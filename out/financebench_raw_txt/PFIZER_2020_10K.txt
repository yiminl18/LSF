BUSINESS 
ABOUT PFIZER
Pfizer Inc. is a research-based, global biopharmaceutical company. We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly
improve their lives through the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing, sales and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide. We work across developed
and emerging markets to advance wellness, prevention, treatments and cures that challenge the most feared diseases of our 
time. We collaborate with healthcare providers,governments and local communities to support and expand access to reliable, affordable healthcare around the world. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the
State of Delaware on June 2, 1942.
Most of our revenues come from the manufacture and sale of our products, principally biopharmaceutical products, and to a lesser extent, 
from alliance agreements, underwhich we co-promote products discovered or developed by other companies or us. We believe that our medicines and vaccines provide significant value for healthcare
providers and patients, through improved treatment of diseases, improvements in health, wellness and productivity as well as by reducing other healthcare costs, such as
emergency room or hospitalization. We seek to enhance the value of our medicines and vaccines and actively engage in dialogues about how we can best work with patients,
physicians and payers to prevent and treat disease and improve outcomes. We seek to maximize patient access and evaluate our pricing arrangements and contracting
methods with payers to minimize adverse impact on our revenues within the current legal and pricing structures.
We are committed to fulfilling our purpose: 
Breakthroughs that change patients’ lives . By doing so, we expect to create value for the  patients we serve and for our colleaguesand shareholders. Pfizer’s growth strategy is driven by five “Bold Moves” that help us deliver breakthroughs for patients and create value for shareholders and other
stakeholders:
1.
Unleash the power of our people; 2.
Deliver first-in-class science; 3.
Transform our go-to-market model; 4.
Win the digital race in pharma; and 5.
Lead the conversation. We are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities by advancing our own product pipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, as well as
through various business development activities. We view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies and seek to generate growth by pursuing
opportunities and transactions that have the potential to strengthen our business and
 our capabilities. We assess our business, assets and scientific capabilities/portfolio aspart of our regular, ongoing portfolio review process and also continue to consider business development activities that will advance our business.
Following (i) the recent spin-off and combination of the Upjohn Business (which was our global, primarily off-patent branded and generics business) with Mylan, which created
a new global pharmaceutical company, Viatris, in November 2020 and (ii) the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019, we saw the culmination of Pfizer’s
transformation into a more focused, innovative science-based biopharmaceutical products business.
Our significant recent business development activities in 2020 include: (i) the April 2020 agreement with BioNTech to develop, manufacture and commercialize an mRNA-
based coronavirus vaccine program, BNT162, aimed at preventing COVID-19, (ii) the June 2020 agreement to co-develop and commercialize Valneva’s Lyme disease vaccine
candidate, VLA15, (iii) the September 2020 entry into a strategic collaboration with CStone to develop and commercialize a PD-L1 antibody, sugemalimab, and to bring
additional oncology assets to China, (iv) the November 2020 spin-off and combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan, and (v) the December 2020 entry into a collaboration
with Myovant to jointly develop and commercialize relugolix in advanced prostate cancer and women’s health in the U.S. and Canada. For a further discussion of our strategy
and our business development initiatives, see the
 Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook section within MD&A and Note 2 . In 2020, our business, operations and financial condition and results were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. To confront the
 public health challenge posed by thepandemic, we have made some important advances, including, among others, the development of a vaccine to help prevent COV
ID-19. For additional information, see theOverview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook—COVID-19 Pandemic 
section within MD&A and the Item 1A. Risk Factors—Development, Regulatory Approval and Marketing of Products
 and —COVID-19 Pandemic  sections in this Form 10-K. COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS
In 2020, we managed our commercial operations through a global structure consisting of two businesses—Biopharma, and, through November 16, 2020, Upjohn, each led by a
single manager.
On November 16, 2020, we completed the spin-off and combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan. Following the combination, we now operate as a 
focused innovativebiopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development, manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide. Beginning in
the fourth quarter of 2020, the financial results of the Upjohn Business are reflected
 as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Prior-period information has beenrestated to reflect our current organizational structure following the separation of the Upjohn Business. In 2019, Consumer Healthcare, which was our OTC medicines
business, was

Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income  section within MD&A. For a discussion of the risks associated with our dependence on certain of our major products, see the 
Item 1A. Risk Factors—Concentration  section in this Form 10-K. COLLABORATION AND CO-PROMOTION
We use collaboration and/or co-promotion arrangements to enhance our development, R&D, sales and distribution of certain biopharmaceutical products, which include,
among others, the following:
•
Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (BNT162b2) is an mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine to help prevent COVID-19 which is being jointly developed and commercialized with BioNTech. Pfizer and BioNTech will equally share the costs of development for the BNT162 program. BNT162b2 has now been granted a CMA,
 EUA or temporaryauthorization in more than 50 countries worldwide. We will also share gross profits equally from commercialization of BNT162b2 and are working jointly with BioNTech in our
respective territories to commercialize the vaccine worldwide (excluding China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan), subject to regulatory authorizations or approvals market by
market. For discussion on BNT162b2, see the 
Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook—COVID-19 Pandemic section within MD&A. •
Eliquis (apixaban) is part of the Novel Oral Anticoagulant market and was jointly developed and commercialized with BMS as an alternative treatment option to warfarin in appropriate patients. We fund between 50% and 60% of all development costs depending on 
the study, and profits and losses are shared equally except in certain countrieswhere we commercialize Eliquis and pay a percentage of net sales to BMS. In certain smaller markets we have full commercialization rights and BMS supplies the product to
us at cost plus a percentage of the net sales 
to end-customers.•
Xtandi (enzalutamide) is an androgen receptor inhibitor that blocks multiple steps in the androgen receptor signaling pathway within tumor cells that is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with Astellas. We share equally in the gross profits and losses related to U.S. net sales and also share equally all Xtandi commercialization
costs attributable to the U.S. market, subject to
 certain exceptions. In addition, we share certain development and other collaboration expenses. For international net saleswe receive royalties based on a tiered percentage.
•
Bavencio (avelumab) is a human anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody that is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with Merck KGaA. We jointly fund the majority of development and commercialization costs and split profits equally related to net sales generated from any products containing avelumab.
•
Orgovyx (relugolix) is an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with advanced prostate cancer that is being developed and commercialized with Myovant. The companies are also collaborating on relugolix combination tablet (relugolix 40 mg, estradiol 1.0 mg,
and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) in women’s health. The companies will equally share profits and allowable expenses in the U.S. and Canada for Orgovyx and the
relugolix combination tablet, with Myovant bearing our share of allowable expenses up to a maximum of $100 million in 2021 and up to a maximum of $50 million in 2022.
Myovant will remain responsible for regulatory interactions and drug supply and continue to lead clinical development for the relugolix combination tablet.
Revenues associated with these arrangements are included in Alliance revenues (except in certain markets where we have direct sales and except for the majority of revenues
for BNT162b2, which are included as direct product revenues). In addition, we have collaboration arrangements for the development and commercialization of certain pipeline
products that are in development stage, including, among others, with Lilly to jointly develop and globally commercialize tanezumab for the treatment of osteoarthritis pain and
cancer pain, under which the companies share equally the ongoing development costs and, if successful, will co-commercialize and share equally in profits and certain
expenses in the U.S., while Pfizer will be responsible for commercialization activities and costs outside the U.S., with Lilly having the right to

receive certain tiered royalties outside the U.S. For further discussion of collaboration and co-promotion agreements, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors—Collaborations and Other Relationships with Third Parties 
section in this Form 10-K and Notes 2  and  17.RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
R&D is at the heart of fulfilling our purpose to deliver breakthroughs that change patients’ lives as we work to translate advanced science and
 technologies into the therapiesthat may be the most impactful for patients. The discovery and development of
 drugs and biological products are time consuming, costly and unpredictable. In addition todiscovering and developing new products, our R&D efforts seek to add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness and ease o
f dosing and by discoveringpotential new indications.
Our R&D Priorities and Strategy. 
Our R&D priorities include: •
delivering a pipeline of highly differentiated medicines and vaccines where we have a unique opportunity to bring the most important new therapies to patients in need;•
advancing our capabilities that can position us for long-term R&D leadership; and•
advancing new models for partnerships with creativity, flexibility and urgency to deliver innovation to patients as quickly as possible.To that end, our R&D primarily focuses on our main therapeutic areas.
While a significant portion of our R&D is internal, we also seek promising chemical and biological lead molecules and innovative technologies developed by others to
incorporate into our discovery and development processes or projects, as well as our product lines. We do so by entering into collaboration, alliance and license agreements
with universities, biotechnology companies and other firms as well as through acquisitions and investments. We also have arrangements with third parties that fund a portion of
the development costs of one or more of our pipeline products in exchange for rights to receive future payments,
 such as milestone-based, revenue sharing, or profit-sharingpayments or royalties. These collaboration, alliance, license and funding agreements and investments allow us to share knowledge, risk and cost. They also enable us to
access external scientific and technological expertise, as well as provide us the opportunity to advance our own products and in-licensed or acquired products. For information
on certain of these collaborations, alliances, license and funding arrangements and investments, see 
Note 2 . Our R&D Operations. 
In 2020, we continued to strengthen our global R&D operations and pursue strategies to improve R&D productivity to achieve a sus tainable pipeline thatis positioned to deliver value in the near term and over time
.  Our R&D activity is conducted through various platform functions that operate in parallel within our globaloperations, including the following:
•
WRDM. Research units are generally responsible for research and early-stage development assets for our business (assets that have not yet achieved proof-of-concept) and are organized by therapeutic area to enhance flexibility, cohesiveness and focus. We can rapidly redeploy resources within a research unit and between various projects
to leverage, as necessary, common skills, expertise or focus.
•
GPD. GPD is a unified center for clinical development and regulatory activities that is generally responsible for the clinical development strategy and operational execution of clinical trials for both early-stage assets in the WRDM portfolio as well as late-stage assets in our portfolio.
•
Science-based platform-services organizations. These organizations provide technical expertise and other services to various R&D projects, and are organized into science-based functions (which are part of our WRDM organization) such as Pharmaceutical Sciences and Medicine Design. These organizations allow us to react more
quickly and effectively to evolving needs by sharing resources among projects, candidates and targets across therapeutic areas and phases of development.
 Anotherplatform-service organization is the Worldwide Medical and Safety (WMS) group, which includes worldwide safety surveillance, medical information and the Chief Medical
Office. The WMS group provides patients, healthcare providers, pharmacists, payers and health authorities with complete and up-to-date information about the
 risks andbenefits associated with Pfizer’s R&D programs and marketed products so they can make appropriate decisions on how and when to use our products.
We manage R&D operations on a total-company basis through our platform functions described above. Specifically, the Portfolio Strategy 
& Investment committee, comprisedof senior executives, is accountable for aligning resources among all of our WRDM, GPD and R&D projects and for seeking to ensure optimal capital allocation across the
innovative R&D portfolio. We believe that this approach also serves to maximize accountability and flexibility.
We do not disaggregate total R&D expense by development phase or by therapeutic area since, as described above,
 we do not manage our R&D operations by developmentphase or by therapeutic area. Further, as we are able to adjust a significant portion of our spending quickly, we believe that
 any prior-period information about R&D expense bydevelopment phase or by therapeutic area would not necessarily be representative of future spending.
In 2020, the R&D organization within Upjohn supported the off-patent branded and generic established medicines and managed its resources separately from the WRDM and
GPD organizations. Following the spin-off and combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan to create Viatris, we have agreed to provide certain transition services to Viatris
including support for R&D, pharmacovigilance and safety surveillance.

Our R&D Pipeline. The process of drug and biological product discovery from initiation through development and to potential regulatory approval is lengthy and can take more than ten years. As of February 2, 2021, we had 
the following number of projects in various stages of R&D:
Development of a single compound is often pursued as part of multiple programs. While our drug candidates may or may not receive regulatory approval, new candidates
entering clinical development phases are the foundation for future products. Information concerning several of our drug candidates in development, as well as supplemental
filings for existing products, is set forth in the 
Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income—Product Developments  section within MD&A. For information on the risks associated with R&D, see the 
Item 1A. Risk Factors—Research and Development  section of this Form 10-K. INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
Our operations are conducted globally, and we sell our products in over 125 countries. Emerging markets are an important component of our strategy for global leadership, and
our commercial structure recognizes that the demographics and rising economic power of the fastest-growing emerging markets are becoming more closely aligned with the
profile found within developed markets. Urbanization and the rise of the middle class in emerging markets provide potential growth opportunities for our products.
Revenues from operations outside the U.S. of $20.2 billion accounted for 48% of our 
total revenues in 2020. Revenues exceeded $500 million in each of 8, 10 and 10 countriesoutside the U.S. in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. By
 total revenues, China and Japan are our two largest national markets outside the U.S. For a geographic breakdownof revenues, see the 
Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income — Revenues by Geography section within MD&A and the table captioned Geographic Information  in Note 17A
. 
Our international operations are subject to risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries. For additional information, see the 
Item 1A. Risk Factors — GlobalOperations 
and Item 1. Business— Government Regulation and Price Constraints sections in this Form 10-K. SALES AND MARKETING
Our prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers, but we also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and pharmacies. In
the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines products directly to the federal government, CDC, wholesalers, individual provider offices, retail pharmacies and integrated delivery
networks. Outside the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines to government and non-government institutions. A portion of our government contracts are subject
 to renegotiation ortermination of contracts or subcontracts at the discretion of a government entity.
 We seek to gain access for our products on healthcare authority and PBM formularies, whichare lists of approved medicines available to members of the PBMs. PBMs use various benefit designs, such as tiered co-pays for 
formulary products, to drive utilization ofproducts in preferred formulary positions. We may also work with payers on disease management programs that help to develop tools and materials to educate patients and
physicians on key disease areas. For information on our largest biopharmaceutical wholesalers, see 
Note 17B . Pfizer Inc.
2020 Form 10-K 4 
We promote our products to healthcare providers and patients. Through our marketing organizations, we explain the approved uses, benefits and risks of our products tohealthcare providers; MCOs that provide insurance coverage, such as hospitals, Integrated Delivery Systems, PBMs and health plans; and employers and government
agencies who hire MCOs to provide health benefits to their employees. We also market directly to consumers in the U.S. through direct-to-consumer advertising that seeks to
communicate the approved uses, benefits and risks of our products while motivating people to have meaningful conversations with their doctors. In addition, we sponsor
general advertising to educate the public on disease awareness, prevention and wellness, important public health issues and our patient assistance programs.
PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
Patents
. We own or license a number of patents covering pharmaceutical and other products, their uses, formulations, and product manufacturing processes. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent
 filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patentprotection is obtained. The scope of protection afforded by a paten
t can vary from country to country and depends on the patent type, the scope of its patent claims and theavailability of legal remedies. Patent term extensions (PTE) may be available in some countries to compensate for a loss of patent term due 
to delay in a product’s approvaldue to the regulatory requirements. One of the primary considerations in limiting our operations in some countries outside the U.S. is the lack of ef
fective intellectual propertyprotection for our products, although international and U.S. free trade agreements have included some improved global protection of intellectual property rights. For additional
information, see the 
Item 1. Business — Government Regulation and Price Constraints section in this Form 10-K. In various markets, a period of regulatory exclusivity may be provided for drugs upon approval. The scope and term of such exclusivity will vary but, in general, the period will
run concurrently with the term of any existing patent rights associated with the drug at the
 time of approval.Based on current sales, and considering the competition with products sold by our competitors, the patent rights we consider most significant in relation to
 our business as awhole, together with the year in which the basic product patent expires, are as follows:

ajor European markets (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the U.K.). Noted in parentheses is the projected year of expiry of the earliest pending patent term extension in the U.S. orJapan and/or SPC applicatio
n in Europe, the term of which, if granted, may be shorter than originally requested due to a number of factors. In some instances, there are later-expiring patents relating to ourproducts which may or may not prot
ect our drug from generic or biosimilar competition after the expiration of the basic patent.The basic product patent for Ch
antix in the U.S. expired in November 2020.Xeljanz Europe expiry is provide
d by regulatory exclusivity.The Europe patent that covers t
he combination of the 13 serotype conjugates of Prevenar 13 was revoked following an opposition and has now been withdrawn. There are other Europe patents and pendingapplications covering the form
ulation, various aspects of the manufacturing process, and the combination of serotype conjugates of Prevenar 13 that remain in force.Eliquis was developed and is 
being commercialized in collaboration with BMS. For Eliquis in the U.S., two patents listed in the FDA Orange Book, the composition of matter patent claiming apixaban specificallyand a formulation patent, 
were challenged by numerous generic companies and are the subject of patent infringement litigation. Prior to the August 2020 ruling referenced in the following sentence, we and BMSsettled with a number of these 
generic companies (settled generic companies) while continuing to litigate against three remaining generic companies (remaining generic companies). In August 2020, the U.S.District Court for the District of Delaware decid
ed that the two challenged Eliquis patents are both valid and infringed by the remaining generic companies. The remaining generic companies have appealed theDelaware court decision and t
he final decision in this case could determine when generic versions of Eliquis will come on the market.While we cannot predict the outc
ome of this pending litigation, these are the alternatives that might occur: (a) If the district court’s decision is upheld in the current appeal with respect to both patents, under theterms of previously executed settlem
ent agreements with the settled generic companies, the permitted date of launch for the settled generic companies under these patents is April 1, 2028; (b) if the formulationpatent is held invalid or not i
nfringed in the current appeal, the settled generic companies and the remaining generic companies would be permitted to launch on November 21, 2026; or (c) if both patents areheld invalid or not inf
ringed in the current appeal, the settled generic companies and the remaining generic companies could launch products immediately upon such an adverse decision.In addition, both patents 
may be subject to subsequent challenges by parties other than the remaining generic companies. If this were to occur, depending on the outcome of the subsequent challenge, thepotential launch by gen
eric companies, including challengers, if successful, could occur on timelines similar to those discussed above.(1) (1) (1) (2)

od of use patent.Bavencio is being develop
ed and commercialized in collaboration with Merck KGaA.The loss, expiration or invalidation of intellectual property rights, patent litigation settlements with manufacturers and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights can
have a significant adverse effect on our revenues. Once patent protec
tion has expired or has been lost prior to the expiration date as a result of a legal challenge, we typicallylose exclusivity on these products, and generic and biosimilar pharmaceutical manufacturers generally produce identical or highly similar products and sell them for a lower
price. The date at which generic or biosimilar competition commences may be different from the date that the patent or regulatory exclusivity expires. However, when generic
or biosimilar competition does commence, the resulting price competition can substantially decrease our revenues for the impacted products, often in a very short period of
time. Also, if one of our product-related patents is found to be
 invalid by judicial, court or regulatory or administrative proceedings, generic or biosimilar products could beintroduced, resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products.
We continue to vigorously defend our patent rights against infringement, and we will continue to support efforts 
that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights whiletaking necessary steps to help ensure appropriate patient access. For additional information, see the 
Item 1A. Risk Factors — Intellectual Property Protection, — Third PartyIntellectual Property Claims 
and — Competitive Products  sections in this Form 10-K and Note 16A1 . Losses of Product Exclusivity. 
Certain of our products have experienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years, and we expect certain products to face significantly increased generic competition over the next few years. The basic product paten
t for Chantix in the U.S. expired on November10, 2020. Also, the basic product patent for 
Sutent in the U.S. will expire in August 2021. For additional information on the impact of LOEs on our revenues, see the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income––Revenues––Selected Product Discussion 
section within MD&A. Trademarks
. Our products are sold under brand-name and logo trademarks and trade dress. Registrations generally are for fixed, but renewable, terms and protection is provided in some countries for as long as the mark is used while in others, for as long as it is registered. Protecting our trademarks is of material importance to Pfizer.
COMPETITION
Our business is conducted in intensely competitive and often highly regulated markets. Many of our products face competition in the
 form of branded or generic drugs orbiosimilars that treat similar diseases or indications. The principal forms of competition include efficacy, safety, ease of use and cost. Though the means o
f competition varyamong our products, demonstrating the value of our products is a critical factor for success.
We compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat diseases or indications similar to those treated by
 our major products. These competitorsinclude other worldwide research-based biopharmaceutical companies, smaller resea
rch companies with more limited therapeutic focus and generic and biosimilar drugmanufacturers. Our competitors also may devote substantial funds and resources to R&D and their successful R&D could result in erosion of the
 sales of our existing productsand potential sales of products in development, as well as unanticipated product obsolescence. In addition, several of our competitors operate
 without large R&D expenses andmake a regular practice of challenging our product patents before their expiration.
To address competitive trends we continually emphasize innovation, which is underscored by our multi-billion-dollar investment in R&D, as well as our business development
transactions, both designed to result in a strong product pipeline. Our investment in research continues even after drug approval as we seek
 to further demonstrate the value ofour products for the conditions they treat, as well as potential new applications. We educate pa
tients, physicians, payers and global health authorities on the benefits and risksof our medicines, and seek to continually enhance the organizational effectiveness of our biopharmaceutical functions, including to accurately and ethically launch and market
our products to our customers.
Operating conditions have also shifted as a result of increased global competitive pressures, industry regulation and cost containment. We continue to
 evaluate, adapt andimprove our organization and business practices in an effort to better meet customer and public needs. We believe that we have 
taken an industry-leading role in evolving ourapproaches to U.S. direct-to-consumer advertising, interactions with, and payments to, healthcare professionals and medical education grants. We also continue to sponsor
programs to address patient affordability and access barriers, as we strive to advance fundamental health system change through our support for be
tter healthcare solutions.Our vaccines may face competition from the introduction of alternative vaccines or “next-generation” vaccines prior to or after the expiration of their patents,
 which mayadversely affect our future results.
Our biosimilars compete with branded products from competitors, as well as other generics and biosimilars manufacturers. We sell biosimilars of certain inflammation &
immunology and oncology biologic medicines. We seek to maximize the opportunity to establish a “first-to-market” or early market position for our biosimilars to provide
customers a lower-cost alternative immediately when available and also to potentially provide us with higher levels of sales and profitability until other competitors enter the
market.

Generic Products. Generic pharmaceutical manufacturers pose one of the biggest competitive challenges to our branded small molecule products because they can market acompeting version of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent and often
 charge much less. Several competitors regularly challenge our product patents before theirexpiration. Generic competitors often operate without large R&D expenses, as well as without costs of conveying medical information about products to 
the medical community.In addition, the FDA approval process exempts generics from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy, allowing generic manufacturers
to rely on the safety and efficacy data of
 the innovator product. In China, for example, we are expected to face further intensified competition by certain generic manufacturersin 2021 and beyond, which may result in price cuts and volume loss of some of our products. In addition, generic versions of competitors’ branded products may also compete
with our products.
MCOs that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics over brand-name drugs. Many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives
to brand-name drugs in their healthcare programs, including Medicaid in the U.S., and U.S. laws generally allow, and in some cases require, pharmacists to substitute generic
drugs for brand-name drugs. In a small subset of states, prescribing physicians are able to expressly prevent such substitution.
Biosimilars. 
Certain of our biologic products, including Enbrel (we market Enbrel outside the U.S. and Canada), already face, or may face in the future,  competition frombiosimilars (also referred to as follow-on biologics). Biosimilars are vers
ions of biologic medicines that have been developed and proven to be highly similar to the originalbiologic in terms of safety and efficacy and that have no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity or potency
. Biosimilars have the potential to offer high-quality, lower-cost alternatives to innovative biologic medicines. In the U.S., biosimilars referencing innovative biologic products are approved under the U.S. Public Health Service Act.
PRICING PRESSURES AND MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS
Pricing Pressures. 
Pricing and access pressures in the commercial sector continue to be significant. Overall, there is increasing pressure on U.S. providers to deliver healthcare at a lower cost and to ensure that those expenditures deliver demonstrated value in terms of health ou
tcomes. Many employers have adopted high deductible healthplans, which can increase out-of-pocket costs for medicines. This trend is likely to continue. Private third-party payers, such as health plans, increasingly challenge
pharmaceutical product pricing, which could result in lower prices, lower reimbursement rates and a reduction in demand for our products. Pricing pressures also may occur as
a result of highly competitive insurance markets. Healthcare provider purchasers, directly or through group purchasing organizations, are seeking enhanced discounts or
implementing more rigorous bidding or purchasing review processes.
Longer term, we foresee a shift in focus away from fee-for-service payments towards outcomes-based payments and risk-sharing arrangements that reward providers for cost
reductions and improved patient outcomes. These new payment models can, at times, lead to lower prices for, and restricted access to
, new medicines. At the same time,these models can also promote utilization of drugs by encouraging physicians to screen and diagnose and consider drugs as a means of forestalling more costly medical
interventions.
We believe medicines are the most efficient and effective use of healthcare dollars based on the value they
 deliver to the overall healthcare system. We work with law makersand advocate for solutions that effectively improve patient health outcomes, lower costs to
 the healthcare system, and help ensure access to medicines within an efficient andaffordable healthcare system. In addition, in response to the evolving U.S. and global healthcare spending landscape, we work with health au
thorities, health technologyassessment and quality measurement bodies and major U.S. payers throughout the product-development process to better understand how these en
tities value ourcompounds and products. Further, we seek to develop stronger internal capabilities focused on demonstrating the value of the medicines that
 we discover or develop, registerand manufacture, by recognizing patterns of usage of our medicines and competitor medicines along with patterns of healthcare costs.
For information on government pricing pressures, see the 
Item 1. Business — Government Regulation and Price Constraints and Item 1A. Risk Factors — Pricing andReimbursement 
sections in this Form 10-K. Managed Care Organizations. 
The evolution of managed care in the U.S. has been a major factor in the competitiveness o f the healthcare marketplace. Approximately 299million people in the U.S. now have some form of health insurance coverage, and the marketing of prescription drugs to both consumers and the en
tities that manage coveragein the U.S. continues to grow in importance. In particular, the influence of MCOs has increased in recent years due
 to the growing number of patients receiving coveragethrough MCOs. At the same time, consolidation in the MCO industry has resulted in fewer, even larger entities, which enhances MCOs’ ability to negotiate
 pricing andincreases their importance to our business. Since MCOs seek to contain and reduce healthcare expenditures, their growing influence has increased pressure on drug prices as
well as revenues.
MCOs typically negotiate prices with pharmaceutical providers by using formularies (which are lists of approved medicines available to MCO members), clinica
l protocols(which require prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or require the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting
access to a branded medicine), volume purchasing, long-term contracts and their ability to influence volume and market share of prescription drugs. In addition, by placing
branded medicines on higher-tier or non-preferred status in their formularies, MCOs transfer a portion of the cost to the patient, resulting in significant patient out-of-pocket
expenses. This financial disincentive is a tool for MCOs to manage drug costs and channel patients to medicines preferred by the MCOs. The
 ACA has accelerated paymentreform by distributing risk across MCOs and other stakeholders in care delivery with the intent of improving quality while reducing costs, which creates pressure on MCOs to tie
reimbursement to defined outcomes. We are closely monitoring these newer approaches and developing appropriate strategies to respond to them.
The breadth of the products covered by formularies can vary considerably from one MCO to another, and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for
treatment of particular medical problems. MCOs also emphasize primary and preventive care, out-patient treatment and procedures performed at doctors’ offices and clinics as
ways to manage costs. Hospitalization and surgery, typically the most expensive forms of treatment, are carefully managed, and drugs tha
t can reduce the need forhospitalization, professional therapy or surgery may become favored first-line treatments for certain diseases.
Pfizer Inc.
2020 Form 10-K 7 
Exclusion of a product from a formulary or other MCO-implemented restrictions can significantly impact drug usage in the MCO patient population and beyond. Consequently,pharmaceutical companies compete to gain access to formularies for their products, typically on the basis of unique product features, such as greater e
fficacy, better patientease of use, or fewer side effects, as well as the overall cost of
 the therapy. We have been generally, although not universally, successful in having our major products includedon MCO formularies. However, increasingly our branded products are being placed on the higher tiers or in a non-preferred status. For additional information, see the 
Item 1A. Risk Factors
— Managed Care Trends section in this Form 10-K. RAW MATERIALS
We procure raw materials essential to our business from numerous suppliers worldwide. In general, these materials have been available in sufficient quantities to support our
demand and in many cases are available from multiple suppliers. We have supplier management activities in place to monitor supply channels and to take action as needed to
secure necessary volumes. No significant impact to our operations due to the availability of raw materials is currently anticipated in 2021.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS
We are subject to extensive regulation by government authorities in the countries in which we do business. This includes laws and regulations governing pharmaceutical
companies, such as the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products, pricing (including discounts and rebates) and health information privacy, among others. These
laws and regulations may require administrative guidance for implementation, and a failure to comply could subject us to legal and administrative actions. Enforcement
measures may include substantial fines and/or penalties, orders to stop non-compliant activities, criminal charges, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, delays in product
approvals, exclusion from participation in government programs or contracts as well as limitations on conducting business in applicable jurisdictions, and could result in harm to
our reputation and business. For additional information, see 
Note 16A. Compliance with these laws and regulations may be costly, and may require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance. While capital expenditures or operating costs for compliance with government regulations cannot be predicted with
certainty, we do not currently anticipate they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position.
In the United States
Drug and Biologic Regulation
. The FDA, pursuant to the FFDCA, the Public Health Service Act and other federal statutes and regulations, extensively regulates pre- and post-marketing activities related to our biopharmaceutical products. The regulations govern areas such as the safety and efficacy of medicines, clinical trials, advertising and
promotion, quality control, manufacturing, labeling, distribution, post-marketing safety surveillance and reporting, and record keeping. Other U.S. federal agencies, including the
DEA, also regulate certain of our products and activities. Many of our activities are subject to 
the jurisdiction of the SEC.For a biopharmaceutical company to market a drug or a biologic product in the U.S., the FDA must evaluate whether the
 product is safe and effective for its intended use. If theFDA determines that the drug or biologic is safe and effective, the FDA will approve the product’s NDA or Biologics License Application (BLA) (or supplemental NDA or
supplemental BLA), as appropriate.
A drug or biologic may be subject to postmarketing commitments, which are studies or clinical trials that the product sponsor agrees to conduct, or postmarketing requirements,
which are studies or clinical trials that are required as a condition of approval. Once a drug or biologic is approved, the FDA must be notified of any product modifications and
may require additional studies or clinical trials. In addition, we are also required to report adverse events and comply with cGMPs (the FDA regulations that govern all aspects
of manufacturing quality for pharmaceuticals), as well as advertising and promotion regulations. For additional information, see the 
Item 1A. Risk Factors — Development,Regulatory Approval and Marketing of Products 
and  —Post-Approval Data section in this Form 10-K. In the context of public health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic, we may apply for EUA with the
 FDA, which when granted, allows for the distribution and use of ourproducts during the term declared and extended by the government, in accordance with the conditions set forth
 in the EUA, unless the EUA is otherwise terminated at thegovernment’s discretion. Although the criteria of an EUA differ from the criteria for approval of an NDA or BLA,
 EUAs nevertheless require the development and submission ofdata to satisfy the relevant FDA standards, and a number of
 ongoing compliance obligations. The FDA expects EUA holders to work toward submission of full applications,such as a BLA, as soon as possible. For BNT162b2, we are working towards submitting a BLA
 for possible full regulatory approval.Biosimilar Regulation.
 The FDA is responsible for approval of biosimilars. Innovator biologics are entitled to 12 years of market exclusivity by statute, and biosimilars applications may not be submitted until four years after the approval of the reference innovator biologic.
Sales and Marketing Regulations
.  Our marketing practices are subject to state laws as well as federal laws, such as the Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, intendedto prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. The Anti-Kickback Sta
tute generally prohibits soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying anything of value to generatebusiness. The False Claims Act generally prohibits anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, any claims for payment for goods or services to
third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) that are false or fraudulent and generally treat claims generated through kickbacks as false or fraudulent. The federal
government and states also regulate sales and marketing activities and financial interactions between manufacturers and healthcare providers, requiring disclosure to
government authorities and the public of such interactions, and the adoption of compliance standards or programs. State
 attorneys general have also taken action to regulatethe marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws.
Healthcare Reform
.  Any significant efforts at the federal or state levels to reform the healthcare system by changing the way healthcare is provided or funded could have amaterial impact on us. This includes potential replacements for the ACA, if it is ultimately invalidated by the U.S. Supreme Court in 
California v. Texas , as well as efforts at the state level to develop additional public insurance options or implement a single payer healthcare system. We do not expect that invalidation of the 
ACA itself would have amaterial impact on our business given the modest revenues the health insurance exchanges and Medicaid expansion generate for us. However, a future replacement of the
ACA or other healthcare reform efforts may adversely affect our business and financial results, particularly if such replacement or reform reduces incentives for employer-
sponsored insurance coverage or dramatically increases industry taxes and fees.

Pricing and Reimbursement.  Pricing and reimbursement for our products depend in part on government regulation. In order to have our products covered by Medicaid, we mustoffer discounts or rebates on purchases of pharmaceutical products under various federal and state programs. We also must report specific prices to government agencies.
The calculations necessary to determine the prices reported are complex and the failure to do so accurately may expose us to enforcement measures. See
 the discussionregarding rebates in the 
Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income — Revenues by Geography section within MD&A and Note 1G. Government and private payers routinely seek to manage utilization and control the costs of our products, and 
there is considerable public and government scrutiny ofpharmaceutical pricing. Efforts by states and the federal government to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including proposed actions to facilitate drug
importation, limit reimbursement to lower international reference prices, require deep discounts, and require manufacturers to report and make public price increases and
sometimes a written justification for the increase, could adversely affect our business if implemented. In the Fall of 2020, 
the Trump Administration finalized an importationpathway from Canada and a payment model to tie Medicare Part B physician reimbursement to international prices, though ultimate implementation of both is uncertain due to
legal challenges. We expect to see continued focus on regulating pricing resulting in additional legislation and regulation under the newly elected Congress and the Biden
Administration. In addition, U.S. government action to reduce federal spending on entitlement programs including Medicare and Medicaid may affect payment for our products
or services associated with the provision of our products. For additional information, see the 
Item 1A. Risk Factors — Pricing and Reimbursement section in this Form 10-K. A majority of states use preferred drug lists to manage access to pharmaceutical products under Medicaid, including some of our products. For example, access to our
products under the Medicaid and Medicare managed care programs typically is determined by the health plans with which state Medicaid agencies and Medicare contract to
provide services to beneficiaries. States seek to control healthcare costs related to Medicaid and other state healthcare programs, including the implementation of
supplemental rebate agreements under the Medicaid drug rebate program tied to patient outcomes. In addition, we expect that
 consolidation and integration among pharmacychains, wholesalers and PBMs will increase pricing pressures in the industry. For additional information, see the 
Item 1A. Risk Factors — Managed Care Trends section in this Form 10-K.
Anti-Corruption. 
The FCPA prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare
professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations.
Data Privacy. 
The collection and use of personal data by us as part of our business activities is subject to  various federal and state privacy and data security laws andregulations, including oversight by various regulatory or other governmental bodies. Such laws and regulations have the potential to affect our business materially, continue to
evolve and are increasingly being enforced vigorously.
Outside the United States
We encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most countries outside the U.S.
New Drug Approvals.
 In the EU, the EMA conducts the scientific evaluation, supervision and safety monitoring of our innovative medicinal products, and employs a centralizedprocedure for approval for the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA) countries. From January 1, 2021,
 as a consequence of the U.K. leaving the EU (Brexit), theMedicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency is the sole regulatory authority for the U.K. In China, following significant regulatory reforms in recent years, the NMPA
is the primary regulatory authority for approving and supervising medicines. In Japan, the PMDA is involved in a wide range of regulatory activities, including clinical studies,
approvals, post-marketing reviews and pharmaceutical safety. Health authorities in many middle- and lower-income require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory
authority (i.e., the FDA or EMA) before they begin to conduct
 their application review process and/or issue their final approval.Pharmacovigilance.
 In the EU/EEA, the EMA’s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations on product safetyissues. Outside developed markets, pharmacovigilance requirements vary and are generally not as extensive, but there is a trend toward increasing regulation.
Pricing and Reimbursement
. Certain governments, including in the different EU member states, the U.K., China, Japan, Canada and South Korea, provide healthcare at low-to-zero direct cost to consumers at the point of care and have significant power to regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for 
thegovernment-sponsored healthcare system, particularly under recent global financing pressures. Governments may use a variety of measures including proposing price reform
or legislation, cross country collaboration and procurement, price cuts, mandatory rebates, health technology assessments, forced localization as a condition of market access,
“international reference pricing” (i.e., the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries), QCE processes and VBP.
 In addition, theinternational patchwork of price regulation, differing economic conditions and incomplete value assessments across countries has led to varying access to quality medicines in
many markets and some third-party trade in our products between countries. Several important multilateral organizations, such as the World Health Organization and the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are increasing scrutiny of international pharmaceutical pricing through issuing reports and policy recommendations.
On November 25, 2020, the European Commission published its new Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe which envisions a broad range of new initiatives and legislation
including a significant focus on affordability and access to medicines.
In China, pricing pressures have increased in recent years, with government officials emphasizing improved health outcomes, healthcare reform and decreased drug prices as
key indicators of progress towards reform. Drug prices have decreased dramatically as a result of adding innovative drugs (including oncology medicines) to the National
Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL). In the off-patent space, numerous local generics have been officially deemed bioequivalent under a QCE process that required
domestically-manufactured generic drugs to pass a test to assess their bioequivalence to a qualified reference drug (typically the originator drug). A centralized VBP program
has also been initiated and expanded nationwide, under which a tender process has been established where a certain portion of included molecule volumes are guaranteed to
tender winners. The program is intended to contain healthcare costs by driving utilization of generics that have passed QCE, which has resulted in dramatic price cuts for o
ff-patent medicines. Furthermore, the Chinese government has discussed moving toward efforts to unify the reimbursement price between QCE-approved generic medicines and
the applicable original medicines, which the government currently plans to
Pfizer Inc.
2020 Form 10-K 9 
implement within the next few years. We and most off-patent originators have mostly not been successful in the VBP bidding process. The government has indicated thatadditional post-LOE drugs could be subjected to QCE qualification in future rounds, which could also be tied to volume-based procurement. While certain details of fu
ture QCEexpansion have been made available, we are unable to determine the impact on our business and financial condition until the initiation of these future rounds.
Healthcare Provider Transparency and Disclosures.
 Several countries have implemented laws requiring (or their industry associations have recommended) disclosure oftransfers of value made by pharmaceutical companies to healthcare providers.
Intellectual Property
.  Reliable patent protection and enforcement around the world are among the key factors we consider for continued business and R&D investment. TheWorld Trade Organization Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (WTO-TRIPS) requires participant countries to provide patent protection for
pharmaceutical products by law, with an exemption provided for least-developed countries until 2033. While some countries have made improvements, we still face patent
grant, enforcement and other intellectual property challenges in many countries.
While the global intellectual property environment has generally improved following WTO-TRIPS and bilateral/multilateral trade agreements, our growth and ability to bring new
product innovation to patients depends on further progress in intellectual property protection. In certain developed international markets, governments maintain relatively
effective intellectual property policies. However, in the EU, following a review of pharmaceutical intellectual property and regulatory incentives, legislative change may result in
the reduction of certain protections. In several emerging market countries, governments have used intellectual property policies as a tool to force innovators to accep
t less thanfair value for medicines, as well as to advance industrial policy and localization goals.
Considerable political and economic pressure has weakened current intellectual property protection in some countries and has led to policies such as more restrictive
standards for obtaining patents and more difficult procedures for patenting biopharmaceutical inventions, restrictions on patenting certain types of inventions, revocation of
patents, laws or regulations that promote or provide broad discretion to issue a compulsory license, weak intellectual property enforcement and failure to implement effective
regulatory data protection.
Our industry advocacy efforts focus on seeking a fair and transparent business environment for foreign manufacturers, underscoring the importance of s
trong intellectualproperty systems for local innovative industries and helping improve patients’ access to innovative medicines.
Data Privacy. 
Outside of the U.S., many countries have privacy and data security laws and regulations concerning the collection and use  of personal data, including the EU’sGeneral Data Protection Regulations. The legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving as countries continue to
adopt privacy and data security laws.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Our operations are affected by national, state and/or local environmental laws. We have made, and intend 
to continue to make, the expenditures necessary for compliance withapplicable laws. We also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites. We incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2020 for
environmental compliance purposes and for the clean-up of certain past industrial activity as follows: $42 million in environment-related capital expenditures and $120 million in
other environment-related expenses.
While capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not currently anticipate they will have a material effect on
our capital expenditures or competitive position. See also 
Note 16A3 . Climate change presents risks to our operations, including the potential for additional regulatory requirements and associated costs, and the potential for more frequent and
severe weather events and water availability challenges that may impact our facilities and those of our suppliers. We cannot provide assurance that physical risks to our
facilities or supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future. We periodically review our vulnerability to potential weather-related risks and other natural disasters
and update our assessments accordingly. Based on our reviews, we do not believe these potential risks are material to our operations at this time.
HUMAN CAPITAL
Our purpose is clear: 
Breakthroughs that change patients’ lives . These breakthroughs are delivered through the relentless collaboration of our talented workforce. As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 78,500 people worldwide, with approximately 29,400 based in the U.S. Women compose approximately 48% of our
workforce, and approximately 32% of our U.S.-based employees are individuals with ethnically diverse backgrounds.
Our continued success links directly to the commitment, engagement and performance of our employees. It is important that
 we not only attract and retain the best andbrightest diverse talent but also ensure they remain engaged and can thrive in an environment that is committed to helping them grow, succeed and
 contribute directly toachieving our purpose. As part of these efforts, we strive for an inclusive and empowering work environment, adopting practices to simplify processes and remove needless
complexity, rewarding both performance and leadership skills, and offering competitive compensation and benefits programs that encourage healthy work-life balance, so that
all colleagues feel ready, equipped and energized to deliver innovative breakthroughs that extend and significantly improve patients’ lives.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.
 At Pfizer, every person deserves to be seen, heard and cared for, and we work to further this goal by bringing together people with differentbackgrounds, perspectives and experiences. Our new and expanded commitments to equity include specific actions to help foster a more inclusive environment within Pfizer,
including, among others: (i) increasing the representation of both women and underrepresented ethnic groups; (ii) providing resources 
to support managers in having courageous conversations about equity, race and the avoidance of bias within their teams; (iii) 
revising our Political Action Committee (PAC) bylaws to help ensure that PAC recipients consistently 
demonstrate  conduct that align with our core values; and (iv) working to help ensure recruitment demographics of all clinical trials correlate to those of the countries where trials are taking place.
Colleague Engagement
. We understand the importance of continuously listening and responding to colleague feedback. Our annual engagement survey, Pfizer Pulse, providesa forum for our colleagues to give structured feedback about their Pfizer experience and equips leaders with
Pfizer Inc.
2020 Form 10-K 10 
actionable insights for discussion and follow up. Regular topics in the survey include (i) employee engagement, such as colleagues’ commitment to and advocacy for Pfizer,and (ii) purpose, including how colleagues’ work connects with our purpose. Through these surveys, we can measure and track the degree to which colleagues are proud to
work at Pfizer, would recommend Pfizer as a great place to work to others and intend to stay
 with Pfizer.Performance, Leadership and Growth.
 We are committed to helping our colleagues reach their full potential by rewarding both their performance and leadership skills and byproviding opportunities for growth and development. Our performance management approach—called 
Performance and Leadership Insights —is based on six-month semesters during which our colleagues and their managers set goals, receive feedback and meet to discuss performance. These conversations are meant to help colleagues grow and
develop by evaluating 
performance  (what the colleague achieved, measured by outcomes), leadership  (how they achieved it, taking into account Pfizer’s values of courage,excellence, equity and joy), and identifying areas of 
growth  that help move colleagues towards fulfilling their career goals and their potential. We strive to ensure that all colleagues have an equal opportunity to grow and offer a variety of programs including mentoring, job rotations, experiential project roles, skill based volunteering and learning
programs focused on many topics, including leadership and management skills and industry- and job-specific learning, as well as general business, manufacturing, finance and
technology skills.
Health, Safety and Well-Being.
 We are committed to the health, safety and well-being of our colleagues and continue to advance a comprehensive occupational injury andillness prevention program.
During 2020, our COVID-19 pandemic preparedness and response was a primary focus. Our comprehensive pandemic response plan incorporates guidance issued by
external health authorities and is designed to keep onsite workers at our manufacturing and research sites safe and healthy. A
 global employee assistance program providesstress management, mental health, emotional, resiliency and pandemic guidance and support to our colleagues.
Pay Equity.
 We are committed to pay equity, based on gender or race/ethnicity, and we conduct  and report publicly on pay equity on an annual basis.Additional information regarding our human capital programs and initiatives is available in the “Careers” section of Pfizer’s website.

ture Results section in this Form 10-K.Pfizer Inc.
2020 Form 10-K 11 
RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS, INDUSTRY AND OPERATIONS:MANAGED CARE TRENDS
Private payers, such as health plans, and other managed care entities, such as P
BMs, continue to take action to manage the utilization and costs of drugs. Negotiating powerof MCOs and other private third-party payers has increased due to consolidation, and they, along with governments, increasingly employ formularies to control costs and
encourage utilization of certain drugs, including through the use of formulary inclusion or favorable formulary placement. These initiatives have increased consumers’ interest
and input in medication choices, as they pay for a larger portion of their prescription costs and may cause them to 
favor lower-cost generic alternatives. We may fail to obtain ormaintain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement of our products, or fail to obtain such formulary placement at favorable pricing.
The growing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceutical medicines that treat rare or life-threatening conditions, which typically have smaller patient populations,
combined with their relative higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products, also has generated increased payer interest in developing cost-containment
strategies targeted to this sector.
Third-party payers also use additional measures such as new-to-market blocks, exclusion lists, indication-based pricing, and value-based pricing/contracting to improve their
cost containment efforts, and are also increasingly imposing utilization management tools, such as clinical protocols, requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a
generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine. As the U.S. private 
third-partypayer market consolidates further and as more drugs become available in generic form, we may face greater pricing pressure from private third-party payers as they continue
to drive more of their patients to use lower cost generic alternatives.
Business arrangements in this area are subject to a high degree of government scrutiny, and available safe harbors under applicable federal and state fraud and abuse laws
are subject to change through legislative and regulatory action, as well as evolving judicial interpretations. Our approach to these arrangements may also be informed by such
government and industry guidance.
COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS
Competitive product launches may erode future sales of our products, including our existing products and those currently under development, or result in unanticipated product
obsolescence. Such launches have recently occurred, and potentially competitive products are in various stages of development. We cannot predict with accuracy 
the timing orimpact of the introduction of competitive products that treat diseases and conditions like those
 treated by our in-line drugs and drug candidates.In addition, competition from manufacturers of generic drugs, including from generic versions of competitors’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity, is a major
challenge for our branded products. Certain of our products have experienced significant generic competition over the last few years. For example, the basic product patent
 forChantix in the U.S. expired in November 2020. While multi-source generic competition for Chantix has not yet begun, it could commence at anytime. Also, the
 basic productpatent for Sutent in the U.S. will expire in August 2021.
 In China, we expect to continue to face intense competition by certain generic manufacturers, which may result in pricecuts and volume loss of some of our products.
In addition, our patented products may face generic competition before patent exclusivity expires, including upon the “at-risk” launch (despite pending patent infringement
litigation against the generic product) by a manufacturer of a generic version of one of our patented products.
 Generic manufacturers have filed applications with the FDAseeking approval of product candidates that they claim do not infringe our patents or claim that our paten
ts are not valid; these include candidates that would compete with,among other products, Eliquis, Ibrance and Xeljanz. Our licensing and collaboration partners also face challenges by generic drug manufacturers to patents covering products
for which we have licenses or co-promotion rights.
We may become subject to competition from biosimilars referencing our biologic products if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for such biosimilars.
We also commercialize biosimilar products that compete with products of others, including other biosimilar products. Uptake of our biosimilars may be lower due to various
factors, such as anti-competitive practices, access challenges where our product may not receive appropriate coverage/reimbursement access or remains in a disadvantaged
position relative to an innovator product, physician reluctance to prescribe biosimilars for existing patients taking the innovative product, or misaligned financial incentives. For
example, Inflectra has experienced access challenges among commercial payers. In September 2017, Pfizer filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the 
Eastern District ofPennsylvania against J&J alleging that J&J’s exclusionary contracts and other anticompetitive practices concerning Remicade
 (infliximab) violate federal antitrust laws. For additional information on competition our products face, see the
 Item 1. Business — Competition section in this Form 10-K. CONCENTRATION
We recorded direct product and/or alliance revenues of more than $1 billion for each of seven products that collectively accounted for 53% of
 our total revenues in 2020. Foradditional information, see 
Notes 1  and 17 . If these products or any of our other major products were to experience loss of patent protection (if applicable), changes inprescription growth rates, material product liability litigation, unexpected side effects or safety concerns, regulatory proceedings, negative publicity affecting doctor or patient
confidence, pressure from existing competitive products, changes in labeling, pricing and access pressures or supply shortages or if a new, more effective treatment should be
introduced, the adverse impact on our revenues could be significant. In particular, certain of our products have experienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory
exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years, and patents covering a number of our best-selling products are, or have been, the
 subject of pending legal challenges. Foradditional information on our patents, see the 
Item 1. Business — Patents and other Intellectual Property Rights section in this Form 10-K. ®Pfizer Inc.
2020 Form 10-K 12 
In addition, we sell our prescription pharmaceutical products principally through wholesalers in the U.S. For additional information, see Note 17B . If one of our significant biopharmaceutical wholesalers should encounter financial or other difficulties, it might decrease the amount of business the wholesaler does with us and/or we might be unable
to timely collect all the amounts that the wholesaler owes us or at all, which could negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, we expec
t that consolidation andintegration of pharmacy chains and wholesalers will increase competitive and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers, including us.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The discovery and development of new products, as well as the development of additional uses for existing products, are necessary for 
the continued strength of our business.Our product lines must be replenished over time to offset revenue losses when products lose exclusivity or market share, as well as to provide for earnings growth, either
through internal R&D or through collaborations, acquisitions, JVs, licensing or other arrangements. Growth depends in large part on our ability to identify and develop new
products or new indications for existing products that address unmet medical needs and receive reimbursement from payers. However, balancing current growth, investment
for future growth and the delivery of shareholder return remains a major challenge. The costs of product development continue to be high, as are regulatory requirements in
many therapeutic areas, which may affect the number of candidates we are able to fund as
 well as the sustainability of the R&D portfolio.Decisions made early in the development process of a drug or vaccine candidate can have a substantial impact on the marketing strategy and payer reimbursement
possibilities if the candidate receives regulatory approval. We try to plan clinical trials prudently and to reasonably anticipate and address challenges, but there is no assurance
that an optimal balance between trial conduct, speed and desired outcome will be achieved.
Additionally, our product candidates can fail at any stage of the R&D process, and
 may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of R&D. We may fail to correctlyidentify indications for which our science is promising or allocate R&D investment resources efficiently, and failure to invest in the right technology platforms, therapeutic areas,
product classes, geographic markets and/or licensing opportunities could adversely impact the productivity of our pipeline. Further, even if we identify areas with the greatest
commercial potential, the scientific approach may not succeed despite the significant investment required for R&D, and the product may not be
 as competitive as expectedbecause of the highly dynamic market environment and the hurdles in terms of access and reimbursement.
GLOBAL OPERATIONS
We operate on a global scale and could be affected by currency fluctuations, capital and exchange
 controls, global economic conditions, expropriation and other restrictivegovernment actions, changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies, trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, and
marketing of, reimbursement for and access to our products, as well as by political or civil unrest, terrorist activity, unstable governments and legal systems and inter-
governmental disputes.
Some emerging market countries may be particularly vulnerable to periods of financial or political instability or significant currency fluctuations or may have limited resources for
healthcare spending. As a result of these and other factors, our s
trategy to grow in emerging markets may not be successful, and growth rates in these markets may not besustainable.
In addition, since a significant portion of our business is conducted in the EU, as well as the
 U.K., the changes resulting from Brexit may pose certain implications for ourresearch, commercial and general business operations in the U.K. and the EU.
Government financing and economic pressures can lead to negative pricing pressure in various markets where governments take an active role in setting prices, access
criteria (e.g., through health technology assessments) or other means of cost control. For additional information on government pricing pressures, see the 
Item 1. Business
— Government Regulation and Price Constraints section in this Form 10-K. We continue to monitor the global trade environment and potential trade conflicts and impediments that could impact our business. If
 trade restrictions or tariffs reduce globaleconomic activity, potential impacts could include declining sales; increased costs; volatility in foreign exchange rates; a decline in the value of our financial assets and pension
plan investments; required increases of our pension funding obligations; increased government cost control efforts; delays or failures in the performance of customers,
suppliers and other third parties on whom we may depend for the performance of our business; and the risk that our allowance for doubtful accounts
 may not be adequate.We operate in many countries and transact in over 100 different currencies. Changes in the value of those currencies relative to the
 U.S. dollar, or high inflation in thesecountries, can impact our revenues, costs and expenses and our financial guidance. Significant portions of our revenues, costs
 and expenses, as well as our substantialinternational net assets, are exposed to exchange rate changes. 48% of
 our total 2020 revenues were derived from international operations, including 23% from Europe and17% from China, Japan and the rest of Asia. Future changes in exchange rates
 or economic conditions and the impact they may have on our results of operations, financialcondition or business are difficult to predict. For additional information about our exposure to foreign currency risk, see the 
Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital Resources and Market Risk—Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resources 
section within MD&A. In addition, our borrowing, pension benefit and postretirement benefit obligations and interest-bearing investments, are subject to risk from changes in interest and exchange
rates. The risks related to interest-bearing investments and borrowings and the measures we have taken to help contain them are discussed in the 
Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital Resources and Market Risk—Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resources 
section within MD&A. For additional details on critical accounting estimates and assumptions for our benefit plans, see the

any contracts to accommodate the SOFR rate where required. While our exposure to LIBOR is very low, market volatility related to the transition  may adversely affect the trading market for securities linked to such benchmarks.
PRODUCT MANUFACTURING, SALES AND MARKETING RISKS
We could encounter difficulties or delays in product manufacturing, sales or marketing due to regulatory actions, shut-downs, work stoppages or strikes, approval delays,
withdrawals, recalls, penalties, supply disruptions, shortages or stock-outs, reputational harm, damage to our facilities due to natural or man-made disasters, product liability or
unanticipated costs. Examples of such difficulties or delays include the inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand; challenges related to component
materials to maintain appropriate quality standards throughout our supply network and/or comply with applicable regulations; and supply chain disruptions at our facilities or at
a supplier or vendor.
Regulatory agencies periodically inspect our manufacturing facilities to evaluate compliance with cGMP or other applicable requirements. Failure to comply with these
requirements may subject us to possible legal or regulatory actions, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctions, debarment, product
recalls, delays or denials of product approvals, import bans or denials of import certifications. For example, in September 2017, our subsidiary, Meridian, received a warning
letter from the FDA asserting the FDA’s view that certain violations of cGMP and Quality 
System Regulations exist at Meridian’s manufacturing sites in St. Louis, Missouri andclassifying the site as Official Action Indicated (OAI). Meridian responded to the warning letter and committed to
 making improvements across the sites. We have madeconsiderable progress addressing the concerns raised by the FDA, and communication with the FDA is ongoing. Future FDA inspections and regulatory activities will further
assess the adequacy and sustainability of these corrections implemented at the site. As a
 result of the OAI classification, the FDA may refuse to grant premarket approval ofapplications and/or the FDA may refuse to grant export certificates related to products manufactured a
t our St. Louis sites.COLLABORATIONS AND OTHER RELATIONSHIPS WITH THIRD PARTIES
We depend on third-party collaborators, service providers, and others in the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of our products and product
candidates and also enter into JVs and other business development transactions. To achieve expected longer-term benefits, we may make subs
tantial upfront payments aspart of these transactions, which may negatively impact our reported earnings or cash flows. We rely heavily on these parties for multiple aspects of our drug development,
manufacturing and commercialization activities, but we do not control many aspects of those activities. We also outsource certain services, including activities related to
transaction processing, accounting, information technology, manufacturing, clinical trial recruitment and execution, clinical lab services, non-clinical research, safety services,
integrated facilities management and other areas. Failure by one or more of the third-party collaborators, service providers and others to complete activities on schedule or in
accordance with our expectations or to meet their contractual or other obligations to us; failure of one or more of 
these parties to comply with applicable laws or regulations; orany disruption in the relationships between us and these parties, could delay or prevent the development, approval, manufacturing or commercialization of our products and
product candidates, expose us to suboptimal quality of service delivery or deliverables, result in repercussions such as missed deadlines or other timeliness issues, erroneous
data and supply disruptions, and could also result in non-compliance with legal or regulatory requirements or industry standards or subject us to reputational harm, all with
potential negative implications for our product pipeline and business. Further, our Alliance revenues will be adversely affected by the termination or expiration of collaboration
and co-promotion agreements that we have entered into and that we may enter into from time to 
time.COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS
Our reputation and promising pipeline render our medicines prime targets for counterfeiters. Counterfeit medicines pose a significant risk to patient health and safety because
of the conditions under which they are manufactured
— often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites— as well as the lack of regulation of their contents.Failure to mitigate this threat could adversely impact our business, by, among other things, causing patient harm, the loss of
 patient confidence in the Pfizer name and in theintegrity of our medicines, potentially resulting in lost sales, product recalls, and an increased threat of litigation.
The prevalence of counterfeit medicines is an industry-wide issue due to a variety of factors, including the adoption of e-commerce, which increased during the COVID-19
pandemic, greatly enhancing consumers’ ability to obtain prescriptions and other medical treatments via the Internet in lieu of traditional brick and mortar pharmacies. The
internet exposes patients to greater risk as it is a preferred vehicle for dangerous counterfeit offers and scams because o
f the anonymity it affords counterfeiters.We consistently invest in an enterprise-wide strategy to aggressively combat counterfeit threats by educating patients and health care providers about 
the risks, proactivelymonitoring and interdicting supply with the help of law enforcement; and advising legislators and regulators. However, our efforts and those of others may not be en
tirelysuccessful, and the presence of counterfeit medicines may continue to increase.
RISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS:
PRICING AND R
EIMBURSEMENTU.S. and international governmental regulations that mandate price controls or limitations on patient access to our products or establish prices paid by government entities or
programs for our products impact our business, and our future results could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations or policies. The adoption of restrictive price
controls in new jurisdictions, more restrictive controls in existing jurisdictions or the failure to obtain or maintain timely or adequate pricing could also adversely impact revenue.
We expect pricing pressures will continue globally.
In the U.S., pharmaceutical product pricing is subject to government and public scrutiny and calls for reform, and many of our products are subject
 to increasing pricingpressures as a result. Some states have implemented, and others are considering, price controls or patient access constraints under the Medicaid program, and some are
considering measures that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not Medicaid-eligible. State legislatures also have recently focused on addressing
drug costs, generally by increasing price transparency or limiting drug price increases. Measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including
legislation on drug importation,
Pfizer Inc.
2020 Form 10-K 14 
could adversely affect our business. For additional information on U.S. pricing and reimbursement, see the Item 1. Business — Government Regulation and Price Constraintssection
 in this Form 10-K.We encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in which we operate. In certain markets, such as in EU member states, the U.K., China, Japan,
Canada and South Korea, governments have significant power as large single payers to regulate prices, access criteria, or impose other means of cost control, particularly as a
result of recent global financing pressures. For example, the QCE and VBP tender process in China has resulted in dramatic price cuts for o
ff-patent medicines. For additionalinformation regarding these government initiatives, see the 
Item 1. Business — Government Regulation and Price Constraints section in this Form 10-K. We anticipate that these and similar initiatives will continue to increase pricing pressures in China and elsewhere in the future. In addition, in many countries, with respect to our vaccines, we
participate in a tender process for selection in national immunization programs. Failure to secure participation in national immunization programs or to obtain acceptable pricing
in the tender process could adversely affect our business. We also anticipate pricing pressures will be amplified by COVID-19 induced budget deficits and focus on pricing for
new COVID-19 therapies and vaccines.
U.S. HEALTHCARE REFORM
The U.S. healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. 
Any significant efforts at the U.S. federal or state levels to reform thehealthcare system by changing the way healthcare is provided or funded could have a material impact on us. For additional information on U.S. healthcare reform, see the 
Item 1. Business––Government Regulation and Price Constraints
 section in this Form 10-K. Other U.S. federal or state legislative or regulatory action and/or policy efforts could adversely affect our business, including, among others,
 general budget control actions,changes in patent laws, the importation of prescription drugs to the U.S. at
 prices that are regulated by foreign governments, revisions to reimbursement of biopharmaceuticalsunder government programs that could reference international prices or require new discounts, restrictions on U.S. direct-to-consumer advertising, limitations on interactions
with healthcare professionals and other industry stakeholders, or the use of comparative effectiveness methodologies that could be implemented in a manner that 
focusesprimarily on cost differences and minimizes the therapeutic differences among pharmaceutical products and restricts access to innovative medicines.
A reduction of U.S. federal spending on entitlement programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, may affect payment for our products or services provided using our products.
The Congressional Budget Office routinely releases options for reducing federal spending that could affect pharmaceutical utilization and pricing as does the Medicare
Payment Advisory Commission. These and any other significant spending reductions or cost controls affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health
programs that may be implemented could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
DEVELOPMENT, REGULATORY APPROVAL AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS
The discovery and development of drugs and biological products are time consuming, costly and unpredictable. The outcome is inherently uncertain and involves a high degree
of risk due to the following factors, among others:
•
The process from early discovery to design and adequate implementation of clinical trials to regulatory approval can take many years.•
Product candidates can and do fail at any stage of the process, including as the result of unfavorable pre-clinical and clinical trial results, or unfavorable new pre-clinical orclinical data and further analyses of existing pre-clinical or clinical data, including results that may not support further clinical development of the product candidate or
indication.
•
We may not be able to meet anticipated pre-clinical or clinical endpoints, commencement and/or completion dates for our pre-clinical or clinical trials, regulatory submissiondates, regulatory approval dates and/or launch dates.
•
We may not be able to successfully address all the comments received from regulatory authorities such as the FDA and the EMA, or be able to obtain approval fromregulators.
Regulatory approvals of our products depend on myriad factors, including a regulator making a determination as to whether a product is safe and efficacious. In 
the context ofpublic health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic, regulators evaluate various factors and criteria to potentially allow for marketing authorization on an emergency basis.
Additionally, clinical trial and other product data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments by regulatory authorities. As a result of regulatory interpretations and
assessments or other developments that occur during the review process, and even after a product is authorized or approved for marketing, a product’s commercial potential
could be adversely affected by potential emerging concerns or regulatory decisions regarding or impacting labeling or marketing, manufacturing processes, safety and/or other
matters.
We may not be able to receive or maintain favorable recommendations by technical or advisory committees, such as the ACIP, that
 may impact the use of our products.Further, claims and concerns that may arise regarding the safety and efficacy of in-line products and product candidates can negatively impact product sales,
 and potentiallylead to product recalls or withdrawals, and/or consumer fraud, product liability and other litigation and claims. Further regulatory agency requirements may result in a more
challenging, expensive and lengthy regulatory approval process than anticipated due to requests for, among other things, additional or more extensive clinical trials prior to
granting approval, or increased post-approval requirements. For these and other reasons discussed in this 
Risk Factors section, we may not obtain the approvals we expect within the timeframe we anticipate, or at all.
POST-APPROVAL DATA
As a condition to granting marketing authorization or approval of a product, the FDA may require additional clinical trials or other studies. The results generated in these trials
could result in the loss of marketing approval, changes in labeling, and/or new or increased concerns about the side effects, ef
ficacy or safety. Regulatory agencies in countriesoutside the U.S. often have similar regulations and may impose comparable requirements. Post-marketing studies, whether conducted by us or by others, whether mandated
by regulatory agencies or conducted voluntarily, and other emerging data about products, such as adverse event reports, may also adversely affec
t the availability orcommercial potential of our products. Further, if safety or efficacy concerns are raised about a product in the same class as
 one of our products, those concerns could implicatethe entire class; and this, in turn, could have an adverse impact on the availability or commercial viability of our product(s) as well as
Pfizer Inc.
2020 Form 10-K 15 
other products in the class. The potential regulatory and commercial implications of post-marketing study results, for approved indications and potential new indications of anin-line product, typically cannot immediately be determined. For example, the potential impact of the co-primary endpoint results from a recently completed post-marketing
required safety study of Xeljanz, ORAL Surveillance (A3921133), announced in January 2021, and related results, analyses and discussions with and reviews by regulators,
remain uncertain. We are working with the FDA and other regulatory agencies to review the full results and analyses as they become available.
The terms of our EUA for the BNT162b2 vaccine require that we conduct post-authorization observational studies. 
In addition, the FDA expects EUA holders to work towardssubmission of full application, such as a BLA, as soon as possible.
LEGAL MATTERS
We are and may be involved in various legal proceedings, including patent litigation, product liability and other product-related litigation, including personal injury, consumer,
off-label promotion, securities, antitrust and breach of contract claims, commercial, environmental, government investigations, employment, tax litigation and other legal
proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and excessive verdicts do occur. Although we believe that
our claims and defenses in matters in which we are a defendant are substantial, we could in the future incur judgments, enter into se
ttlements or revise our expectationsregarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of
 operations.Claims against our patents include challenges to the coverage and/or validity of our patents on various products or processes. There can be no assurance as
 to the outcome ofthese matters, and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss o
f patent protection for the product at issue, which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that productand could materially affect future results of operations.
Government investigations and actions could result in substantial fines and/or criminal charges and civil penalties, limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable
jurisdictions, corporate integrity or deferred prosecution agreements and other disciplinary actions, as well as reputational harm, including as a result of increased public
interest in the matter. In addition, in a qui tam lawsuit in which the government declines to intervene, the
 relator may still pursue a suit for the recovery of civil damages andpenalties on behalf of the government.
Our sales and marketing activities and the pricing of our products are subject to extensive regulation under the FFDCA, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the FCP
A andother federal and state statutes, including those discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, as well as the An
ti-Kickback Statute, anti-bribery laws, the False Claims Act, andsimilar laws in international jurisdictions. In addition to the potential for changes to relevant laws, the compliance and enforcement landscape is informed by government
litigation, settlement precedent, advisory opinions, and special fraud alerts. Our approach to certain practices may evolve over time in light of these types
 of developments.Requirements or industry standards in the U.S. and certain jurisdictions abroad require pharmaceutical manufacturers to track and disclose financial interactions with
healthcare professionals and healthcare providers and can increase government and public scrutiny of such financial interactions. If an interaction is found to be improper,
government enforcement actions and penalties could result. Like many companies in our industry, we have from time-to-time received, and may receive in the future, inquiries
and subpoenas and other types of information demands from government authorities. In addition, we have been subject
 to claims and other actions related to our businessactivities, brought by governmental authorities, as well as consumers and private payers. In some instances, we have incurred significant expense, civil payments, fines and
other adverse consequences as a result of these claims, actions and inquiries. Such claims, actions and inquiries may relate to alleged non-compliance with laws and
regulations associated with the dissemination of product (approved and unapproved) information, potentially resulting in government enforcement action and reputational
damage. This risk may be heightened by digital marketing, including social media, mobile applications and blogger outreach.
In connection with the resolution of a U.S. government investigation concerning independent copay assistance organizations that
 provide financial assistance to Medicarepatients, in 2018, we entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) with the O
ffice of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, whichis effective for a period of five years. In the CIA
, we agreed to implement and/or maintain certain compliance program elements to promote compliance with federal healthcareprogram requirements. Breaches of the CIA could result in severe sanctions against us.
We and certain of our subsidiaries are also subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business relating to legal claims and proceedings, including
environmental contingencies. Amounts recorded for legal and environmental contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties
and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. While we have accrued for worldwide legal liabilities, there is no guarantee that additional costs will not be incurred beyond
the amounts accrued.
For additional information, including information regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved in, see 
Note 16A . RISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, TECHNOLOGY AND SECURITY:
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION
Our success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products. We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property,
including patent, trademark, trade dress, copyright, trade secret and domain name protection laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements, to protect our intellectual
property and proprietary rights. If we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection, we may not be able to
 prevent third parties from launching generic orbiosimilar versions of our branded products, from using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours. Our currently pending
or future patent applications may not result in issued patents, or be granted on a
 timely basis. Similarly, any term extensions that we seek may not be granted on a timely basis,if at all. In addition, our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protec
t us against claims regarding validity, enforceability, scope and effective term made byparties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage, including exclusivity in a particular product area.
The scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries, as individual countries have distinct patent laws, and our ability to enforce our pa
tents depends on the laws ofeach country, its enforcement practices, and the extent to
 which certain countries engage in policies or practicesPfizer Inc.
2020 Form 10-K 16 
that weaken a country’s intellectual property framework (e.g., laws or regulations that promote or provide broad discretion to issue a compulsory license). In countries thatprovide some form of regulatory exclusivity, mechanisms exist permitting some form of challenge to our patents by competitors or generic drug marketers prior to or
immediately following the expiration of such regulatory exclusivity, and generic companies are employing aggressive strategies, such as “at risk” launches that challenge our
patent rights. Most of the suits involve claims by generic drug manufacturers that patents covering our products,
 uses, processes or dosage forms are invalid and/or do notcover the product of the generic or biosimilar drug manufacturer. Independent actions have been filed alleging that our assertions of, or at
tempts to enforce, patent rights withrespect to certain products constitute unfair competition and/or violations of antitrust laws. Such claims may also be brought as
 counterclaims to actions we bring to enforce ourpatents. We are also party to other patent damages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers, payers, governments or other parties are
seeking damages from us for alleged delay of generic entry. We also are often involved in other proceedings, such as inter partes review, post-grant review, re-examination or
opposition proceedings, before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, 
the European Patent Office, or other foreign counterparts relating to our intellectual property or theintellectual property rights of others. Also, if one of our patents or a competitors’ paten
ts is found to be invalid in such proceedings, generic or biosimilar products could beintroduced into the market resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products. For additional information, including information regarding certain legal proceedings in
which we are involved, see 
Note 16A1 . Further, if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.
We currently hold trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending in many jurisdictions, any of which may be the subject of a governmental or third-party
objection, which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the trademark. As our products mature, our reliance on our trademarks and trade dress to dif
ferentiate us fromour competitors increases and, as a result, our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting,
 registering or using trademarks andtrade dress that infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our rights. We seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring
our employees, consultants, other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their
relationship with us. Despite these efforts and precautions, we may be unable to prevent a third party 
from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or ourother intellectual property without authorization, and legal remedies may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use. Further,
 othersmay independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or
otherwise.
THIRD PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS
A properly functioning intellectual property regime is essential to our business model. We are committed to respecting the valid intellectual property rights of other companies,
but the patent granting process is imperfect. Accordingly, the pursuit of valid business opportunities may require us to challenge intellectual property rights held by others that
we believe were improperly granted, including challenges through negotiation and litigation, and such challenges may not always be successful.
Part of our business depends upon identifying biosimilar opportunities and launching products to take advantage of those opportunities, which may involve litigation, associated
costs and time delays, and may ultimately not be successful. These opportunities may arise in situations where patent protection o
f equivalent branded products has expired orbeen declared invalid, or where products do not infringe the patents of others. In some circumstances we may take ac
tion, such as litigation, asserting that our products do notinfringe patents of existing products or that those patents are invalid or unenforceable in order to achieve a “first-to-market” or early market position for our products.
Third parties may claim that our products infringe one or more patents owned or controlled by them. Claims of intellectual property infringement can be costly and time-
consuming to resolve, may delay or prevent product launches, and may result in significant damages. We are involved in patent-related disputes with third parties over our
attempts to market generic pharmaceutical products and biosimilars. Once we have final regulatory approval of the related generic products or biosimilars, we may decide to
commercially market these products even though associated legal proceedings (including any appeals) have not been resolved (i.e., “at-risk” launch). If one of our marketed
products is found to infringe valid patent rights of a third party, such third party may be
 awarded significant damages, or we may be prevented from further sales of that product.Such damages may be enhanced as much as three-fold if we or one of our subsidiaries is found to have willfully infringed valid patent rights of a third party.
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND SECURITY
Significant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our business. We extensively rely upon sophisticated
information technology systems to operate our business. We collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information (including personal information and
intellectual property), and we deploy and operate an array of technical and procedural controls to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. We
have outsourced significant elements of our operations, including significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and, as a result, we manage relationships
with many third-party vendors who may or could have access to our confidential information. The size and complexity of our information technology and information security
systems, and those of our third-party vendors (and the large amounts of confidential information that is present on
 them), make such systems potentially vulnerable to serviceinterruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors, or malicious attackers. Cyber-attacks are of ever-increasing levels of
sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives (including, but not limited to, industrial espionage) and expertise, including organized
criminal groups, “hacktivists,” nation states and others. As a global pharmaceutical company, our systems are subject to frequent cyber-attacks. Due 
to the nature of some ofthese attacks, there is a risk that they may remain undetected 
for a period of time. While we have invested in the protection of data and information technology, our efforts maynot prevent service interruptions or security breaches. Any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss of
critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property, and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us. We maintain cyber liability
insurance; however, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of
 oursystems.
Pfizer Inc.
2020 Form 10-K 17 
RISKS RELATED TO BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT:BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
We expect to enhance our in-line products and product pipeline through various forms of business development, which can include alliances, licenses, JVs, collaborations,
equity- or debt-based investments, dispositions, divestments, mergers and acquisitions. The success of these activities is dependent on 
the availability and accuratecost/benefit evaluation of appropriate opportunities, competition from others that are seeking similar opportunities and our ability to successfully identify, structure and execute
transactions, including the ability to satisfy closing conditions in the anticipated timeframes or at all, and successfully integrate acquisitions. Pursuing these opportunities may
require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which could result in increased leverage and/or a downgrade of our credit ratings. Where we acquire debt or equity
securities as all or part of the consideration for business development activities, the value of those securities will fluctuate, and may depreciate. We
 may not control a companyin which we invest, and, as a result, we will have limited ability to determine its management, operational decisions and policies. Further, while we seek to mitigate risks and
liabilities of such transactions through, among other things, due diligence, there may be risks and liabilities that such efforts fail to discover, tha
t are not disclosed to us, or thatwe inadequately assess. The success of any of our acquisitions will depend, when applicable, on our ability to realize anticipated benefits from integrating these businesses
with us. We, for example, may fail to achieve cost savings anticipated with certain of these
 acquisitions, or such cost savings within the expected time frame. Similarly, theaccretive impact anticipated from certain of these acquisitions may not be realized or may be delayed. Integration of these businesses may result in 
the loss of key employees,the disruption of ongoing business, including third-party relationships, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. We also may fail to generate the
expected revenue growth for the acquired business. Expected revenue from acquired products and product candidates also may be constrained by developments ou
tside ofour control. Unsuccessful clinical trials, regulatory hurdles and commercialization challenges may adversely impact revenue and income contribution from products and product
candidates, including those acquired in these acquisitions.
SPIN-OFF AND COMBINATION OF UPJOHN WITH MYLAN
We may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the spin-off and
 combination (the Transactions) of the Upjohn Business with Mylan, which resulted in the creation ofViatris, due to many factors, including, among others, strategic adjustments required to reflect the na
ture of our business following the Transactions, increased risks resultingfrom us becoming a company that is 
a more focused, innovative science-based biopharmaceutical products business and the possibility that we may not achieve our strategic objectives. In addition, we have agreed to provide certain transition services to Viatris, generally for an initial period of 24 months following the completion of the Transactions
(with certain possibilities for extension). These obligations under the transition services agreements may result in additional expenses and may divert our focus and resources
that would otherwise be invested into maintaining or growing our business.
CONSUMER HEALTHCARE JV WITH GSK
In 2019, we and GSK combined our respective consumer healthcare businesses into a JV that
 operates globally under the GSK Consumer Healthcare name. Although wehave certain consent, board representation and other governance rights, we are a minority owner of the JV and do no
t control the JV, its management or its policies. As aresult, our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction depend upon G
SK’s operation and management of the JV. In addition, the JV is subject to risks that aredifferent than the risks associated with our business. Many of these risks are outside GS
K’s or the JV’s control and could materially impact the business, financial condition andresults of operations of the JV.
GSK has indicated that it intends to separate 
the JV as an independent company listed on the U.K. equity market. Until July 31, 2024, GSK has the exclusive right to initiate aseparation and listing transaction. We have the option to participate in a separation and listing transaction initiated by G
SK. However, the separation and public listingtransaction may not be initiated or completed within expected time periods or at all, and both the timing and success of
 any separation and public listing transaction, as well asthe value generated for us or our shareholders in any such transaction, will be subject to prevailing market conditions and other factors at the 
time of such transaction. Anyfuture distribution or sale of our stake in the JV will similarly be subject to prevailing market conditions and other factors at the time of such 
transaction. Our ability to completeany such future distribution or sale may also be impacted by the size of our retained stake at 
the time. The uncertainty relating to the separation and public listing transactions,their implementation, their timing and their yet to be determined effects on the JV’s business may subject us and
 the JV to risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect ourbusiness and financial results.
GENERAL RISKS:
COVID-19 PANDEMIC
Our business, operations and financial condition and results have been and may continue to be impacted by the CO
VID-19 pandemic to varying degrees. The pandemic haspresented a number of risks and challenges for our business, including, among others, impacts due to travel limitations and mobility restrictions; manufacturing disruptions and
delays; supply chain interruptions, including challenges related to reliance on third-party suppliers; disruptions to pipeline development and clinical trials, including difficulties or
delays in enrollment of certain clinical trials and in access to needed supplies; decreased product demand, due to reduced numbers of in-person meetings with prescribers,
patient visits with physicians, vaccinations and elective surgeries, resulting in fewer new prescriptions or refills of existing prescriptions and reduced demand for products used
in procedures; further reduced product demand as a result of increased unemployment; challenges presented by reallocating personnel and R&D, manufacturing and other
resources to assist in responding to the pandemic; costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including practices intended to reduce the
 risk of transmission, increasedsupply chain costs and additional R&D costs incurred in our efforts to develop a vaccine to help prevent COVID-19 and po
tential treatments for COVID-19; challenges relatedto our business development initiatives, including potential delays or disruptions related to regulatory approvals; interruptions or delays in the operations of regulatory
authorities, which may delay potential approval of new products we are developing, potential label expansions for existing products and the launch of newly-approved products;
challenges operating in a virtual work environment; potential increased cyber incidents such as phishing, social engineering and malware attacks; challenges related to our
intellectual property, both domestically and internationally, including in response to any pressure or legal or regulatory action that could potentially result in us not seeking
intellectual property protection for, licensing, or agreeing not to enforce,
Pfizer Inc.
2020 Form 10-K 18 
intellectual property rights related to our products, including our vaccine to help prevent COVID-19 and potential treatments for COVID-19; challenges related to conductingoversight and monitoring of regulated activities in a remote or virtual environment; and other challenges presented by disruptions to our normal operations in response to the
pandemic, as well as uncertainties regarding the duration and severity of the pandemic and its impacts, and government or regulatory actions to contain the virus or control the
supply of medicines.
We also face risks and uncertainties related to our efforts to develop and commercialize a vaccine to help prevent COVID-19 and poten
tial treatments for COVID-19, as well aschallenges related to their manufacturing, supply and distribution, including, among others, uncertainties inherent in R&D, including the ability to meet anticipated clinical
endpoints, commencement and/or completion dates for clinical trials, regulatory submission dates, regulatory approval dates and/or launch dates, as well as risks associated
with pre-clinical or clinical data (including the in vitro and Phase 3 data for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2)), including the possibility of unfavorable new
pre-clinical, clinical or safety data and further analyses of existing pre-clinical, clinical or safety data; the ability to produce comparable clinical or other results, including the rate
of vaccine effectiveness and safety and tolerability profile observed to date, in additional analyses of 
the Phase 3 trial and additional studies or in larger, more diversepopulations upon commercialization; the ability of BNT162b2 to prevent COVID-19 caused by emerging virus variants; the risk that more widespread use of the vaccine will
lead to new information about efficacy, safety or other developments, including the risk of additional adverse reactions, some of
 which may be serious; the risk that pre-clinicaland clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments, including during the peer review/publication process, in the scientific community generally, and by
regulatory authorities; whether and when additional data from the BNT162 mRNA vaccine program or other programs will be published in scientific publications and, if so, when
and with what modifications and interpretations; whether regulatory authorities will be satisfied with the design of and results from these and any future pre-clinical and clinical
studies; when other biologics license and/or EUA applications may be filed in particular jurisdictions for BNT162b2 or any other potential vaccines that may arise from the
BNT162 program, and if obtained, whether or when such EUA or licenses will expire or terminate; whether and when any applications that may be pending or filed for
BNT162b2 or other vaccines that may result from the BNT162 program may be approved by particular regulatory authorities, which will depend on myriad factors, including
making a determination as to whether the vaccine’s benefits outweigh its known risks and determination of the vaccine’s efficacy and, if approved,
 whether it will becommercially successful; regulatory decisions impacting labeling or marketing, manufacturing processes, safety and/or other matters that could affect the availability or
commercial potential of a vaccine, including development of products or therapies by other companies; disruptions in the relationships between us and our collaboration
partners, clinical trial sites or third-party suppliers, including our relationship with BioNTech; the risk that other companies may produce superior or competitive products; the
risk that demand for any products may be reduced or no longer exist; risks related to the availability of raw materials to manufacture or test any
 such products; challengesrelated to our vaccine’s ultra-low temperature formulation, two-dose schedule and attendant storage, distribution and administration requirements, including risks related to
storage and handling after delivery by us; the risk that we may not be able to success
fully develop other vaccine formulations; the risk that we may not be able to recoup costsassociated with our R&D and manufacturing efforts; risks associated with any changes in the way we approach or provide research funding for the BNT162 program or
potential treatment for COVID-19; challenges and risks associated with the pace of our development programs; the risk that
 we may not be able to maintain or scale upmanufacturing capacity on a timely basis or maintain access to logistics or supply channels commensurate with global demand for our vaccine or any potential approved
treatment, which would negatively impact our ability to supply the estimated numbers of doses of our vaccine within the projected time periods as previously indicated; whether
and when additional supply agreements will be reached; uncertainties regarding the ability to obtain recommendations from vaccine advisory or technical committees and other
public health authorities and uncertainties regarding the commercial impact of any such recommendations; pricing and access challenges for such products; challenges related
to public vaccine confidence or awareness; trade restrictions; and competitive developments.
Further, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the volatile global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, could precipitate or amplify the other risks that we identify in this
Risk Factors
 section, which could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition and results. We are continuing to monitor the latest developments regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on our business,
 operations and financial condition and results, andhave made certain assumptions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic for purposes of our operational planning and financial projections, including assumptions regarding the
duration, severity and the global macroeconomic impact of the pandemic, as well as COVID-19 vaccine supply and contracts, which remain dynamic. Despite careful tracking
and planning, we are unable to accurately predict the extent of the impact of
 the pandemic on our business, operations and financial condition and results due to theuncertainty of future developments. In particular, we believe the ultimate impact on our business, operations and financial condition and results will be affected by
 the speedand extent of the continued spread of the coronavirus globally, the emergence of additional virus variants, the
 duration of the pandemic, new information regarding the severityand incidence of COVID-19, the safety, efficacy and availability of vaccines and 
treatments for COVID-19, the rate at which the population becomes vaccinated against COVID-19, the global macroeconomic impact of the pandemic and governmental or regulatory actions to contain the virus or control supply of medicines. The pandemic may also
affect our business, operations or financial condition and results in a manner that is not presently known to us or 
that we currently do not consider as presenting significantrisks.
MARKET FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS
Changes in fair value of certain equity investments need to be recognized in net income that may result in increased volatility of our income. For additional information, see
Note 4 
and the Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital Resources and Market Risk—Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resources  section within MD&A. Our pension benefit obligations and postretirement benefit obligations are subject to volatility from changes in fair value of equity investments and other investment
 risk in theassets funding these plans. For additional information, see the 
Significant Accounting Policies and Application of Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions — BenefitPlans 
section within MD&A and Note 11. COST AND EXPENSE CONTROL AND NONORDINARY EVENTS
Growth in costs and expenses, changes in product and geographic mix and the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings, internal reorganizations, product
withdrawals, recalls and other unusual events that could result from evolving business strategies, evaluation of asset realization and organizational restructuring could
adversely affect future results. Such risks and uncertainties include, in particular, our ability to realize the projected benefits of our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives,
other corporate strategic initiatives and any acquisitions, divestitures or other initiatives, as well as potential disruption of ongoing business.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS, GOODWILL AND EQUITY-METHOD INVESTMENTSOur consolidated balance sheet contains significant amounts of intangible assets, including IPR&D and goodwill. For IPR&D assets, 
the risk of failure is significant, and therecan be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield successful products. Our ability to realize value on these significant investments is o
ften contingent upon, among otherthings, regulatory approvals and market acceptance. As such, we expect that many o
f these IPR&D assets will become impaired and/or be written off at some time in the futureif the associated R&D effort is abandoned or is curtailed. For goodwill, all reporting units can confront events and circumstances that can
 lead to a goodwill impairment chargesuch as, among other things, unanticipated competition, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, a
 significant adverse change in legal matters or in the businessclimate and/or a failure to replace the contributions of products that lose exclusivity. Our other intangible assets, including developed technology rights and brands,
 face similarrisks for impairment. Our equity-method investments may also be subject to impairment charges that may result from the occurrence of unexpected adverse events or
management decisions that impact our estimates of expected cash flows to be generated from these
 investments. We may recognize impairment charges as a result of a weakeconomic environment, events related to particular customers or asset types, challenging market conditions or decisions by management. Any such impairment charge of our
intangible assets, goodwill and equity-method investments may be significant. For additional details, see the S
ignificant Accounting Policies and Application of Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions
 section within MD&A. CHANGES IN LAWS AND ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Our future results could be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation, including, among others, changes in accounting standards,
 taxationrequirements, competition laws, privacy laws and environmental laws in the U.S. and other countries. For additional information on changes in tax laws or rates or accounting
standards, see the 
Provision/(Benefit) for Taxes on Income and  New Accounting Standards sections within MD&A and Note 1B . ITEM 2.
PROPERTIES We own and lease space around the world for sales and marketing, customer service, regulatory compliance, R&D, manufacturing and distribution and corporate enabling
functions. In many locations, our business and operations are co-located to achieve synergy and operational efficiencies. Our global headquarters are located in New York
City. We continue to advance our global workplace strategy to provide workplaces that enable collaboration and foster innovation. As of December 31, 2020
, we had 363owned and leased properties, amounting to approximately 43 million square feet.
In 2020, we reduced the number of properties in our portfolio by 90 sites and 4 million square feet, primarily due to the spin-off and combination of
 the Upjohn Business withMylan to form Viatris.
We expect to relocate our global headquarters to the Spiral, an office building in the Hudson Yards neighborhood of New York City,
 with occupancy expected beginning in2022. In April 2018, we entered into an agreement to lease space at 
this property. In July 2018, we completed the sale of our current headquarters in New York City. Weremain in a lease-back arrangement with the buyer while we complete our relocation.
Our PGS platform function is headquartered in various locations, with leadership teams primarily in New York City and in Peapack, New Jersey. As of December 31, 2020,
PGS had responsibility for 43 plants around the world, including in Belgium, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, 
Singapore and the U.S., which manufacture products for ourbusiness. PGS expects to exit five of 
these sites over the next several years. PGS also operates multiple distribution facilities around the world.In general, we believe that our properties, including the principal properties described above, are well-maintained, adequate and suitable for their current requirements and for
our operations in the foreseeable future. See

References to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. Although foreign exchange rate changes are partof our business, they are not within our control and since they can mask positive or negative trends in the
 business, we believe presenting operational variances excludingthese foreign exchange changes provides useful information to evaluate our results.
Our Business and Strategy
Most of our revenues come from the manufacture and sale of biopharmaceutical products. With the formation of 
the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019 and the completion of thespin-off and combination of our Upjohn Business with Mylan in November 2020, Pfizer has transformed into a more focused, global leader in science-based innovative
medicines and vaccines. We now operate as a single operating segment engaged in the discovery, development, manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution of
biopharmaceutical products worldwide. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, the financial results of the Upjohn Business and the Mylan-Japan collaboration are reflected as
discontinued operations for all periods presented. Prior-period information has been restated to reflect our current organizational structure following the separation of the
Upjohn Business. See 
Note 1A and  Item 1. Business––Commercial Operations of this Form 10-K for additional information. We expect to incur costs of approximately $700 million in connection with separating Upjohn, of which, approximately 70% has been incurred since inception and through December 31, 2020. These charges include costs
and expenses related to separation of legal entities and transaction costs.
Transforming to a More Focused Company: 
We have undertaken efforts to ensure our cost base aligns appropriately with our revenue base. While certain direct costs transferred to the Consumer Healthcare JV and to the Upjohn Business in connection with the spin-off, 
there are indirect costs which did not transfer. In addition, we are takingsteps to restructure our corporate enabling functions to appropriately support and drive the purpose of our focused innovative biopharmaceutical products business and R&D
and PGS platform functions. See the 
Costs and Expenses––Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives section of this MD&A.
R&D:
 We believe we have a strong pipeline and are well-positioned for future growth. R&D is at the heart of fulfilling our purpose to deliver breakthroughs that change patients’ lives as we work to translate advanced science and technologies into the therapies that may be the most
 impactful for patients. Innovation, drug discovery and developmentare critical to our success. In addition to discovering and developing new products, our R&D efforts seek to add value 
to our existing products by improving their effectivenessand ease of dosing and by discovering potential new indications. See the 
Item 1. Business — Research and Development section  of this Form 10-K for our R&D priorities andstrategy.
We seek to leverage a strong pipeline, organize around expected operational growth drivers and capitalize on trends creating long-term growth opportunities, including:
•
an aging global population that is generating increased demand for innovative medicines and vaccines that address patients’ unmet needs;•
advances in both biological science and digital technology that are enhancing the delivery of breakthrough new medicines and vaccines; and•
the increasingly significant role of hospitals in healthcare systems.We are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities by advancing our own product pipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, as well as
through various business development activities. We view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies and seek to generate growth by pursuing
opportunities and transactions that have the potential to strengthen our business and
 our capabilities. We assess our business, assets and scientific capabilities/portfolio aspart of our regular, ongoing portfolio review process and also continue to consider business development activities that will advance our business. For additional information,
including discussion of recent significant business development activities, see

 increased $736 million, or 2%, to $41.9 billion in 2020 from $41.2 billion in 2019, reflecting an operational increase of $1.1 billion, or 3%, and an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $331 million, or 1%.
Excluding the impact of the Consumer Healthcare transaction, revenues increased 8% operationally, reflecting strong growth in Vyndaqel/Vyndamax, Eliquis, Ibrance outside
developed Europe, Inlyta, Xeljanz, Xtandi, Prevenar 13 outside the U.
S., oncology biosimilars and certain products in the Hospital therapeutic area in the U.S., partially offsetby Enbrel internationally and Prevnar 13 and Chantix in the U.S. Revenues for 2020 included an estimated unfavorable impact of approximately $700 million, or 2%, due to
COVID-19, primarily reflecting lower demand for certain products in China and unfavorable disruptions to wellness visits for patients in the U.S., which negatively impacted
prescribing patterns for certain products, partially offset by increased U.S. demand for certain sterile injectable products and increased adult uptake for Prevenar 13 in certain
international markets, resulting from greater vaccine awareness for respiratory illnesses, and U.S. revenues for BNT162b2.

Our product lines must be replenished to offset revenue losses when products lose their market exclusivity, respond to healthcare and innovation trends and provide for
earnings growth. As a result, we devote considerable resources to our R&D activities which, while essential to our growth, incorporate a high degree of risk and cost, including
whether a particular product candidate or new indication for an in-line product will achieve the desired clinical endpoint or safety profile, will be approved by regulators or will be

provide data on safety and efficacy to support the evaluation of a drug’s overall benefit-risk profile for a particular patient population. In addition, after a product has beenapproved and launched, we continue to monitor its safety as long as it is available to patients.
 This includes postmarketing trials that may be conducted voluntarily or pursuantto a regulatory request to gain additional medical knowledge. For the entire life of the product, we collect safety da
ta and report safety information to the FDA and otherregulatory authorities. Regulatory authorities may evaluate potential safety concerns and take regulatory actions in response, such as updating a product’s labeling, restricting
its use, communicating new safety information to the public, or, in rare cases, requiring us to suspend or remove a product from the market.
 The commercial potential of in-lineproducts may be negatively impacted by post-marketing developments.

The loss, expiration or invalidation of intellectual property rights, patent litigation settlements with manufacturers and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights can
have a material adverse effect on our revenues. Certain of our products have experienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the
last few years, and we expect certain products to face significantly increased generic competition over the next few years.
 For example, the basic product patent for Chantix inthe U.S. expired in November 2020. Also, the basic product patent for 
Sutent in the U.S. will expire in August 2021. While additional patent expiries will continue, we expect amoderate impact of reduced revenues due to patent expiries from 2021 through 2025. We continue to
 vigorously defend our patent rights against infringement, and we willcontinue to support efforts that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps 
to ensure appropriate patient access.For additional information on patent rights we consider most significant to our business as a whole, see the

, related to the fee payable to the federal government 195  210 134 Regulatory Environment/Pricing and Access––Government and Other Payer Group Pressures
The pricing of medicines by pharmaceutical manufacturers and the cost of healthcare, which includes medicines, medical services and hospital services, continues to be
important to payers, governments, patients, and other stakeholders. Federal and state governments and
 private third-party payers in the U.S. continue to take action tomanage the utilization of drugs and cost of drugs, including increasingly employing formularies to control costs by taking into account discounts in connection with decisions
about formulary inclusion or favorable formulary placement. We consider a number of factors impacting the pricing of our medicines. Within the U.S., we often engage with
patients, doctors and healthcare plans. We also often provide significant discounts from the list price to insurers, including PBMs and MCOs.
 The price that patients pay in theU.S. for prescribed medicines is ultimately set by healthcare providers and insurers. On average, insurers impose a higher out-of-pocket burden on patients for prescription
medicines than for comparably priced medical services. Certain governments outside the U.S. provide healthcare at low-to-zero direct cost to consumers at the point of care
and have significant power as large single payers to effectively regulate prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare
system. Governments may use a variety of measures, including proposing pricing reform or legislation, cross country collaboration and procurement, price cuts, mandatory
rebates, health technology assessments, forced localization as a condition of market access, “international reference pricing” (i.e., the practice of a coun
try linking its regulatedmedicine prices to those of other countries), QCE processes and VBP. For additional information, see the 
Item 1. Business –– Government Regulation and Price Constraintssection in this Form 10-K.
The Global Economic Environment
In addition to the industry-specific factors discussed above, we, like other businesses of our size and global extent
 of activities, are exposed to the economic cycle. Certainfactors in the global economic environment that may impact our global operations include, among other things, currency fluctuations, capital and exchange controls, global
economic conditions, restrictive government actions, changes in intellectual property, legal protections and remedies, trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting
approval, production, pricing, and marketing of, reimbursement for and access to our products, as well as impacts of political or civil unrest, terrorist activity, unstable
governments and legal systems, inter-governmental disputes and public health outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics. Government pressures can lead to negative pricing
pressure in various markets where governments take an active role in setting prices, access criteria or other means of cost control.
COVID-19 Pandemic
The continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our business, operations and financial condition and results. For additional information on the impact of CO
VID-19on our revenues, please see the 
Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook–Our 2020 Performance  section of this MD&A. Our Response to COVID-19
We are committed to confronting the public health challenge posed by the pandemic by collaborating with industry partners and academic institutions to develop potential
approaches to prevent and treat COVID-19. In March 2020, we issued a five-point plan calling on the biopharmaceutical industry to join us in committing to unprecedented
collaboration to combat COVID-19. Subsequently, we have made some important advances, including, among others:
•
Entry into a global agreement (except for China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) with BioNTech for the development, manufacture and commercialization of an mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine, BNT162, to help prevent COVID-19. In November 2020, the companies announced that
 after conducting the final efficacy analysis in the Phase3 study, BNT162b2 met both of the study’s primary efficacy endpoints.
Pfizer Inc.
2020 Form 10-K 26 
Analysis of the data indicated a vaccine efficacy rate against COVID-19 of 95% in participants without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (first primary objective) and also inparticipants with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (second primary objective), in each case measured from seven days after the second dose. The FDA authorized
the distribution and use of BNT162b2 in the U.S. to help prevent
 COVID-19 for individuals 16 years of age and older under an EUA issued in December 2020. BNT162b2has not been approved or licensed by the FDA. The EUA authorizes distribution and use of
 this product subject to the conditions set forth in the EUA, and only for theduration of the declaration by the Department of Health & Human Services that circumstances exist justifying authorization of
 emergency use of drugs and biologicalproducts (such as BNT162b2) during the COVID-19 pandemic under Section 564 of the FFDCA (the Declaration), or until revocation of the 
EUA by the FDA. The FDA hasissued EUAs to certain other companies for products intended for the prevention or treatment of
 COVID-19 and may continue to do so during the duration of the Declaration.The FDA expects EUA holders to work towards submission of a BLA as soon as possible. 
BNT162b2 has now been granted a CMA, EUA or temporary authorization in morethan 50 countries worldwide. The companies continue to study BNT162b2, including studies evaluating it in additional populations, booster doses and emerging variants.
Based on the updated 6-dose labeling and subject to continuous process improvements, expansion at current facilities and adding new suppliers and contract
manufacturers, the companies believe that they can potentially manufacture at least 2 billion doses in total by 
the end of 2021. The companies have entered into agreementsto supply pre-specified doses of BNT162b2 with multiple developed and emerging nations around the world and are continuing to deliver doses of BNT162b2 to
governments under such agreements. As of February 2, 2021, based on the doses
 to be delivered in 2021 primarily under agreements entered into as of February 2, 2021(including, among others, agreements with the U.S. government to supply 200 million doses, the European Commission to supply 300 million doses, the Japanese
government to supply 144 million doses and COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) for up to 40 million doses in 2021, subject to
 the negotiation and execution ofadditional agreements under the COVAX Facility structure), we forecasted approximately $15 billion in revenues in 2021 from BNT162b2, with gross margin to be split
evenly with BioNTech. This forecast was based on doses mostly covered under agreements entered into as of February 2, 2021 and
 did not include all of the doses we canpotentially deliver by the end of 2021. The companies continue to enter into agreements with governments for additional doses, including, among others,
 the exercise by theU.S. government of an option for an additional 100 million doses and an agreement with the European Commission for an additional 200 million doses to be delivered in
2021. Accordingly, this forecast may change based, in part, on these and
 future additional agreements that may be signed and as circumstances warrant. For additionalinformation on our COVID-19 vaccine development program, see 
Note 2  and the Item 1A. Risk Factors—COVID-19 Pandemic  section in this Form 10-K. •
Initiation, in September 2020, of a Phase 1b clinical trial in hospitalized participants with COVID-19 to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a novelinvestigational protease inhibitor for COVID-19, PF-07304814, which is a phosphate prodrug of a 3C-like (3CL) protease inhibitor, PF-00835231.
Despite our significant investments and efforts, any of our ongoing development programs related to COVID-19 may not be success
ful as the risk of failure is significant, andthere can be no certainty these efforts will yield a successful product or that costs
 will ultimately be recouped.Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business and Operations
The following discussion summarizes our current views of key business and operational areas impacted by the pandemic and its effects on our business, operations, and
financial condition and results. As part of our on-going monitoring and assessment, we have made certain assumptions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic for purposes of our
operational planning and financial projections, including assumptions regarding the duration, severity and the global macroeconomic impact of the pandemic, as well as
COVID-19 vaccine supply and contracts, which remain dynamic. Despite careful tracking and planning, we are unable to accurately predict the extent of the
 impact of thepandemic on our business, operations and financial condition and results due to the uncertainty of future developments. 
In particular, we believe the ultimate impact on ourbusiness, operations and financial condition and results will be affected by the speed and extent of
 the continued spread of the coronavirus globally; the emergence ofadditional virus variants; the duration of the pandemic; new information regarding the severity and incidence of COVID-19; the safety,
 efficacy and availability of vaccines andtreatments for COVID-19; the rate at which the population becomes vaccinated against CO
VID-19; the global macroeconomic impact of the pandemic and governmental orregulatory actions to contain the virus or control supply of medicines. We are focused on all aspects of our business and are implementing measures aimed at mitigating issues
where possible, including by using digital technology to assist in operations for our commercial, manufacturing, R&D and enabling functions globally.
Our business and operations have been impacted by the pandemic in various ways. For example:
•
At this time, most of our colleagues who are able to perform their job functions outside of our facilities continue to work remotely, while certain colleagues in the PGS andWRDM organizations continue to work onsite and are subject to strict protocols intended to reduce the risk of transmission.
•
While engagement with healthcare professionals has started to return to pre-pandemic levels due to our virtual engagement capabilities, our sales force colleagues continueto encounter mixed access as a result of ongoing restrictions on in-person meetings. We are actively reviewing and assessing epidemiological data and our colleagues
remain ready to resume in-person engagements with healthcare professionals on a location-by-location basis as soon as it is safe to do so. During the pandemic, we have
adapted our promotional platform by amplifying our existing digital capabilities to reach healthcare professionals and customers to provide critical education and information,
including increasing the scale of our remote engagement.
•
We have not seen a significant disruption to our supply chain to date, and all of our manufacturing sites globally have continued to operate at or near normal levels.•
After a brief pause to the recruitment portion of certain ongoing clinical studies and a delay to most new study starts, we restarted recruitment across the developmentportfolio (including new study starts) in late-April 2020.
•
Our portfolio of products experienced varying impacts from the pandemic. Some of our products are medically necessary but also more reliant on maintenance therapy withcontinuing patients in addition to new patients, some of our products are more reliant on new patient starts and
 typically require doctor visits, including wellness visits, andsome of our products are identified as medically necessary for treatment in the pandemic. A large proportion of our portfolio comprises oral or self-injected medicines that do
not require a visit to an infusion center or a physician’s office for administration, but vaccines and physician-administered medicines, which do require office visits, were
impacted in 2020 by COVID-19-related mobility restrictions or limitations and decline in patient visits to doctors. In addition, certain of our vaccines such as Prevnar
13/Prevenar 13 may be impacted by recommendations by certain health officials to not co-administer such vaccines alongside the COVID-19 vaccines. For additional detail
on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our products, see the 
Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income—Revenues—Selected Product Discussio n section within MD&A.
Pfizer Inc.
2020 Form 10-K 27 
Notwithstanding the foregoing impact of the pandemic, given our significant operating cash flows, as well as our financial assets, access to capital markets and revolving creditagreements, we believe we have, and expect to maintain, the ability to meet liquidity needs for the 
foreseeable future. We will continue to pursue efforts to maintain thecontinuity of our operations while monitoring for new developments related to the pandemic. Future developments could result in additional favorable or unfavorable impacts on
our business, operations or financial condition and results. If we experience significant disruption in our manufacturing or supply chains or significant disruptions in clinical trials
or other operations, or if demand for our products is significantly reduced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we could experience a material adverse impact on our
business, operations and financial condition and results. See the
 Item 1A. Risk Factors—COVID-19 Pandemic  section of this Form 10-K. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
Following is a discussion about the critical accounting estimates and assumptions impacting our consolidated financial statements. Also, see 
Note 1C . For a description of our significant accounting policies, see 
Note 1 . Of these policies, the following are considered critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as they require the application of the most subjective and the most
 complex judgments: Acquisitions (Note 1D ); Fair Value ( Note 1E ); Revenues ( Note 1G ); Asset Impairments (
Note 1L ); Tax Assets and Liabilities and  Income Tax Contingencies (Note 1P ); Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans ( Note 1Q ); and Legal and Environmental Contingencies (
Note 1R ). Acquisitions and Fair Value
For discussions about the application of fair value, see the following: recent acquisitions (
Note 2A ); investments ( Note 7A) ;  benefit plan assets (Note 11D ); and Asset Impairments
 below. Revenues
Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the
 revenues are recognized. Suchvariable consideration represents chargebacks, rebates, sales allowances and sales returns. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such,
knowledge and judgment are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period.
Historically, adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual results or updated expectations, have no
t been material to our overall business and generally have been less than1% of revenues. Product-specific rebates, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product revenue growth trends. If any of our ratios, 
factors,assessments, experiences or judgments are not indicative or accurate estimates of our future experience, our results could be materially affected. The poten
tial of ourestimates to vary (sensitivity) differs by program, product, type of customer and geographic location. However, estimates associated with U.S. Medicare, Medicaid and
performance-based contract rebates are most at risk for material adjustment because of the extensive time delay between the recording of the
 accrual and its ultimatesettlement, an interval that can generally range up to one year. Because of
 this lag, our recording of adjustments to reflect actual amounts can incorporate revisions of severalprior quarters.
Asset Impairments
We review all of our long-lived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year. We perform impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill at least
annually and for all other long-lived assets whenever impairment indicators are present. When necessary, we record charges for impairments of long-lived assets for the
amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets. Our impairment review processes are described in 
Note 1L. Examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairment include:
•
A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset. For example, a successful challenge of our patent rights wouldlikely result in generic competition earlier than expected.
•
A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used such as a restriction imposed by the FDA or other regulatory authorities that could affect ourability to manufacture or sell a product.
•
An expectation of losses or reduced profits associated with an asset. This could result, for example, from a change in a government reimbursement program that results inan inability to sustain projected product revenues and profitability. This also could result from the introduction of a competitor’s product that impacts projected revenue
growth, as well as the lack of acceptance of a product by patients
, physicians and payers. For IPR&D projects, this could result from, among other things, a change inoutlook based on clinical trial data, a delay in the projected launch date or additional expenditures to commercialize the product.
Identifiable Intangible Assets
We use an income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of intangible assets, o
ther than goodwill. We start with a forecast of allthe expected net cash flows associated with the asset, which incorporates the consideration of
 a terminal value for indefinite-lived assets, and then we apply an asset-specificdiscount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. Some of 
the more significant estimates and assumptions that impact our fair value estimates include: the amount andtiming of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on 
the projections and the impact of technologicaladvancements and risk associated with IPR&D assets, as well as the selection of a long-term growth rate; the
 discount rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent inthe projected cash flows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the
 geographic origin of the projected cash flows.While all intangible assets other than goodwill can face events and circumstances that can lead to impairment, those that are most
 at risk of impairment include IPR&D assets(approximately $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2020) and newly acquired or recently impaired indefinite-lived brand assets. IPR&D assets are high-risk assets, given the
uncertain nature of R&D. Newly acquired and recently impaired indefinite-lived assets are more vulnerable to impairment as the assets are recorded at fair value and are then
subsequently measured at the lower of fair value or

2020 Form 10-K 28 
carrying value at the end of each reporting period. As such, immediately after acquisition or impairment, even small declines in the outlook for these assets can negativelyimpact our ability to recover the carrying value and can result in an impairment charge.
Goodwill
Our goodwill impairment review work as of December 31, 2020 concluded that none of our goodwill was impaired and we do not believe the risk of impairment is significant at
this time.
In our review, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the 
fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Qualitativefactors that we consider include, for example, macroeconomic and industry conditions, overall financial performance and other relevant entity-specific events. If we conclude
that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less 
than its carrying value, we then perform a quantitative fair value test.When we are required to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we mainly use the income approach but may also use the market approach, or a weighted-average
combination of both approaches.
•
The income approach is a forward-looking approach to estimating fair value and relies primarily on internal forecasts. Within the income approach, we use the discountedcash flow method. We start with a forecast of all the expected
 net cash flows for the reporting unit, which includes the application of a terminal value, and then we apply areporting unit-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. Some of the more significant estimates and
 assumptions inherent in this approach include: theamount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of 
technological risk and competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on theprojections, as well as the selection of a long-term growth rate; the discount rate, which seeks to reflect 
the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows; and the taxrate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows.
•
The market approach is a historical approach to estimating fair value and relies primarily on external information. We may use two alternative methods within the marketapproach:
◦
Guideline public company method—this method employs market multiples derived from market prices of stocks of companies that are engaged in the same or similar linesof business and that are actively traded on a free and open market and 
the application of the identified multiples to the corresponding measure of our reporting unit’sfinancial performance.
◦
Guideline transaction method—this method relies on pricing multiples derived from transactions of significant interests in companies engaged in the same or similar linesof business and the application of the identified multiples to the corresponding measure of our reporting unit’s financial performance.
The market approach is only appropriate when the available external information is robust and deemed to be a reliable proxy for the specific reporting unit being valued;
however, these assessments may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: 
theselection of appropriate guideline companies and transactions and the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in ownership
percentages, ownership rights, business ownership forms or marketability between the reporting unit and the guideline companies and transactions.
For all of our reporting units, there are a number of future events and factors tha
t may impact future results and that could potentially have an impact on the outcome ofsubsequent goodwill impairment testing. For a list of these factors, see the 
Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results  and the Item 1A. Risk Factors 
sections in this Form 10-K. Benefit Plans
For a description of our different benefit plans, see
 Note 11 . Effective January 1, 2018, accruals for future benefits under the
 PCPP (our largest U.S. defined benefit plan) and the defined benefit section of the Pfizer Group PensionScheme (our largest pension plan in the U.K.) were frozen and resulted in elimination of future service costs for the plans. The P
fizer defined contribution savings plan providesadditional annual contributions to those previously accruing benefits under the PCPP and active members of the Pfizer Group 
Pension Scheme started accruing benefits underthe defined contribution section of that plan.
Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and our judgment regarding future expectations that have been deemed reasonable by management. The judgments made
in determining the costs of our benefit plans can materially impact our results of operations.
The following provides (i) at the end of each year, the expected annual rate of return on plan asse

Expected Annual Rate of Return on Plan AssetsThe assumptions for the expected annual rate of return on all of our plan assets reflect
 our actual historical return experience and our long-term assessment of forward-lookingreturn expectations by asset classes, which is used to develop a weighted-average expected return based on the implementation of our 
targeted asset allocation in ourrespective plans.
The expected annual rate of return on plan assets for our U.S. plans and
 the majority of our international plans is applied to the fair value of plan assets at each year-end andthe resulting amount is reflected in our net periodic benefit costs in the following year.
The following illustrates the sensitivity of net periodic benefit costs to a 50 basis point decline in our assumption for the expec
ted annual rate of return on plan assets,holding all other assumptions constant (in millions, pre-tax):
Assumption
Change Increase in 2021 Net PeriodicBenefit Costs
Expected annual rate of return on plan assets
50 basis point decline $116 The actual return on plan assets was approximately $2.9 billion during 2020
. Discount Rate Used to Measure Plan Obligations
The weighted-average discount rate used to measure the plan obligations for our U.S. defined benefit plans is determined at least annually and evaluated
 and modified, asrequired, to reflect the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality fixed income investments, rated AA/Aa or be
tter, that reflect the rates at which the pension benefitscould be effectively settled. The discount rate used to measure the plan obligations for our international plans is determined at least
 annually by reference to investment gradecorporate bonds, rated AA/Aa or better, including, when there is sufficient da
ta, a yield-curve approach. These discount rate determinations are made in consideration of localrequirements.
The measurement of the plan obligations at the end of the year will affect 
the amount of service cost, interest cost and amortization expense reflected in our net periodic benefitcosts in the following year.
The following illustrates the sensitivity of net periodic benefit costs and benefit obligations to a 10 basis point decline in our assumption for 
the discount rate, holding allother assumptions constant (in millions, pre-tax):
Assumption

Increase Discount rate
10 basis point decline $2 $483 The change in the discount rates used in measuring our plan obligations as of December 31, 2020 resulted in an increase in the measurement of our aggregate plan
obligations by approximately $1.9 billion.
Anticipated Change in Accounting Policy
We anticipate making a change in our pension accounting policy under which we would begin recognizing actuarial gains and losses immediately in the income statement
compared to our current accounting policy that recognizes such gains and losses in stockholders’ equity and amortizes them as a component of net periodic benefit
cost/(credit) over future periods. This anticipated change is expected to go into effect
 in the first quarter of 2021 and if adopted, will require recasting prior period amounts toconform to the new accounting policy.
Income Tax Assets and Liabilities
Income tax assets and liabilities include income tax valuation allowances and accruals for uncertain tax positions. For additional information, see

Revenue Deductions
Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the
 revenues are recognized. Thesedeductions represent estimates of related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on
 grosssales for a reporting period.
Historically, adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual results or updated expectations, have no
t been material to our overall business and generally have been less than1% of revenues. Product-specific rebates, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product revenue growth trends.
The following presents information about revenue deductions:

increased spending on our Inflammation & Immunology and Rare Disease portfolios due to several Phase 3 programs andinvestment in gene therapy;
•
increased spending related to assets acquired from our acquisition of Array; and•
increased medical spend for new and growing products,partially offset by:
•
decreased spending across the Oncology, Vaccines and Internal Medicine portfolios, as select programs have reached completion;•
the decrease in the value of the portfolio performance share grants reflecting changes in the price of Pfizer’s common stock, as well as management’s assessment of theprobability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved;

•
the increase in amortization of intangible assets from our acquisition of Array.2019 v. 2018
Amortization of intangible assets decreased $274 million, mainly due to:
•
the non-recurrence of amortization as a result of the impairment of sterile injectable products in the fourth quarter of 2018;•
fully amortized assets; and•
the contribution of our Consumer Healthcare business to the Consumer Healthcare JV,partially offset by:
•
the increase in amortization related to assets recorded as a result of the approval of Xtandi in the U.S. for the treatment of nmCRPC in July of 2018; and•
amortization of intangible assets from our acquisition of Array.For additional information, see

r Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity InitiativesTransforming to a More Focused Company Program
For a description of our program, as well as the anticipated and actual costs, see 
Note 3. The program savings discussed below may be rounded and represent approximations. In connection with the costs primarily related to the corporate enabling functions initiatives, we expect gross cost savings of $1.0
 billion, or net cost savings,excluding merit and inflation growth and certain real estate cost increases, of $700 million, to be achieved primarily over the two-year period 2021-2022. In connection with
manufacturing network optimization, including legacy cost reduction initiatives, we expect targeted net cost savings of $300 million to be achieved primarily from 2020 through
2022.

g short-term incentive financial metrics.Adjusted income, and its components and Adjusted diluted EPS, are non-G
AAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore,are limited in their usefulness to investors. Because of their non-standardized definitions, they may not be comparable to the calculation of
 similar measures of othercompanies and are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance. A limitation of these measures is that they provide a
view of our operations without including all events during a period, and do not provide a comparable view of our performance to peers. These measures are not, and should not
be viewed as, substitutes for their directly comparable GAAP measures of
 Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders , components of Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders
 and EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders—diluted , respectively. See the accompanying reconciliations of certain GAAP reported to non-GAAP adjusted information for 2020, 2019 and 2018 below.
We also recognize that, as internal measures of performance, these measures have limitations, and we do not restrict our performance-management process solely to these
measures. We also use other tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance. For example, our R&D organization has productivity targets, upon
 which itseffectiveness is measured. In addition, total shareholder return, both on an absolute basis and relative to
 a publicly traded pharmaceutical index, plays a significant role indetermining payouts under certain of our incentive compensation plans.
Purchase Accounting Adjustments
Adjusted income excludes certain significant purchase accounting impacts resulting from business combinations and net asset acquisitions. These impacts can include the
incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to 
fair value, amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finite-lived intangible assets, and to a much lesser extent, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of the
 acquired fixed assets, amortization related to the increasein fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value changes for contingent consideration. Therefore, the
 Adjusted income measure includes the revenues earned upon the sale ofthe acquired products without considering the acquisition cost of those products.
The exclusion of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our results by providing a degree of parity to
internally developed intangible assets for which R&D costs have been expensed. However, we have not factored in the impacts of any
 other differences that might haveoccurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own, such as different R&D costs, 
timelines or resulting sales; accordingly, this approach does notintend to be representative of the results that would have occurred if we had discovered and developed the
 acquired intangible assets internally.Acquisition-Related Costs
Adjusted income excludes acquisition-related costs, which are comprised of transaction, integration, restructuring charges and additional depreciation costs for business
combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that
 were incurred to restructure and integrate businesses as a result of an acquisition.We have made no adjustments for resulting synergies.
The significant costs incurred in connection with a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets, activities or employees––a natural result of
acquiring a fully integrated set of activities. For this reason, we believe that such costs incurred can be viewed differently in the
 context of an acquisition from those costsincurred in other, more normal, business contexts. The integration and restructuring costs for a business combination may occur over several years, with the more significant
impacts typically ending within three years of the relevant transaction. Because of the need for certain ex
ternal approvals for some actions, the span of time needed to achievecertain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy.
Discontinued Operations
Adjusted income excludes the results of discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the disposal of such operations. We
 believe that this presentation ismeaningful to investors because, while we review our therapeutic areas and product lines for strategic fit with our operations, we do not build or run our business with the intent
to discontinue parts of our business. Restatements due to discontinued operations do not
 impact compensation or change the Adjusted income measure for the compensationin respect of the restated periods, but are presented for consistency across all periods.
Certain Significant Items
Adjusted income excludes certain significant items representing substantive and/or unusual items that are evaluated individually on a quantitative and qualitative basis. Certain
significant items may be highly variable and difficult to predict. Furthermore, in some cases it is reasonably possible that they could reoccur in future periods. For example,
although major non-acquisition-related cost-reduction programs are specific to an event or goal with a defined term, we may have subsequent programs based on
reorganizations of the business, cost productivity or in response to LOE or economic conditions. Legal charges to resolve litigation are also related to specific cases,
 which arefacts and circumstances specific and, in some cases, may also be the result of litigation matters at
 acquired companies that were inestimable, not probable or unresolved at thedate of acquisition. Unusual items represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items tha
t, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occuras part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that would be non-recurring; or items that relate to products we no longer sell. For a non-inclusive list of certain
significant items see

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND MARKET RISKWe rely largely on operating cash flows, short-term investments or commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt to provide for our liquidity requirements. We continue our
efforts to improve cash inflows through working capital efficiencies. We target specific areas of focus including accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable, and o
therworking capital, which allows us to optimize our operating cash flows.
Due to our significant operating cash flows as well as our financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we believe
that we have, and will maintain, the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future, which can include, among others:
•
the working capital requirements of our operations, including our R&D activities;•
investments in our business;•
dividend payments and potential increases in the dividend rate;•
share repurchases;•
the cash requirements for our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives;•
paying down outstanding debt;•
contributions to our pension and postretirement plans; and•
business development activities.Our long-term debt is rated high-quality by both S&P and Moody’s. See the 
Credit Ratings  section below. We have taken, and will continue to take, a conservative approach to our financial investments and monitoring of our liquidity position in response to market changes. Our debt investments consist primarily of high-quality, highly liquid, well-
diversified available-for-sale debt securities.
Debt Capacity—Lines of Credit
We have available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements with a group of banks and other financial intermediaries. We typically maintain cash and cash equivalent
balances and short-term investments which, together with our available revolving credit facilities, are in excess of our commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. See
Note 7C

Note 7 for a description of certain assets held and for a description of credit risk related to our financial instruments held.The increase in working capital was 
primarily driven by the use of Upjohn cash distribution proceeds to pay down short-term commercial paper borrowings. See Note 2B . On November 16, 2020, we received $12.0 billion as partial consideration for the contribution of the Upjohn Business to Viatris (see 
Note 2B ). In November 2020, we used the cash proceeds to pay down commercial paper and redeem, before the maturity date, the $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding of 1.95% senior unsecured notes
that were due in June 2021 and $342 million aggregate principal amount of 5.80% senior unsecured notes that were due in August 2023.

completed a public offering of $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured sustainability notes. The proceeds were initially used to repay outstandingcommercial paper and subsequently will be used to help manage our environmental impact and support increased patient access to our medicines and vaccines, especially
among underserved populations, and strengthen healthcare systems; and
•
repurchased at par all $1.065 billion principal amount outstanding of senior unsecured notes that were due in 2047 before the maturity date.For additional information about these issuances and retirements, see 
Note 7D. For additional information about the sources and uses of our funds, see the

Credit RatingsTwo major corporate debt-rating organizations, Moody’s and S&P, assign ratings to our short-term and long-term debt. A security rating is not
a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and the rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each
rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
The current ratings assigned to our commercial paper and senior unsecured long-term debt:

LIBOR
For information on interest rate risk and LIBOR, see the 
Item 1A. Risk Factors––Global Operations  section in this Form 10-K. We do not expect the transition to  an alternativerate to have a material impact on our liquidity or financial resources.
Gl
obal Economic ConditionsOur Venezuela and Argentina operations function in hyperinflationary economies. The impact to Pfizer is not considered material. For additional information on the global
economic environment, see the 
Item 1A. Risk Factors––Global Operations  section in this Form 10-K. Market Risk
The objective of our financial risk management program is to minimize the impact of foreign exchange rate and interest rate movements on our earnings. We address these
exposures through a combination of operational means and financial instruments. We adapt our practices periodically as economic conditions change. For more information,
see 
Notes 1F and 7E , as well as the Item 1A. Risk Factors—Global Operations section in this Form 10-K for key currencies in which we operate. Foreign Exchange Risk
—We are subject to foreign exchange risk in our commercial operations, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and our net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
On the commercial side, a significant portion of our revenues and earnings is exposed to changes in exchange rates. Where foreign exchange risk is not o
ffset by otherexposures, we may use foreign currency forward-exchange contracts and/or foreign currency swaps to manage that risk.
With respect to our financial assets and liabilities, our primary foreign exchange exposure arises from intercompany receivables and payables, and, to a lesser extent, from
investments and debt denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the business entity.
In addition, under certain market conditions, we may seek to protect against possible declines in the reported net investments o
f our foreign business entities. In these cases,we may use foreign exchange contracts and/or foreign currency debt.
The fair values of our financial instrument holdings are analyzed at year-end to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes. In this analysis, holding all other
assumptions constant and assuming that a change in one currency’s rate relative to the U.S.
 dollar would not have any effect on another currency’s rates relative to the U.S.dollar, if the dollar were to appreciate against all other currencies by 10%, as of December 31, 2020, the expected adverse impact on our ne
t income would not be significant.Interest Rate Risk
—Our interest-bearing investments and borrowings are subject to interest rate risk which may have an impact on net income. Depending on market conditions, we may change the profile of our outstanding debt or investments by entering into derivative financial instruments like interest rate swaps, either to
 hedge or offsetthe exposure to changes in the fair value of hedged items with fixed interest rates,
 or to convert variable rate debt (or investments) to fixed rates.The fair values of our financial instrument holdings are analyzed at year-end to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes. In this analysis, holding all other
assumptions constant and assuming a parallel shift in the interest rate curve for all maturities and for all instruments, if there were a one hundred basis point decrease in
interest rates as of December 31, 2020, the expected adverse impact on our net
 income would not be significant.Equity Price Risk
––We hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values in life science companies as a result of certain business development transactions. While we are holding such securities, we are subject to equity price risk, and this may increase the volatility of our income in future periods due to changes in the 
fair value of equityinvestments. From time to time, we will sell such equity securities based on our business considerations, which may include limiting our price risk.
Our equity securities with readily determinable fair values are analyzed at year-end to determine their sensitivity to equity price rate changes. In this sensitivity analysis, the
expected adverse impact on our net income would not be significant.

Dividends on Common StockIn December 2020, our BOD declared a first-quarter dividend of $0.39 per share, payable on March 5, 2021, to shareholders of record at
 the close of business on January 29,2021. The first-quarter 2021 cash dividend will be our 329th consecutive quarterly dividend.
Our current and projected dividends provide a return to shareholders while maintaining sufficient capital to invest in growing our business. Our dividends are not restricted by
debt covenants. While the dividend level remains a decision of Pfizer’s BOD and will continue to be evaluated in the context
 of future business performance, we currentlybelieve that we can support future annual dividend increases, barring significant unforeseen events. Viatris is expected to begin paying a quarterly dividend in the second

Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements
Accounting for income taxes
 eliminates certain exceptions to the guidance, related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim
period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The new guidance
also simplifies aspects of the accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or
rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax
 basis of goodwill.January 1, 2021.We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.
Reference rate reform
 provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the guidance for contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference
rate expected to be discontinued after 2021 because of reference rate reform.
The new guidance provides the following optional expedients:
1.
Simplify accounting analyses under current U.S. GAAP for contract modifications.2.
Simplify the assessment of hedge effectiveness and allow hedging relationships affected byreference rate reform to continue.
3.
Allow a one-time election to sell or transfer debt securities classified as held to maturity thatreference a rate affected by reference rate reform.
Elections can be adoptedprospectively at any time in the first
quarter of 2020 through December

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARK ET RISKThe information required by this Item is incorporated by reference to the discussion in the 
Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital Resources and Market Risk— Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resources 
section within MD&A. Pfizer Inc.

ITEM 8.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATAReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and 
Shareholders of Pfizer Inc.:Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pfizer Inc. and 
Subsidiary Companies (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the relatedconsolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in 
the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, and the relatednotes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its
 operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control overfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 25, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
 Company’s internal controlover financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and
 are required to be independent with respect to the Company inaccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAO
B. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assuranceabout whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits
 included performing procedures to assessthe risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond 
to those risks. Suchprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or
required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that
 are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2)involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the
consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit
matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Evaluation of the U.S. Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based contract rebates accrual
As discussed in Note 1G to the consolidated financial statements, the
 Company records estimated deductions for Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based contractrebates (collectively, U.S. rebates) as a reduction to gross product revenues. The accrual for U.S. rebates is recorded in the
 same period that the corresponding revenuesare recognized. The length of time between when a sale is made and when the U.S. rebate is paid by
 the Company can be as long as one year, which increases the needfor significant management judgment and knowledge of market conditions and practices in estimating the accrual.
We identified the evaluation of the U.S. rebates accrual as a critical audit matter because 
the evaluation of the product-specific experience ratio assumption involvedespecially challenging auditor judgment. The product-specific experience ratio assumption relates to estimating which of the Company’s revenue transactions will ultimately
be subject to a related rebate.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness o
f certaininternal controls over the Company’s U.S. rebates accrual process related to the development of the product-specific experience ratio assumptions. We estimated the U.
S.rebates accrual using internal information and historical data and compared the result to the Company’s estimated U.S. rebates accrual. We evaluated the Company’s ability
to accurately estimate the accrual for U.S. rebates by comparing historically recorded accruals to the actual amount that was ultimately paid by the
 Company.Evaluation of gross unrecognized tax benefits
As discussed in Notes 5D and 1P, the Company’s tax positions are subject to audit by
 local taxing authorities in each respective tax jurisdiction, and the resolution of suchaudits may span multiple years. Since tax law is complex and often subject to varied interpretations and judgments, it is uncertain whether some of 
the Company’s taxpositions will be sustained upon audit. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding associated interest
, of $5.6 billion.We identified the evaluation of the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter because a high degree of
 audit effort, including specialized skills andknowledge, and complex auditor judgment was required in evaluating the Company’s interpretation of tax law and its estimate of the ultimate resolution of its tax positions.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness o
f an internalcontrol over the Company’s liability for unrecognized tax position process related to (1) interpretation
Pfizer Inc.
2020 Form 10-K 49 
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firmof tax law, (2) evaluation of which of the Company’s tax positions may not be sustained upon audit
, and (3) estimation and recording of the gross unrecognized tax benefits.We involved tax and valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating the Company’s interpretation of tax laws, including the
assessment of transfer pricing practices in accordance with applicable tax laws and regulations. We inspected settlements with applicable taxing authorities, including
assessing the expiration of statutes of limitations. We tested the
 calculation of the liability for uncertain tax positions, including an evaluation of the Company’s assessment ofthe technical merits of tax positions and estimates of the amount of
 tax benefits expected to be sustained.Evaluation of product and other product-related litigation
As discussed in Notes 1R and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the
 Company is involved in product liability and other product-related litigation, which can includepersonal injury, consumer, off-label promotion, securities, antitrust and breach of contract claims, among others. Certain of these pending product and other product-related
legal proceedings could result in losses that could be substantial. The accrued liability and/or disclosure for the pending product and other product-related legal proceedings
requires a complex series of judgments by the Company about future events, which involves a number of uncertainties.
We identified the evaluation of product and other product-related litigation as a critical audit matter. Challenging auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Company’s
judgments about future events and uncertainties.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness o
f certaininternal controls over the Company’s product liability and other product-related litigation processes, including controls related to (1) the evaluation of information from
external and internal legal counsel, (2) forward-looking expectations, and (3) new legal proceedings, or other legal proceedings not currently reserved or disclosed. We read
letters received directly from the Company’s external and internal legal counsel that described the Company’s probable or reasonably possible legal contingency to pending
product and other product-related legal proceedings. We inspected the Company’s minutes from meetings of the Audit Committee, which included the status of
 key litigationmatters. We evaluated the Company’s ability to estimate its monetary exposure to pending product and other product-related legal proceedings by comparing historically
recorded liabilities to actual monetary amounts incurred upon resolution of prior legal matters. We analyzed relevant publicly available information about the Company, its
competitors, and the industry.
 

KPMG LLP
We have not been able to determine the specific year that KPMG
 and our predecessor firms began serving as the Company’s auditor, however, we are aware that KPMG andour predecessor firms have served as the Company’s auditor since at least 1942.

Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
Note 1. Basis of Presentation and Significan
t Accounting PoliciesA. Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our parent company and all subsidiaries and are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP
. The decision ofwhether or not to consolidate an entity for financial reporting purposes requires consideration of majority voting interests, as well as effective economic or other control over the
entity. Typically, we do not seek control by means other than voting interests. For subsidiaries operating outside the U.
S., the financial information is included as of and for theyear ended November 30 for each year presented. Pfizer's fiscal year-end for U.S. subsidiaries is as of and for the year ended December 31 for each
 year presented.Substantially all unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries are free of legal and contractual restrictions. All significant transactions among our subsidiaries have been
eliminated.
On November 16, 2020, we completed the spin-off and the combination of our Upjohn Business with Mylan. Prior to the
 separation of the Upjohn Business, beginning in 2020,the Upjohn Business, Meridian, which is the manufacturer of EpiPen and other auto-injector products, and a pre-existing strategic collaboration between Pfizer and Mylan for
generic drugs in Japan (the Mylan-Japan collaboration) were managed as part of our former Upjohn operating segment. Revenues and expenses associated with Meridian and
the Mylan-Japan collaboration were included in the Upjohn operating segment results along with the results of operations of the Upjohn Business in Pfizer’s historical
consolidated financial statements. Meridian, which remains with Pfizer, supplies EpiPen Auto-Injectors to Viatris under a supply agreement expiring December 31, 2024, with
an option for Viatris to extend for an additional one-year term. On December 21, 2020, which falls in Pfizer’s international 2021 fiscal year, P
fizer and Viatris completed thetermination, under the previously disclosed agreement dated November 13, 2020, of the Mylan-Japan collaboration and we transferred related inventories and operations that
were part of the Mylan-Japan collaboration to Viatris. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, the 
financial results of the Upjohn Business and the Mylan-Japan collaborationare reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The financial results of Meridian are now included in our Hospital therapeutic area for all periods presented.
Upon completion of the spin-off of the Upjohn Business on November 16, 2020, the Upjohn assets
 and liabilities were derecognized from our consolidated balance sheet andare reflected in 
Retained Earnings – Distribution of Upjohn Business in the consolidated statement of equity. The assets and  liabilities associated with the Upjohn Business andthe Mylan-Japan collaboration are classified as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current
year presentation. In addition, other acquisitions and business development activities completed in 2020, 2019 and 2018, including the acquisitions of 
Array and Therachon,and the contribution of our Consumer Healthcare business to the Consumer Healthcare JV, impacted financial results in the periods presented. See 
Note 2. Prior to the separation of the Upjohn Business, we managed our commercial operations through three distinct business segments: (i) our innovative science-based
biopharmaceutical products business (Biopharma); (ii) our global, primarily off-patent branded and generics business (Upjohn); and (iii
) through July 31, 2019, Pfizer’sconsumer healthcare business. With the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019 and the completion of the spin-off
 of our Upjohn Business in the fourth quarter of2020, Pfizer has transformed into a more focused, global leader in science-based innovative medicines and vaccines. We now operate as a single operating segment engaged
in the discovery, development, manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide. Regional commercial organizations market, distribute
and sell our products. Our commercial organization is supported by global platform functions that are responsible for the research, development, manufacturing and supply of
our products. The business is also supported by global corporate enabling functions. Our determination that we operate as a single segment is consistent
 with the financialinformation regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker for purposes of evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets, and
planning and forecasting for future periods. Our chief operating decision maker allocates resources and assesses financial performance on a consolidated basis. Prior-period
information has been restated to reflect our current organizational structure following the separation of the Upjohn Business. For information about product and geographic
revenues, see 
Note 17 . Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements and associated notes may not add due to
 rounding. All percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts.B
. New Accounting Standards Adopted in 2020On January 1, 2020, we adopted the following accounting standards:
Credit Losses on Financial Instruments
––We adopted a new accounting standard for credit losses on financial instruments, which replaces the probable initial recognition threshold for incurred loss estimates under prior guidance with a methodology that reflects expected credit loss estimates. The standard generally impacts financial assets that
have a contractual right to receive cash and are not accounted for at 
fair value through net income, such as accounts receivable and held-to-maturity debt securities. The newguidance requires us to identify, analyze, document and support new methodologies for quantifying expected credit loss estimates for certain financial instruments, using
information such as historical experience, current economic conditions and information, and the use of reasonable and supportable forecasted information. The standard also
amends existing impairment guidance for available-for-sale debt securities to incorporate a credit loss allowance and allows for reversals of credit impairments in the event the
issuer’s credit improves.
We adopted the new accounting standard utilizing the modified retrospective method and, therefore, no adjustments were made to
 prior period financial statements. Thecumulative effect of adopting the standard as an adjustment to
 the opening balance of Retained earnings  was not material. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated statement of income or consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020
, nor on our consolidated balancesheet as of December 31, 2020. For additional information, see 
Note 1G. Goodwill Impairment Testing
––We prospectively adopted the new standard, which eliminates the requirement to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to measure goodwill impairment. Under the new guidance, the goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, and
recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount
Pfizer Inc.
2020 Form 10-K 57 
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. There was no impact to our consolidated financial statements from the
 adoption of this new standard.Implementation Costs in a Cloud Computing Arrangement
––We prospectively adopted the new standard related to customers’ accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is considered a service contract. The new guidance aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs in such arrangements
with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on
our consolidated financial statements.
Collaboration Agreements
––We prospectively adopted the new standard, which provides guidance clarifying the interaction between the accounting for collaborative arrangements and revenue from contracts with customers. There was no impact to our consolidated financial statements from the adoption of 
this new standard.C. Estimates and Assumptions
In preparing these financial statements, we use certain estimates and assumptions that affec
t reported amounts and disclosures. These estimates and assumptions can impactall elements of our financial statements. For example, in the consolidated statements of income, estimates are used when accoun
ting for deductions from revenues,determining the cost of inventory that is sold, allocating cost in the form of depreciation and amortization, and
 estimating restructuring charges and the impact of contingencies,as well as determining provisions for taxes on income. On the consolidated balance sheets, estimates are used in determining the valuation and recoverability of assets, and in
determining the reported amounts of liabilities, all of which also impact the consolidated statements of income. Certain estimates of fair value and amounts recorded in
connection with acquisitions, revenue deductions, impairment reviews, restructuring-associated charges, investments and financial instruments, valuation allowances, pension
and postretirement benefit plans, contingencies, share-based compensation, and other calculations can result from a complex series of judgments about future events
 anduncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions.
Our estimates are often based on complex judgments and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, but
 that can be inherently uncertain and unpredictable. If ourestimates and assumptions are not representative of actual outcomes, our results could be materially impacted. As future events
 and their effects cannot be determined withprecision, our estimates and assumptions may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, or unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to
 changethose estimates and assumptions. We are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause ac
tual results to differ from estimated amounts, such as changes in the healthcareenvironment, competition, litigation, legislation and regulations. We regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions using historical experience and expectations about the
future. We adjust our estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances indicate the need 
for change.D. Acquisitions
Our consolidated financial statements include the operations of acquired businesses after the completion of the acquisitions. We accoun
t for acquired businesses using theacquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair values as of 
theacquisition date and that the fair value of acquired IPR&D be recorded on the balance shee
t. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Any excess of the considerationtransferred over the assigned values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. When we acquire net assets that
 do not constitute a business, as defined in U.S.GAAP, no goodwill is recognized and acquired IPR&D is expensed.
Contingent consideration in a business combination is included as part of the acquisition cost and is recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date
. Fair value is generallyestimated by using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow approach. See 
Note 16D . Any liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved. These changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in 
Other (income)/deductions––net . E. Fair Value
We measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value, either upon initial recognition or for subsequent accounting or reporting. We estimate fair value using an exit price
approach, which requires, among other things, that we determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to 
transfer a liability in an orderly market. Thedetermination of an exit price is considered from the perspective of market participants, considering the highest and best use of non-financial assets and
, for liabilities,assuming that the risk of non-performance will be the same before and after the transfer.
When estimating fair value, depending on the nature and complexity of the asset or liability, we may use one or all of 
the following techniques:•
Income approach, which is based on the present value of a future stream of net cash flows.•
Market approach, which is based on market prices and other information from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.•
Cost approach, which is based on the cost to acquire or construct comparable assets, less an allowance for functional and/or economic obsolescence.Our fair value methodologies depend on the following types of inputs:
•
Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets (Level 1 inputs).•
Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other thanquoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable, or inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means
(Level 2 inputs).
•
Unobservable inputs that reflect estimates and assumptions (Level 3 inputs).Pfizer Inc.
2020 Form 10-K 58 
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
The following inputs and valuation techniques are used to estimate the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities:
•
Available-for-sale debt securities—third-party matrix-pricing model that uses significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data and credit-adjustedyield curves.
•
Equity securities with readily determinable fair values—quoted market prices and observable NAV prices.•
Derivative assets and liabilities—third-party matrix-pricing model that uses inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. Where applicable, these modelsuse market-based observable inputs, including interest rate yield curves to discount future cash flow amounts, and forward and spot prices for currencies. The credit risk
impact to our derivative financial instruments was not significant.
•
Money market funds—observable NAV prices.We periodically review the methodologies, inputs and outputs of third-party pricing services for reasonableness. Our procedures can include, for example, referencing other
third-party pricing models, monitoring key observable inputs (like benchmark interest rates) and selectively performing test-comparisons of values with actual sales of financial
instruments.
F. Foreign Currency Translation
For most of our international operations, local currencies have been determined to be the functional currencies. We translate functional currency assets and liabilities to their
U.S. dollar equivalents at exchange rates in effect as of the
 balance sheet date and income and expense amounts at average exchange rates for the period. The U.S. dollareffects that arise from changing translation rates are recorded in 
Other comprehensive income/(loss) . The effects of converting non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities into the functional currency are recorded in 
Other (income)/deductions––net . For operations in highly inflationary economies, we translate monetary items at rates in effect as of the balance sheet date,
 with translation adjustments recorded in Other (income)/deductions––net , and we translate non-monetary items at historical rates. G
. Revenues and Trade Accounts ReceivableRevenue Recognition
––We record revenues from product sales when there is a transfer of control of the product from us to  the customer. We determine transfer of controlbased on when the product is shipped or delivered and title passes to the customer.
Our Sales Contracts
––Sales on credit are typically under short-term contracts. Collections are based on market payment cycles common in various markets, with shorter cycles in the U.S. Sales
 are adjusted for sales allowances, chargebacks, rebates and sales returns and cash discounts. Sales returns occur due to LOE, product recalls or achanging competitive environment.
Deductions from Revenues
––Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized. Such variable consideration represents chargebacks, rebates, sales allowances and sales returns. These deductions represent estimates of the
related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment is required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period.
Provisions for pharmaceutical sales returns––
Provisions are based on a calculation for each market that incorporates the following, as appropriate: local returns policies and practices; historical returns as a percentage of sales; an understanding of the reasons for past returns;
 estimated shelf life by product; an estimate of the amount of timebetween shipment and return or lag time; and any other factors that could impact the es
timate of future returns, such as LOE, product recalls or a changing competitiveenvironment. Generally, returned products are destroyed, and customers are refunded the sales price in the form of a credit.
We record sales incentives as a reduction of revenues at the time the related revenues are recorded or when the incentive is offered,
 whichever is later. We estimate the costof our sales incentives based on our historical experience with similar incentives programs to predict customer behavior.
The following outlines our common sales arrangements:
•
Customers––Our biopharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers, but we also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and pharmacies. In the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines products directly to the federal government, CDC, wholesalers, individual provider offices, retail pharmacies, and
integrated delivery networks. Outside the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines to government and non-government institutions. Customers for our consumer healthcare
business, which were part of the business that was combined with GSK’s Consumer Healthcare business included retailers and, to a lesser extent, wholesalers and
distributors.
Biopharmaceutical products that ultimately are used by patients are generally covered under governmental programs, managed care programs and insurance programs,
including those managed through PBMs, and are subject to sales allowances and/or rebates payable directly to those programs. Those sales allowances and rebates are
generally negotiated, but government programs may have legislated amounts by type of product (e.g., patented
 or unpatented).Specifically:
•
In the U.S., we sell our products principally to distributors and hospitals. We also have contracts with managed care programs or PBMs and legislatively mandated contractswith the federal and state governments under which we provide rebates based on medicines utilized by the lives they cover. We record provisions for Medicare, Medicaid,
and performance-based contract pharmaceutical rebates based upon our experience ratio of rebates paid and actual prescriptions written during prior periods. We apply the
experience ratio to the respective period’s sales to determine the rebate accrual and related expense. This experience ratio is evaluated regularly to ensure that the historical
trends are as current as practicable. We estimate discounts on branded prescription drug sales to Medicare Part D participants in the Medicare “coverage gap,” also known
as the “doughnut hole,” based on the historical experience of beneficiary prescriptions and consideration of the utilization that is expected to
 result from the discount in thecoverage gap. We evaluate this estimate regularly to ensure that the historical trends and future expecta
tions are as current as practicable. For performance-based contractrebates, we also consider current contract terms, such as changes in formulary status and rebate rates.
•
Outside the U.S., the majority of our pharmaceutical sales allowances are contractual or legislatively mandated and our estimates are based on actual invoiced sales withineach period, which reduces the risk of variations in the estimation process. In certain European countries,
Pfizer Inc.
2020 Form 10-K 59 
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
rebates are calculated on the government’s total unbudgeted pharmaceutical spending or on specific product sales thresholds and we apply an estimated allocation factor
against our actual invoiced sales to project the expected level of reimbursement. We obtain third-party information that helps us to monitor the adequacy
 of these accruals.•
Provisions for pharmaceutical chargebacks (primarily reimbursements to U.S. wholesalers for honoring contracted prices to third parties) closely approximate actual amountsincurred, as we settle these deductions generally within two to five weeks of incurring the liability.
We recorded direct product sales and/or alliance revenues of more than $1 billion for each of seven products in 2020, for each of six products
 in 2019 and for each of sevenproducts in 2018. In the aggregate, these direct products sales and/or alliance product revenues represent 53% o
f our revenues in 2020, 49% of our revenues in 2019 and47%
 of our revenues in 2018. See Note 17B for additional information. The loss or expiration of intellectual property rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues as our contracts with customers will generally be at lower selling prices due to added competition and we generally provide for higher sales returns during the period
in which individual markets begin to near the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights.
Our accruals for Medicare, Medicaid and related state program and performance-based contract rebates, chargebacks, sales allowances and sales returns and cash
discounts are as follows:

$ 4,712  $4,098 Taxes collected from customers relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from 
Revenues . Trade Accounts Receivable
—Trade accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance for credit losses reflects our best estimate of expected credit losses of the receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, current information, and forecasts of future economic conditions. In developing the
 estimatefor expected credit losses, trade accounts receivables are segmented into pools of assets depending on market (U.S.
 versus international), delinquency status, and customertype (high risk versus low risk and government versus non-government), and fixed reserve percentages are established for each pool of trade accounts receivables.
In determining the reserve percentages for each pool of trade accounts receivables, we considered our historical experience with certain customers and customer types,
regulatory and legal environments, country and political risk, and other relevant current and future forecasted macroeconomic factors. These credit risk indicators are monitored
on a quarterly basis to determine whether there have been any changes in the economic environment that would indicate the established reserve percentages should be
adjusted, and are considered on a regional basis to reflect more geographic-specific metrics. Additionally, write-offs and recoveries of customer receivables are tracked against
collections on a quarterly basis to determine whether the reserve percentages remain appropriate. When management becomes aware of certain customer-specific factors that
impact credit risk, specific allowances for these known troubled accounts are recorded. Trade accounts receivable are written off after all reasonable means to collect the full
amount (including litigation, where appropriate) have been exhausted.
During 2020, additions to the allowance for credit losses, write-offs and recoveries of customer receivables were not material to our consolidated financial statements.
H. Collaborative Arrangements
Payments to and from our collaboration partners are presented in our consolidated statements of income based on the nature o
f the arrangement (including its contractualterms), the nature of the payments and applicable accounting guidance. Under co-promotion agreements, we record the amounts received for our share of gross profits from
our collaboration partners as alliance revenues, a component of 
Revenues,  when our collaboration partners are the principal in the transaction and we receive a share of their net sales or profits. Alliance revenues are recorded as we perform co-promotion activities for the collaboration and the collaboration partners sell the products to their
customers. The related expenses for selling and marketing these products including reimbursements to or from our collaboration partners for these costs are included in
Selling, informational and administrative expenses.
 In collaborative arrangements where we manufacture a product for our collaboration partners, we record revenues when we transfer control of the product to our collaboration partners. In collaboration arrangements where we are the principal in the transaction, we record amounts paid to
collaboration partners for their share of net sales or profits earned, and all royalty payments to collaboration partners as 
Cost of sales . Royalty payments received from collaboration partners are included in 
Other (income)/deductions—net. Reimbursements to or from our collaboration partners for development costs are recorded in 
Research and development expenses . Upfront payments and pre-approval milestone payments due from us to our collaboration partners in development stage collaborations are recorded as 
Research and development expenses . Milestone payments due from us to our collaboration partners after regulatory approval has been attained for a medicine are recorded in 
Identifiable intangible assets—Developed technology rights
. Upfront and pre-approval milestone payments earned from our collaboration partners by us are recognized in Other (income)/deductions—net  over the development period for the products, when our performance obligations include providing R&D services to our collaboration partners. Upfront, pre-approval and post-approval milestone
payments earned by us may be recognized in 
Other (income)/deductions—net  immediately when earned or over other periods depending upon the nature of our performance obligations in the applicable collaboration. Where the milestone event is regulatory approval for a medicine, we generally recognize milestone payments due to us in the
transaction price when regulatory approval in the applicable jurisdiction has been attained. We may recognize milestone payments due to us in the transaction price earlier
than the milestone event in certain circumstances when recognition of the income would not be probable of a significant reversal.

I. Cost of Sales and Inventories
Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of finished goods, work in process and raw materials is determined using average actual cost. We
regularly review our inventories for impairment and reserves are established when necessary.
J. Selling, Informational and Administrative Expenses
Selling, informational and administrative costs are expensed as incurred. Among other things, these expenses include the internal and external costs of marketing, advertising,
shipping and handling, information technology and legal defense. Advertising expenses totaled approximately $1.8 billion in 2020, $2.4 billion in 2019 and $2.7 billion in 2018.
Production costs are expensed as incurred and the costs of TV, radio, and
 other electronic media and publications are expensed when the related advertising occurs.K. Research and Development Expenses
R&D costs are expensed as incurred. These expenses include the costs of our proprietary R&D efforts, as well as costs
 incurred in connection with certain licensingarrangements. Before a compound receives regulatory approval, we record upfront and milestone payments we make to third parties under licensing arrangements as
expense. Upfront payments are recorded when incurred, and milestone payments are recorded when the specific milestone has been achieved. Once a compound receives
regulatory approval, we record any milestone payments in 
Identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization  and, unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite life, we amortize the payments on a straight-line basis over the remaining agreement term or the expected product life cycle, whichever is shorter.
L. Amortization of Intangible Assets, Depreciation and Certain Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets include:
•
Property, plant and equipment, less accumulated depreciation—These assets are recorded at cost, including any significant improvements after purchase, less accumulateddepreciation. Property, plant and equipment assets, other than land and construction in progress, are depreciated on a
 straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of theindividual assets. Depreciation begins when the asset is ready for its intended use. For tax purposes, accelerated depreciation methods are used as allowed by tax laws.
•
Identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization—These assets are recorded at fair value at acquisition. Intangible assets with finite lives  are amortized on astraight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized until a useful life can be determined.
•
Goodwill—Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred for an acquired business over the assigned values of its net assets . Goodwill is not amortized.Amortization of finite-lived acquired intangible assets that contribute to our ability to sell, manufacture, research, market and distribute products, compounds and intellectual
property is included in 
Amortization of intangible assets  as these intangible assets benefit multiple business functions. Amortization of intangible assets that  are for a singlefunction and depreciation of property, plant and equipment are included in 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses  and/or Research and development expenses,
 as appropriate. We review our long-lived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year. We perform impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill at least
annually and for all other long-lived assets whenever impairment indicators are present. When necessary, we record impairments of long-lived assets for the amount by which
the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets.
Specifically:
•
For finite-lived intangible assets, such as developed technology rights, and for other long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, whenever impairmentindicators are present, we calculate the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows for the asset
, or asset group, and compare this estimated amount to the carryingamount. If the carrying amount is greater, we record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over fair value. In
 addition, in all cases of an impairment review, wereevaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them, as appropriate.
•
For indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as Brands and IPR&D assets, when necessary, we determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment loss, if any, forthe excess of book value over fair value. In addition, in all cases of an impairment review other than for I
PR&D assets, we re-evaluate whether continuing to characterize theasset as indefinite-lived is appropriate.
•
For goodwill, when necessary, we determine the fair value of each reporting unit and record an impairment loss, if any, for the excess of the book value of the reporting unitover the implied fair value.
M.
 Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity InitiativesWe may incur restructuring charges in connection with acquisitions when we implement plans to restructure and integrate the acquired operations or in connection with our
cost-reduction and productivity initiatives.
•
In connection with acquisition activity, we typically incur costs associated with executing the transactions, integrating the acquired operations (which may includeexpenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes), and restructuring the combined company (which may include charges related to employees,
assets and activities that will not continue in the combined company); and
•
In connection with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives, we typically incur costs and charges for site closings and other facility rationalization actions, workforcereductions and the expansion of shared services, including the development of global systems.
Included in 
Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs  are all restructuring charges, as well as certain other costs associated with acquiring and integrating an acquired business. If the restructuring action results in a change in the estimated useful life of an
 asset, that incremental impact is classified in Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses

expenses
, as appropriate. Employee termination costs are generally recorded when the actions are probable and estimable and include accrued severance benefits, pension and postretirement benefits, many of which may be paid out during periods after termination.
 Transaction costs, such as banking, legal, accounting and other similar costsincurred in connection with a business acquisition are expensed as incurred
. Our business and platform functions may be impacted by these actions, including sales and marketing, manufacturing and R&D, as well as our corporate enabling functions
(such as digital, global real estate operations, legal, finance, human resources, worldwide public affairs, compliance and worldwide procurement).
N. Cash Equivalents and Statement of Cash Flows
Cash equivalents include items almost as liquid as cash, such as certificates of deposit and time deposits with maturity periods of three months or less when purchased. 
Ifitems meeting this definition are part of a larger investment pool, we classify them as 
Short-term investments . Cash flows for financial instruments designated as fair value or cash flow hedges may be included in operating, investing or financing activities, depending on the classification
of the items being hedged. Cash flows for financial instruments designated as net investment hedges are classified according to the
 nature of the hedge instrument. Cash flowsfor financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are classified according to their purpose and accounting na
ture.O. Investments and Derivative Financial Instruments
The classification of an investment depends on the nature of the investment
, our intent and ability to hold the investment, and the degree to which we may exercise influence.Our investments are primarily comprised of the following:
•
Public equity securities with readily determinable fair values, which are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in Other (income)/deductions—net. •
Available-for-sale debt securities, which are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in Other comprehensive income/(loss) until realized. •
Held-to-maturity debt securities, which are carried at amortized cost.•
Private equity securities without readily determinable fair values and where we have no significant influence are measured at cost minus any impairment and plus or minuschanges resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.
•
For equity investments in common stock or in-substance common stock where we have significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, we usethe equity-method of accounting. Under the equity-method, we record our share of the investee’s income and expenses in 
Other (income)/deductions—net . The excess of the cost of the investment over our share of the underlying equity in the
 net assets of the investee as of the acquisition date is allocated to the identifiable assets andliabilities of the investee, with any remaining excess amount allocated to goodwill. Such investments are initially recorded at cost, which is the fair value of consideration paid
and typically does not include contingent consideration.
Realized gains or losses on sales of investments are determined by using the specific identification cost method.
We regularly evaluate all of our financial assets for impairment. For investments in debt and equity, when a decline in fair value, if any, is determined, an impairment charge is
recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value in various balance sheet categories (see 
Note 7A ), with changes in fair value reported in Net income  or, for derivative financial instruments in certain qualifying hedging relationships, in 
Other comprehensive income/(loss) (see Note 7E ). P
. Tax Assets and Liabilities and Income Tax ContingenciesTax Assets and Liabilities
Current tax assets
 primarily includes (i) tax effects for intercompany transfers of inventory within our combined group, which are recognized in the consolidated statements of income when the inventory is sold to a third party and (ii) income tax receivables that are expected to be recovered either via refunds from taxing authorities or reductions to
future tax obligations.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between 
the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilitiesusing enacted tax rates and laws. We provide a valuation allowance when we believe that our deferred tax assets are not recoverable based on an
 assessment of estimatedfuture taxable income that incorporates ongoing, prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies, that would be implemented, if necessary, to
 realize the deferred tax assets.Amounts recorded for valuation allowances requires judgments about future income which can depend heavily on estimates and assumptions. All deferred tax assets and
liabilities within the same tax jurisdiction are presented as a net amount in the noncurrent section of our consolidated balance sheet.
Other non-current tax assets primarily represent our estimate of the potential tax benefits in one tax jurisdiction that could result 
from the payment of income taxes in anothertax jurisdiction. These potential benefits generally result from cooperative efforts among taxing authorities, as required by tax treaties to minimize double taxation, commonly
referred to as the competent authority process. The recoverability of these assets, which we believe to be
 more likely than not, is dependent upon the actual payment of taxesin one tax jurisdiction and, in some cases, the successful petition for recovery in another tax jurisdiction.
Pfizer Inc.
2020 Form 10-K 62 
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
Other taxes payable
 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 include liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the noncurrent portion of the repatriation tax liability for which we elected payment over eight years through 2026. For additional information, see 
Note 5D  for uncertain tax positions and Note 5A  for the repatriation tax liability and other estimates and assumptions in connection with the TCJA.
Income Tax Contingencies
We account for income tax contingencies using a benefit recognition model. If we consider that a 
tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, based solely onthe technical merits of the position, we recognize all or a portion of the benefit. We measure the
 benefit by determining the amount that is greater than 50% likely of beingrealized upon settlement, presuming that the tax position is examined by the taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information.
We regularly monitor our position and subsequently recognize the unrecognized tax benefit: (i) if there are changes in tax law, analogous case law or there is new information
that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to “more likely than not”; (ii) if the statute o
f limitations expires; or (iii) if there is acompletion of an audit resulting in a favorable settlement of that tax year with the
 appropriate agency. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions are classified as current only whenwe expect to pay cash within the next 12 months. In
terest and penalties, if any, are recorded in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income  and are classified on our consolidated balance sheet with the related tax liability.
Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but
 our estimates of unrecognized tax benefits and potentialtax benefits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and variation from such es
timates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or whenthe statutes of limitations expire, as we treat these events as
 discrete items in the period of resolution.Q. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans
The majority of our employees worldwide are covered by defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we have
 both IRC-qualified andsupplemental (non-qualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans, as well as other postretirement benefit plans consisting primarily of medical insurance for
retirees and their eligible dependents. We recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of each of our defined bene
fit plans as an asset or liability. The obligations aregenerally measured at the actuarial present value of all benefits attributable to employee service rendered, as provided by the applicable benefit formula. Our pension and
other postretirement obligations may be determined using assumptions such as discount rate, expected annual rate of return on plan assets,
 expected employee turnover andparticipant mortality. For our pension plans, the obligation may also include assumptions as to future compensation levels. For our other postretirement benefit plans, the
obligation may include assumptions as to the expected cost of providing medical insurance benefits, as well as the extent to
 which those costs are shared with the employee orothers (such as governmental programs). Plan assets are measured at fair value. Net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs other than the service costs
 arerecognized in 
Other (income)/deductions—net . R. Legal and Environmental Contingencies
We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, such as patent litigation, product liability and other
product-related litigation, commercial litigation, environmental claims and proceedings, government investigations and guarantees and indemnifications. We record accruals for
these contingencies to the extent that we conclude tha
t a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. If some amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimatethan any other amount within the range, we accrue that amount. Alternatively, when no
 amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount,we accrue the lowest amount in the range. We record anticipated recoveries under existing insurance contracts when recovery is assured.
S. Share-Based Payments
Our compensation programs can include share-based payments. Generally, grants under share-based payment programs are accounted for at fair value and these fair values
are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting terms with the related costs recorded in 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or 
Research and development expenses , as appropriate. Note 2. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Equi
ty-Method Investments, Licensing Arrangements and Collaborative ArrangementsA. Acquisitions
Array
On July 30, 2019, we acquired Array, a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of targeted small
molecule medicines to treat cancer and other diseases of high unmet need, for $48 per share in cash. The to
tal fair value of the consideration transferred was $11.2 billion($10.9 billion, net of cash acquired). In addition, $157 million in payments to Array employees for the fair value of previously unvested stock options was recognized as pos
t-closing compensation expense and recorded in 
Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs (see Note 3 ). We financed the majority of the transaction with debt and the balance with existing cash.
Array’s portfolio includes Braftovi (encorafenib) and Mektovi (binimetinib), a broad pipeline of targeted cancer medicines in different stages of R&D, as well as a portfolio of out-
licensed medicines, which may generate milestones and royalties over time.
The final allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed was completed in 2020. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded:
(i) $6.3 billion in 
Identifiable intangible assets , consisting of $2.0 billion of Developed technology rights  with Pfizer Inc.
2020 Form 10-K 63 
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
a useful life of 16 years
,  $2.8 billion of IPR&D and $1.5 billion of Licensing agreements ($1.2 billion for technology in development –– indefinite-lived licensing agreements and$360 million for developed technology
–– finite-lived licensing agreements with a useful life of 10 years), (ii) $6.1 billion of Goodwill , (iii) $1.1 billion of net deferred tax liabilities and (iv) $451 million of assumed long-term debt, which was paid in full in 2019.
In 2020, we recorded measurement period adjustments to the estimated fair values initially recorded in 2019, which resulted in a reduction in 
Identifiable intangible assets  of approximately $900 million with a corresponding change to 
Goodwill and net deferred tax liabilities. The measurement period adjustments were recorded to better reflect market participant assumptions about facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date and did not
 have a material impact on our consolidated statement of incomefor the year ended December 31, 2020.
Therachon
On July 1, 2019, we acquired all the remaining shares of Therachon, a privately-held clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on rare diseases, with assets in
development for the treatment of achondroplasia, a genetic condition and the most common form of short-limb dwarfism, for $340 million upfront, plus potential milestone
payments of up to $470 million contingent on the achievement of key milestones in the development and commercialization of the lead asset
. In 2018, we acquiredapproximately 3% of Therachon’s outstanding shares for 
$5 million. We accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since the lead asset represented substan
tially all the fair value of the gross assets acquired. The total fairvalue of the consideration transferred for Therachon was $322 million, which consisted of $317 million of cash and our previous $5 million investment in Therachon. In
connection with this asset acquisition, we recorded a charge of $337 million in 
Research and development expenses. B
. DivestituresUpjohn Separation and Combination with Mylan
On November 16, 2020, we completed the spin-off and the combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan (the Transactions) to
 form Viatris. The Transactions were structuredas an all-stock, Reverse Morris Trust transaction. Specifically, (i) we contributed the Upjohn Business to a wholly owned subsidiary, which was renamed Viatris, so that the
Upjohn Business was separated from the remainder of our business (the Separation), (ii) following the Separation, we distributed, on a pro rata basis, all of the shares of 
Viatriscommon stock held by Pfizer to Pfizer stockholders as of the November 13, 2020 record date,
 such that each Pfizer stockholder as of the record date received approximately0.124079 shares of Viatris common stock per share of Pfizer common stock (the Distribution); and (iii) immediately after the Distribution, the Upjohn Business combined with
Mylan in a series of transactions in which Mylan shareholders received one share of Viatris common stock for each Mylan ordinary share held by such shareholder, subject to
any applicable withholding taxes (the Combination). Prior to the Distribution, Viatris made a cash payment to Pfizer equal to $12.0 billion as partial consideration for the
contribution of the Upjohn Business to Viatris. As of the closing of
 the Combination, Pfizer stockholders owned approximately 57% of the outstanding shares of Viatris commonstock, and Mylan shareholders owned approximately 43% of the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock, in each case on a
 fully diluted, as-converted and as-exercisedbasis. The Transactions are generally expected to be tax free to Pfizer and P
fizer stockholders for U.S. tax purposes. Beginning November 16, 2020, Viatris operates both theUpjohn Business and Mylan as an independent publicly traded company, which is traded under the symbol “VTRS” on the NASDAQ.
In connection with the Transactions, in June 2020, Upjohn Inc. and Upjohn Finance B.
V. completed privately placed debt offerings of $7.45 billion and €3.60 billion aggregateprincipal amounts, respectively, (approximately $11.4 billion) of senior unsecured notes and entered into other financing arrangements, including a $600 million delayed draw
term loan agreement and a revolving credit facility agreement for up to $4.0 billion. Proceeds from the debt offerings and other financing arrangements were used to 
fund the$12.0 billion cash distribution Viatris made to Pfizer prior to the Distribution. We used the cash distribution proceeds to pay down commercial paper borrowings and redeem the
$1.15 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 1.95% senior unsecured notes that were due in June 2021 and $342 million aggregate principal amount outstanding
of our 5.80% senior unsecured notes that were due in August 2023, be
fore the maturity date. Interest expense for the $11.4 billion in debt securities incurred during 2020 isincluded in 
Income from discontinued operations––net of tax . Following the Separation and Combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan, we are no longer the obligor or guarantor of any Upjohn debt or Upjohn financing arrangements.
As a result of the separation of Upjohn, we incurred separation-related costs of $434 million in 2020 and $83 million in 2019, which are included in 
Income from discontinued operations––net of tax
. These costs primarily relate to professional fees for regulatory filings and separation activities within finance, tax, legal and information system functions as well as investment banking fees.
In connection with the Transactions, Pfizer and Viatris entered into various agreements to effec
t the Separation and Combination to provide a framework for our relationshipafter the Combination, including a separation and distribution agreement, manufacturing and supply agreements (MSAs), transition service agreements (TSAs), a tax matters
agreement, and an employee matters agreement, among others. Under the MSAs, Pfizer or Viatris, as 
the case may be, manufactures, labels, and packages products for theother party. The terms of the MSAs range in initial duration from 4 to 7 years post-Separation.
 The TSAs primarily involve Pfizer providing services to Viatris related to finance,information technology and human resource infrastructure and are generally expected to be for terms of no more than 3 years post-Separation. In
 addition, we are also party tovarious commercial agreements with Viatris. The amounts billed for net manufacturing supply and transition services provided under the above agreements as well as sales to
and purchases from Viatris are not material to our results of continuing operations in 2020.
Included in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 are net amounts due from Viatris primarily related to various interim agency operating models and
transitional services, partially offset by net amounts due to Viatris for unsettled intercompany balances as of 
the closing date of the spin-off, transaction-related indemnificationsand a contractual cash payment pursuant to terms of the separation and distribution agreement, 
totaling approximately $401 million. The interim agency operating modelprimarily includes billings, collections and remittance of rebates that we are performing on a transitional basis on behalf of Viatris.
The operating results of the Upjohn Business are reported as 
Income from discontinued operations––net of tax  through November 16, 2020, the date of the spin-off and combination with Mylan. In addition, as of December 31, 2019, the assets and liabilities associated with this business are classified as assets and liabilities of discontinued
operations. Prior-period financial information has been restated, as appropriate.

In April 2018, Pfizer and Allogene announced that the two companies entered into a
 contribution agreement for Pfizer’s portfolio of assets related to allogeneic CAR T therapy,an investigational immune cell therapy approach to treating cancer. Under this agreement, we received an equity investment in Allogene and Allogene received our rights to
pre-clinical and clinical CAR T assets, all of which were previously licensed to us from French cell therapy company, Cellectis, beginning in 2014 and French pharmaceutical
company, Servier, beginning in 2015. Allogene assumed responsibility for all potential financial obligations to both Cellectis and Servier. In connection with the Allogene
transaction, we recognized a non-cash $50 million pre-tax gain in 
Other (income)/deductions––net in the second quarter of 2018 ,  representing the difference between the $127million fair value of the equity investment received and the book value of assets transferred (including an allocation of goodwill) (see

Sale of Phase 2b Ready AMPA Receptor Potentiator for CI
AS to BiogenIn April 2018, we sold our Phase 2b ready AMPA receptor potentiator for CIA
S to Biogen. We received $75 million upfront which was recognized in Other (income)/deductions––net 
(see  Note 4) and may receive up to $515 million in total development and commercialization milestones, as well as tiered royalties in the low-to-mid- teen percentages.
Divestiture of Neuroscience Assets
In September 2018, we and Bain Capital entered into a transaction to create a
 new biopharmaceutical company, Cerevel (formerly known as Cerevel Therapeutics, LLC), tocontinue development of a portfolio of clinical and preclinical stage neuroscience assets primarily targeting disorders of the central nervous system including Parkinson’s
disease, epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia and addiction. In connection with this transaction, we out-licensed the portfolio to Cerevel in exchange for a 25%
ownership stake in Cerevel’s parent company, Cerevel Therapeutics, Inc., and potential future regulatory and commercial milestone payments and royalties. In connection with
the transaction, we recognized a non-cash $343 million pre-tax gain in 
Other (income)/deductions––net in the third quarter of 2018, representing the fair value of the equity investment received as the assets transferred
 had a book value of $0 (see Note 4 ). On October 27, 2020, Cerevel Therapeutics, Inc. completed a merger with ARYA SciencesAcquisition Corp II, a publicly-traded special purpose acquisition corporation, and a concurrent private investment in public equity “PIPE” transaction to form Cerevel
Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. Our existing shares in Cerevel Therapeutics, Inc. converted into common shares of Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. as part of the
 mergertransaction, and we purchased an additional $12 million in common shares as part of the PIPE transaction. The common shares of
 Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. tradepublicly on the NASDAQ stock market (ticker symbol CERE). As of December 31, 2020, we continue to
 hold a 21.5% equity stake in Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. forwhich we have elected the fair value option and which we measure at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. In the fourth quarter o

Formation of Consumer Healthcare JV
On July 31, 2019, we completed a transaction in which we and GSK combined our respective consumer healthcare businesses into a new JV
 that operates globally underthe GSK Consumer Healthcare name. In exchange, we received a 32% equity stake in the
 new company and GSK owns the remaining 68%. Upon closing, wedeconsolidated our Consumer Healthcare business and recognized a pre-tax gain of $8.1 billion ($5.4 billion, net of tax) in the third quarter of 2019 in 
(Gain) on completion of Consumer Healthcare JV transaction
 for the difference in the fair value of our 32% equity stake and  the carrying value of our Consumer Healthcare business. Our financialresults and our Consumer Healthcare segment’s operating results for
 2019 reflect seven months of Consumer Healthcare segment domestic operations and eight months of Consumer Healthcare segment international operations.
 The financial results for 2020 do not reflect any contribution from the Consumer Healthcare business. In valuing our investment in the Consumer Healthcare JV, we used discounted cash flow techniques. Some of the
 more significant estimates and assumptions inherent inthis approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which include the expected
 impact of competitive, legal or regulatory forces on the products;the long-term growth rate, which seeks to project the sustainable growth rate over the long term; the discount rate
, which seeks to reflect our best estimate of the variousrisks inherent in the projected cash flows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of 
the projected cash flows.We are accounting for our interest in the Consumer Healthcare JV as an equity-method investment. The carrying value of our investment in the Consumer Healthcare JV is
$16.7 billion as of December 31, 2020 and $17.0 billion as of December 31, 2019 and is reported as a private equity investment in 
Equity-method investments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Consumer Healthcare JV is a foreign investee whose reporting currency is the U.K. pound, and therefore we 
translate its financialstatements into U.S. dollars and recognize the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments in the carrying value of our investment and in o
ther comprehensive income.The decrease in the value of our investment from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 is primarily due to dividends of $932 million, which were received from the
Consumer Healthcare JV in June, September and November 2020, largely offset by our share of the JV’s earnings of $417 million and $345 million in pre-tax foreign
currency translation adjustments (see 
Note 6 ). We record our share of earnings from the Consumer Healthcare JV on a quarterly basis on a one-quarter lag in Other (income)/deductions––net
 commencing from August 1, 2019. Our total share of the J V’s earnings generated in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first nine months of 2020,which we recorded in our operating results in 2020, was $417 million. Our total share of two months of the JV’s earnings generated in the third quarter of
 2019, which werecorded in our operating results in the fourth quarter of 2019, was $47 million. As of the July 31, 2019
 closing date, we estimated that the fair value of our investment in theConsumer Healthcare JV was $15.7 billion and that 32% of the underlying equity in the carrying value of the net assets
 of the Consumer Healthcare JV was $11.2 billion,resulting in an initial basis difference of approximately $4.5 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we preliminarily completed the allocation of the basis difference, which
resulted from the excess of the initial fair value of our investment over the underlying equity in the carrying value of the ne
t assets of the JV, primarily to inventory, definite-lived intangible assets, indefinite-lived intangible assets, related deferred tax liabilities and equity method goodwill within the investment account. During the fourth quarter of
2019, the Consumer Healthcare JV revised the initial carrying value of the net assets of the JV
 and our 32% share of the underlying equity in the carrying value of the netassets of the Consumer Healthcare JV was reduced to $11.0 billion and our initial basis difference was increased to $4.8 billion. The adjustment was allocated to equity
method goodwill within the investment account. We began recording the amortization of basis differences allocated to inventory, definite-lived intangible assets and related
deferred tax liabilities in 
Other (income)/deductions––net  commencing August 1, 2019. During the third and fourth quarters of 2020, we recognized write-offs of  a portion ofour basis differences allocated to indefinite-lived and definite-lived intangible assets and related deferred tax liabilities for the divestiture of certain brands by the Consumer
Healthcare JV during its second quarter of 2020. The total amortization and write-off of these basis dif
ferences for the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first nine months of2020, which was included in 
Other (income)/deductions— Pfizer Inc.
2020 Form 10-K 66 
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
net
 in 2020, was $119 million of expense. The amortization of basis differences for two months of the third quarter of 2019 totaling approximately $31 million is included inour operating results in the fourth quarter of 2019. See 
Note 4. Amortization of basis differences on inventory and related deferred tax liabilities was completely recognized by the second quarter of 2020. Basis differences on definite-lived intangible assets and related deferred tax liabilities are being amortized over the lives of the underlying
assets, which range from 8 to 20 years.
While we have received our full 32% interest in the Consumer Healthcare JV as of the July 31, 2019 closing and transferred control of our Consumer Healthcare business to
the Consumer Healthcare JV, the contribution of the business was not completed in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions due to temporary regulatory or operational constraints. In
these jurisdictions, we have continued to operate the business for the net economic benefit o
f the Consumer Healthcare JV, and we are indemnified against risks associatedwith such operations in the interim period, subject to our obligations under the definitive transaction agreements. We expect the contribution in these
 jurisdictions to becompleted by the second half of 2021. As such, we have
 treated these jurisdictions as sold for accounting purposes.In connection with the contribution, we entered into certain transitional agreements designed to facilitate the orderly transition of the
 business to the Consumer Healthcare JV.These agreements primarily relate to administrative services, which are generally to be provided for a period of up to 24 months after closing. We will also manufacture and
supply certain consumer products for the Consumer Healthcare JV and the Consumer Healthcare JV will manufacture and supply certain retained Pfizer products for us after
closing, generally for a term of up to six years. These agreements are not material to Pfizer.
As a part of Pfizer, pre-tax income on a management basis for the Consumer Healthcare business was $654 million through July 31, 2019 and $977 million in 2018.

 due to the significant influence that we have over the operations ofViiV through our board representation and minority veto rights. We suspended application of the equity method to our investment
 in ViiV in 2016 when the carrying value of ourinvestment was reduced to zero due to the recognition of cumulative equity method losses and dividends. Since 2016,

Agreement with Valneva
On April 30, 2020, we signed an agreement to co-develop and commercialize Valneva’s Lyme disease vaccine candidate, VLA15, which covers six serotypes that are
prevalent in North America and Europe. Valneva and Pfizer will work closely together throughout the development of VLA15. Valneva is eligible to receive a to
tal of up to $308million in cash payments from us consisting of a $130 million upfront payment, which was paid and recorded in 
Research and development expenses in our second quarter of 2020, as well as $35 million in development milestones and $143 million in early commercialization milestones. Under the terms of the agreement, Valneva will fund 30% of all
development costs through completion of the development program, and in return we will pay Valneva tiered royalties. We will lead late-stage development and have sole
control over commercialization.
Agreement with BioNTech
In August 2018, a multi-year R&D arrangement went into effect between BioNTech and P
fizer to develop mRNA-based vaccines for prevention of influenza (flu). In relation tothis R&D arrangement, in September 2018, we made an upfront payment of $50 million to BioNTech, which was recorded in 
Research and development expenses, and BioNTech became eligible to receive up to $325 million in development and sales-based milestones and royalty payments associated with worldwide sales. As part of the
transaction, we also purchased 169,670 newly-issued ordinary shares of BioNTech for $50 million in the third quarter of 2018.
Akcea
On October 4, 2019, we entered into a worldwide exclusive licensing agreement for AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, an investigational antisense therapy being developed to 
treatpatients with certain cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, with Akcea, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ionis. The transaction closed in November 2019 and we made an upfront
payment of $250 million to Akcea, which was recorded in 
Research and development expenses in our fourth quarter of 2019. We may be required to make development, regulatory and sales milestone payments of up to $1.3 billion and pay tiered, double-digit royalties on annual worldwide net sales upon marketing approval of AKCEA-
ANGPTL3-LRx.
E. Collaborative Arrangements
In the normal course of business, we enter into collaborative arrangements with respect to in-line medicines, as well as medicines in development that require completion of
research and regulatory approval. Collaborative arrangements are contractual agreements with third parties that involve a joint operating activity, typically a research and/or
commercialization effort, where both we and our partner are active participants in the activity and are exposed to the significant risks and rewards of the ac
tivity. Our rights andobligations under our collaborative arrangements vary. For example, we have agreements to co-promote pharmaceutical products discovered by us or other companies, and
we have agreements where we partner to co-develop and/or participate together in commercializing, marketing, promoting, manufacturing and/or distributing a drug product.
Agreement with Myovant
On December 26, 2020, we entered into a collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize Orgovyx™ (relugolix) in advanced prostate cancer and, if approved, relugolix
combination tablet (relugolix 40 mg, estradiol 1.0 mg, and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) in women’s health in the U.S. and Canada. We will also receive an exclusive option to
commercialize relugolix in oncology outside the U.S. and Canada, excluding certain Asian countries. Under the terms of the agreement, the companies will equally share profits
and allowable expenses for Orgovyx and the relugolix combination tablet in the U.S. and Canada, with Myovant bearing our share of allowable expenses up to a maximum
Pfizer Inc.
2020 Form 10-K 68 
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
of $100 million in 2021 and up to a maximum of $50 million in 2022. We will record our share of gross profits as Alliance revenue. Myovant will remain responsible for
regulatory interactions and drug supply and continue to lead clinical development for the relugolix combination tablet. Myovant will be entitled to receive up to $4.35 billion,
including an upfront payment of $650 million, which was made in December 2020, $200 million in potential regulatory milestones for FDA approvals for relugolix combination
tablet in women’s health, and tiered sales milestones of up to $3.5 billion for prostate cancer and also for the combined women’s health indications. If
 we exercise the option tocommercialize relugolix in oncology outside of the U.S. and Canada, excluding certain Asian countries, Myovant will receive $50 million and be entitled to receive double-digit
royalties on sales. In connection with this transaction, we recognized $499 million in 
Identifiable intangible assets––Developed technology  rights and $151 million in Research and development expenses 
representing the relative fair value of the portion of the upfront payment allocated to the approved indication and unapproved indications of theproduct, respectively.
Agreement with CStone
On September 29, 2020, we entered into a strategic collaboration with CStone to address oncological needs in China. The collaboration encompasses our $200 million upfront
equity investment in CStone, a collaboration between the companies for the development and commercialization of CStone’s sugemalimab (CS1001, PD-L1 antibody) in
mainland China, and a framework between the companies to bring additional oncology assets to the Greater China market. The transaction closed on October 9,
 2020. As ofDecember 31, 2020, we held a 9.9% stake in CStone.
Agreement with BioNTech
On April 9, 2020, we signed a global agreement with BioNTech to co-develop a mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine program, BNT162b2, aimed at preventing COVID-19
disease. The collaboration rapidly advanced a COVID-19 vaccine candidate into human clinical testing based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA vaccine platforms, and the
vaccine has been granted EUA in the U.S., the 
EU and the U.K., among other countries. We are working with BioNTech to manufacture and help ensure rapid worldwideaccess to the vaccine. The collaboration leverages our broad expertise in vaccine R&D, regulatory capabilities, and global manufacturing and distribution network. In
connection with the April 2020 agreement, we paid BioNTech an upfront cash payment of $72 million, which was recorded in 
Research and development expenses in our second quarter of 2020, and we made an additional equity investment of $113 million in common stock of BioNTech. BioNTech became eligible to receive potential milestone
payments of up to $563 million for a total consideration of $748 million. Under the terms of this agreement, we and BioNTech will share gross profits and development costs
equally after the vaccine is approved and successfully commercialized, and we were responsible for all of the development costs until commercialization of the vaccine.
Thereafter, BioNTech was to repay us its 50 percent share of these development costs
 through reductions in gross profit sharing and milestone payments to BioNTech overtime. On January 29, 2021, we and BioNTech signed an amended version of the April 2020 agreement. Under the
 January 2021 agreement, BioNTech will pay us their 50percent share of prior development costs in a lump sum payment during the first quarter of 2021. Further R&D costs will be shared equally. We have commercialization rights
to the vaccine worldwide (excluding Germany and Turkey where BioNTech will market and distribute the vaccine under the agreement with us, and excluding China, Hong
Kong, Macau and Taiwan, which are subject to a separate collaboration between BioNTech and Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd). We recognize 
Revenues and 
Cost of sales on a gross basis in markets where we are commercializing the vaccine and we will record our share of gross profits related to sales of the vaccine by BioNTech in Germany and Turkey in 
Alliance revenues . We made an additional investment of $50 million in common stock of BioNTech as part of an underwritten equity offering by BioNTech, which closed in July 2020. 
As ofDecember 31, 2020, we held an equity stake of 2.5% in BioNTech.

. Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity InitiativesIn 2019, we substantially completed several multi-year initiatives focused on positioning us for future growth and creating a simpler, more efficient operating structure within
each business.
Transforming to a More Focused Company Program
With the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019 and the spin-off of our Upjohn Business in 
the fourth quarter of 2020, Pfizer has transformed into a more focused,global leader in science-based innovative medicines and vaccines. We have undertaken efforts to ensure our cost base aligns appropriately with our revenue base. While
certain direct costs transferred to the Consumer Healthcare JV and to the Upjohn Business in connection with the spin-off
, there are indirect costs which did not transfer. Inaddition, we are taking steps to restructure our corporate enabling functions to appropriately support and drive the purpose of our focused
 innovative biopharmaceuticalproducts business and R&D and PGS platform functions. The program costs discussed below may be rounded and represent approximations.
We expect costs for this program, primarily related to corporate enabling functions, to be incurred from 2020 through 2022 and to to
tal $1.6 billion on a pre-tax basis, withsubstantially all costs to be cash expenditures. Actions will include, among others, changes in location of certain activities, expanded use and
 co-location of centers ofexcellence and shared services, and increased use of digital technologies. The associated actions and the specific costs will primarily include severance and benefit plan
impacts, exit costs as well as associated implementation costs.
Also as part of this program, we expect to incur costs related to manufacturing network optimization, including certain legacy cost-reduction initiatives, of $500 million, with
approximately 20% of the costs to be non-cash. The costs for 
this effort are expected to be incurred primarily from 2020 through 2022, and will include, among other things,implementation costs, product transfer costs, site exit costs, as well as accelerated depreciation.
From the start of this program in the fourth quarter of 2019 through December 31, 2020,
 we incurred costs of $900 million.Key Activities
In 2020, we incurred costs of $896 million, composed primarily of the Transforming to a More Focused Company program. In 2019, we incurred costs of $820 million
composed of $548 million for the 2017-2019 and Organizing for Growth initiatives, $288 million for the integration of Array, $94 million for the integration of Hospira, and $87
million for the Transforming to a More Focused Company program, partially offset by income of $197 million, primarily due to the reversal of certain accruals upon the effective
favorable settlement of an IRS audit for multiple tax years and other acquisition-related initiatives.

Amounts discussed below are rounded to the nearest hundred million and represent approximations.
In
 2018, we finalized our provisional accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA, based on our best estimates of available information and data. We reported and disclosed theimpacts
 within the applicable measurement period, in accordance with SEC guidance, and recorded a favorable adjustment of $100 million to Provision/(benefit)  for taxes onincome
. We
 elected, with the filing of our 2018 U.S. Federal Consolidated Income Tax Return, to pay our initial estimated $15 billion repatriation tax liability on accumulated post-1986foreign
 earnings over eight years through 2026. The third annual installment of this liability, which is due to be paid in April 2021, is reported in current Income taxes payable , and
 the  remaining  liability  is  reported  in  noncurrent Other  taxes  payable as  of  December  31,  2020.  Our  obligations  may  vary  as  a  result  of  changes  in  our  uncertain  taxpositions and/or availability of attributes such as foreign tax and other credit carryforwards.
The TCJA subjects a U.S. shareholder to current tax on global intangible low-taxed income earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The FASB Staf
f Q&A, Topic 740, No. 5,Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income
, states that we are permitted to make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes  for temporary basisdifferences expected to reverse as global intangible low-taxed income in future years or provide for the tax expense related to such income in the year the
 tax is incurred. Weelected to recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as global intangible low-taxed income in future years.
On
 March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was signed into law in the U.S. to provide certain relief as a result of the COVID-19pandemic. In
 addition, governments around the world have enacted or implemented various forms of tax relief measures in response to the economic conditions in the wake ofCOVID-19.
 As of December 31, 2020, neither the CARES Act nor changes to income tax laws or regulations in other jurisdictions had a significant impact on our effective taxrate.
The changes in 
Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income  impacting the effective tax rate year-over-year are summarized below: 2020 v. 2019
The higher effective tax rate in 2020 was mainly the result of:
•
the non-recurrence of the $1.4 billion tax benefits, representing taxes and interest, recorded in 2019 due to the favorable settlement of an IRS audit for multiple tax years;•
the non-recurrence of the tax benefits related to certain tax initiatives associated with the implementation of our then new business structure; and•
the non-recurrence of the tax benefits recorded in 2019 as a result of additional guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury related to the TCJA, as well as:•
lower tax benefits related to the impairment of intangible assets,partially offset by:
•
the non-recurrence of the tax expense of $2.7 billion recorded in the third quarter of 2019 associated with the gain related to the completion of the Consumer Healthcare JVtransaction; and
•
the favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business.(b)(a)

2019 v. 2018
The higher effective tax rate was primarily the result of:
•
the tax expense of $2.7 billion associated with the gain related to the completion of the Consumer Healthcare JV transaction; and•
the non-recurrence of certain tax initiatives and favorable adjustments to the provisional estimate of the TCJA,partially offset by:
•
an increase in tax benefits associated with the resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years, primarily due to a benefit of $1.4 billion, representing tax andinterest, resulting from the favorable settlement of an IRS audit;
•
benefits related to certain tax initiatives associated with the implementation of our then new business structure;•
the tax benefits recorded as a result of additional guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury related to the enactment of the TCJA; and•
the favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business.In all years, federal, state and international net tax liabilities assumed or established as part of a business acquisition are not included in

Note 5A.For taxation of non-U.S. operatio
ns, this rate impact reflects the income tax rates and relative earnings in the locations where we do business outside the U.S., together with the U.S. tax cost on ourinternational operations, c
hanges in uncertain tax positions not included in the reconciling item called “Tax settlements and resolution of certain tax positions,” as well as changes in valuation allowances.Specifically: (i) the jurisdictional locatio
n of earnings is a significant component of our effective tax rate each year, and the rate impact of this component is influenced by the specific location of non-U.S.earnings and the level of s
uch earnings as compared to our total earnings; (ii) the U.S. tax implications of our foreign operations is a significant component of our effective tax rate each year and generallyoffsets some of the reduction to 
our effective tax rate each year resulting from the jurisdictional location of earnings; (iii) the impact of certain tax initiatives; and (iv) the impact of changes in uncertain taxpositions not included in th
e reconciling item called “Tax settlements and resolution of certain tax positions” is a component of our effective tax rate each year that can result in either an increase or decrease toour effective tax rate. The jurisdiction
al mix of earnings, which includes the impact of the location of earnings as well as the U.S. tax cost on our international operations, can vary as a result of operatingfluctuations in the normal cours
e of business and as a result of the extent and location of other income and expense items, such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and gains and losses on strategicbusiness decisions. See also 
Note 5A for the components of pre -tax income and Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income, which is based on the locatio n of the taxing authorities, and for information aboutsettlements and other i
tems impacting Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income. In all years, the impact on our eff
ective tax rate is the result of the jurisdictional location of earnings. In 2020 and 2019, the reduction in our effective tax rate resulting from the jurisdictional location of earningsis largely due to lower tax rates in c
ertain jurisdictions, as well as manufacturing and other incentives for our subsidiaries in Singapore and to a lesser extent in Puerto Rico. We benefit from Puerto Rican taxincentives pursuant to a gra
nt that expires during 2029. Under such grant, we are partially exempt from income, property and municipal taxes. In Singapore, we benefit from incentive tax rates effective through2045 on income from manufac
turing and other operations.For a discussion about tax settleme
nts and resolution of certain tax positions and the impact of the gain on the completion of the Consumer Healthcare JV transaction, see Note 5A. The favorable rate impact in 20
18 is a result of the updated 2017 invoice received from the federal government, which reflected a lower expense than what was previously estimated for invoiced periods, aswell as certain tax initiatives.

$ (3,123) $ (4,961) *
The deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with global intangible low-taxed income are included in the relevant categories. See Note 5A . The increase in 2020 is primarily rel
ated to the capitalization of certain R&D-related expenses.The decrease in 2020 is primarily t
he result of amortization of intangible assets and certain impairment charges.The amounts in 2020 and 
2019 are reduced for unrecognized tax benefits of $3.0 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, where we have net operating loss carryforwards, similar tax losses, and/or tax creditcarryforwards that are available, 
under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction, to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position.The amounts in 2020 and 
2019 are primarily related to the Consumer Healthcare JV. See Note 2C. In 2020, 
Noncurrent deferred tax a ssets and other noncurrent tax assets ($0.9 billion), and Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ($4.1 billion). In 2019, Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent taxassets
 ($0.7 billion), and Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ($5.7 billion). We have carryforwards, primarily related to net operating and capital losses, general business credits, foreign tax credits and charitable contributions, which are available to
reduce future U.S. federal and/or state, as well as international, income taxes payable with either an indefinite life or expiring at various times from 2021 to
 2040. Certain of ourU.S. net operating losses and general business credits are subject to limitations under IRC Section 382.
As of December 31, 2020, we have not made a U.S. 
tax provision on $55.0 billion of unremitted earnings of our international subsidiaries. As these earnings are intended to beindefinitely reinvested overseas, the determination of a hypothetical unrecognized deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2020 is not practicable. The amount of indefinitely
reinvested earnings is based on estimates and assumptions and subject to management evaluation, and is subject to change in 
the normal course of business based onoperational cash flow, completion of local statutory financial statements and the finalization of tax returns and audits
, among other things. Accordingly, we regularly update ourearnings and profits analysis for such events.
D. Tax Contingencies
For a description of our accounting policies associated with accounting for income tax contingencies, see 
Note 1P. Uncertain Tax Positions
As tax law is complex and often subject to varied interpretations, it is uncertain whether some of our tax
 positions will be sustained upon audit. As of December 31, 2020, wehad $4.3 billion and as of December 31, 2019, we had $4.2 billion in net unrecognized tax benefits, excluding associated interest.
•
Tax assets for uncertain tax positions primarily represent our estimate of the potential tax benefits in one tax jurisdiction that could result from the payment of income taxes inanother tax jurisdiction. These potential benefits generally result from cooperative efforts among taxing authorities, as required by tax treaties to minimize double taxation,
commonly referred to as the competent authority process. The recoverability of these assets, which we believe to be more likely than not,
 is dependent upon the actualpayment of taxes in one tax jurisdiction and, in some cases, the successful petition 
for recovery in another tax jurisdiction. As of December 31, 2020, we had $1.3 billion inassets associated with uncertain tax positions. These amounts were included in 
Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets  ($1.1 billion), Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities 
($122 million) and Other taxes payable  ($46 million). As of December 31, 2019, we had $1.2 billion in assets associated with uncertain tax positions. These amounts were included in 
Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets  ($1.0 billion) and Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ($109 million). •
Substantially all of these unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact our effective income tax rate.(a)(b)

Income taxes payable  ($34 million), Noncurrent deferred tax a ssets and other noncurrent tax assets ($18 million), Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ($3.0 billion) and Other taxes payable ($2.5 billion). In 2019,
 included in Income taxes payable  ($108 million), Current tax assets  ($2 million), Noncurrent deferred tax a ssets and other noncurrent tax assets ($51 million), Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities
 ($2.8 billion) and Other taxes payable  ($2.4 billion). •
Interest related to our unrecognized tax benefits is recorded in accordance with the laws of each jurisdiction and is recorded primarily in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income
. In 2020, we recorded a net increase in interest of $89 million. In 2019, we recorded a net  decrease in interest of $564 million, resulting primarily from a settlementwith the IRS; and in 2018, we recorded a net increase in interest of $103 million. Gross accrued interest to
taled $493 million as of December 31, 2020 (reflecting a decreaseof $5 million as a result of cash payments and a decrease of $75 million relating to the separation of Upjohn) and gross accrued interest totaled $485
 million as of December31, 2019 (reflecting a decrease of $13 million as a result of cash payments). In 2020, this amount
 was included in Income taxes payable ($7 million) and Other taxes payable ($486 million). In 2019, this amount was included in 
Income taxes payable ($20 million)  and Other taxes payable ($465 million). Accrued penalties are not significant. See also 
Note 5A. Status of Tax Audits and Potential Impact
 on Accruals for Uncertain Tax PositionsThe U.S. is one of our major tax jurisdictions, and we are regularly audited by the IRS. With respect to
 Pfizer, the IRS has issued a Revenue Agent’s Report (RAR) for taxyears 2011-2013. We are not in agreement with the RAR and are currently appealing certain disputed issues. Tax years 2014-2015 are currently under audit. Tax years 2016-
2020 are open, but not under audit. All other tax years are closed.
In addition to the open audit years in the U.S.,
 we have open audit years in other major tax jurisdictions, such as Canada (2013-2020), Japan (2017-2020), Europe (2011-2020,primarily reflecting Ireland, the U.K., France, Italy, Spain and Germany), Latin America (1998-2020, primarily reflecting Brazil) and Puerto Rico (2016-2020).
Any settlements or statutes of limitations expirations could result in a significant decrease in our uncertain tax positions. We estimate 
that it is reasonably possible that withinthe next 12 months, our gross unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest,
 could decrease by as much as $50 million, as a result of settlements with taxing authorities orthe expiration of the statutes of limitations. Our assessments are based on
 estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but our estimatesof unrecognized tax benefits and potential tax benefits may not be
 representative of actual outcomes, and variation from such estimates could materially affect our financialstatements in the period of settlement or when the statutes
 of limitations expire, as we treat these events as discrete items in the period of resolution. Finalizing audits with therelevant taxing authorities can include formal administrative and legal proceedings, and, as a result, it is difficult to estimate the timing and range of possible changes related to
our uncertain tax positions, and such changes could be significant.

Other (income)/deductions––net , which included the related termination of cross currency swaps . E. Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities
Foreign Exchange Risk
A significant portion of our revenues, earnings and net investments in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in 
foreign exchange rates. We manage our foreign exchange riskpredominately through the use of derivative financial instruments and foreign currency debt. These financial instruments serve to mitigate the impact on net income as a result
of remeasurement into another currency, or against the impact of translation into U.S. dollars of certain foreign exchange-denominated transactions.
The derivative financial instruments primarily hedge or offset exposures in the euro, U.K. pound, Japanese yen, Swedish krona and Canadian dollar. Additionally, we hedge a
portion of our forecasted intercompany inventory sales denominated in euro, Japanese yen, Chinese renminbi, Canadian dollar, U.K. pound and Australian dollar for up to two
years.
Changes in fair value are reported in earnings or in 
Other comprehensive income/(loss) , depending on the nature and purpose of the financial instrument (hedge or offset relationship). For certain foreign exchange contracts, we exclude an amount from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and
 recognize the excluded amount through anamortization approach in earnings. The hedge relationships are as follows:
Generally, we recognize the gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts that are designated as fair value hedges in earnings upon the
 recognition of the change in fairvalue of the hedged item. We also recognize the offsetting foreign exchange impact a
ttributable to the hedged item in earnings.•
Generally, we record in Other comprehensive income/(loss)  gains or losses on foreign exchange contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges and reclassify those amounts into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
•
We record in Other comprehensive income/(loss)  ––Foreign currency translation adjustments, net the foreign exchange gains and losses related to foreign exchange- denominated debt and foreign exchange contracts designated as a hedge of our net
 investments in foreign subsidiaries and reclassify those amounts into earnings upon thesale or substantial liquidation of our net investments.
•
For certain foreign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments, we recognize the gains and losses on contracts that are used to offset foreign currencyassets or liabilities immediately into earnings along with the earnings impact of the items they generally offset. These contracts essentially take the opposite currency
position of that reflected in the month-end balance sheet to counterbalance the
 effect of any currency movement.(a)(a)

Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
Interest Rate Risk
Our interest-bearing investments and borrowings are subject to interest rate risk. Depending on market conditions, we may change the profile of our outstanding debt or
investments by entering into derivative financial instruments like interest rate swaps, either to hedge or offset the exposure to
 changes in the fair value of hedged items withfixed interest rates, or to convert variable rate debt or investments to fixed rates.
 The derivative financial instruments primarily hedge U.S. dollar fixed-rate debt.We recognize the gains and losses on interest rate contracts that are designated as 
fair value hedges in earnings upon the recognition of the change in fair value of the hedgedrisk. We also recognize the offsetting earnings impact attributable to the hedged item.

Investments areplaced in instruments that are investment grade and are primarily short in duration. Exposure limits are established to limit a concentration with any single credit counterparty.
As of December 31, 2020, the largest investment exposures in our portfolio represent primarily sovereign debt instruments issued by the U.S., France, Canada,
 Japan,Sweden and Germany.
With respect to our derivative financial instrument agreements with financial institutions, we do not expect to incur a significant loss from failure of any counterparty.
 Derivativefinancial instruments are executed under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master agreements with credit-support annexes that contain zero threshold
provisions requiring collateral to be exchanged daily depending on levels of exposure. As a result, there are no significant concentrations of credit risk with any individual
financial institution. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate fair value of these
 derivative financial instruments that are in a net payable position was $946 million, for which wehave posted collateral of $821 million with a corresponding amount reported in
 Short-term investments . As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate fair value of our derivative financial instruments that are in a net receivable position was $137 million, for which we have received collateral of $142 million with a corresponding amount reported in
 Short- term borrowings, including current portion of long-term debt.

-mutant mCRC after prior therapy, as well as a $499 million capitalized portion of an upfront payment to Myovant (see Note 2E ) and an increase from a  $200 million measurementperiod adjustment related t
o the acquisition of Array (see Note  2A), partially offset by a $528 million impairment of Eucrisa (see Note 4 ) and a $263 million impairme nt of certain generic sterile injectables acquiredin connection with our acquisiti
on of Hospira (see Note 4 ). The changes in the gross carryin
g amounts primarily reflect the transfer of $600 million from indefinite-lived Licensing agreements and other  to finite-lived Licensing agreements and other  to reflect the approval in the U.S. of several products subject t
o out-licensing arrangements acquired from Array, as well as measurement period adjustments related to the acquisition of Array.The decrease in the gross carryin
g amount primarily reflects a decrease from a $1.2 billion measurement period adjustment related to the acquisition of Array, a $900 million impairment of IPR&D (see Note 4 ), and the transfer of $600 m
illion from IPR&D  to Developed technology rights to reflect the approval of Braftovi i n combination with Erbitux (cetuximab), for the treatment of BRAF -mutant mCRC after prior therapy.
The decrease is primarily due to am
ortization, impairments, and measurement period adjustments related to the acquisition of Array, partially offset by the capitalization of an upfront payment to Myovant (seeNote 2E
). Nearly all of our identifiable intangible assets are managed by our commercial organization, with only 9% of total cost of IPR&D managed by our R&D organization.

Developed Technology Rights
Developed technology rights represent the cost for developed technology acquired from third parties and can include the right to develop, use, market,
 sell and/or offer for salethe product, compounds and intellectual property that we have acquired with respect to products, compounds and/or processes 
that have been completed. We possess a well-diversified portfolio of hundreds of developed technology rights across therapeutic categories, representing our commercialized products. The significant components of
developed technology rights are the following: Xtandi, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 Infant, Braf
tovi/Mektovi, Premarin, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 Adult, Eucrisa, Orgovyx, and, to alesser extent Zavicefta, Tygacil, Merrem/Meronem, Refacto AF/Xyntha, Pristiq and Bosulif. Also included in this ca
tegory are the post-approval milestone payments madeunder our alliance agreements for certain biopharmaceutical products.
Brands
Brands represent the cost for tradenames and know-how, as the products themselves do not receive paten
t protection. Indefinite-lived brands include Medrol and Depo-Medrol, while finite-lived brands include Depo-Provera and Zavedos.
IPR&D
IPR&D assets represent R&D assets that have not yet
 received regulatory approval in a major market. The significant components of IPR&D are the following: the program forthe oral poly ADP ribose polymerase inhibitor for the treatment of patients with germline BRCA-mutated advanced breast cancer acquired as part of the Medivation acquisition
and assets acquired in connection with the Array acquisition. IPR&D assets are required to be classified as indefinite-lived assets until the successful completion or the
abandonment of the associated R&D effort. Accordingly, during the development period after the
 date of acquisition, these assets are not amortized until approval is obtainedin a major market, typically either the U.S. or the EU, or in a series of other countries, subject 
to certain specified conditions and management judgment. At that time, we willdetermine the useful life of the asset, reclassify it out of 
IPR&D and begin amortization. If the associated R&D effort is abandoned, the related IPR&D assets will likely bewritten-off, and we will record an impairment charge.
IPR&D assets are high-risk assets, given the uncertain nature of R&D. Accordingly, we expect tha
t many of these IPR&D assets will become impaired and be written-off atsome time in the future.
Licensing Agreements
Licensing agreements for developed technology and for technology in development primarily relate to out-licensing arrangements acquired from third parties, including the
Array acquisition. These assets represent the cost for the license, where we acquired the right to fu
ture royalties and/or milestones upon development or commercialization bythe licensing partner. A significant component of the licensing arrangements are for out-licensing arrangements with a number of partners for oncology technology in varying
stages of development that have not yet received regulatory approval in a major market. Accordingly, during the development period after the da
te of acquisition, each of theseassets is classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets and will not be amortized until approval is obtained in a major market. At that time we will determine the useful life of the
asset, reclassify the respective licensing arrangement asset to finite-lived intangible asset and begin amortization. If the development effort is abandoned
, the related licensingasset will likely be written-off, and we will record an impairment charge.
Amortization
The weighted-average life for each of our total finite-lived intangible assets and the largest component, developed technology rights, is approximately 9 years. Total
amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets was $3.5 billion in 2020, $4.5 billion in 2019 and $4.8 billion in 2018.
The following provides the expected annual amortization expense:

At the beginning of 2019, we reorganized our commercial operations and began to manage our businesses through three different operating segments––Biopharma, Upjohn
and Consumer Healthcare. As a result of the reorganization of our commercial operations, our remaining goodwill was required to be reallocated amongst the then new
Biopharma and Upjohn operating segments by determining the fair value of each reporting unit under our old and new management structure and the portions being
transferred. We completed this re-allocation based on relative fair value in the second quarter of 2019 and retrospectively presented goodwill according to the operating
structure.
Our Consumer Healthcare business was classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2018 and, upon closing of the transaction with GSK
 during the third quarter of 2019, wedeconsolidated our Consumer Healthcare business and derecognized Consumer Healthcare goodwill. For additional information, see 
Note 2C . On November 16, 2020, we completed the spin-off and the combination of our Upjohn Business with Mylan. Upon closing, we deconsolidated the Upjohn business and derecognized $10.6 billion in
Upjohn goodwill. In addition, at December 31, 2019, the goodwill associated with the Upjohn Business was classified as 
Noncurrent assets of discontinued operations . For additional information, see

.  Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans and Defined Contribution PlansThe majority of our employees worldwide are eligible for retirement benefits provided through defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we
sponsor both IRC-qualified and supplemental (non-qualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. A qualified plan meets the requirements of certain sections of
the IRC, and, generally, contributions to qualified plans are tax deductible. A qualified plan typically provides benefits to a broad group of
 employees with restrictions ondiscriminating in favor of highly compensated employees with regard to coverage, benefits and contributions. A supplemental (non-qualified) plan provides additional benefits to
certain employees. In addition, we provide medical insurance benefits to certain retirees and their eligible dependents through our postretirement plans.

2.9 % 1.4 %2.5 %Effective January 1, 2018, we froz
e the defined benefit plans to future benefit accruals in the U.S. and members’ accrued benefits to that date no longer increase in line with future compensation increases. Therate of compensation increas
e is therefore no longer an assumption used to determine the benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost for the U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension plans.The assumptions above are used to develop the benefit obligations at each fiscal year-end. All of 
the assumptions are reviewed on at least an annual basis. We revise theseassumptions based on an annual evaluation of long-term trends as well as market conditions that may have an impact on the cost
 of providing retirement benefits.The weighted-average discount rate for our U.S. defined benefit plans is determined annually and evaluated and modified to reflect at year-end the
 prevailing market rate of aportfolio of high-quality fixed income investments, rated AA/Aa or better that reflect
 the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. For our internationalplans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA/
Aa or better, including, when there is sufficient data, a yield curveapproach. These rate determinations are made consistent with local requirements. Overall, the yield curves used to measure the benefit obligations at year-end 2020 resulted
in lower discount rates as compared to the prior year.
The following provides the healthcare cost trend rate assumptions for our U.S. postretirement benefit plans:

Equity securities, Fixed income securities and Other investments may each be combined into commingled funds. Most commingled funds are valued to reflect the interest in
the fund based on the reported year-end NAV. Partnership and Other investments
 are valued based on year-end reported NAV (or its equivalent), with adjustments asappropriate for lagged reporting of up to three months.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of our pension and postretirement plans’ assets:
•
Cash and cash equivalents: Level 1 investments may include cash, cash equivalents and foreign currency valued using exchange rates. Level 2 investments may includeshort-term investment funds which are commingled funds priced at a stable NAV by the administrator of the funds.
•
Equity securities: Level 1 investments may include individual securities that are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which they aretraded. Level 1 and Level 2 investments may include commingled funds that have a readily determinable fair value based on quoted prices on an exchange or a published
NAV derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying securities. Level 3 investments may include individual securities that are unlisted, delisted,
suspended, or illiquid and are typically valued using their last available price.
•
Fixed income securities: Level 1 investments may include individual securities that are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which theyare traded. Level 2 investments may include commingled funds that have a readily determinable fair value based on observable prices of the underlying securities. Level 2
investments may include corporate bonds, government and government agency obligations and other fixed income securities valued using bid evaluation pricing models or
quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Level 3 investments may include securities that are valued using alternative pricing sources, such as investment
managers or brokers, which use proprietary pricing models that incorporate unobservable inputs.
•
Other investments: Level 1 investments may include individual securities that are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which they aretraded. Level 2 investments may include Insurance contracts which invest in interest bearing cash, U.S. government securities and corporate debt instruments.
Certain investments are authorized to include derivatives, such as equity or bond futures, swaps, options and currency futures or forwards for managing risks and exposures.

t periodic benefitcosts and cash contributions over the long-term. We utilize long-term asset allocation ranges in the management of our plans’ invested assets. Our long-term return
expectations are developed based on a diversified, global investment strategy that takes into account
 historical experience, as well as the impact of portfolio diversification,active portfolio management, and our view of current and future economic and financial market conditions. As market conditions and other factors change
, we may adjust ourtargets accordingly and our asset allocations may vary from the target allocations.
Our long-term asset allocation ranges reflect our asset class return expectations and tolerance for investment risk within the context of 
the respective plans’ long-term benefitobligations. These ranges are supported by analysis that incorporates historical and expected returns by asset class, as well as volatilities and correlations across asset
classes and our liability profile.
Each pension plan is overseen by a local committee or board that is responsible for the overall investment of the pension plan assets. 
In determining investment policies andassociated target allocations, each committee or board considers a wide variety of factors. As such, the
 target asset allocation for each of our international pension plans is seton a standalone basis by the relevant board or committee. The target

asset allocation ranges shown for the international pension plans seek to reflect the combined target allocations across all such plans, while also showing the range within
which the target allocations for each plan typically falls.
The investment managers of certain separately managed accounts, commingled funds and private equity funds may be permitted to use repurchase agreements and derivative
securities, including U.S. Treasury and equity futures contracts as described in each respective investment management, subscription, partnership or other governing
agreement.
E. Cash Flows
It is our practice to fund amounts for our qualified pension plans that are at least
 sufficient to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable employee benefit laws andlocal tax laws.
The following provides the expected future cash flow information related to our benefit plans:

to be paid from the plans or from our general assets under the current actuarial assumptionsused for the calculation of the benefit obligation and, therefore, actual bene
fit payments may differ from projected benefit payments.F. Defined Contribution Plans
We have defined contribution plans in the U.S. and several other countries. For the majority of the
 U.S. defined contribution plans, employees may contribute a portion of theirsalaries and bonuses to the plans, and we match, in cash, a portion of 
the employee contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2011, for newly hired non-union employees, rehiresand transfers to the U.S. or Puerto Rico, we no longer offer a
 defined benefit pension plan and, instead, offer a Retirement Savings Contribution (RSC) in the definedcontribution plan. The RSC is an annual non-contributory employer contribution (that is not dependent upon the participant making a contribution) determined based on each
employee’s eligible compensation, age and years of service. Beginning on January 1, 2018, all non-union employees in the U.S. and Puerto Rico defined benefit plans
transitioned to the RSC in the defined contribution plans. We recorded charges related to the employer contributions to global defined contribution plans of
 $685 million in2020, $659 million in 2019 and $622 million in 2018.
Note 12. Equity
A. Common Stock Purchases
We purchase our common stock through privately negotiated transactions or in the open market as circumstances and prices warrant. Purchased shares under each of the
share-purchase plans, which are authorized by our BOD, are available for general corporate purposes. In December 2015, the BOD authorized an $11 billion share repurchase
program, which was exhausted in the third quarter of 2018. In December 2017, the BOD authorized an additional $10 billion share repurchase program, which was exhausted
in the first quarter of 2019. In December 2018, the BOD au
thorized another $10 billion share repurchase program to be utilized over time and share repurchases commencedthereunder in the first quarter of 2019.
In March 2018, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (ASR) with Citibank, N.A. to repurchase $4 billion of our common stock pursuant to our previously
announced share repurchase authorization. We paid $4 billion and received an initial delivery of 87 million shares of stock at a price of $36.61 per share, which represented
approximately 80% of the notional amount of the ASR. In 
September 2018, the ASR was completed resulting in Citibank owing us an additional 21 million shares of ourcommon stock. The average price paid for all of the shares delivered under the ASR was $36.86 per share. The common stock received is included in 
Treasury stock . In February 2019, we entered into an ASR with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC 
to repurchase $6.8 billion of our common stock pursuant to our previously announced sharerepurchase authorization. We paid $6.8 billion and received an initial delivery of 130 million shares of common stock, which represented approximately 80% of the notional
amount of the ASR. In August 2019
, the ASR with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC was completed resulting in Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC owing us an additional 33.5 million sharesof our common stock. The average price paid for all of the shares delivered under the ASR was $41.42 per share. The
 common stock received is included in Treasury stock . Pfizer Inc.

B. Preferred Stock and Employee Stock Ownership Plans
Prior to May 4, 2020, our Series A convertible perpetual preferred stock (the Series A Preferred Stock) was held by an
 ESOP trust (the Trust). All outstanding shares of SeriesA Preferred Stock were converted, at the direction of the independent
 fiduciary under the Trust and in accordance with the certificate of designations for the Series A PreferredStock, into shares of our common stock on May 4, 2020. The
 Trust received an aggregate of 1,070,369 shares of our common stock upon conversion, with zero shares ofSeries A Preferred Stock remaining outstanding as a result of the conversion. In December 2020, we filed a certificate
 of elimination and a restated certificate of incorporationwith the Delaware Secretary of State, which eliminated the Series A Preferred Stock.
Since May 4, 2020, we have one ESOP tha
t holds common stock of the Company (Common ESOP). Prior to that there was also an ESOP that held the Series A PreferredStock. As of December 31, 2020, all shares of common stock held by 
the Common ESOP have been allocated to the Pfizer U.S. defined contribution plan participants. Thecompensation cost related to the Common ESOP was $19 million in 2020, $20 million in 2019 and $19 million in 2018.
Note 13. Share-Based Payments
Our compensation programs can include share-based payment awards with value that is determined by reference to the fair value of our shares and that provide for the grant
of shares or options to acquire shares or similar arrangements. Our share-based awards are designed based on competitive survey data or industry peer groups used for
compensation purposes; and are allocated between different long-term incentive awards, generally in the form of Total Shareholder Return Units (TSRUs), Restricted Stock
Units (RSUs), Portfolio Performance Shares (PPSs), Performance Share Awards (PSAs) and Stock Options,
 as determined by the Compensation Committee.The 2019 Stock Plan (2019 Plan) replaced and superseded the 2014 Plan. It
 provides for 400 million shares, in addition to shares remaining under the 2014 Plan, to beauthorized for grants. The 2019 Plan provides that the number of stock op
tions, TSRUs, RSUs, or performance-based awards that may be granted to any one individual duringany 36-month period is limited to 20 million shares, and that RSUs, PPSs and PSAs count
 as three shares, while TSRUs and stock options count as one share, toward themaximum shares available under the 2019 Plan. As of December 31, 2020, 411 million shares were available for award. Although not required to do so we have used
authorized and unissued shares and, to a lesser extent, treasury stock to sa
tisfy our obligations under these programs.A summary of the awards and valuation details:

We lease real estate, fleet, and equipment for use in our operations. Our leases generally have lease terms of 1
 to 30 years, some of which include options to terminate orextend leases for up to 5 to 10 years or on a month-to-month basis. We
 include options that are reasonably certain to be exercised as part of the determination of lease terms.We may negotiate termination clauses in anticipation of any changes in market conditions, but generally these termination options have not been exercised. Residual value
guarantees are generally not included within our operating leases with the exception of some fleet leases. In addition to base rent payments
, the leases may require us to paydirectly for taxes and other non-lease components, such as insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses, which may be dependent on
 usage or vary month-to-month. Variable lease payments amounted to $380 million in 2020 and $327 million in 2019. We elected the practical expedient in the new standard to not
 separate non-leasecomponents from lease components in calculating the amounts of ROU assets and lease liabilities for all underlying asset classes.
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the contract and we perform the lease classification test
 as of the lease commencement date. ROU assets representour right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets
and liabilities are recognized at commencement date

In April 2018, we entered an agreement to lease space in an office building in New York City. We expect 
to take control of the property in 2021 and relocate our globalheadquarters to this new office building in 2022. Our future minimum rental commitment under this 20-year lease is approximately $1.6 billion.
Prior to our adoption of the new lease standard, rental expense, net of
 sublease income, was $301 million in 2018.Note 16. Contingenc
ies and Certain CommitmentsWe and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, including tax and legal contingencies. The following
outlines our legal contingencies. For a discussion of our tax contingencies, see 
Note 5B. A. Legal Proceedings
Our legal contingencies include, but are not limited to, the following:
•
Patent litigation, which typically involves challenges to the coverage and/or validity of patents on various products, processes or dosage forms. We are the plaintiff in themajority of these actions. An adverse outcome in actions in which we are the plaintiff could result in loss of paten
t protection for a drug, a significant loss of revenues fromthat drug or impairment of the value of associated assets.
•
Product liability and other product-related litigation, which can include personal injury, consumer, off-label promotion, securities, antitrust and breach of contract claims,among others, often involves highly complex issues relating to medical causation, label warnings and reliance on those warnings, scientific evidence and findings, actual,
provable injury and other matters.
•
Commercial and other matters, which can include acquisition-, licensing-, collaboration- or co-promotion-related and product-pricing claims and environmental claims andproceedings, can involve complexities that will vary from matter to matter.
•
Government investigations, which often are related to the extensive regulation of pharmaceutical companies by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S.and in other jurisdictions.
Certain of these contingencies could result in losses, including damages, fines and/or civil penalties, which could be substantial, and/or criminal charges.
We believe that our claims and defenses in matters in which we are a defendant are substantial, but litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur. We
do not believe that any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our 
financial position. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise ourexpectations regarding the outcome of matters, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
/or our cash flows in the period in which theamounts are accrued or paid.
We have accrued for losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Substantially all of our contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and,
 therefore,determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. Consequently, we are unable to estimate the range o
f reasonably possible loss inexcess of amounts accrued. Our assessments, which result from a complex series of judgments about future events
 and uncertainties, are based on estimates andassumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be
 incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occurthat might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions.
Amounts recorded for legal and environmental contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on
estimates and assumptions. In August 2020, the S
EC amended its disclosure rules regarding the threshold for disclosure of proceedings under environmental laws to which agovernmental authority is a party. In accordance with the amended rule, we have adopted a disclosure threshold for such proceedings of $1 million in potential or actual
governmental monetary sanctions.
The principal pending matters to which we are a party are discussed below. In determining whether a pending matter is a principal matter, we consider both quantitative and
qualitative factors to assess materiality, such as, among others, the amount of
 damages and the nature of other relief sought, if specified; our view of the merits of the claimsand of the strength of our defenses; whether the
 action purports to be, or is, a class action and, if not certified, our view of the likelihood that a class will be certified by thecourt; the jurisdiction in which the proceeding is pending; whether related actions have been transferred to multidistrict litigation; any experience that we or, to our knowledge,
other companies have had in similar proceedings; whether disclosure of the action would be important to a reader of our financial statements, including whether disclosure
might change a reader’s judgment about our financial statements in light of all of the information that is available to the reader; 
the potential impact of the proceeding on ourreputation; and the extent of public interest in the matter.
 In addition, with respect to patent matters in which we are the plaintiff, we consider, among other things, the financialsignificance of the product protected by the patent(s) at issue. 
Some of the matters discussed below include those which management believes that the likelihood of possibleloss in excess of amounts accrued is remote.
A1. Legal Proceedings––Patent Litigation
We are involved in suits relating to our patents, including but not limited to, those discussed below. Most involve claims by generic drug manufacturers that paten
ts coveringour products, processes or dosage forms are invalid and/or do not cover the product of the generic drug manufacturer. Also,
 counterclaims, as well as various independentactions, have been filed alleging that our assertions of, or attempts to en
force, patent rights with respect to certain products constitute unfair competition and/or violations ofantitrust laws. In addition to the challenges to the U.S.
 patents that are discussed below, patent rights to certain of our products are being challenged in various otherjurisdictions. We are also party to patent damages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers, payers, governments or other parties are seeking
damages from us for allegedly causing delay of generic entry. Additionally, our licensing and collaboration partners face challenges by generic drug manufacturers to patents
covering products for which we have licenses or co-promotion rights.
Pfizer Inc.
2020 Form 10-K 98 
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
We also are often involved in other proceedings, such as inter partes review, post-grant review, re-examination or opposition proceedings, before the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office, the European Patent Office, or o
ther foreign counterparts relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others. Also, if one of ourpatents is found to be invalid by such proceedings, generic or competitive products could be introduced into the market resulting in the erosion of
 sales of our existing products.For example, several of the patents in our pneumococcal vaccine portfolio were challenged in inter partes review and post-grant review proceedings in the U.S. In 2017, the
Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) initiated proceedings, which remain pending, with respect to two of our pneumococcal vaccine patents.
 However, the PTAB declined toinitiate proceedings as to two other pneumococcal vaccine patents. Various legal challenges to other pneumococcal vaccine patents remain pending in jurisdictions outside the
U.S. The invalidation of all of the patents in our pneumococcal portfolio could potentially allow a competitor’s pneumococcal vaccine into the marketplace. In the even
t that anyof the patents are found valid and infringed, a competitor’s pneumococcal vaccine might be prohibited from entering the market or a competitor might be required to pay us
 aroyalty.
We are also subject to patent litigation pursuant to which one or more third parties seek damages and/or injunctive relief to compensate for alleged infringement of its pa
tentsby our commercial or other activities. For example, our Hospira subsidiaries are involved in patent disputes over their attempts to bring generic pharmaceutical and biosimilar
products to market. If one of our marketed products is found 
to infringe valid patent rights of a third party, such third party may be awarded significant damages, or we may beprevented from further sales of that product. Such damages may be enhanced as
 much as three-fold if we or one of our subsidiaries is found to have willfully infringed validpatent rights of a third party.
Actions In Which We Are The Plaintiff
EpiPen
In 2010, King, which we acquired in 2011 and is a wholly-owned subsidiary, brought a patent-infringement action against Sandoz in the U.S. District Court for 
the District ofNew Jersey in connection with Sandoz’s abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) filed with the FDA seeking approval to market an epinephrine injectable product. Sandoz is
challenging patents, which expire in 2025, covering the next-generation autoinjector for use with epinephrine that is sold under the EpiPen brand name.
Xeljanz (tofacitinib)
Beginning in 2017, we brought patent-infringement actions against several generic manufacturers that filed separate ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to market their
generic versions of tofacitinib tablets in one or both of 5 mg and 10 mg dosage strengths
, and in both immediate and extended release forms. To date, we have settled actionswith several generic manufacturers on terms not material to Pfizer. The remaining actions continue in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware as described below.
In 2017, we brought a patent-infringement action against Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. and Cadila Healthcare Ltd. (collectively, Zydus) asserting the infringement and
validity of three patents: the patent covering the active ingredient expiring in December 2025 (the 2025 Paten
t), the patent covering an enantiomer of tofacitinib expiring in2022, and the patent covering a polymorphic form of tofacitinib expiring in 2023 (the 2023 Patent), which Zydus challenged in its 
ANDA seeking approval to market a genericversion of tofacitinib 5 mg tablets. In November 2020, we settled the case against
 Zydus on terms not material to Pfizer. In February 2021, we brought a separate patent-infringement action against Zydus asserting the infringement and validity of our composition of matter and crystalline form patents challenged by Zydus in its ANDA seeking
approval to market a generic version of tofacitinib 22 mg extended release tablets.
In 2018, we brought a separate patent infringement action against Teva Pharmaceuticals USA,
 Inc. (Teva) asserting the infringement and validity of our patent coveringextended release formulations of tofacitinib that was challenged by Teva in its ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of tofacitinib 11 mg ex
tended releasetablets.
In January 2021, we brought a separate patent-infringement action against Aurobindo Pharma Limited (Aurobindo) asserting the infringement and validity of the 2025 Pa
tentand the 2023 Patent, which Aurobindo challenged in its ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of tofacitinib 5 mg and
 10 mg tablets.Inlyta (axitinib)
In 2019, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Limited (Glenmark) notified us that it had filed an ANDA with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of Inlyta
. Glenmarkasserts the invalidity and non-infringement of the crystalline form patent for Inlyta that expires in 2030. In
 June 2019, we filed suit against Glenmark in the U.S. District Court forthe District of Delaware, asserting the validity and infringement of the crystalline form patent for Inlyta.
Ibrance (palbociclib)
In March 2019, several generic companies notified us that they had filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of 
Ibrance. The generic companiesassert the invalidity and non-infringement of two composition of matter patents, one of which expires in 2023 and one o
f which expires in 2027, as a result of a U.S. PatentTerm Extension certificate issued in January 2021, and a method of use patent covering palbociclib, which expires in 2023. In April 2019, we brought
 patent infringementactions against each of the generic filers in various federal courts, asserting the validity and infringement of the patents
 challenged by the generic companies. Beginning inSeptember 2020, we received correspondence from several generic companies notifying us that they would seek approval to market generic versions of Ibrance. The generic
companies assert the invalidity and non-infringement of our crystalline form patent which expires in 2034. Beginning in October 2020, we brought patent infringement actions
against each of these generic companies in various federal courts, asserting the validity and infringement of the crystalline form patent.
Lyrica (pregabalin)
•
U.K.In June 2014, Generics (U.K.) Ltd (trading as Mylan) filed an invalidity action against the Lyrica pain use patent in the
 High Court of Justice in London. Subsequently, ActavisGroup PTC ehf filed an invalidity action in the same court, and Pfizer sued Actavis 
Group PTC ehf, Actavis U.K. Ltd and Caduceus Pharma Ltd (together, Actavis) forinfringement and requested preliminary relief. Our request for preliminary relief was denied in a January 2015 hearing, and the denial subsequently was confirmed on appeal.
Pfizer Inc.
2020 Form 10-K 99 
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
In February 2015, the National Health Service (NHS) England was ordered by the High Court, as an intermediary, to issue guidance for prescribers and pharmacists directing
the prescription and dispensing of Lyrica by brand when pregabalin was prescribed for the treatment of neuropathic pain. NHS Wales and NHS Northern Ireland also issued
prescribing guidance. The guidance to prescribe and dispense Lyrica for neuropathic pain was withdrawn upon patent expiration in July 2017.
We also filed infringement actions against (i) Teva UK Ltd, and (ii) Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories (UK) Ltd and Caduceus Pharma Ltd (together, Dr. Reddy’s) in February 2015,
seeking the same relief as in the action against Actavis. Dr. Reddy’s filed an invalidity counterclaim. These actions were stayed pending the outcome of
 the Mylan and Actaviscases.
The Mylan and Actavis invalidity actions were heard in the High Court at the same time as the Actavis infringement action. The High Court ruled against us,
 holding that theasserted claims were either not infringed or invalid, and appeals followed. In November 2018, the U.K. Supreme Court ruled that all the relevant claims directed to neuropathic
pain were invalid.
In October 2015, after Sandoz GmbH and Sandoz L
td (together, Sandoz) launched a full label generic pregabalin product, we obtained from the High Court a preliminaryinjunction enjoining Sandoz from further sales of the product and ordering Sandoz to identify the parties holding its product. 
Sandoz identified wholesaler AAH PharmaceuticalsLtd and pharmacy chain Lloyds Pharmacy Ltd (supplied by AAH), and we requested that these parties cease 
further sales and withdraw the Sandoz full label product. InOctober 2015, Lloyds was added to the Sandoz action, and
 we obtained a preliminary order from the High Court requiring Lloyds to advise its pharmacists that the Sandoz fulllabel product should not be dispensed. In November 2015, the High Court confirmed the preliminary injunction against Sandoz and Lloyds. Sandoz filed an invalidity
counterclaim. Upon agreement of the parties, in December 2015, the proceedings against Lloyds were discontinued, and the proceedings against Sandoz were stayed pending
outcome of the Mylan and Actavis cases. The preliminary injunction against Sandoz remained in place until patent expiration in July 2017.
In May 2020, Dr. Reddy’s filed a claim for damages in connection with the above-referenced legal actions. In July 2020, the Sco
ttish Ministers and fourteen Scottish HealthBoards (together, NHS Scotland) filed a claim for damages in connection with the above-referenced legal action concerning Sandoz. In September 2020, Teva
, Sandoz,Ranbaxy, Inc. (Ranbaxy), Actavis, and the Secretary of S
tate for Health and Social Care, together with 32 other National Health Service entities (together, NHS England,Wales, and Northern Ireland) filed claims for damages in the above-referenced legal actions. In November 2020, we and Mylan completed the transaction to spin-off our
Upjohn Business and combine it with Mylan to form Viatris. As part of the transaction, Viatris has agreed 
to assume, and to indemnify Pfizer for, liabilities arising out of thismatter.
◦
JapanIn January 2017, Sawai Pharmaceutical Company Limited (a Japanese generic company) (Sawai) filed an invalidation action against the Lyrica pain use patent in the
Japanese Patent Office (JPO). Hexal AG has 
filed a separate invalidation action that was stayed pending the result of the Sawai action. Multiple parties were allowed tointervene in the Sawai case. In July 2020, the JPO recognized the
 validity of certain amended claims of the patent covering Lyrica. We are appealing the decision. In August2020, the Japanese regulatory authority granted regulatory approval to multiple generic companies and we filed legal actions against the generic companies seeking
preliminary and permanent injunctions to prevent infringement of our patent. In November 2020, we and Mylan completed the transaction to spin-off our Upjohn Business and
combine it with Mylan to form Viatris. As part of the transaction, Viatris has agreed to
 assume, and to indemnify Pfizer for, liabilities arising out of this matter.Matter Involving Our Collaboration/Licensing Partners
Eliquis
In February, March, and April 2017, twenty-five generic companies sent BMS Paragraph-IV certification letters informing BMS that they
 had filed ANDAs seeking approval ofgeneric versions of Eliquis, challenging the validity and infringement of one or more of the three patents listed in the Orange Book
 for Eliquis. One of the patents expired inDecember 2019 and the remaining patents currently are set to expire in 2026 and 2031. Eliquis has been jointly developed and is being commercialized by BMS and Pfizer. In
April 2017, BMS and Pfizer filed patent-infringement actions against all generic filers in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware and the U.S
. District Court for theDistrict of West Virginia, asserting that each of the generic companies’ proposed products would infringe each of the patent(s) tha
t each generic filer challenged. Some genericfilers challenged only the 2031 patent, some challenged both the 2031 and 2026 patent
, and one generic company challenged all three patents. In August 2020, the U.S.District Court for the District of Delaware ruled that both the 2026 patent and the 2031
 patent are valid and infringed by the proposed generic products. In August andSeptember 2020, the generic filers appealed the District Court’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
the Federal Circuit. Prior to the August 2020 ruling, we and BMSsettled with certain of the generic companies on terms not material to Pfizer, and we and BMS may se
ttle with other generic companies in the future.A2. Legal Proceedings––Product Litigation
We are defendants in numerous cases, including but not limited to those discussed below, related to our pharmaceutical and other products. 
Plaintiffs in these cases seekdamages and other relief on various grounds for alleged personal injury and economic loss.
Asbestos
Between 1967 and 1982, Warner-Lambert owned American Optical Corporation (American Optical), which manufactured and sold respiratory protective devices and asbestos
safety clothing. In connection with the sale of American Optical in 1982, Warner-Lambert agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain liabilities, including certain asbestos-
related and other claims. Warner-Lambert was acquired by Pfizer in 2000 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer. Warner-Lambert is actively engaged in the defense of,
and will continue to explore various means of resolving, these claims.
Numerous lawsuits against American Optical, Pfizer and certain of its previously owned subsidiaries are pending in various federal and state courts seeking damages for
alleged personal injury from exposure to products allegedly containing asbestos and other allegedly hazardous materials sold by Pfizer and certain of its previously owned
subsidiaries.
There also are a small number of lawsuits pending in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged exposure to asbestos in facilities owned or formerly owned
by Pfizer or its subsidiaries.

Effexor
Beginning in May 2011, actions, including purported class actions, were filed in various federal courts against Wyeth and, in certain of the actions,
 affiliates of Wyeth andcertain other defendants relating to Effexor XR, which is the extended-release formulation of Ef
fexor. The plaintiffs in each of the class actions seek to represent a classconsisting of all persons in the U.S. and its territories who directly purchased, indirectly purchased or reimbursed patients for the purchase of Effexor XR or generic Ef
fexor XRfrom any of the defendants from June 14, 2008 until the
 time the defendants’ allegedly unlawful conduct ceased. The plaintiffs in all of the actions allege delay in the launch ofgeneric Effexor XR in the U.S. and its territories, in violation of federal antitrust laws and, in certain o
f the actions, the antitrust, consumer protection and various other laws ofcertain states, as the result of Wyeth fraudulently obtaining and improperly listing certain patents for Ef
fexor XR in the Orange Book, enforcing certain patents for Effexor XRand entering into a litigation settlement agreement with a generic drug manufacturer with respect to Effexor XR. Each
 of the plaintiffs seeks treble damages (for itself in theindividual actions or on behalf of the putative class in the purported class actions) for alleged price overcharges for Effexor XR or generic Effexor 
XR in the U.S. and itsterritories since June 14, 2008. All of these actions have been consolidated in the U.S
. District Court for the District of New Jersey.In October 2014, the District Court dismissed the direct purchaser plaintiffs’ claims based on the litigation settlement agreement, but declined to dismiss the o
ther directpurchaser plaintiff claims. In January 2015, the District Court entered partial final judgments as to all settlement agreement claims, including those asserted by direct
purchasers and end-payer plaintiffs, which plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
 Third Circuit. In August 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuitreversed the District Court’s decisions and remanded the claims to the District Court.

Antitrust ActionsBeginning in November 2011, purported class actions relating to Lipitor were filed in various federal courts against, among others, Pfizer, certain Pfizer affiliates, and, in most
of the actions, Ranbaxy and certain Ranbaxy affiliates. The plaintiffs in these various actions seek
 to represent nationwide, multi-state or statewide classes consisting ofpersons or entities who directly purchased, indirectly purchased or reimbursed patients for the purchase of Lipitor (or, in certain of the actions, generic Lipitor) from any of the
defendants from March 2010 until the cessation of the defendants’ allegedly unlawful conduct (the Class Period). The plaintiffs allege delay in the
 launch of generic Lipitor, inviolation of federal antitrust laws and/or state antitrust, consumer protection and various other laws, resulting from (i) the 2008 agreement pursuant to which P
fizer andRanbaxy settled certain patent litigation involving Lipitor and Pfizer granted Ranbaxy a license to sell a generic version of Lipitor in various markets beginning on varying dates,
and (ii) in certain of the actions, the procurement and/or enforcement of certain patents for Lipitor. 
Each of the actions seeks, among other things, treble damages on behalf ofthe putative class for alleged price overcharges for Lipitor (or, in certain of the actions, generic Lipitor) during the Class Period. In addition, individual actions have been filed
against Pfizer, Ranbaxy and certain of their affiliates, among others, that assert
 claims and seek relief for the plaintiffs that are substantially similar to the claims asserted andthe relief sought in the purported class actions described above. These various actions have been consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in a Multi-District Litigation (
In re Lipitor Antitrust Litigation MDL-2332
) in the U.S. District  Court for the District of New Jersey.In September 2013 and 2014, the District Court dismissed with prejudice the claims of the direct purchasers. In October and November 2014, 
the District Court dismissed withprejudice the claims of all other Multi-District Litigation plaintiffs. All plaintiffs have appealed the District Court’s orders dismissing their claims with prejudice to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Third Circuit. In addition, the direct purchaser class plaintiffs appealed the order denying their motion to amend the judgment and 
for leave to amend theircomplaint to the Court of Appeals. In August 2017,
 the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court’s decisions and remanded the claims to the District Court.Also, in January 2013, the State of West
 Virginia filed an action in West Virginia state court against Pfizer and Ranbaxy, among others, that asserts claims and seeks relief onbehalf of the State of West 
Virginia and residents of that state that are substantially similar to the claims asserted and the relief sought in the purported class actions describedabove.
•
Personal Injury ActionsA number of individual and multi-plaintiff lawsuits have been filed against Pfizer in various federal and state courts alleging that the plaintiffs developed type 2 diabetes
purportedly as a result of the ingestion of Lipitor. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages.
In February 2014, the federal actions were transferred for consolidated pre-trial proceedings to a Multi-District Litigation (
In re Lipitor (Atorvastatin Calcium) Marketing, Sales Practices and Products Liability Litigation (No. II) MDL-2502
) in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina. Since 2016, certain cases in the Multi-District Litigationwere remanded to certain state courts. In January 2017, the District Court granted our motion for summary judgment, dismissing substantially all of the remaining cases
pending in the Multi-District Litigation. In January 2017, the plaintiffs appealed the District Court’s decision to the U.S. Court of
 Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. In June 2018, theCourt of Appeals affirmed the District Court’s decision. In November 2020, we and Mylan completed the transaction to spin-off our Upjohn Business and combine it with Mylan
to form Viatris. As part of the transaction, Viatris has agreed 
to assume, and to indemnify Pfizer for, liabilities arising out of this matter.Viagra
Since April 2016, a Multi-District Litigation has been pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (
In Re: Viagra (Sildenafil Citrate) Products Liability Litigation, MDL-2691
), in which plaintiffs allege that they developed melanoma and/or the exacerbation of melanoma purportedly as a result of the ingestion of Viagra.Additional cases filed against Lilly with respect to Cialis have also been consolidated in the Multi-District Litigation 
(In re: Viagra (Sildenafil Citrate) and Cialis (Tadalafil) Products Liability Litigation, MDL-2691
). In January 2020, the District Court granted our and Lilly’s motion to exclude all of plaintiffs’ general causation opinions. As a result, in April 2020, the District Court entered summary judgment in favor of defendants and dismissed all of plaintiffs’ claims. In April 2020, plaintiffs filed a notice of
 appeal in the U.S.Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In November 2020, we and Mylan completed the transaction to spin-off our Upjohn Business and
 combine it with Mylan to form Viatris.As part of the transaction, Viatris has agreed to assume, and
 to indemnify Pfizer for, liabilities arising out of this matter.Pfizer Inc.

EpiPen
Beginning in February 2017, purported class actions were filed in various federal courts by indirect purchasers of EpiPen against Pfizer, and/or its affiliates King and Meridian,
and/or various entities affiliated with Mylan, and Mylan Chief Executive Officer, Heather Bresch. The plaintiffs in these ac
tions seek to represent U.S. nationwide classescomprising persons or entities who paid for any portion of the end-user purchase price of an EpiPen between 2009 until the cessation of
 the defendants’ allegedly unlawfulconduct. In February 2020, a similar lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas against 
Pfizer, King, Meridian and the Mylan entities on behalf of apurported U.S. nationwide class of direct purchaser plaintiffs who purchased EpiPen devices directly from the defendants (the 2020 Lawsuit). Against
 Pfizer and/or its affiliates,plaintiffs in these actions generally allege that Pfizer’s and/or its affiliates’ settlement of patent litigation regarding EpiPen delayed market entry o
f generic EpiPen in violation offederal antitrust laws and various state antitrust laws. At least one lawsuit also alleges that P
fizer and/or Mylan violated the federal Racketeer Influenced and CorruptOrganizations Act (RICO). Plaintiffs also filed various federal antitrust, state consumer protection and unjust enrichment claims against, and relating to conduc
t attributablesolely to, Mylan and/or its affiliates regarding EpiPen. Plaintiffs seek treble damages for alleged overcharges for EpiPen since 2011. In
 August 2017, all of these actions, exceptfor the 2020 Lawsuit, were consolidated for coordinated pre-trial proceedings in a Multi-District Litigation (
In re: EpiPen (Epinephrine Injection, USP) Marketing, Sales Practices and Antitrust Litigation, MDL-2785
) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas with other EpiPen-related actions against Mylan and/or its  affiliates to which Pfizer, Kingand Meridian are not parties.
In July 2020, a new lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado on behalf of
 indirect purchasers. Plaintiff represents a putative U.S. nationwide classof persons or entities who paid for any portion of the end-user purchase price of certain refill or replacement EpiPens since 2010. Plaintiff alleges that
 Pfizer and Meridianmisrepresented the shelf-life and expiration date of EpiPen, in violation of the federal RICO statute
. Plaintiff seeks treble damages for alleged unnecessary replacement or refillpurchases of EpiPens by members of the putative class.
Nexium 24HR and Protonix
A number of individual and multi-plaintiff lawsuits have been filed against Pfizer, certain of its subsidiaries and/or other pharmaceutical manufacturers in various federal and
state courts alleging that the plaintiffs developed kidney-related injuries purportedly as a result of the ingestion of certain proton pump inhibitors. The cases against 
Pfizerinvolve Protonix and/or Nexium 24HR and seek compensatory and punitive damages and, in some cases, treble damages, restitution or disgorgement. In August 2017,
 thefederal actions were ordered transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a Multi-District Litigation (
In re: Proton-Pump Inhibitor Products Liability Litigation  (No. II)) in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. In 2019, we and GS
K combined our respective consumer healthcare businesses into a new Consumer Healthcare JV thatoperates globally under the GSK Consumer Healthcare name. As part of the JV transaction,
 the JV has agreed to assume, and to indemnify Pfizer for, liabilities arising out ofsuch litigation to the extent related to Nexium 24HR.
Docetaxel
•
Personal Injury ActionsA number of lawsuits have been filed against Hospira and Pfizer in various federal and state courts alleging that plaintiffs who were treated with Docetaxel developed
permanent hair loss. The significant majority of the cases also name other defendants, including the manufacturer of the branded product
, Taxotere. Plaintiffs seekcompensatory and punitive damages.
In October 2016, the federal cases were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a Multi-District Litigation (
In re Taxotere (Docetaxel) Products Liability Litigation, MDL-2740
) in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. •
Mississippi Attorney General Government ActionIn October 2018, the Attorney General of Mississippi filed a complaint in Mississippi state court against the manufacturer of
 the branded product and eight other manufacturersincluding Pfizer and Hospira, alleging, with respect to Pfizer and Hospira, a failure to warn about a risk of permanent hair loss in violation of the Mississippi Consumer
Protection Act. The action seeks civil penalties and injunctive relief.
Array Securities Litigation
In November 2017, two purported class actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado alleging that Array, which we acquired in July 2019 and is our
wholly owned subsidiary, and certain of its former officers violated federal securities laws in connection with certain disclosures made, or omitted, by Array regarding the NRAS-
mutant melanoma program. In March 2018, the actions were consolidated into a single proceeding.
Zantac
A number of lawsuits have been filed against Pfizer in various federal and state courts alleging that plaintiffs developed various types o
f cancer, or face an increased risk ofdeveloping cancer, purportedly as a result of the ingestion of Zantac. The significant majority of these cases
 also name other defendants that have historically manufacturedand/or sold Zantac. Pfizer has not sold Zantac since 2006, and only sold an
 OTC version of the product. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages and, in somecases, treble damages, restitution or disgorgement.
In February 2020, the federal actions were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a Multi-District Litigation (
In re Zantac/Ranitidine NDMA Litigation, MDL-2924 ) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. From June to December 2020: (i) plaintiffs in the Multi-District Litigation filed against Pfizer and many other
defendants a consolidated consumer class action complaint alleging, among other things, violations of the RICO statute and
 consumer protection statutes of all 50 states, anda consolidated third-party payor class action complaint alleging violation of the RICO statute and seeking reimbursement for payments made for the prescription version of
Zantac; (ii) Pfizer received service of two Canadian class action complaints naming Pfizer and other defendants, and seeking compensatory and punitive damages for personal

A3. Legal Proceedings––Commercial and Other Matters
Monsanto-Related Matters
In 1997, Monsanto Company (Former Monsanto) contributed certain chemical manufacturing operations and facilities to a newly formed corporation, Solutia Inc. (Solutia), and
spun off the shares of Solutia. In 2000,
 Former Monsanto merged with Pharmacia & Upjohn Company to form Pharmacia. Pharmacia then transferred its agricultural operationsto a newly created subsidiary, named Monsanto Company (New Monsanto), which it spun off in a two-stage process that was completed in 2002. Pharmacia was acquired by
Pfizer in 2003 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer.
In connection with its spin-off that was completed in 2002, New Monsanto assumed, and agreed to
 indemnify Pharmacia for, any liabilities related to Pharmacia’s formeragricultural business. New Monsanto has defended and/or is defending Pharmacia in connection with various claims and litigation arising out of, or related to, the agricultural
business, and has been indemnifying Pharmacia when liability has been imposed or settlement has been reached regarding such claims and litigation.
In connection with its spin-off in 1997, Solutia assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, liabilities related to Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses. As the result of
its reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, Solutia’s indemnification obligations relating to Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses are primarily limited
to sites that Solutia has owned or operated. In addition, in connec
tion with its spin-off that was completed in 2002, New Monsanto assumed, and agreed to indemnifyPharmacia for, any liabilities primarily related to Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses, including, but not limited to, any such liabilities that Solutia assumed. Solutia’s and
New Monsanto’s assumption of, and agreement to indemnify Pharmacia for, these liabilities apply to pending actions and any future actions related to Former Monsanto’s
chemical businesses in which Pharmacia is named as a defendant, including, without limitation, actions asserting environmental claims, including alleged exposure to
polychlorinated biphenyls. Solutia and/or New Monsanto are defending Pharmacia in connection with various claims and litigation arising out of, or related to, Former
Monsanto’s chemical businesses, and have been indemnifying Pharmacia when liability has been imposed or settlement has been reached regarding such claims and
litigation.
Environmental Matters
In 2009, we submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) a corrective measures study report with regard to Pharmacia’s discontinued industrial chemicalfacility in North Haven, Connecticut. In September 2010, our corrective measures study report was approved by the EP
A, and we commenced construction of the site remedyin late 2011 under an Updated Administrative Order on Consent with the EPA. In
 September 2019, the EPA acknowledged that construction of the site remedy has beencompleted.
Also in 2009, we submitted a revised site-wide feasibility study with regard to Wyeth Holdings Corporation’s (formerly, American Cyanamid Company) discontinued industrial
chemical facility in Bound Brook, New Jersey. In July 2011, Wyeth Holdings Corporation executed an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent 
for RemovalAction (the 2011 Administrative Settlement Agreement) with the EPA with regard to 
the Bound Brook facility. In accordance with the 2011 Administrative SettlementAgreement, we completed construction of an interim remedy to address the discharge of impacted groundwater from the facility to the Raritan River. In 
September 2012, theEPA issued a final remediation plan for the Bound Brook facility’s main plant area, which is generally in accordance with one of the remedies evaluated in our revised site-wide
feasibility study. In March 2013, Wyeth Holdings Corporation (now Wyeth Holdings LLC) entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent with the
EPA to allow us to undertake detailed engineering design of the remedy for the main plant area and 
to perform a focused feasibility study for two adjacent lagoons. InSeptember 2015, the U.S., on behalf of 
the EPA, filed a complaint and consent decree with the federal District Court for the District of New Jersey that allows Wyeth HoldingsLLC to complete the design and to implement the remedy for the main plant area. The consent decree (which supersedes the 2011
 Administrative Settlement Agreement) wasentered by the District Court in December 2015. In September 2018, the EPA
 issued a final remediation plan for the two adjacent lagoons, which is generally in accordancewith one of the remedies evaluated in our focused feasibility study, and, in September 2019, Wye
th Holdings LLC entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement andOrder on Consent with the EPA to allow us to undertake detailed engineering design of the
 remedy for the lagoons.We have accrued for the estimated costs of the site remedies for the
 North Haven and Bound Brook facilities.We are a party to a number of other proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as
 amended, and otherstate, local or foreign laws in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past and/or future remediation.
Contracts with Iraqi Ministry of Health
In October 2017, a number of U.S. service members, civilians, and their families brought a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the
 District of Columbia against a number ofpharmaceutical and medical devices companies, including Pfizer and certain of its subsidiaries, alleging that the defendants violated the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act. The complaint
alleges that the defendants provided funding for terrorist organizations through their sales practices pursuant to pharmaceutical and medical device contracts with the Iraqi
Ministry of Health, and seeks monetary relief. In July 2020, the District Court granted defendants’ motions to dismiss and dismissed all of plaintiffs’ claims. The plaintiffs are
appealing the District Court’s decision.
Allergan Complaint for Indemnity
In August 2018, Pfizer was named as a defendant in a
 third-party complaint for indemnity, along with King, filed by Allergan Finance LLC (Allergan) in a Multi-District Litigation(
In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation MDL 2804) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The lawsuit asserted claims for indemnity related to Kadian, which was owned for a short period by King in 2008, prior to Pfizer's acquisition of King in 2010. In December 2018, the
 District Court dismissed the lawsuit. In February 2019,Allergan filed a similar complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, asserting claims for indemnity related to Kadian. That suit was voluntarily discontinued without
prejudice in January 2021.
Breach of Contract––Xalkori/Lorbrena
We
 are a defendant in a breach of contract action brought by New York University (NYU) in the Supreme Court of the State of New York (Supreme Court). NYU alleges that itis

A4. Legal Proceedings––Government Investigations
We are subject to extensive regulation by government agencies in the U.S., other developed markets and multiple emerging markets in which we operate. Criminal charges,
substantial fines and/or civil penalties, limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, corporate integrity or deferred prosecution agreements, as well
as reputational harm and increased public interest in the matter could result from government investigations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we do business. In
addition, in a qui tam lawsuit in which the government declines to intervene, the relator may still pursue a suit for the recovery of civil damages and penalties on behalf of
 thegovernment. Among the investigations by government agencies are the matters discussed below.
Greenstone Investigations
•
U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division InvestigationSince July 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust
 Division has been investigating our former Greenstone generics business. We believe this is related to an ongoingbroader antitrust investigation of the generic pharmaceutical industry. The government has been obtaining information from Greenstone relating to this investigation.
•
State Attorneys General Generics Antitrust LitigationIn April 2018, Greenstone received requests for information from the Antitrust Department of the
 Connecticut Office of the Attorney General. In May 2019, Attorneys General ofmore than 40 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico filed a complaint against a number of pharmaceutical companies, including Greenstone and Pfizer. The
matter has been consolidated with a Multi-District Litigation (
In re: Generic Pharmaceuticals Pricing Antitrust Litigation MDL No. 2724)  in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. As to Greenstone and Pfizer, the complaint alleges anticompetitive conduct in violation of federal and s
tate antitrust laws and state consumer protection laws. In June 2020, theState Attorneys General filed a new complaint against a large number of companies, including Greenstone and Pfizer, making similar allegations, but concerning a new set of
drugs. This complaint was transferred to the Multi-District Litigation in July 2020.
Subpoena relating to Manufacturing of Quillivant XR
In October 2018, we received a subpoena from the U.S. A
ttorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) seeking records relating to our relationship with anotherdrug manufacturer and its production and manufacturing of drugs including, but not limited to, Quillivant XR. We have produced records pursuant to
 the subpoena.Government Inquiries relating to Meridian Medical Technologies
In February 2019, we received a civil investigative demand from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the
 SDNY. The civil investigative demand seeks records and information relatedto alleged quality issues involving the manufacture of auto-injectors at our Meridian site. In August 2019, we received a HIPA
A subpoena from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for theEastern District of Missouri seeking similar records and information. We are producing records in response to these requests.
U.S. Department of Justice/SEC Inquiry relating to Russian Operations
In June 2019, we received an informal request from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) Unit seeking documents
 relating to our operationsin Russia. In September 2019, we received a similar request from the SEC’s FCPA Unit. We have produced records pursuant to these

Hormone Therapy Consumer Class Action
A certified consumer class action was pending against Wyeth in the U.S. District Court for the Sou
thern District of California based on the alleged off-label marketing of itshormone therapy products. The case was originally filed in December 2003. The class consisted of California consumers who purchased Wyeth’s hormone-replacement
products between January 1995 and January 2003 and who did not seek personal injury damages therefrom. The class sought compensatory and punitive damages, including
a full refund of the purchase price. In March 2020, the parties reached an agreement, and
 obtained preliminary court approval, to resolve this matter for $200 million, which waspaid in full in the second quarter of 2020.
B. Guarantees and Indemnifications
In the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses and
 other transactions, we often indemnify our counterparties against certainliabilities that may arise in connection with the transaction or that are related to events and activities prior to or following a transaction. If
 the indemnified party were to make asuccessful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we may be required to reimburse the loss. These indemnifications are generally subject to various restrictions
and limitations. Historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of December 31, 2020, the estimated fair value of 
these indemnificationobligations was not significant.
In addition, in connection with our entry into certain agreements and other transactions, our counterparties may agree to indemnify us. For example, our collaboration
agreement with EMD Serono, Inc. to co-promote Rebif in the U.S. expired at the
 end of 2015 and included certain indemnity provisions. Patent litigation brought by Biogen IdecMA Inc. against EMD Serono Inc. and Pfizer is pending in the U.
S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.EMD Serono Inc. has acknowledged that it is obligated to satisfy any award of
 damages.We have also guaranteed the long-term debt of certain companies that we acquired and that now are subsidiaries of Pfizer. 
See Note 7D . C. Certain Commitments
•
As of December 31, 2020, we had agreements totaling $3.8 billion to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and include amounts relating toadvertising, information technology services, employee benefit administration services, and potential milestone payments deemed reasonably likely to occur.
•
See Note 5A for information on the TCJA repatriation tax liability. D. Contingent Consideration for Acquisitions
We may be required to make payments to sellers for certain prior business combinations that are contingent upon future events or outcomes. 
See Note 1D . The estimated fair value of contingent consideration as of December 31, 2020 is $689 million, of which $123 million is recorded in 
Other current liabilities  and $566 million in Other noncurrent liabilities 
and $711 million, of which $160 million is recorded in Other current liabilities  and $551 million in Other noncurrent liabilities as of December 31, 2019. The decrease in the contingent consideration balance from December 31, 2019 is primarily due to payments made upon the achievement of certain sales-based milestones, partially offset by
fair value adjustments.
E. Insurance
Our insurance coverage reflects market conditions (including cost and availability) existing at the time it is written, and our decision to obtain insurance coverage or to self-
insure varies accordingly. Depending upon the cost and availability of insurance and the nature of the risk involved, the amount of self-insurance may be significant. The cost
and availability of coverage have resulted in self-insuring certain exposures, including product liability.
 If we incur substantial liabilities that are not covered by insurance orsubstantially exceed insurance coverage and that are in excess of existing accruals, there could be a material adverse effect on our cash
 flows or results of operations in theperiod in which the amounts are paid and/or accrued.

en Pfizer and Mylan for generic drugs in Japan (Mylan-Japan) and we transferred the operations that were part of the Mylan-Japan collaboration to Viatris. Beginning in the fourthquarter of 2020, the fina
ncial results of the Upjohn Business and the Mylan-Japan collaboration are reported as Income from discontinued  operations––net of tax for all periods presented. Prior- period financialinformation has been resta
ted, as appropriate. Prior to the separation of the Upjohn Business, and beginning in 2020, Upjohn began managing our Meridian subsidiary, the manufacturer of EpiPen and other auto-injector products, and the Myla
n-Japan collaboration. As a result, revenues associated with our Meridian subsidiary, except for product revenues for EpiPen sold in Canada, and Mylan-Japan were reported inUpjohn beginning in th
e first quarter of 2020. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, the results of our Meridian subsidiary are reported in the Hospital therapeutic area for all periods presented in our consolidatedfinancial statements.
Biosimilars are highly similar versions of a
pproved and authorized biological medicines and primarily include revenues from Inflectra/Remsima, Retacrit, Ruxience and Zirabev.Hospital is a therapeutic area t
hat commercializes our global portfolio of sterile injectable and anti-infective medicines. Hospital also includes Pfizer CentreOne. All other Hospital primarily includes rev enues fromlegacy Sterile Injectable Pharmac
euticals (SIP) products (that are not anti-infective products) and, to a much lesser extent, solid oral dose products (that are not anti-infective products). SIP anti-infective productsthat are not individually listed 
above are recorded in “All other Anti-infectives”.Pfizer CentreOne includes reven
ues from our contract manufacturing and active pharmaceutical ingredient sales operation, including sterile injectables contract manufacturing, and revenues related to ourmanufacturing and supply agree
ments.On July 31, 2019, our Consum
er Healthcare business, an OTC medicines business, was combined with GSK’s consumer healthcare business to form a new consumer healthcare JV. See Note 2C . Total Sterile Injectable Pharmaceutic
als represents the total of all branded and generic injectable products in the Hospital therapeutic area, including anti-infective sterile injectable pharmaceuticals. Contract Liabilities
Our contract liabilities primarily relate to advance payments received or receivable in connection with contracts that we entered into during 2020 with various government or
government sponsored customers in international markets for supply of BNT162b2. The deferred revenue associated with these advance payments totals approximately $957
million as of December 31, 2020 and are recorded in 
Other current liabilities . The deferred revenue will be recognized in Revenues  proportionately as we deliver doses of the vaccine to our customers and satisfy our performance obligation under the contracts, which we expect to fully occur during 2021. Contract liabilities associated with other
customer contracts were not significant as of December 31, 2020 or 2019.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm onInternal Control Over Financial Reporting
The Board of Directors and Sha
reholders of Pfizer Inc.:Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in
Internal Control
— Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets ofPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated sta
tements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cashflows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes
 (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our reportdated February 25, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with
respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
 Commission and thePCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAO
B. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance aboutwhether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating ef
fectivenessof internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that
our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
 dispositions of the assets ofthe company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
 thecompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation o
f effectiveness tofuture periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or proceduresmay deteriorate.

r Financial ReportingThe management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of

being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely

t on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation o
f effectiveness tofuture periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or 
that the degree of compliance with the policies or proceduresmay deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment,
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

 its 0.250% Notes due 2022 (the “2022 notes”) and its 1.000% Notes due 2027 (the “2027 notes” and together with the2022 notes, the “notes”) registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The following descriptions of our commonstock and the notes are summaries and do not purport to be complete. The description of
 our common stock is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to ourrestated certificate of incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”), and our bylaws, as amended (the “Bylaws”), and the description of the notes is subject
 to and qualified inits entirety by reference to the base indenture (as defined below) and the ninth supplemental indenture (as defined below), each of which are exhibits to
 the Annual Report onForm 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.23 is a part. We encourage you to read our Certificate of
 Incorporation, our Bylaws, the applicable provisions of the Delaware GeneralCorporation Law (the “DGCL”), the base indenture and the ninth supplemental indenture for additional information. References in this section to “Pfizer,” “we,” “us” and “our”
are to Pfizer Inc., unless otherwise stated or the context
 so requires.DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK
Common Stock
Under the Certificate of Incorporation, we are authorized to issue up to 12 billion shares of common stock, par value $0.05 per share.
 The common stock is not redeemable,does not have any conversion rights and is not subject to call. Holders of shares of common stock have
 no preemptive rights to maintain their percentage of ownership in futureofferings or sales of our stock. Holders of shares of common stock have one vote per share in all elections of
 Directors and on all other matters submitted to a vote of ourstockholders. The holders of common stock are entitled to receive dividends, if any, as and when may be declared from time to 
time by our Board of Directors, out of fundslegally available therefor. Upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs, the holders of common stock will be entitled to participate equally and ratably, in proportion
to the number of shares held, in our net assets available for distribution to holders of common stock. The
 shares of common stock currently outstanding are fully paid andnonassessable. The common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYS
E”) under the trading symbol “PFE.”Preferred Stock
Under the Certificate of Incorporation, we are authorized to issue up to 27 million shares of preferred stock, without par value. The preferred stock
 may be issued in one ormore series, and the Board of Directors of Pfizer is expressly authorized (i) to fix the descriptions, powers, preferences, rights, qualifications, limitations, and restrictions with
respect to any series of preferred stock and (ii) to specify the number of shares of any series of
 preferred stock.Anti-takeover Effects of the Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws and Delaware Law
Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws
. Various provisions contained in the Certificate of Incorporation and the By-laws could delay or discourage some transactions involving an actual or potential change in control of us or a change in our management and may limit the ability of our stockholders to remove current management or approve
transactions that our stockholders may deem to be in their best interests. Among other 
things, these provisions:•
limit the right of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders to holders of at least 10% of the total number of shares of stock entitled to vote on the matter tobe brought before the proposed special meeting;
•
authorize our Board of Directors to establish one or more series of preferred stock without stockholder approval; •
authorize the Board to issue dividends in the form of stock purchase or similar rights, including rights that would have the effect  of making an attempt to acquire usmore costly;
•
grant to the Board of Directors, and not to the  stockholders, the sole power to set the number of Directors;•
require that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected a t a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and may notbe effected by any consent in writing; and
•
subject to the rights of the holders of any one or more series of preferred stock then outstanding, allow our Directors, and not our stockholders, to fill vacancies on ourBoard of Directors, including vacancies resulting from the removal of one or more Directors or an increase in the number of Directors constituting the whole Board of
Directors.
1

Delaware Law. We are a Delaware corporation and consequently are also subject to certain anti-takeover provisions of the DGCL. Subject to certain exceptions,  Section 203 ofthe DGCL prevents a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a “business combination” with any “interested stockholder” for three years following the date that the
person became an interested stockholder, unless (a) the interested stockholder attained such status with the approval of
 the corporation’s board of directors, (b) uponconsummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested
 stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of thecorporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, exclusive of shares owned by directors who are also officers and by certain employee stock plans or (c) at
 orsubsequent to such time, the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized by 
the affirmative vote at a stockholders’ meeting, and not by writtenconsent, of at least 66-2/3% of the ou
tstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder. A “business combination” includes, among other things, a mergeror consolidation involving the corporation and the “interested stockholder” and the sale of more than 10% of the corporation’s assets. In
 general, an “interested stockholder” isany entity or person beneficially owning 15% or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock, and any entity or person af
filiated with or controlling or controlled by suchentity or person. Section 203 makes it more difficult for an interested stockholder to ef
fect various business combinations with a corporation for a three-year period. This statutecould prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts not approved in advance by our Board of Directors, and, as a result,
 could discourage attemptsto acquire us, which could depress the market price of our common stock.
DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES
Reference should be made to the indenture dated as of January 30, 2001,
 between Pfizer and The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of New York), assuccessor to JPMorgan Chase Bank (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank), as trustee, which we refer to as 
the “base indenture,” as supplemented by the ninthsupplemental indenture dated as of March 6, 2017, among Pfizer Inc., The 
Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, and The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch, as payingagent, which we refer to as the “ninth supplemental indenture.” When we refer to the “indenture,” we mean the base indenture,
 as supplemented by the ninth supplementalindenture. The following description is a summary of selected portions of the base indenture and the ninth supplemental indenture. It does
 not restate the base indenture or theninth supplemental indenture, and those documents, not this description, define the rights of
 a holder of the notes.Principal, Maturity and Interest
The 2022 notes were limited to €1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount and the 2027 notes were limited to €750,000,000
 aggregate principal amount. The 2022 notes willmature on March 6, 2022 and the 2027 notes will mature on March 6, 2027. We issued the no
tes in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excessthereof.
Interest on the 2022 notes accrues at the annual rate
 of 0.250% and interest on the 2027 notes accrues at the annual rate of 1.000%. Interest on the notes is payable on March6 of each year. Interest on the notes is computed
 on the basis of the actual number of days in the period for which interest is being calculated and the actual number of daysfrom and including the last date on which interest was paid on the notes to, bu
t excluding, the next scheduled interest payment date. This payment convention is referred to asACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA) (as defined in the rulebook of the International Capital Market Association).
We make each interest payment to the holders of record of the notes
 at the close of business on the 15th calendar day (whether or not a business day) preceding the relevantinterest payment date.
The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch, acts as our paying agent with respect 
to the notes. Upon notice to the trustee, we may change any paying agent. Payments ofprincipal, interest and premium, if any, will be made by us through the paying agent to Euroclear Bank S.A.
/N.V. (the “Euroclear Operator”), as operator of the EuroclearSystem (“Euroclear”) and/or Clearstream Banking, Société Anonyme, Luxembourg (“Clearstream”) as described under “—Book-Entry.”
Issuance in Euros
Principal, premium, if any, and interest payments and additional amounts, if any, in respect of the no
tes are payable in euros.If the euro is unavailable to us due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our con
trol or the euro is no longer used by the then member states ofthe European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the se
ttlement of transactions by public institutions within the international bankingcommunity, then all payments in respect of the notes will be made in U.S. dollars until the euro is again available to us or so used.
 In such circumstances, the amount payableon any date in euros will be converted to U.S. dollars on the basis of the most
 recently available market exchange rate for euros, as determined by us in our sole discretion.Any payment in respect of the notes so made in U.S.
 dollars does not constitute an event of default under the indenture or the notes. Neither the trustee nor the paying agent isresponsible for obtaining exchange rates, effecting conversions or otherwise handling redenominations.
Payment of Additional Amounts
All payments in respect of the notes are made by or on behalf of us
 without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments orgovernmental charges of whatever nature, imposed or levied by the United States or any taxing authority thereof or 
therein, unless such withholding or deduction is required bylaw. If such withholding or deduction is required by law, we pay to a beneficial owner who is not a United States person such additional amounts on 
the notes as are necessaryin order that the net payment of the principal of, and premium or redemption price, if any, and interest on
, such notes to2

such beneficial owner, after such withholding or deduction (including any withholding or deduction on such additional amounts), will not be less than the amount provided insuch notes to be then due and payable; provided, however, that
 the foregoing obligation to pay additional amounts will not apply:a)
to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but  for the beneficial owner, or a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member orshareholder of the beneficial owner if the beneficial owner is an estate, trust, partnership or corporation, or a person holding a power over an estate or trust
administered by a fiduciary holder, being considered as (i) having a current or former connection with the United States (other than a connection arising solely as a
result of the ownership of such notes, the receipt of any payment
 or the enforcement of any rights thereunder), including being or having been a citizen or resident ofthe United States, or being or having been engaged in a trade or business in the United 
States or having or having had a permanent establishment in the UnitedStates; (ii) being a controlled foreign corporation related to Pfizer directly, indirectly or constructively through stock ownership for U.S. federal income tax purposes;

in the ordinary course of its trade or business;
b)
to any holder that is not the sole beneficial owner of such notes, or a  portion of such notes, or that is a fiduciary, partnership or limited liability company, but only tothe extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to the
 fiduciary, a beneficial owner or a member of the partnership or limited liability company would not have beenentitled to the payment of an additional amount had the beneficiary, set
tlor, beneficial owner or member received directly from Pfizer its beneficial or distributive shareof the payment;
c)
to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by reason of the holder’s or beneficial owner’s past or present status as a  passive foreign investmentcompany, a controlled foreign corporation, a foreign tax exempt organization or a personal holding company with respect to the United States or as a
 corporation thataccumulates earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax;
d)
to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but  for the failure of the holder or beneficial owner of the applicable notes tocomply with any applicable certification, identification or information reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the
United States of the holder or beneficial owner of such notes, if compliance is timely requested by Pfizer and required by sta
tute, by regulation of the United States orany taxing authority therein or by an applicable income tax treaty to which the United States is a
 party as a precondition to exemption from such tax, assessment orother governmental charge;
e)
to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed otherwise than by withholding or deducting from the payment; f)
to any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, wealth,  capital gains or personal property tax or similar tax, assessment or other governmental charge;g)
to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge required to be withheld by any paying agent from any payment o f principal of or interest on any such note, ifsuch payment can be made without such withholding by at least one other paying agent in a Member Sta
te of the European Union;h)
to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely by reason of a change in law, regulation, or administrative or judicial interpretation that becomes effective more than 15 days after the payment
 becomes due or is duly provided for, whichever occurs later;i)
to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but  for the presentation by the holder of any note, where presentation isrequired, for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date
 on which payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly providedfor, whichever occurs later, except to the extent that 
the holder or beneficial owner thereof would have been entitled to additional amounts had the note beenpresented for payment on the last day of such 30 day period;
j)
to any withholding or deduction that is imposed on a payment pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and related Treasury regulations andpronouncements or any successor provisions thereto (that are substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to comply with) and any regulations or
official law, agreement or interpretations thereof in any jurisdiction implementing an intergovernmental approach thereto; or
k)
in the case of any combination of the above listed items. Except as specifically provided under this heading “—Payment of Additional Amounts,” we are not required to make any payment for any 
tax, duty, assessment orgovernmental charge of whatever nature imposed by any government or a political subdivision or taxing authority of or in any government or political subdivision.
As used under this heading “—Payment of Additional Amounts” and under the heading “—Optional Redemption of the
 Notes; No Sinking Fund,” the term “United States”means the United States of America, any state thereof
, and the District of Columbia, and the3

term “United States person” means (i) any individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (ii) a corporation, partnership orother entity created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any
 state thereof or the District of Columbia (other than a partnership that is not treated as a UnitedStates person for U.S. federal income tax purposes), (iii) any estate the income of which is subject to
 U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source, or (iv) any trust if aU.S. court can exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more United States persons can control all substantial trust decisions, or if
 a validelection is in place to treat the trust as a United States
 person.Priority
The notes are unsecured general obligations of Pfizer and rank equally in right of payment with all other unsubordinated indebtedness of Pfizer from time to 
time outstanding.Listing
The notes are listed on the NYSE. We have no obligation to
 maintain such listing, and we may delist the notes at any time.Covenants
The indenture contains a provision that restricts our ability to consolidate with or merge into any other person or convey or transfer our properties and assets as an en
tirety orsubstantially as an entirety to any other person. The indenture does not restrict our ability to convey
 or transfer our properties and assets other than as an entirety orsubstantially as an entirety to any other person. See “Article VIII
 - Consolidation, Merger, Conveyance or Transfer” in the base indenture. The indenture contains no otherrestrictive covenants, including those that would afford holders of the notes protection in the
 event of a highly-leveraged transaction involving Pfizer or any of its affiliates orother events involving us that may adversely affect our creditworthiness or the value of the notes
. The indenture also does not contain any covenants relating to totalindebtedness, interest coverage, stock repurchases, recapitalizations, dividends and distributions to shareholders, current ratios or acquisitions and divestitures. The notes do
not have the benefit of covenants that
 relate to subsidiary guarantees, liens and sale leaseback transactions that apply to other of our existing unsecured and unsubordinatednotes.
Pfizer may, without the consent of the holders of notes
 of any series, issue additional notes having the same ranking and the same interest rate, maturity and other terms asthe notes of any series (except for the issue date and 
the public offering price). Any additional notes having such similar terms, together with the notes of the applicable series,will constitute a single series of debt securities under the indenture. No additional notes of any series may be issued if an event o
f default has occurred with respect to thenotes of that series. Pfizer will not issue any additional notes intended to form a single series with the no
tes of any series, unless such further notes will be fungible with allnotes of the same series for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Optional Redemption of the Notes; No Sinking Fund
At our option, we may redeem the 2022 notes or the 2027 notes
 (together, the redemption notes), in whole, at any time, or in part, from time to time, prior to February 6, 2022(one month prior to the maturity date) with respect to the 2022 notes and December 6, 2026
 (three months prior to the maturity date) with respect to the 2027 notes. Theredemption price will be equal to the greater of the following amounts:
•
100% of the principal amount of the redemption notes being redeemed on the redemption date; and •
the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the redemption notes  being redeemed on that redemption date (notincluding the amount, if any, of accrued and unpaid interest to, but
 excluding, the redemption date) discounted to the redemption date on an annual basis at a rateequal to the sum of the Comparable Government Bond Rate plus (a) 15 basis points in the case o
f the 2022 notes and (b) 15 basis points in the case of the 2027notes;
plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the redemption notes being redeemed to, but
 excluding, the redemption date.At any time on or after February 6, 2022 (one month prior to the maturity date) with respect
 to the 2022 notes and December 6, 2026 (three months prior to the maturity date)with respect to the 2027 notes, we may redeem such series of redemption notes, in whole or in part, a
t a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of theredemption notes to be redeemed, plus in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the redemption notes being redeemed to
, but excluding, the redemption date.Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on the applicable redemption notes that are due and payable on interest
 payment dates falling on or prior to aredemption date will be payable on the interest payment date to the registered holders as of the close o
f business on the relevant record date according to the applicableredemption notes and the indenture. The redemption prices for the redemption notes will be calculated on the basis of a 365-day year or a 366-day year,
 as applicable, and theactual number of days elapsed.
We will mail notice of any redemption at least 10 days, but not more than 60 days, be
fore the redemption date to each registered holder of the redemption notes to beredeemed. Once notice of redemption is mailed, the redemption notes called for redemption will become due and payable on the redemption date at the applicable redemption
price, plus accrued and unpaid interest applicable to such redemption notes to, but excluding, the redemption date.

“Comparable Government Bond” means, in relation to any Comparable Government Bond Rate calculation, at the discretion of an Independent Investment Banker, a Germangovernment bond whose maturity is closest to the maturity of the redemption notes to be
 redeemed, or if such independent investment bank in its discretion determines thatsuch similar bond is not in issue, such other German government bond as such Independent Investment Banker may,
 with the advice of three brokers of, and/or market makersin, German government bonds selected by us, determine to be appropriate for determining the Comparable Government Bond Rate.
“Comparable Government Bond Rate” means the price, expressed as a percentage (rounded to three decimal places, with 0.0005 being rounded upwards), at which the gross
redemption yield on the fixed rate notes to be redeemed, if they were to be purchased a
t such price on the third business day prior to the date fixed for redemption, would beequal to the gross redemption yield on such business day of the Comparable Government Bond on the basis of
 the middle market price of the Comparable Government Bondprevailing at 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such business day as determined by an Independent Investment 
Banker.“Independent Investment Banker” means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by us to act
 as the “Independent Investment Banker.”“Reference Treasury Dealer” means each of Barclays Bank PLC, BNP Paribas, Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.
P. Morgan Securities plc (or their respective affiliates that arePrimary Treasury Dealers), and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a broker or dealer of, and/or market maker in,
German government bonds (a “Primary Treasury Dealer”), we will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer.
On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the redemption notes
 or any portion of the redemption notes called for redemption (unless we default in thepayment of the redemption price and accrued and unpaid interest). On or before the redemption date, we will deposit with a paying agent
 (or the trustee) money sufficient topay the redemption price of and accrued and unpaid interest on the redemption notes to be redeemed on 
that date. If fewer than all of the redemption notes of any series are tobe redeemed, the redemption notes to be redeemed shall be selected by Euroclear and/or Clearstream, in the case of redemption notes represented by a
 global security, or bythe trustee by a method the trustee deems to be
 fair and appropriate, in the case of redemption notes that are not represented by a global security.The notes are not entitled to the benefit of
 a sinking fund.Redemption for Tax Reasons
If, as a result of any change in, or amendment to,
 the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated under the laws) of the United States (or any taxing authority thereof ortherein), or any change in, or amendments to, an official position regarding the application or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, which change or amendment is
announced or becomes effective on or after February 28, 2017, we become or, based upon a
 written opinion of independent tax counsel of recognized standing selected by us,will become obligated to pay additional amounts as described herein under the heading “—Payment of Additional Amounts” with respect to any series of the notes
, then wemay at our option, having given not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior notice to holders, redeem, in whole, bu
t not in part, the applicable series of notes at a redemptionprice equal to 100% of the principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest (including any additional amounts) on such notes to, bu
t excluding, the redemption date.Book-Entry
Global Clearance and Settlement
The notes of each series were issued in the form of one or more global notes in fully registered form, without coupons, and are deposited
 with, or on behalf of, a commondepositary, and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary, for, and in respect
 of interests held through, Euroclear and Clearstream. Except as describedherein, certificates will not be issued in exchange for beneficial interests in the global notes representing the notes.
Except as set forth below, the global notes representing the notes
 may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective nominees.Beneficial interests in the global notes representing the notes are represented, and transfers of such bene
ficial interests are effected, through accounts of financial institutionsacting on behalf of beneficial owners as direct or indirect participants in Euroclear or Clearstream. Those beneficial interests are in denominations of €100,000 and integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. Investors may hold the notes directly through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in such sys
tems, or indirectly throughorganizations that are participants in such systems.
For so long as any series of the notes is represented by a global note deposited with, and
 registered in the name of a nominee for, a common depositary for Euroclear and/orClearstream, each person (other than Euroclear or Clearstream) who is for the time being shown in the records of Euroclear or of Clearstream as the holder of a particular
nominal amount of the notes (in which regard any certificate or other document issued by Euroclear or Clearstream as to the nominal amount of the notes s
tanding to theaccount of any person shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes save in the case of manifest error) shall upon their receipt of a certificate or other document
 be treatedby Pfizer and the trustee as the holder of such nominal amount of 
the notes and the registered holder of the global note representing such notes shall be deemed not to be theholder for all purposes other than with respect to the
5

payment of principal or interest on such nominal amount of the notes, for which purpose the registered holder of the relevant global note shall be treated by Pfizer and thetrustee as the holder of such nominal amount of notes in accordance with and subject to
 the terms of the global note representing the notes, and the expressions “noteholder”and “holder of notes” and related expressions shall be construed accordingly.
The information in this section concerning Euroclear and Clearstream Banking and their book-entry systems and procedures has been obtained from sources that we believe to
be reliable. We are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of this information.
We have been advised by Clearstream and Euroclear, respectively, as follows:
Clearstream has advised that:
    
•
It is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and licensed as a bank and professional depositary. Clearstream holds securities for its participating organizations and facilitates the clearance and settlement of securities transactions among its participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of
 its participants,thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates.
•
Clearstream provides to its participants, among other things, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of internationally traded securities and securities lending and borrowing. Clearstream interfaces with domestic markets in several countries.
•
Clearstream has established an electronic bridge with the Euroclear Operator to facilitate the settlement of trades between the nominees of Clearstream and Euroclear.
•
As a registered bank in Luxembourg, Clearstream is subject to regulation by the Luxembourg Commission for the Supervision of the Financial Sector. •
Clearstream customers are recognized financial institutions around the world, including underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations and may include the underwriters. Indirect access to Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers,
dealers and trust companies that clear through, or maintain a custodial relationship with, a Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.
Distributions with respect to the notes held beneficially through Clearstream will be credited to cash accounts of Clearstream participants in accordance with its rules and
procedures.
Euroclear has advised that:
•
It was created in 1968 to hold securities for its participants and to clear and settle transactions between Euroclear participants through simultaneous electronic book-entry delivery against payment, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates and any risk from lack of simultaneous transfers of securities and
cash.
•
Euroclear includes various other services, including securities lending and borrowing and interfaces with domestic markets in several countries. •
Euroclear is operated by the Euroclear Operator. All operations are conducted by the Euroclear Operator, and all Euroclear securities clearance accounts and Euroclear cash accounts are accounts with the Euroclear Operator.
•
Securities clearance accounts and cash accounts with the Euroclear Operator are governed by the Terms and Conditions Governing Use of Euroclear and the related operating procedures of Euroclear, and applicable Belgian law (collectively, the “Terms and Conditions”). The Terms and Conditions govern transfers of securities
and cash within Euroclear, withdrawals of securities and cash from Euroclear, and receipts of payments with respect to securities in Euroclear. All securities in
Euroclear are held on a fungible basis without attribution of specific certificates to specific securities clearance accounts. The Euroclear Operator acts under the
Terms and Conditions only on behalf of Euroclear participants, and has no records of or relationship with persons holding through Euroclear participants.
•
Euroclear participants include banks (including central banks), securities brokers and dealers and other professional financial intermediaries and may include the underwriters. Indirect access to Euroclear is also available to other firms that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear participant, either
directly or indirectly.
Distributions with respect to the notes held beneficially through Euroclear will be credited to the cash accounts of Euroclear participants in accordance with the Terms and
Conditions.
Euroclear and Clearstream Arrangements
So long as Euroclear or Clearstream or their nominee or their common depositary is the registered holder of the global notes representing the notes, Euroclear, Clearstream or
such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of
6

the notes represented by such global notes for all purposes under the indenture and the notes. Payments of principal, interest and additional amounts, if any, in respect of theglobal notes representing the notes are made to Euroclear, Clearstream, such nominee or such common depositary, as the case may be, as registered holder thereof. Neither
Pfizer nor the trustee, or any affiliate of any of 
the above or any person by whom any of the above is controlled (as such term is defined in the Securities Act) has anyresponsibility or liability for any records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the global notes representing the notes or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
Distributions of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the global notes representing the notes are credited in euros to the
 extent received by Euroclear orClearstream from the paying agent to the cash accounts of Euroclear or Clearstream customers in accordance with the relevant system’s rules and procedures.
Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
 indirect participants, the ability of a person having an interest in theglobal notes representing the notes to pledge such interest to persons or entities which do not participate in 
the relevant clearing system, or otherwise take actions in respect ofsuch interest, may be affected by the lack of a
 physical certificate in respect of such interest.Secondary Market Trading
Because the purchaser determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of
 trading of any notes where both the purchaser’s and seller’s accounts arelocated to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.
We understand that secondary market trading between Clearstream and/or Euroclear participants occurs in the ordinary way following the applicable rules and operating
procedures of Clearstream and Euroclear. Secondary market trading is settled using procedures applicable to conventional eurobonds in global registered form.
The holder of the notes should be aware that investors are only able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other communications involving the notes through
Clearstream and Euroclear on days when those systems are open for business. Those systems may not be open for business on days
 when banks, brokers and otherinstitutions are open for business in the United States.
In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be problems with completing transactions involving Clearstream and Euroclear on the same business day as in the
United States. U.S. investors who wish to transfer their interests in the no
tes, or to make or receive a payment or delivery of the notes, on a particular day, may find that thetransactions are not performed until the next business day in Luxembourg or Brussels, depending on whether Clearstream or Euroclear is used.
Clearstream or Euroclear credits payments to the cash accounts of Clearstream customers or Euroclear participants, as applicable, in accordance with the relevant system’s
rules and procedures, to the extent received by its depositary. Clearstream or the Euroclear Operator, as the case may be
, takes any other action permitted to be taken by aholder under the indenture on behalf of a Clearstream customer or Euroclear participant only in accordance with its relevant rules and procedures.
Clearstream and Euroclear have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of the notes among participants of Clearstream and Euroclear. However,
they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform those procedures, and they may discontinue those procedures at any
 time.Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes
Subject to certain conditions, the notes represented by the global notes are exchangeable 
for certificated notes in definitive form of like tenor in minimum denominations of€100,000 principal amount and multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof if:
•
the common depositary notifies us that it is no longer willing or able to act as a depositary for such global notes or ceases to be a clearing agency registered underthe Exchange Act and we fail to appoint a successor common depositary within 90 days;
•
an event of default has occurred and is continuing and the common depositary requests the issuance o f certificated notes; or•
we determine not to have the notes represented by a global note. In all cases, certificated notes delivered in exchange for any global note or beneficial interest therein will be registered in the names, and issued in any approved
denominations, requested by or on behalf of the common depositary (in accordance with its customary procedures).
Payments (including principal, premium and interest) and transfers with respect to the notes in certificated form may be executed at the of
fice or agency maintained for suchpurpose in London (initially the corporate trust office of the paying agent) or, at our option, by
 check mailed to the holders thereof at the respective addresses set forth in theregister of holders of the notes (maintained by the registrar), provided that all payments (including principal, premium and interest) on the notes in certificated form, for which
the holders thereof have given wire transfer instructions, are required to be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
7

accounts specified by the holders thereof. No service charge is made for any registration of transfer, but payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental chargepayable in connection with such registration may be required.
Modification of Indenture
Under the indenture, the rights of the holders of the notes may be
 modified through a supplemental indenture if the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of theoutstanding notes of all series affected by the modification (voting as one class) consent 
to it. No modification of the maturity date or principal or interest payment terms, nomodification of the currency for payment, no impairment of the right to sue for the en
forcement of payment at the maturity of the debt security, no modification of anyconversion rights, no modification reducing the percentage required for any such supplemental indenture or the percentage required for the waiver of certain defaults, and no
modification of the foregoing provisions or any other provisions relating to the waiver of past defaults or the waiver of certain covenants, is e
ffective against any holder withoutits consent.
Events of Default
Each of the following will constitute an Event of Default under the indenture with respect
 to the notes of the applicable series:•
we fail to make the principal or any premium payment on any note of such series when due; •
we fail to make any sinking fund payment for 60 days after payment was due by the terms of any note of such series;•
we fail to pay interest on any note of such series for 60 days a fter payment was due;•
we fail to perform any other covenant in the indenture and this failure continues for 90 days af ter we receive written notice of it; or•
we, or a court, take certain actions relating to the bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of our company. A default under our other indebtedness will not be a default under the indenture for the
 notes, and a default under one series of the notes will not necessarily be a default underanother series. The trustee may withhold notice to the holders of notes of 
the applicable series of any default (except for defaults that involve our failure to pay principal orinterest) if it considers such withholding of notice to be in the best interests of 
the holders.If an Event of Default with respect to ou
tstanding notes of any series occurs and is continuing, then the trustee or the holders of at least 33% in principal amount of outstandingnotes of that series may declare, in a written notice, the principal amount (or, if any of 
the notes of that series are original issue discount securities, such portion of the principalamount of such notes) plus accrued and unpaid interest on all notes of that
 series to be immediately due and payable. At any time after a declaration of acceleration withrespect to notes of any series has been made, the holders of a
 majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes of such series may rescind and annul the acceleration if:•
the holders act before the trustee has obtained a judgment or decree for payment o f the money due;•
we have paid or deposited with the trustee a sum sufficient to pay overdue interest and  overdue principal other than the accelerated interest and principal; and•
we have cured or the holders have waived all Events of Default, other than the non-payment o f accelerated principal and interest with respect to notes of that series,as provided in the indenture.
If a default in the performance or breach of the indenture shall have occurred and be continuing, 
the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstandingnotes of all series affected thereby, by notice to the
 trustee, may waive any past Event of Default or its consequences under the indenture. However, an Event of Defaultcannot be waived with respect to any series of notes in the following two circumstances:
    
•
a failure to pay the principal of, and premium, if any, or interest on any security or in the payment o f any sinking fund installment; or•
a covenant or provision that cannot be modified or amended without the consent of each  holder of outstanding notes of that series.Other than its duties in case of a default, 
the trustee is not obligated to exercise any of its rights or powers under the indenture at the request, order or direction of any holders,unless the holders offer the trustee reasonable indemnity. Holders of a majority in principal amount outstanding of any series of notes may, subject 
to certain limitations, directthe time, method and place of conducting any proceeding or any remedy available to the trustee, or exercising any power conferred upon the
 trustee, for such applicable seriesof notes.
We are required to deliver an annual officers’ certificate to the trustee, stating whether we are in default in the
 performance and observance of any of the terms, provisions andconditions of the indenture, and, if we are in default, specifying all such defaults and
 the nature and status thereof.8

DefeasanceWhen we use the term defeasance, we mean discharge from some or all of our obligations under the indenture. Subject to certain additional conditions, if
 we irrevocablydeposit with the trustee sufficient cash or government securities to pay the principal, interest, any premium and any other sums due
 to the stated maturity date or a redemptiondate of the notes of a particular series, then at our op
tion:•
we will be discharged from our obligations with respect to the notes of such series; or •
we will no longer be under any obligation to comply with certain restrictive covenants under the indenture, and certain events of default will no longer apply to us. To exercise our defeasance option, we must deliver to the trustee an officer’s certificate and an opinion of
 counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent related to thedefeasance have been complied with.

 and as determined by the CEO.iv)
A  Participant’s actual Award is determined based on his or her Target Incentive Award, adjusted by the funding factors stated above and further adjusted toreflect the
