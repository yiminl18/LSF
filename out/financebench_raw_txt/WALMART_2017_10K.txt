The Development of Our Company
Although Walmart was incorpor
ated in Delaware in October 1969, the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened afranchise Ben Franklin vari
ety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, ourfounders' business was devoted entir
ely to the operation of variety stores. In that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a discount store, opened inRogers, Arkansas. In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, 
and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In 1998, we opened our first Neighborhood Market.In 1991, we began our first intern
ational initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico. Since then, our international presence has expanded and, as ofJanuary 31, 2017 
, our Walmart Intern ational segment conducted business in 27 countries.In 2000, we began our first digita
l initiative by creating the walmart.com retail website. Since then, our digital presence has continued to grow. As of January 31, 2017 
, we operated e-commer ce websites in 11 countries, providing access to Walmart and our various brands around the world.6

Information About Our SegmentsThe Company is engaged in the opera
tion of retail, wholesale and other units located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central America,Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and 
the United Kingdom and retail websites in the U.S. and 10 other countries. The Company's operations are conducted inthree reportable seg
ments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chiefoperating decision make
r ("CODM") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and servicesin each of its segments. I
t is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.Walmart U.S. is our largest s
egment and operates retail stores in all 50 states in the U.S., Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, with three primary store formats, aswell as digital reta
il. Walmart U.S. generated approximately 64% of our net sales in fisca l 2017 , and of our three segments, W almart U.S. is the largest and hashistorically had the high
est gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit rate"). In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amountto the Company's net sales and oper
ating income.Walmart International consists 
of operations in 27 countries outside of the U.S. and includes numerous formats divided into three major categories: retail,wholesale and other. These ca
tegories consist of numerous formats, including supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs),cash & carry, home impro
vement, specialty electronics, apparel stores, drug stores and convenience stores, as well as digital retail. Walmart International generatedapproximately 
24% of our fiscal 2017 net sales. The overall gross profit rate for Walmart International is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of itsmerchandise mix. Wal
mart International is our second largest segment and has grown through acquisitions, as well as by adding retail, wholesale and other units.Sam's Club consists of membership-on
ly warehouse clubs and operates in 47 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico, as well as digital retail. Sam's Club accountedfor approximately 
12% of our fiscal 2017 net sales. As a membership-on ly warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment'soperating income. Sam's Club oper
ates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments.The Company measures the resul
ts of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporateoverhead allocations. From 
time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, asdetermined by the infor
mation regularly reviewed by our CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances arereclassified to be co
mparable to the current period's presentation.Walmart U.S. Segment

chandise and services, both of which vary by country. Digital retail supports our physical stores with capabilities like "Click & Collect" inthe United Kingdom and our grocery hom
e delivery business in Mexico.Merchandise. 
The merchandising strat egy for the Walmart International segment is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scopeof merchandise offer
ed for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developedmarket specific pr
ivate brands to serve our customers with high quality, lower priced items. Along with the private brands we market globally, such as "Equate,""George," "Great Value," "Holiday Time," "M
ainstays," "Ol' Roy" and "Parent's Choice," our international markets have developed market specific brandsincluding "Aurrera," "Cambridge," "Chosen by You," and "Ex
tra Special." In addition, we have developed relationships with regional and local suppliers in eachmarket to ensure reliable so
urces of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices.Operations. 
The hours of operation for oper ating units in the Walmart International segment vary by country and by individual markets within countries,depending upon local and nationa
l ordinances governing hours of operation. Operating units in each country accept a variety of payment methods.Seasonal Aspects of Operations. 
The Walmart Intern ational segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent. Historically, the segment's highest sales volumeand operating income have o
ccurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religiousholidays, festivals and custo
ms, as well as different weather patterns.Competition. 
The Walmart Intern ational segment competes with a variety of local, national and global chains in the supermarket, discount, grocery, department,drug, variety and special
ty stores, hypermarkets, wholesale clubs, home improvement, specialty electronic, e-commerce and catalog businesses in each of themarkets in which we operate. 
We also operate, on a limited basis, consumer credit operations. We compete with others for desirable sites. Our ability to develop,open and operate units at th
e right locations and to deliver a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping determines, to alarge extent, our competitive
 position in the markets in which Walmart International operates. We believe price leadership is a critical part of our business modeland we continue to focus on moving our m
arkets towards an EDLP approach. Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significantimpact on our competit
ive position in the markets where we operate. In the markets in which we have retail websites or retail websites and mobile commerceapplications, those websites 
and applications help differentiate us from our competitors and help us compete with other retailers for customers and their purchases,both in our digital and physica
l retail operations.12

ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS The risks described below could m
aterially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our business operations couldalso be affected by addi
tional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally.Strategic Risks
General or macro-economi
c factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial performance.General economic conditio
ns and other economic factors, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance.Higher interest rates, 
lower or higher prices of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for electricity and otherenergy, weakness in the housing mark
et, inflation, deflation, increased costs of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels ofunemployment, decreases 
in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer spending andshopping patterns, fluctuat
ions in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes and surcharges or other changes in tax laws, changes inhealthcare laws, other reg
ulatory changes, the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, overalleconomic slowdown and other economi
c factors in the U.S. or in any of the other markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer demand for theproducts we sell in the U.S. or such other 
markets, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionarypurchases of goods, adversely af
fect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory, or otherwise materially adverselyaffect our operations 
and operating results.In addition, the economic 
factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation, labor, insurance or healthcare costsor commodity prices, and oth
er economic factors in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, generaland administrative expense
s and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results.The economic factors th
at affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers, which can result in an increase in the cost to us of thegoods we sell to our customers or, in 
more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale.We may not timely identify or e
ffectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers,demand for the products and services we sell, our market share and the growth of our business.
It is difficult to pr
edict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns. The success ofour business depends in part on how accur
ately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing productsand the competitive env
ironment, whether for customers purchasing products at our stores and clubs, through our digital retail businesses or through thecombination of both reta
il offerings. Price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience and the speed and cost of shipping are ofprimary importance to customer
s and continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and thechoices available to 
consumers for purchasing products. As a result of these factors, we17

plan to increase investments in e-commerce, technology, store remodels and other customer initiatives, moderate the number of new store openings and rely to agreater extent on comparable 
store sales and e-commerce for growth. Any failure of these investments or initiatives to adequately or effectively respond tochanging consumer tastes, pr
eferences and shopping patterns, or any other failure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes,preferences and shopping pat
terns could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for the products we sell, our market share and thegrowth of our business.
We face strong competition fro
m other retailers and wholesale club operators (whether through physical retail, digital retail or the integration of both),which could materially adversely affe
ct our financial performance.The retail business is highly 
competitive. Each of our segments competes for customers, employees, store and club sites, products and services and in otherimportant aspects of i
ts business with many other local, regional, national and global retailers and wholesale club operators, as well as other national andinternational internet-based retailers
 and retail intermediaries.Our Walmart U.S. segment compe
tes with retailers operating discount, department, retail and wholesale grocers, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores,supermarkets, supercent
er-type stores and hypermarkets, as well as e-commerce and catalog businesses. Our Sam's Club segment competes with other wholesaleclub operators, as well as dis
count retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations, and e-commerceretailers, wholesale
rs and catalog businesses.Internationally, we compete
 with retailers who operate department, drug, dollar stores, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores,hypermarkets, wholesale c
lubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, apparel stores, wholesale clubs, cash & carry operations, convenience storesand e-commerce and c
atalog businesses.We compete in a vari
ety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers,location, store hours, in-sto
re amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our e-commercewebsites and mobile comme
rce applications, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased online, through mobile commerceapplications or through the 
integration of our physical and digital retail operations.Where necessary, to comp
ete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our EDLP philosophy, we will lowerour prices on goods for sale. A fai
lure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could materially adversely affect ourfinancial performance. See " 
Item 1. Business " above for additional discuss ion of the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments.Although the retail industry 
as a whole is highly fragmented, certain segments of the retail industry may undergo consolidation from time to time, which couldresult in increased competitio
n and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace. Such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improvedfinancial resources, improve
d access to merchandise, greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitivepositions. Such business combinations cou
ld result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidatedcompanies, which could adverse
ly affect our financial performance.Failure to grow our e-commerc
e business through the integration of physical and digital retail or otherwise, and the cost of our increasing e-commerceinvestments, may materially adve
rsely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance.The retail business is quick
ly evolving and consumers are increasingly embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications. As a result, theportion of total consumer 
expenditures with all retailers and wholesale clubs occurring online and through mobile commerce applications is increasing and the paceof this increase could accelerate
. We plan to increase our investments in e-commerce, technology, store remodels and other customer initiatives, moderate thenumber of new store openings and re
ly to a greater extent on increasing comparable store and club sales and e-commerce sales (which are included in ourcalculation of compa
rable store and club sales with the exception of e-commerce acquisitions until such businesses have been owned for 12 months) for growth.The success of this strategy wi
ll depend in large measure on our ability to build and deliver a seamless shopping experience across the physical and digital retailchannels and is further subj
ect to the risks we face as outlined in this Item 1A . Our investments in e-comm
erce, technology, store remodels and other customer initiatives may not adequately or effectively allow us to grow our e-commercebusiness, increase compar
able store sales, maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business of a moderatedpace of new store and club openings. 
If we fail to successfully implement our strategy, our market position, net sales and financial performance could be adverselyaffected. In addition, 
a greater concentration of e-commerce sales could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn,reduce the opportunities 
for cross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs andmaterially adversely affect the financial
 performance of the physical retail side of our operations.18

In addition, the cost of certain e-commerce and technology investments, including any operating losses incurred by acquired e-commerce businesses will adverselyimpact our financial performance i
n the short-term and may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term.Operational Risks
Natural disasters, changes in climate, and geo-polit
ical events could materially adversely affect our financial performance.The occurrence of one or mo
re natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical storms, floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, weather conditions such asmajor or extended winter s
torms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, severe changes in climate and geo-political events,such as civil unrest or te
rrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financialperformance.
Such events could result in physic
al damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distributionfacilities, the l
ack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs affected bysuch events, the evacuation o
f the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution facilities are located, the unavailability of our retail websites andmobile commerce app
lications to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers' disposable income, the temporary or long-termdisruption in the supply of products 
from some local and overseas suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in thedelivery of goods to our distribu
tion facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, thedisruption of utility serv
ices to our stores and our facilities, and disruption in our communications with our stores.These events and their imp
acts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which they occur, such as Superstorm Sandy in the U.S.in 2012 or the numerous storm syste
ms in the U.S. in recent years, and could adversely affect our financial performance.In light of the substantia
l premiums payable for insurance coverage for losses caused by certain natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropicalstorms, earthquakes, floods and 
tsunamis, as well as the limitations on available coverage for such losses, we have chosen to be primarily self-insured with respectto such losses. Although we maintain c
ertain specific coverages for losses from physical damages in excess of certain amounts to guard against catastrophic lossesfrom such causes, we still be
ar the risk of losses incurred as a result of any physical damage to, or the destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution facilities,loss or spoilage of inventory, and bus
iness interruption caused by any such events to the extent they are below catastrophic levels of coverage, as well as in theevent of a catastrophe, 
to the extent they exceed our aggregate limits of applicable coverages. Significant losses caused by such events could materially adverselyaffect our financial performance.
Risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could mate
rially adversely affect our financial performance.The products we sell are sourc
ed from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an importantfactor in our financi
al performance. We expect all of our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety and environmental laws, and tootherwise meet our requi
red supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timely andefficient manner, 
is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S.Political and economic 
instability in the countries in which our foreign suppliers and their manufacturers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers'failure to meet c
ertain of our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and theirmanufacturers, the availability 
of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption in the transportation of merchandise from thesuppliers and manufactur
ers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount ofmerchandise we purchase en
ters into the U.S., currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to thesuppliers and the countries 
in which they are located are beyond our control.In addition, the U.S.'s foreign trad
e policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on theimportation of cert
ain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond ourcontrol. These and other fa
ctors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance.If the products we sell are not safe or otherwis
e fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries sufferedby customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise exper
ience material adverse effects to our brand, reputation and financial performance.Our customers count on us to provide th
em with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers orthat we prepare and then se
ll could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food andnon-food needs, even if the basis 
for the concern is19

outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish. As such, any issue regarding the safety of anyfood or non-food items we sell, r
egardless of the cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial performance.We rely extensively on informat
ion systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in both our primary andsecondary (back-up) systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations.
Although we have independent, redundant 
and physically separate primary and secondary information systems, given the number of individual transactions wehave each year, it is c
ritical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information systems. Our information systems, including our back-upsystems, are subject to da
mage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computerprograms, denial-of-service attac
ks, security breaches (through cyber-attacks from cyber-attackers and sophisticated organizations), catastrophic events such asfires, tornadoes, earthqu
akes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our associates. Our information systems are essential to our business operations, including theprocessing of transactions, 
management of our associates, facilities, logistics, inventories, physical stores and clubs and our online operations. If our informationsystems and our back-up systems a
re damaged, breached or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, andwe may suffer interrupt
ions in our business operations in the interim. Any interruption in both our information systems and back-up systems may have a materialadverse effect on our busin
ess or results of operations. In addition, we are pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information technology processes andsystems. The risk of system disrup
tion is increased when significant system changes are undertaken, although we believe our change management process willmitigate this risk. I
f we fail to integrate our information systems and processes, we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from theseinitiatives.
If the technology-based systems that give our custom
ers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as ourability to grow our e-commerc
e business globally, could be materially adversely affected.Many of our customers shop with us over our 
e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, which are a part of our multi-channel sales strategy.Increasingly, customers 
are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to shop online and through mobile commerce applications with us and with our competitorsand to do comparison shopping. We use soc
ial media and electronic mail to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. As apart of our multi-chann
el sales strategy, in addition to home delivery, we offer "Walmart Pickup," "Pickup Today" and "Club Pickup" and in a growing number oflocations, "Online Grocery" progr
ams under which many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the customer at a local Walmart store or Sam'sClub, which provides additional custo
mer traffic at such stores and clubs. Multi-channel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of ouroperations in the U.S. and in a number o
f markets in which our Walmart International segment operates.We must anticipate 
and meet our customers' changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors' operationsthrough focusing on the building and de
livery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment. Any failure on our part to provideattractive, user-friendly secure e-c
ommerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid deliveryoptions and that continually 
meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and mobile commerce application merchandising andrelated technology could p
lace us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of e-commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have amaterial adverse 
impact on the growth of our e-commerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.Our e-commerce websites 
and mobile commerce applications, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope, andthe computer systems and ope
rating systems on which they run, including those applications and systems in our acquired e-commerce businesses, may be subject tocyber-attacks. Those at
tacks could involve attempts to gain access to the website or mobile commerce application to obtain and make unauthorized use ofcustomers' or members' pay
ment information and related risks discussed below. Such attacks, if successful, can also create denials of service or otherwise disable,degrade or sabotage one or mo
re of our retail websites or mobile commerce applications and otherwise significantly disrupt our customers' and members' shoppingexperience on any of 
our retail website or mobile commerce applications. If we are unable to maintain the security of our retail commerce websites and mobilecommerce applications and kee
p them operating within acceptable parameters, we could suffer loss of sales, reductions in traffic, reputational damage anddeterioration of our co
mpetitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers whose personal information is unlawfully obtained and used, any of whichevents could have a mate
rial adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business.20

Any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our company, customers, members, associates and vendors, whether as a result ofcybersecurity attacks on our information syst
ems or otherwise, could damage our reputation, result in litigation or other legal actions against us, cause usto incur substantial additional costs, and materially advers
ely affect our business and operating results.As do most retailers, we rec
eive and store in our digital information systems certain personal information about our customers and members, and we receive andstore personal informa
tion concerning our associates and vendors. Some of that information is stored digitally in connection with our e-commerce websites andmobile commerce applications. We
 also utilize third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, for encryption andauthentication techno
logy, content delivery to customers and members, back-office support, and other functions. Such providers may have access to informationwe hold about our customers, memb
ers, associates or vendors. In addition, our online operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential informationover public networks, including in
formation permitting cashless payments.Cyber threats are rapid
ly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasinglysophisticated. Cyber threa
ts and cyber-attackers can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of single "hackers" or smallgroups of "hackers." Each year, cyb
er-attackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in our information systems. We have in place substantialsecurity measures to pro
tect, and to prevent unauthorized access to, our information systems and the information stored on such systems. We also have securityprocesses, protocols and standa
rds that are applicable to our third-party service providers, including cloud service providers, to protect information from oursystems which they have access 
to or hold under their engagements with us.We constantly monitor de
velopments in cyber threats, evaluate the effectiveness of our information security measures and change such measures or implement newand additional security 
measures from time to time to address new and different risks to the security of such information and to strengthen our protections for theinformation stored on our syst
ems. We require our third-party service providers to do the same. Nevertheless, as cyber threats evolve, change and become moredifficult to detec
t and successfully defend against, one or more cyber-attacks might defeat our or a third-party service provider's security measures in the future andobtain the personal infor
mation of customers, members, associates and vendors.Associate error or mal
feasance, faulty password management or other irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or our third-party service providers' securitymeasures and a breach of ou
r or their information systems. Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent defects of design, manufactureor operations or could be inadv
ertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security. We or our third-party serviceproviders may not discover any s
ecurity breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach occurs.Any breach of our security me
asures or any breach, error or malfeasance of those of our third-party service providers and loss of our confidential information, orany failure by us to comply with 
applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations, could cause us to incur significant costs to protect anycustomers, members, assoc
iates and vendors whose personal data was compromised and to restore their confidence in us and to make changes to our informationsystems and administrat
ive processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.In addition, such events could be wid
ely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates, vendors andshareholders, as well as our ope
rations, net sales, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity, could result in the release to the public ofconfidential inform
ation about our operations and financial condition and performance and could result in litigation or other legal actions against us or theimposition of penalties, 
fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies. Moreover, a security breach could require us to devotesignificant managem
ent resources to address the problems created by the security breach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further thesecurity measures we emp
loy to guard personal information against cyber-attacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption ofour operations, particul
arly our digital retail operations.We accept payments using 
a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, our private label credit cards and gift cards, and we may offer newpayment options over time, whi
ch may have information security risk implications. As a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject tovarious industry data prote
ction standards and protocols, such as the American National Standards Institute encryption standards and payment network securityoperating guidelines and th
e Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. Even though we comply with these standards and protocols and other informationsecurity measures, we canno
t be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent, contain ordetect any cyber-at
tacks, cyber terrorism, or security breaches from known cyber-attacks or malware that may be developed in the future. To the extent that anycyber-attack or incu
rsion in our or one of our third-party service provider's information systems results in the loss, damage or misappropriation of information, wemay be materially adversely affected
 by claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others. In certaincircumstances, paymen
t card association rules and obligations to which we are subject under our contracts with payment card processors make us liable to paymentcard issuers if inform
ation in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we hold is compromised, which liabilities could be substantial. Inaddition, the cost of
21

complying with stricter and more complex data privacy, data collection and information security laws and standards could be significant to us.Changes in the results of our retail pharmacy business could adversely af
fect our overall results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.The retail pharmacy op
erations in our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments generate substantial net sales, a large majority of which are generated by fillingprescriptions for which we re
ceive payment established through contractual relationship with third-party payers and payment administrators, such as privateinsurers, governmental ag
encies and pharmacy benefit managers ("PBMs").Our retail pharmacy ope
rations are subject to numerous risks, including: reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for drugs; changes in our payer mix (i.e.,shifts in the relativ
e distribution of our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorablereimbursement ter
ms); changes in third party payer drug formularies (i.e., the schedule of prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwisereceive preferential coverage treatment); gr
owth in, and our participation in or exclusion from, exclusive and preferred pharmacy network arrangements operatedby PBMs and/or any insurance plan or progr
am; increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we sell; increases in theadministrative burden ass
ociated with seeking third-party reimbursement; changes in the frequency with which new brand name pharmaceuticals become availableto consumers; introduction o
f lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for existing brand name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug competition; changesin drug mix (i.e., the rel
ative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and generics); changes in the health insurance marketgenerally; changes in the
 scope of or the elimination of Medicare Part D or Medicaid drug programs; increased competition from other retail pharmacy operations;further consolidation a
mong third party payers, PBMs or purchasers of drugs; overall economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy customers to pay fordrugs prescribed for them 
to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a third party; failure to meet any performance or incentive thresholds to which our level ofthird party reimbursement may
 be subject; and changes in the regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical industry, includingas a result of restri
ctions on the further implementation of or the repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or the enactment and implementation of alaw replacing such act, and o
ther changes in laws, rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business.If the supply of certain ph
armaceuticals provided by one or more of vendors were to be disrupted for any reason, our pharmacy operations could be severelyaffected until at 
least such time as we could obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals. Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in asignificant number of o
ur pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies.One or a combination of such fa
ctors may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell, our cost of sales associated with ourretail pharmacy ope
rations, and the net sales and gross margin of those operations, result in the loss of cross-store or -club selling opportunities and, in turn,adversely affect our ov
erall net sales, other results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.Our failure to attract and reta
in qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other labor issues could materiallyadversely affect our financial per
formance.Our ability to continue to condu
ct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associatesglobally. Our ability to me
et our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs anddistribution centers, whil
e controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of asufficient number of qua
lified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates,changing demographics, heal
th and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. If we are unable to locate, toattract or to retain qualified per
sonnel, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected.The wage increases for over 500,000 
associates in our operations in the U.S. and investment in other initiatives for our associates in the U.S. that we announced inFebruary 2015, and related wage in
creases for 1.2 million associates occurring in February 2016 have increased our wage and other labor expenses significantly. Ifwe cannot offset the incr
eases in our wage and other labor expenses resulting from those wage increases by increasing our gross profit, achieving decreases in ouroperating, selling, gener
al and administrative expense or a combination of both, our consolidated operating income and our consolidated income from continuingoperations could continue to b
e less than our consolidated operating income and consolidated income from continuing operations for our fiscal years prior to fiscal2017. In addition, if our costs of l
abor or related costs increase even more significantly for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations orhealthcare laws are adopted
 or implemented that further increase our labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.22

Impediments to the expansion of our Walmart International operations, and the performance of strategic alliances to support the expansion of thatsegment, could materially adverse
ly affect our financial performance.Our business strategy for our Wa
lmart International segment includes opening new units and growing comparable stores sales in the countries in which we haveexisting operations. Our abil
ity to open new units or to expand or relocate existing units depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retainqualified personnel and a
cquire new store sites on acceptable terms. Local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive pre-existing buildings in which to locateunits or sites on which to build new units o
r to expand existing units.In addition, access to loc
al suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing units in certainmarkets, especially 
in those markets in which consumers desire to purchase locally produced goods. Economic, business and legal environments in foreign marketsmay also limit our abi
lity to expand our operations and increase our net sales in those markets as we may want and could result in the closure of existing units insuch markets which may advers
ely impact our financial results. If we cannot effectively continue to expand our Walmart International segment through openingnew units, growing comparable stor
e sales or selective acquisitions, our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected.Our Walmart Interna
tional segment may also enter into strategic alliances in the countries in which we have existing operations or in other markets to expand ourdigital retail ope
rations, physical retail operations or both. For example, in fiscal 2017, we entered into a strategic alliance with JD.com, Inc. providing for WalmartChina to be a preferred r
etailer on its online-to-offline platform and our Sam's Club business in China to be a flagship store on its marketplace. Any strategicalliance may not generate the le
vel of e-commerce or other sales we anticipate when entering into that alliance or may otherwise adversely impact our businessrelative to the resu
lts we could have achieved in the absence of such alliance. In addition, any investment we make in connection with a strategic alliance, such asour investment in JD.com, Inc., cou
ld materially adversely affect our financial performance.Financial Risks
Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may mat
erially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations.Our operations in countries oth
er than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our consolidated financial statements aredenominated in U.S. dollars, and to pr
epare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expensesof our operations outside of th
e U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currencyexchange rates that wer
e unfavorable to us coupled with such translations have had a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations.As a result of such translat
ions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our consolidatedfinancial statements reflecting sig
nificant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in ourfinancial perform
ance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency exchange ratefluctuations will adversel
y affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on ourreported consolidated r
esults of operations.We may pay for products we purch
ase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which thegoods will be sold. When we must acquir
e the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorableto us, our cost of sales may inc
rease and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, witha corresponding adverse ef
fect on our gross profit. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.23

Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.We believe that the price of 
our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting theseexpectations, including our 
comparable store and club sales growth rates, e-commerce growth rates, gross margin, or earnings and earnings per share could causethe market price of ou
r stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies.Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks
Our operations subject us to legislative, 
judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries orregions in which we operate, which could materially adverse
ly affect our business or financial performance.In addition to our U.S. operations, we oper
ate our retail business principally through wholly-owned subsidiaries in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, India,Japan and the United Kingdom and our ma
jority-owned subsidiaries in Africa, Central America and Mexico.In fiscal 2017, our Walma
rt U.S. and Sam's Club operating segments generated approximately 76% of our consolidated net sal es. The Federal Government hascreated the potenti
al for significant changes in trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countrieswhere we source many of the produc
ts we sell in our stores and clubs. Potential changes which have been discussed include the renegotiation or termination oftrade agreements, th
e imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S. and the imposition of a border tax, or a border adjustment tax, on imports into the U.S. Asignificant portion of th
e general merchandise we sell in our U.S. stores and clubs is manufactured in other countries. Any such actions could increase the cost to usof such merchandise (whethe
r imported directly or indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which couldmaterially advers
ely affect the financial performance of our U.S. operations and our business.During fiscal 
2017 , our Walmart Intern ational operations generated approximately 24% of our consolidated net sal es. Our operating segments also source goodsand services from other 
countries. Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond ourcontrol. These factors in
clude political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, localproduct safety and environm
ental laws, tax regulations, local labor laws, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations, and othermatters in any of the coun
tries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future.The potential imposition by 
the U.S. of a border tax or border adjustment tax, new or higher tariffs or other restrictions on trade discussed above which impact acountry in which we have operations 
could result in actions by that country to impose new, or increase existing tariffs or taxes on products imported into suchcountry from the U.S. or elsewhere 
and could damage the reputations of U.S.-based companies, including us, with customers and others in that country. This couldmaterially adversely affect the financial
 performance of our operations in such country or countries.Our business and results of operat
ions in the UK may be negatively affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, increases in food costs, changes in tradepolicies, or changes in labo
r, immigration, tax or other laws resulting from the UK's anticipated exit from the European Union.Brazilian federal, s
tate and local laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although the Company believes it complies with those laws, theCompany's subsidiaries in Brazil 
are party to a large number of labor claims and non-income tax assessments, which have arisen during the normal course ofbusiness in Brazil.
 These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and if decided adversely to the Company, could materially adversely affect our financialperformance.
The economies of some of the 
countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if theyoccurred again, could a
dversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary andfiscal policies of th
e U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risksassociated with having numerous 
facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the U.S. Additional risks inherent in our internationaloperations generally in
clude, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty inenforcing intellec
tual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doingbusiness outside of the U.S., and may be exagg
erated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws andregulations.
In foreign countries in which we h
ave operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in businesspractices prohibited by U.S. laws and 
regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), or the laws and regulations of othercountries, such as the UK Bribery Act. W
e maintain policies prohibiting such business practices and have in place enhanced global anti-corruption complianceprograms designed to ensure co
mpliance with these laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our24

associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulationsof other countries may be 
customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so,violate such laws and regula
tions. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance andour reputation.
We are also subject to 
income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. TheU.S. Congress and the current federa
l administration have identified federal tax reform as a priority for 2017.  Federal tax reform plans under consideration mayresult in significant 
changes to the U.S. tax code. Some of the changes contemplated by the U.S. Congress, like the border tax or border adjustment tax, could havethe effect of incr
easing our effective tax rate, the amount of our consolidated net taxable income subject to income taxes, and our overall tax liability, and couldreduce our net income and ou
r earnings per share, as well as our consolidated cash flows and liquidity, even if the changes include a reduction in the rate at whichcorporate taxable in
come is taxed. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilitiesrequires judgment and est
imation. Our income taxes could also be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that havelower statutory tax rat
es and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets andliabilities, or by chang
es in worldwide tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles.We are subject to regu
lar review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changingtax regulations and legi
slation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recordedin our consolidated financ
ial statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which suchdetermination and set
tlement is made.We are subject to certain lega
l proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We are involved in a numbe
r of legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort and other litigation. In particular, we are currently a defendant in anumber of cases containing 
class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws, as well as a number ofcases containing class-
action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws.In addition, ASDA Stores, Ltd. ("ASDA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Comp
any, has been named as a defendant in nearly 10,000 "equal value" claimspending in the Manchester Emp
loyment Tribunal (the "Employment Tribunal") in the United Kingdom. The claimants, who are current and former ASDA storeemployees, allege tha
t the work performed by female employees in ASDA's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobsto that of male employ
ees working in ASDA's warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is notobjectively justifi
ed. The claimants are seeking differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouses and distribution facilities and higher wage rateson a prospective basis. At presen
t, we cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that mayarise from these proc
eedings. We discuss this case and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption " Item 3. Legal Proceedings " and in Note 10 in the "Notes to our Consolidated Financ
ial Statements," which are part of our Annual Report to Shareholders, which are incorporated by reference in this AnnualReport on Form 10-K and are included as 
an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We could be subject to liability, penalties and other sanc
tions and other adverse consequences arising out of our on-going FCPA matter.The Audit Committee of our Board of Di
rectors has been conducting an internal investigation into, among other things, alleged violations of the FCPA and otheralleged crimes or m
isconduct in connection with certain of our foreign subsidiaries, including Wal-Mart de México, S.A.B. de C.V. ("Walmex"), and whether priorallegations of such viola
tions and/or misconduct were appropriately handled by the Company. We have also been conducting a voluntary global review of ourpolicies, practices 
and internal controls for anti-corruption compliance and are engaged in strengthening our global anti-corruption compliance programs. Since theimplementation of th
e global review and enhanced anti-corruption compliance programs, the Audit Committee and we have identified or been made aware ofadditional allegat
ions regarding potential violations of the FCPA.Inquiries or investigat
ions regarding allegations of potential FCPA violations have been commenced in a number of foreign markets in which we operate,including, but not limited 
to, Brazil, China and India. In November 2011, we voluntarily disclosed our investigative activity to the U.S. Department of Justice (the"DOJ") and the SEC. We have been cooperating wi
th those agencies and discussions have begun with them regarding the resolution of these matters. Asdiscussions regarding resolut
ion are preliminary, we cannot currently predict the timing, the outcome or the impact of a possible resolution of these matters. Anumber of federal and lo
cal government agencies in Mexico have also initiated investigations of these matters. Furthermore, lawsuits relating to the matters underinvestigation have been f
iled by several of our shareholders against us, certain of our current and former directors and officers and certain of Walmex's current andformer officers.
25

We could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of these matters. One or more enforcement actions could be instituted in respect of thematters that are 
the subject of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines,penalties, injunctions, c
ease and desist orders, debarment or other relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties. The shareholder lawsuits may result in judgmentsagainst us and our current and 
former directors and officers named in those proceedings. We also expect that there will be ongoing media and governmental interestregarding these matters, incl
uding additional news articles on these matters that could impact the perception of our role as a corporate citizen among certainaudiences. Moreover, we have in
curred and expect to continue to incur costs in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimonyand other information in 
connection with the government investigations, in defending the shareholder lawsuits and in conducting our review and investigations.While we believe it is p
robable we will incur a loss from these matters, given the on-going nature and complexity of the review, inquiries and investigations wecannot yet reasonably est
imate a loss or range of loss that may arise from the conclusion of these matters. Although we do not presently believe that these matterswill have a materia
l adverse effect on our business, given the inherent uncertainties in such situations, we can provide no assurance that these matters will not bematerial to our business 
in the future.ITEM 1B.

ITEM 3.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS I. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: 
We discuss certain leg al proceedings in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, entitled "Contingencies,"which is one of the Notes to Consolidated Fin
ancial Statements incorporated by reference in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of thisAnnual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporat
ed by reference in this item. We refer you to that discussion for important information concerning those legalproceedings, including the bas
is for such actions and, where known, the relief sought. We provide the following additional information concerning those legalproceedings, including the na
me of the lawsuit, the court in which the lawsuit is pending, and the date on which the petition commencing the lawsuit was filed.ASDA Equal Value Claims:

; ASDA Stores Ltd v Ms S Brierley & Others (UKEAT/0009/16/JOJ - United Kingdom Employment Appeal Tribunal).II. CERTAIN OTHER PROCEEDINGS: 
The Company is a defendant in seve ral lawsuits in which the complaints closely track the allegations set forth in anews story that appeared in 
The New York Times ( the " Times " ) on April 21, 2012. One of these is a securities lawsuit that was filed on May 7, 2012, in theUnited States District Court fo
r the Middle District of Tennessee, and subsequently transferred to the Western District of Arkansas, in which the plaintiff allegesvarious violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrup
t Practices Act (the "FCPA") beginning in 2005, and asserts violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the SecuritiesExchange Act of 1934, as amended, re
lating to certain prior disclosures of the Company. The plaintiff seeks to represent a class of shareholders who purchased oracquired stock of the Company be
tween December 8, 2011, and April 20, 2012, and seeks damages and other relief based on allegations that the defendants'conduct affected the v
alue of such stock. On September 20, 2016, the court granted plaintiff's motion for class certification. On October 6, 2016, the defendantsfiled a petition to app
eal the class certification ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. On November 7, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for theEighth Circuit denied the Company's p
etition. In addition, a number of derivative complaints have been filed in Delaware and Arkansas, also tracking theallegations of the 
Times story, and naming various curr ent and former officers and directors as additional defendants. The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in whichthe Company is a nominal defend
ant) allege, among other things, that the defendants who are or were directors or officers of the Company breached their fiduciaryduties in connection with the
ir oversight of FCPA compliance. All of the derivative suits have been combined into two consolidated proceedings, one of which wasconsolidated in the United Sta
tes District Court for the Western District of Arkansas and the other in the Delaware Court of Chancery. On March 31, 2015, theWestern District of Arkans
as granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the consolidated derivative proceedings in that court. On April 15, 2015, plaintiffs filedtheir notice of appea
l with the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. On July 22, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuitaffirmed the dismiss
al of the consolidated derivative proceedings in Arkansas. There was no appeal from that ruling. On May 13, 2016, the Delaware Court ofChancery granted the defend
ants' motion to dismiss the consolidated derivative proceedings in that court. On June 10, 2016, plaintiffs in the Delaware consolidatedderivative proceedings 
filed their notice of appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court. On January 18, 2017, the Delaware Supreme Court remanded those proceedingsto the Court of Chancery for fur
ther briefing and an additional ruling on due process issues raised by the plaintiffs, before the Delaware Supreme Court renders itsultimate decision on th
e appeal. Management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with theseproceedings will be mate
rial to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.Securities Class Action:

III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires dis closure of certain environmental matters. The following matters aredisclosed in accordance wi
th that requirement. For the matters listed below, management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss thatmay be incurred in connec
tion with each matter, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.In November and December 2016, the Env
ironmental and Natural History Ministry of Chiapas, Mexico ("Ministry") notified a subsidiary of the Company,Arrendadora de Centros Comerci
ales, S. de R.L. de C.V. ("Arrendadora"), that it was proposing aggregated penalties approximating $430,000 in respect to fourstores which the Ministry bel
ieved may have been constructed without first obtaining a required environmental impact license. Arrendadora has challenged thepenalties before an ad
ministrative court and the trials are in process. The Ministry had previously proposed penalties of approximately $640,000 related to thismatter in 2014, but Arrendador
a was released by an administrative court from payment of such penalties on the basis that the Ministry had failed to comply withlegal formalities in connection
 with their imposition.In November 2016, the state envi
ronmental agency in Santa Catarina, Brazil imposed aggregate penalties of approximately $180,000 against WMS Supermercadosdo Brasil Ltda ("Walmar
t Brazil") related to the fuel station at its store in Posto Camboriú. Such amount includes penalties related to a fuel tank leak and foroperation of the fuel st
ation in non-compliance with its license from 2009-2013 and without a license commencing in 2013. These matters had been self-reportedby Walmart Brazil to the en
vironmental agency following an internal licensure review. Walmart Brazil has filed its defense with the agency against the impositionof these penalties as wel
l as its remediation plans and has been monitoring the underground water for contamination. Following the filing of that defense, in March2017 the environmental agen
cy reduced the aggregate penalties to approximately $90,000 which amount has been paid by Walmart Brazil.During fiscal year 2015, a Cali
fornia Greenwashing Task Force informed the Company that it was investigating whether the Company had violated a Californiastatute that prohibits 
the sale of plastic products labeled by the Company's suppliers as "biodegradable" or "compostable." In January 2017, the Company enteredinto a settlement ag
reement under which it agreed to pay approximately $950,000. The Company also agreed to abide by a permanent injunction requiringcompliance with Californ
ia's laws related to the sale of products labeled "biodegradable," "degradable," "compostable," or "decomposable."On April 23, 2015, Wal-Mart Transport
ation LLC, a subsidiary of the Company, received a Finding and Notice of Violation from the Environmental ProtectionAgency alleging that Wal
mart Transportation violated the California Air Resources Board's Truck and Bus regulations by failing to install particulate matter filterson some diesel fueled vehi
cles. The Company responded and is in settlement negotiations with the agency.On April 6, 2015, representatives fo
r the Brazilian Institute of the Environment alleged that Walmart Brazil had failed to file required reports documenting thenumber of tires import
ed, sold and recycled. The agency proposed a penalty of approximately $857,000, which may be doubled and excludes additional amounts inrespect of inflation and i
nterest, and prohibited Walmart Brazil from selling or importing tires until the matter is resolved. In October 2015, Walmart Brazil filed itsdefense with the agency aga
inst the imposition of this penalty.In April 2013, a subsidiary of the Company, Corpo
racion de Compañias Agroindustriales, operating in Costa Rica, became aware that the Municipality ofCurridabat is seeking a pena
lty of approximately $380,000 in connection with the construction of a retaining wall seventeen years ago for a perishables distributioncenter that is situated alon
g a protected river bank. The subsidiary obtained permits from the Municipality and the Secretaria Técnica Nacional Ambiental at thetime of construction, but 
the Municipality now alleges that the wall is non-conforming.In January 2011, the Environmenta
l Department of Porto Alegre Municipality formally notified Walmart Brazil of soil inspection reports indicating soilcontamination due to le
akage of oil from power generating equipment at nine store locations in Brazil. Walmart Brazil is cooperating with the agency as well as theDistrict Attorney's Office 
for the State of Rio Grande do Sul and has filed a mitigation plan to address the situation.ITEM 4.

ITEM 9A.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosur
e controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, isaccumulated and commun
icated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls andprocedures, no matter how well d
esigned and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management isnecessarily required 
to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control ormanage those entities, ou
r controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to ourconsolidated subsidiaries.
In the ordinary course of busin
ess, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controlsand increase effic
iency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, moreefficient systems, upda
ting existing systems, automating manual processes, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasingmonitoring controls. 
These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financialreporting. However, they allow us to con
tinue to enhance our internal control over financial reporting and ensure that our internal control environment remainseffective.
An evaluation of the effe
ctiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report wasperformed under the superv
ision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon thatevaluation, our Chief Execut
ive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonableassurance that inform
ation required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, isaccumulated and commun
icated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisionsregarding required disc
losure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within thetime periods specifi
ed by the SEC's rules and forms.Reports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

9. 
Deferral of Restricted Stock. A. 
Mandatory  Deferral .  If Walmart reasonably anticipates that the delivery of Shares upon the vesting of RestrictedStock
 in any year, when considered with your other compensation, would result in Walmart’s inability to deduct the value of suchShares
 because of the limitation on deductible compensation under Code Section 162(m), then Walmart shall defer the delivery ofsuch
 Shares until the first year in which Walmart reasonably anticipates that the related deduction will not be limited under Section162(m) (the “First Non-162(m) Year”) in
 accordance with the Deferral Procedures under the Plan and Code Section 409A. However,if
 you have made an irrevocable election to defer such Shares to a date later than the First Non-162(m) Year, then Walmart shall notdeliver
 such Shares in the First Non-162(m) Year, but shall instead deliver your Shares in accordance with your irrevocable electionand the Deferral Procedures.
B. 
Elective Deferral of  Restricted Stock . If  you are eligible to defer delivery of the Shares underlying your RestrictedStock award to
 a future date in accordance with Section 7.8 of the Plan and rules and procedures relating thereto, you will be advisedas to when any such deferral election must be made and the rules and procedures applicable to such deferral election.
10.     
Taxes and Tax Withholding . A. 
You  agree  to  consult  with  any  tax  advisors  you  think  necessary  in  connection  with  your  Restricted  Stock  andacknowledge
 that you are not relying, and will not rely, on Walmart or any Affiliate for any tax advice. Please see Paragraph 10.Fregarding Section 83(b) elections.
B. 
You  acknowledge  that,  regardless  of  any  action  taken  by  Walmart  or,  if  different,  the  Employer,  the  ultimateliability
 for all income tax, social insurance, pension, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related itemsrelated
 to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you (“Tax-Related Items”), is and remains your responsibility andmay
 exceed the amount actually withheld by Walmart or the Employer. You further acknowledge that Walmart and/or the Employer(a)
 make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of theRestricted
 Stock, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement of the Restricted Stock, the subsequent sale of Sharesacquired
 pursuant  to  such  settlement  and  the  receipt  of  any  dividends;  and  (b)  do  not  commit  to  and  are  under  no  obligation  tostructure
 the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Restricted Stock to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items orachieve
 any particular tax result. Further, if you are subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledgethat
 Walmart and/or the Employer (or your former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-RelatedItems in more than one jurisdiction.
C. 
Prior  to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangementssatisfactory
 to  Walmart  and  the  Employer  to  satisfy  all  Tax-Related  Items.  In  this  regard,  you  authorize  Walmart  and/or  theEmployer or their respective agents, at
4

their sole discretion, to satisfy any applicable withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by withholding of Sharesto
 be  issued  upon  settlement  of  the  vested  Restricted  Stock.  In  the  event  that  such  withholding  in  Shares  is  problematic  underapplicable
 tax or securities law or has materially adverse accounting consequences, by your acceptance of the Restricted Stock andthis
 Agreement, you authorize and direct: (a) Walmart and any broker or other third party designated by Walmart to sell on yourbehalf
 a  whole  number  of  Shares  corresponding  to  the  vested  Restricted  Stock  that  Walmart  or  the  Employer  determines  to  beappropriate
 to  generate  cash  proceeds  sufficient  to  satisfy  the  obligation  for  Tax-Related  Items;  and  (b)  Walmart  and/or  theEmployer,
 or their respective agents, at their sole discretion, to satisfy the Tax-Related Items by any other method of withholding,including through withholding from your wages or other cash compensation paid to you by Walmart or any Affiliate.
D. 
Depending  on the withholding method, Walmart or the Employer may withhold or account for Tax-Related Itemsby considering applicable minimum
 statutory withholding rates or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicablerates. Further, if
 the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to havebeen
 issued  the  full  number  of  Shares  subject  to  the  vested  Restricted  Stock,  notwithstanding  that  a  number  of  the  Shares  arewithheld solely
 for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. If as a result of withholding whole Shares, an excess amount of taxis withheld, such excess tax will be reported and paid to the applicable tax authorities or regulatory body. In the event that any excess
amounts
 are withheld to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items, you may be entitled to receive a refund of any over-withheldamount in the form of cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent.
E. 
Finally,  you  agree  to  pay  to  Walmart  or  the  Employer  any  amount  of  Tax-Related  Items  that  Walmart  or  theEmployer
 may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by themeans
 previously described. Walmart may refuse to deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares, if you fail to complywith your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.

3

settlement of your Plan Award to avoid adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code.9. 
Deferral . A. 
Mandatory Deferral. If  Walmart reasonably anticipates that the delivery of Shares upon the vesting of the RSUs inany
 year, when considered with your other compensation, would result in Walmart’s inability to deduct the value of suchShares
 because of the limitation on deductible compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, then Walmart shall defer thedelivery
 of such Shares until the first year in which Walmart reasonably anticipates that the related deduction will not belimited
 under  Section  162(m)  of  the  Code  (the  “First  Non-162(m)  Year”)  in  accordance  with  the  deferral  proceduresestablished
 pursuant to the Plan and Section 409A of the Code. However, if you have made an irrevocable election to defersuch
 Shares to a date later than the First Non-162(m)  Year, then Walmart  shall not deliver  such Shares in the First Non-162(m)
 Year, but shall instead deliver your Shares in accordance with your irrevocable election and the deferral proceduresestablished pursuant to the Plan and Section 409A of the Code.
B. 
Elective  Deferral of Restricted Stock Units .  If you are eligible to defer delivery of the Shares underlying yourRSU
 award to a future date in accordance with Section 8.7 of the Plan and rules and procedures relating thereto, you will beadvised as to when any such deferral election must be made and the rules and procedures applicable to such deferral election.
10. 
Taxes and Tax Withholding . A. 
You  agree to consult with any tax advisors you think necessary in connection with your RSUs and acknowledgethat you are not relying, and will not rely, on Walmart or any Affiliate for any tax advice.
B. 
You  acknowledge that, regardless of any action taken by Walmart or, if different, the Affiliate that employs you(the
 “Employer”), the ultimate liability for all income tax, social insurance, pension, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, paymenton
 account or other tax-related items related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you (“Tax-RelatedItems”)
 is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by Walmart or the Employer. Youfurther
 acknowledge that Walmart and/or the Employer (a) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatmentof
 any  Tax-Related  Items  in  connection  with  any  aspect  of  the  RSUs,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  the  grant,  vesting  orsettlement
 of the RSUs, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such settlement and the receipt of any dividends;and
 (b) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the RSUs or any aspect of the RSUs to reduceor
 eliminate  your  liability  for  Tax-Related  Items  or  achieve  any  particular  tax  result.  Further,  if  you  are  subject  to  Tax-Related
 Items in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that Walmart and/or the Employer (or your former employer,as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
4

C. Prior  to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangementssatisfactory
 to Walmart and the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, you authorize Walmart and/or theEmployer,
 or their respective agents, at their sole discretion, to satisfy their withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related
 Items by withholding of Shares to be issued upon settlement of the vested RSUs. In the event that such withholdingin
 Shares is problematic under applicable tax or securities law or has materially adverse accounting consequences, by youracceptance
 of  the  RSUs  and  this  Agreement,  you  authorize  and  direct  Walmart,  and  any  broker  or  other  third  partydesignated
 by Walmart to sell on your behalf a whole number of Shares corresponding to the vested RSUs that Walmart orthe
 Employer  determines  to  be  appropriate  to  generate  cash  proceeds  sufficient  to  satisfy  the  obligation  for  Tax-RelatedItems.
 However,  Walmart  may  also  require  you  to  satisfy  the  Tax-Related  Items  by  any  other  method  of  withholding  itauthorizes,
 in its sole discretion, including through withholding from your wages or other cash compensation paid to you byWalmart or any Affiliate.
D. 
Depending  on the withholding method, Walmart or the Employer may withhold or account for Tax-Related Itemsby
 considering applicable minimum statutory withholding rates or other applicable withholding rates, including maximumapplicable
 rates. Further, if the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, youare
 deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested RSUs, notwithstanding that a number of theShares
 are withheld solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. If as a result of withholding whole Shares, anexcess
 amount of tax is withheld, such excess tax will be reported and paid to the applicable tax authorities or regulatorybody.
 In the event that any excess amounts are withheld to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items, you may be entitledto receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in the form of cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent.
E. 
Finally,  you  agree  to  pay  to  Walmart  or  the  Employer  any  amount  of  Tax-Related  Items  that  Walmart  or  theEmployer
 may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied bythe
 means previously described. Walmart may refuse to deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares, if you fail tocomply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.
11. 
RSUs Not Transferable . The RSUs may  not be sold, conveyed, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of orencumbered at
 any time prior to vesting of the RSUs and the issuance of the underlying Shares. Any attempted action in violation ofthis Paragraph 11 shall be null, void, and without effect.
12. 
Country-Specific  Appendix .  Notwithstanding any provision in these Global Share-Settled RSU Notification and Termsand
 Conditions to the contrary, the grant of RSUs also shall be subject to any special terms and conditions set forth in any appendixattached
 hereto  (the  “Appendix”)  with  respect  to  certain  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  specific  to  your  country.  Moreover,  if  yourelocate
 to one of the countries included in the Appendix, the special terms and conditions for such country will apply to you, to theextent Walmart determines that the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative

2. 
Mandatory  Deferral .  If  Walmart  reasonably  anticipates  that  the  delivery  of  Shares  upon  the  vesting  ofAdjusted
 PRSUs in any year would, when considered with your other compensation, result in Walmart’s inability todeduct
 the value of such Shares because of the limitation on deductible compensation under Section 162(m) of theCode,
 then  Walmart  shall  defer  the  delivery  of  such  Shares  until  the  first  year  in  which  Walmart  reasonablyanticipates
 that the related deduction will not be limited under Section 162(m) of the Code (the “First Non-162(m)Year”)
 in accordance with the deferral procedures established pursuant to the Plan and Section 409A of the Code.However,
 if you have made an irrevocable election to defer such Shares to a date later than the First Non-162(m)Year (and to the extent Walmart has permitted such an election), then Walmart shall not deliver such
3

Shares  in  the  First  Non-162(m)  Year,  but  shall  instead  deliver  your  Shares  in  accordance  with  your  irrevocableelection and the deferral procedures established pursuant to the Plan and Section 409A of the Code.
To
 the extent you are a “covered employee” within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, your Plan Award andthis
 Agreement are subject to, and conditioned upon, shareholder approval of the material terms of the PerformanceGoals referred to in Paragraph 5.A above.
6. 
Forfeiture  Condition .  Subject  to  Paragraph  8  below,  any  PRSUs  that  would  otherwise  vest  in  whole  or  in  part  on  theVesting Date, if any, will not vest and will be immediately forfeited if, prior to the Vesting Date:
A. 
your  Continuous  Status  terminates  for  any  reason  (other  than  death  or  Disability,  to  the  extent  provided  inParagraph 8 below); or
B. 
you  have not executed and delivered to Walmart a Non-Disclosure and Restricted Use Agreement, in a form to beprovided to you by Walmart.
Each of
 the events described in Paragraphs 6.A and 6.B above shall be referred to as a “Forfeiture Condition” for purposes ofthis
 Agreement. Furthermore, if applicable, you shall be advised if the Committee has determined that vesting of this Plan Award isfurther
 conditioned upon your execution and delivery to Walmart of a Post Termination Agreement and Covenant Not to Compete,in
 a form to be provided to you by Walmart. If applicable, the failure to execute and deliver such Post Termination Agreement andCovenant
 Not to Compete prior to the Vesting Date shall also be deemed a “Forfeiture Condition” for purposes of this Agreement.Upon the occurrence of a Forfeiture 
Condition, you shall have no further rights with respect to such PRSUs or the underlying Shares.7. 
Administrative  Suspension .  If you are subject to an administrative suspension, vesting of your PRSUs may be suspendedas of the date you are placed on administrative
 suspension. If you are not reinstated as an Associate in good standing at the end of theadministrative
 suspension period, your PRSUs may be immediately forfeited and you shall have no further rights with respect tosuch
 PRSUs  or  the  underlying  Shares.  If  you  are  reinstated  as  an  Associate  in  good  standing  at  the  end  of  the  administrativesuspension
 period, then the vesting of your PRSUs will resume as provided in Paragraph 5, and any PRSUs that would have vestedwhile
 you were on administrative suspension will vest and the corresponding number of Shares will be delivered to you as soon asadministratively
 feasible,  but  in  any  event  within  74  days  of  the  end  of  the  administrative  suspension  period  which  shall  beconsidered the Vesting Date for purposes of this Paragraph 7.
8. 
Accelerated  Vesting; Vesting Notwithstanding Termination of Continuous Status by Death or Disability .  Your PRSUswill vest earlier than described in Paragraph 5.B. above, and
 such earlier vesting date shall also be considered a Vesting Date, if yourContinuous
 Status  is  terminated  by  your  death  or  Disability  prior  to  the  Vesting  Date  and  you  have  not  incurred  a  ForfeitureCondition. The number of Shares you will become vested in under this Paragraph 8 shall be determined as follows:
A. 
Any  PRSUs that are scheduled to vest within 90 days of the date that your Continuous Status is terminated byreason of your death or Disability will become
4

immediately  vested; provided,  however ,  that  if  the  determination  of  attainment  of  Performance  Goals  has  not  yet  beendetermined
 for  your  Plan  Award,  then  achievement  of  Target  performance  for  all  applicable  Performance  Goals  shall  beassumed for purposes of this Paragraph 8.A; and
B. 
Any  PRSUs that are scheduled to vest more than 90 days but within the same fiscal year as the date on which yourContinuous Status was terminated
 by reason of your death or Disability shall vest and the number of Shares you shall receivewill
 be prorated by dividing: (x) the number of calendar days from the Grant Date to the date your Continuous Status wasterminated 
by (y)  the  number  of  calendar  days  from  the  Grant  Date  through  the  Vesting  Date  set  forth  above; provided, however 
,  that  if  the  determination  of  attainment  of  Performance  Goals  has  not  yet  occurred  for  your  Plan  Award,  thenachievement
 of Target performance for all applicable Performance Goals shall be assumed for purposes of this Paragraph8.B.
For
 purposes of this Paragraph 8, your Continuous Status will be considered terminated on the date of death or the date onwhich
 your  employment  or  other  service  relationship  has  been  legally  terminated  by  reason  of  Disability.  For  purposes  of  thisAgreement, “Disability”
 shall mean that you would qualify to receive benefit payments under the long-term disability plan or policy,as
 it may be amended from time to time, of Walmart or, if different, the Employer, regardless of whether you are covered by suchpolicy.
  If  Walmart  or,  if  different,  the  Employer  does  not  have  a  long-term  disability  policy,  for  purposes  of  this  Agreement,“Disability”
 means that you are unable to carry out the responsibilities and functions of the position held by you by reason of anymedically
 determined physical or mental impairment for a period of not less than one hundred and eighty (180) consecutive days. You
 shall not be considered to have incurred a Disability unless you furnish proof of such impairment sufficient to satisfy Walmartin its
 discretion. If your Continuous Status is terminated due to a Disability, you agree to promptly notify the Walmart Global Equityteam.
 Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, Walmart will not accelerate your Plan Award if Walmart has not receivednotification
 of your termination within such period of time that it determines, in its sole discretion, to be necessary to process thesettlement of your Plan Award to avoid adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code.
9. 
Permanent Transfers Between Walmart and Walmart Affiliates . A. 
Permanent  Transfers  and  Continuous  Status .  For  the  avoidance  of  doubt,  a  permanent  transfer  of  ContinuousStatus from Walmart,
 or the Employer (if different), to another Affiliate or from an Affiliate to Walmart does not constitute atermination of your Continuous Status.
B. 
Applicable  Performance  Measures  and  Goals  Upon  Permanent  Transfer .  If  you  permanently  transfer  yourContinuous Status
 during the Performance Period, then the performance criteria and the resulting adjustment will be proratedand/or
 adjusted  to  reflect  the  proportion  of  the  Performance  Period  during  which  you  provided  service  to  Walmart,  or,  ifdifferent,
 the  Affiliate  that  initially  employed  you  (the  “Initial  Employer”)  and  the  proportion  of  the  Performance  Periodduring
 which  you  provided  service  to  Walmart  or,  if  different,  the  Affiliate  to  which  you  permanently  transferred  (the“Subsequent Employer”).
5

C. Permanent  Transfers  to  Affiliate  or  Position  where  Performance-Based  Awards  are  Not  Granted .  If  youpermanently
 transfer your Continuous Status to an Affiliate or into a position where performance-based Plan Awards are notgranted,
 the performance criteria applicable for the remaining portion of your Performance Period shall be communicated toyou, and your PRSUs will be prorated and adjusted using the methodology described in Paragraph 9.B above.
D. 
Transfers  to New Position with Same Employer .  If you transfer to a position with the same Employer (as definedherein)
 but your new position is subject to different applicable Performance Measures (including any applicable weightingsthereof)
 and  Performance  Goals,  then  the  performance  criteria  applicable  for  the  remaining  portion  of  your  PerformancePeriod
 shall be communicated to you, and your PRSUs will be prorated and adjusted using the methodology described inParagraph 9.B above.
10. 
Taxes and Tax Withholding . A. 
You  agree to consult with any tax advisors you think necessary in connection with your PRSUs and acknowledgethat you are not relying, and will not rely, on Walmart or any Affiliate for any tax advice.
B. 
You  acknowledge  that,  regardless  of  any  action  taken  by  Walmart  (or  if  different,  the  Employer),  the  ultimateliability
 for all income tax, social insurance, pension, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-relateditems
 related  to  your  participation  in  the  Plan  and  legally  applicable  to  you  (“Tax-Related  Items”)  is  and  remains  yourresponsibility
 and  may  exceed  the  amount  actually  withheld  by  Walmart  or  the  Employer.  You  further  acknowledge  thatWalmart
 and/or the Employer (a) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Itemsin
 connection with any aspect of the PRSUs, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement of the PRSUs, thesubsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such settlement and the receipt of any dividends; and (b) do not commit to and
are
 under no obligation to structure the terms of the PRSUs or any aspect of the PRSUs to reduce or eliminate your liabilityfor
 Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if you are subject to Tax-Related Items in more than onejurisdiction, you acknowledge that Walmart and/or the Employer (or your former employer, as applicable) may be required to
withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
C. 
Prior  to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangementssatisfactory
 to Walmart and the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, you authorize Walmart, to satisfyany
 applicable  withholding  obligations  with  regard  to  all  Tax-Related  Items  by  withholding  of  Shares  to  be  issued  uponsettlement
 of  the  Adjusted  PRSUs.  In  the  event  that  such  withholding  in  Shares  is  problematic  under  applicable  tax  orsecurities law or
 has materially adverse accounting consequences, by your acceptance of the PRSUs and this Agreement, youauthorize
 and direct (a) Walmart and any broker or other third party designated by Walmart to sell on your behalf a wholenumber
 of  Shares  corresponding  to  the  Adjusted  PRSUs  that  Walmart  or  the  Employer  determines  to  be  appropriate  togenerate
 cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items and (b) Walmart and/or the Employer, ortheir respective agents, at their sole discretion to satisfy the Tax-Related
6

Items by any other method of withholding, including through withholding from your wages or other cash compensation paidto you by Walmart or any Affiliate.
D. 
Depending  on the withholding method, Walmart or the Employer may withhold or account for the Tax-RelatedItems
 by  considering  applicable  minimum  statutory  withholding  rates  or  other  applicable  withholding  rates,  includingmaximum
 applicable  rates.  Further,  if  the  obligation  for  Tax-Related  Items  is  satisfied  by  withholding  in  Shares,  for  taxpurposes, you are
 deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the Adjusted PRSUs, notwithstanding thata
 number of the Shares are withheld solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. In the event that any excessamounts
 are  withheld  to  satisfy  the  obligation  for  Tax-Related  Items,  you  may  be  entitled  to  receive  a  refund  of  anyoverwithheld amount in the form of cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent.
E. 
Finally,  you  agree  to  pay  to  Walmart  or  the  Employer  any  amount  of  Tax-Related  Items  that  Walmart  or  theEmployer
 may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied bythe
 means previously described. Walmart may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares, ifyou fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.

     Separate Covenants . This Agreement shall be deemed to consist of a series of separate covenants, one for each line of business included within the Business as it may be conducted by the Company and its successors on or after the date hereof, and
each city, county, state, country or other region included within the Business Area. The parties expressly agree that the character,
duration and geographical scope of this Agreement are reasonable in light of the circumstances as they exist on the date upon which
this Agreement has been executed. However, should a determination nonetheless be made by a Court at a later date that the
character, duration or geographical scope of this Agreement is unreasonable in light of the circumstances as they then exist, then it is
the intention and the agreement of the Company, the Acquiror and Holder that this Agreement shall be construed in such a manner as
to impose only those restrictions on the conduct of Holder that may be enforceable under applicable law, to the fullest extent of such
enforceability to assure the Company and the Acquiror of the intended benefit of this Agreement. If, in any judicial proceeding, a
Court shall refuse to enforce all of the separate covenants deemed included herein because, taken together, they are more extensive
than necessary to assure the Company and the Acquiror of the intended benefit of this Agreement, it is expressly understood and
agreed among the parties hereto that those of such covenants that, if eliminated, would permit the remaining separate covenants to be
enforced in such proceeding shall, for the purpose of such proceeding, be deemed eliminated from the provisions hereof.
9. 
     Severability . If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a Court to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.
4

which would require the application of the law of any other jurisdiction. By its execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by
any party or its successors or assigns against any other party shall be brought and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, provided, that if jurisdiction is not then available in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, then any such legal
action or proceeding may be brought in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or any other Delaware state court, and

property, generally and unconditionally, with regard to any such action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the parties agrees not to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating thereto

provided herein shall constitute sufficient service of process and the parties further waive any argument that such service is
insufficient. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as described herein

(b) 
     Any failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein may bewaived by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party granting such waiver,
but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as
a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.
12. 
     Entire Agreement . This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof; except for that certain Non-
Disclosure and Restricted Use Agreement dated as of August 7, 2016, which is in full and force and effect, along with this
Agreement.
5

13.      Counterparts . This Agreement may be executed by the parties in separate counterparts (including facsimile and electronic transmission counterparts), each of which, when so executed and delivered, shall be an original, but all of which, when

Agreement, unless otherwise specified, and include all subparts thereof.

the Acquiror (in the case of an assignment by Holder) or the Holder (in the case of an assignment by the Acquiror or the Company),
and any such assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void; 
provided , however , that the Acquiror or the Company may assign this Agreement to any Affiliate of the Acquiror without the prior consent of Holder; 
provided , further , that no assignment shall limit the assignor’s obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.
16. 
     Further Assurances . From time to time, at the request of any member of the Company and without further consideration, Holder shall execute and deliver such additional documents and take all such further action as reasonably requested, to
make effective, in the most expeditious manner possible, the terms of this Agreement.

Table of ContentsItem 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Overview
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("
Walmart," the "Company" or "we") is engaged in retail and wholesale operations in various formats around the world. Through ouroperations, we help people around 
the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – in retail stores or through our e-commerce and mobilecapabilities. Through innova
tion, we are striving to create a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping and saves time forour customers. Physical ret
ail encompasses our brick and mortar presence in each of the markets in which we operate. Digital retail is comprised of our e-commerce websites and mob
ile commerce applications. Each week, we serve over 260 million customers who visit our 11,695 stores under 59 banners in 28 countries and e-comme
rce websites in 11 countries. Our strategy is to lead on price, invest to differentiate on access, be competitive on assortment and deliver agreat experience. By le
ading on price we earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everydaylow prices ("EDLP"). EDLP is our pricing philosophy under whi
ch we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not changeunder frequent promotiona
l activity. Price leadership is core to who we are. Everyday low cost ("EDLC") is our commitment to control expenses so our costsavings can be passed along to our cus
tomers. Our digital and physical presence, which we are investing in to integrate, provides customers access to our broadassortment anytime and 
anywhere. We strive to give our customers and members a great digital and physical shopping experience.Our operations consist of thre
e reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.•
Walmart U.S. is our largest segment with three primary store formats, as well as digital retail. Of our three reportable segments, Walmart U.S. hashistorically had the high
est gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit rate"). In addition, it has historically contributed the greatest amount tothe Company's net sales and opera
ting income.•
Walmart International consists of our operations outside of the U.S. and includes retail, wholesale and other businesses. These businesses consist ofnumerous formats, including sup
ercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs, including Sam's Clubs, cash & carry, home improvement,specialty electronics, apparel 
stores, drug stores and convenience stores, as well as digital retail. The overall gross profit rate for Walmart International islower than that of Walm
art U.S. primarily because of its merchandise mix. Walmart International is our second largest segment and has grown throughacquisitions, as well as by adding 
retail, wholesale and other units, and expanding digital retail.•
Sam's Club consists of membership-only warehouse clubs as well as digital retail. As a membership-only warehouse club, membership income is asignificant component of 
the segment's operating income. Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentageof net sales than our other s
egments.The following example
s illustrate the pursuit of our strategy to create a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping: •
In September 2016, we completed the acquisition of Jet.com, Inc. ("jet.com"), a U.S. based e-commerce company. The total purchase price for theacquisition was $2.4 billion, net o
f cash acquired. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price includes $1.7 billion in goodwill and $0.6 billion inintangible assets. As part of 
the transaction consideration, we will pay additional amounts accounted for as compensation of approximately $0.8billion over a five yea
r period, including approximately $0.5 billion in cash and approximately $0.3 billion in equity. The impact on fiscal 2017 net salesand operating income as a 
result of the acquisition was not significant. The acquisition of jet.com is in line with the Company's strategic framework ofaccelerating e-commerce growth.
•
In June 2016, we announced our strategic alliance with JD.com, Inc. ("JD") and the sale to JD of certain assets relating to Yihaodian, our e-commerceoperations in China, including th
e Yihaodian brand, website and application in exchange for approximately 5 percent of JD's outstanding ordinary shareson a fully diluted basis. The sa
le resulted in the recognition of a $535 million noncash gain in our International segment, which gain is included inmembership and other inco
me in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Subsequently, during fiscal 2017, the Company purchased $1.9billion of additional J
D shares classified as available for sale securities, representing an incremental ownership percentage of approximately five percent,for a total ownership of approx
imately ten percent of JD's outstanding ordinary shares.Each of our segments contribu
tes to the Company's operating results differently. Each, however, has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to theCompany's net sales and operating 
income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due tofluctuations in curren
cy exchange rates.Our fiscal year ends on 
January 31 for our U.S. and Canadian operations. We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendaryear basis. Our business is seasonal 
to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns. Historically, ourhighest sales volume and oper
ating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31 . 3

Table of ContentsThis discussion, which presents our resu
lts for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017 ("fiscal 2017 "), January 31, 2016 ("fiscal 2016 ") and January 31, 2015 ("fiscal 
2015 ") should be read in conjunction wi th our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. We intend for this discussion to provide thereader with information that
 will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period toperiod and the primary f
actors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company'sperformance. Additional
ly, the discussion provides information about the financial results of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding ofhow each of those segments and its 
results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole.Throughout this Management's Discussion 
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we discuss segment operating income, comparable storeand club sales and other me
asures. Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certaincorporate overhead allocation
s, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including certaincorporate overhead al
locations, and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. When we do so,the previous period amounts and b
alances are reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation.Comparable store and club sa
les is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing U.S. stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such storesand clubs, including e-comm
erce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year. Walmart's definition of comparable store andclub sales includes sales 
from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as e-commerce sales. We measure the e-c
ommerce sales impact by including those sales initiated through websites and mobile commerce applications and fulfilledthrough our e-commerce d
istribution facilities, as well as an estimate for sales initiated online and on our mobile commerce applications, but fulfilled through ourstores and clubs. Sales of a stor
e that has changed in format are excluded from comparable store and club sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied bya relocation or expansion 
that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent. Additionally, sales related to e-commerce acquisitionsare excluded until such a
cquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable store and club sales are also referred to as "same-store" sales by others within theretail industry. The me
thod of calculating comparable store and club sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable store and clubsales is not necessarily 
comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.In discussing our operating resu
lts, we use the term "currency exchange rates" to refer to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for allcountries where the funct
ional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. We calculate the effect of changes in currencyexchange rates from th
e prior period to the current period as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchangerates, and current per
iod activity translated using the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results ofthis calculation as th
e impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operatingincome, of the Company and the W
almart International segment in the future.The Retail Industry
We operate in the highly 
competitive retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar,variety and specialty s
tores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as e-commerce and catalog businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional orinternational chains or ha
ve a national or international online presence. We compete with a number of companies for prime retail site locations, as well as inattracting and ret
aining quality employees (whom we call "associates"). We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, butnot limited to: cat
astrophic events, weather, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer creditavailability, cost of goods, 
currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions,insurance costs, interes
t rates, labor costs, tax rates, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment. Further information on the factors that can affect our operatingresults and on certain r
isks to our Company and an investment in its securities can be found under "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended 
January 31, 2017 , and in the discussion under "Cautiona ry Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Information" in ourAnnual Report on 
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2017 . 4

Table of ContentsCompany Performance Metrics
We are committed 
to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs.  At times, we adjust ourbusiness strategies to ma
intain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate.  For several years, our performance metricsemphasized three financial prioritie
s: growth, expense leverage and returns.  We are currently making strategic investments in our associates and in the integrationof digital and physical r
etail.  These investments support long-term growth while we maintain our heritage of everyday low prices which are supported by everydaylow cost.  During this time of inc
reased investments, we are focused primarily on growth, balanced by the long-term health of the Company including expenseleverage and returns.  Although we wi
ll continue to grow through new stores and clubs, our growth going forward will rely more on increasing comparable storeand club sales and accelerati
ng e-commerce sales growth.Our objective of balancing g
rowth with returns means that we are focused on efficiently employing assets for return on investment and more effectively managingworking capital to delive
r strong free cash flow. We plan to provide returns to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.Growth
We measure our growth prim
arily by the amount of the period-over-period growth in our net sales and our comparable store and club sales, which include theimpact of e-comme
rce sales. At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company. These strategic investments maynot benefit net sales and 
comparable store and club sales in the near term.Net Sales

creased $2.7 billion or 0.6% for fiscal 2017 and decreased $3.6 billion or 0.7% for fiscal 2016 , when compared to the previous f iscalyear. Net sales for fiscal 
2017 were positively impact ed by overall positive comparable sales and e-commerce sales and the 1.3% year-over-year growth in consolidated retail squ
are feet. The positive effect of such factors was partially offset by a negative impact of $11.0 billion or 2.3% as a result of fluctua tions incurrency exchange rat
es and a $0.4 billion decrease in fuel sal es from lower fuel prices at the Sam's Club segment. Net sales for fiscal  2016  were negatively impacted by $17.1 billion or 3.5% 
as a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates and a $1.9 billion decrease in fuel sales from lower fuel prices at the Sam'sClub segment. The negative ef
fect of such factors was partially offset by 1.3% year-over-year growth in retail square feet, positive comparable sales in the WalmartU.S. segment and higher e-comme
rce sales across the Company.Calendar Comparable Store and Club Sales
Comparable store and club sa
les is a metric which indicates the performance of our existing U.S. stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such storesand clubs, including e-comm
erce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparablestore and club sales using the 
retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable store and clubsales using the retail 
calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable store and club sales below, we are referring to ourcalendar comparable store and
 club sales calculated using our fiscal calendar. As our fiscal calendar differs from the retail calendar, our fiscal calendar comparablestore and club sales also di
ffer from the retail calendar comparable store and club sales provided in our quarterly earnings releases. Calendar comparable store andclub sales, as well as the i
mpact of fuel, for fiscal 2017 and 2016 , were as follows:

Table of ContentsComparable store and club sa
les in the U.S., including fuel, increased 1.4% and 0.3% in fiscal 2017 and 2016 , respectively, when compar ed to the previous fiscalyear. The fiscal 
2017 total U.S. comparable store and club sales were positively impacted by continued traffic improvement and higher e-commerce sales at theWalmart U.S. segment, part
ially offset by the negative impact of lower fuel sales primarily due to lower fuel prices at the Sam's Club segment. E-commerce salespositively impacted comparable
 sales approximately 0.4% and 0.7% for Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club, respe ctively, for fiscal 2017 . The fiscal 2016  total U.S. comparable store and club
 sales were positively impacted by continued traffic improvement and higher e-commerce sales at the Walmart U.S. segment, offset to asignificant degree by the
 negative impact of lower fuel sales from lower fuel prices at the Sam's Club segment. E-commerce sales positively impacted comparablesales approximately 0.2% 
and 0.6% for Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club, respectively, for fiscal 2016 . As we continue to add new stores and clubs in 
the U.S., we do so with an understanding that additional stores and clubs may take sales away from existing units.We estimate the neg
ative impact on comparable store and club sales as a result of opening new stores and clubs was approximately 0.7% and 0.8% in fiscal  2017  and  
2016 , respectively. Our estim ate is calculated primarily by comparing the sales trends of the impacted stores and clubs, which are identified based on theirproximity to the new stores and 
clubs, to those of nearby non-impacted stores and clubs, in each case, as measured after the new stores and clubs are opened.6

Table of ContentsReturns
While we are focused pri
marily on growth, we also place a priority on generating returns to ensure our approach is appropriately balanced. We generate returns byefficiently deploying 
assets and effectively managing working capital. We monitor these efforts through our return on investment and free cash flow metrics, whichwe discuss below. In addition, we are fo
cused on providing returns to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in theLiquidity and Capital Resources s
ection.We include Return on Assets ("ROA"), the most d
irectly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally acceptedaccounting principles in 
the U.S. ("GAAP"), and Return on Investment ("ROI") as metrics to assess returns on assets.Return on Assets and Return on Investment
Management believes ROI is a 
meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trendsin ROI can fluctuate over t
ime as management balances long-term potential strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. We consider ROA to be thefinancial measure 
computed in accordance with GAAP that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of ROI.ROA was 
7.2% and 7.5% for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. ROI was 15.2% and 15.5% for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017 
and 2016 , respectively. The decl ines in ROA and ROI were primarily due to our decrease in operating income over these periods.We define ROI as adj
usted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the fiscal year or trailing12 months divided by average inves
ted capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets,plus average accumulated de
preciation and average accumulated amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period, plus arent factor equal to 
the rent for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of eight. When we have discontinued operations, we exclude the impactof the discontinued operat
ions.Our calculation of ROI is conside
red a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that areincluded and excluded in the 
most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. For example, we exclude the impactof depreciation and amo
rtization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. In addition, we include a factor ofeight for rent expense th
at estimates the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measurecomputed in accordance wi
th GAAP that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which isconsolidated net income 
for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items andadds interest income; adju
sts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities; and incorporates afactor of rent to ar
rive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying ourkey assets and is more mean
ingful to investors than ROA.Although ROI is a standard financia
l metric, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculateour ROI may differ from the 
methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.7

Table of ContentsFree Cash Flow
Free cash flow is considered a non
-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, howeve r, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additionalcash from our business operat
ions, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should beconsidered in addition to, r
ather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as ameasure of our liquidity. Se
e Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including n et cash provided by operating activities, net cash used ininvesting activities 
and net cash used in financing activities.We define free cash 
flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We had net cashprovided by operating activ
ities of $31.5 billion , $27.4 billion and $28.6 billion for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respec tively. We generated free cash flow of $20.9 billion 
, $15.9 billion and $16.4 billion for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The incr ease in net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow infiscal 
2017 from fiscal 2016 was primarily due to improv ed working capital management. Additionally, we benefited from the application of new tax regulationsrelated to the accelerated deductio
n of remodels and related expenses. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow in fiscal 2016 from fiscal 
2015 was primarily due to lower in come from continuing operations, partially offset by lower capital spending and improved working capitalmanagement.
Walmart's definit
ion of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that themeasure does not deduct the p
ayments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, webelieve it is import
ant to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.Although other companies repor
t their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used byWalmart's management to calculate o
ur free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow.The following table sets for
th a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe tobe the GAAP financial measure mos
t directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash usedin financing activities.

0.7% for fiscal 2016 when compared to the previous f iscal year. For fiscal 2017 , net sales were positively impacted by overall positive comparablesales and e-commerc
e sales and the 1.3% year-over-year growth in consolidated retail square feet. The positive effect of such factors on our consolidated net salesfor fiscal 
2017 was partially offset by a n egative impact of $11.0 billion or 2.3% as a result of fluctua tions in currency exchange rates and a $0.4 billion decrease in fuel sales from lower fu
el prices at the Sam's Club segment. For fiscal 2016 , net sales were negative ly impacted by $17.1 billion or 3.5% as a result of fluctuationsin currency exchange ra
tes and a $1.9 billion decrease in fuel sales from lower fuel prices at the Sam's Club segment. The negative effect of such factors on ourconsolidated net sales was pa
rtially offset by the 1.3% year-over-year growth in retail square feet, positive comparable sales in the Walmart U.S. segment andhigher e-commerce s
ales across the Company.Gross profit rate incre
ased 36 and 29 basis points for fiscal 2017 and 2016 , respectively, when compar ed to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2017 , the increase in gross profit rate was pri
marily due to improved margin in food and consumables, including the impact of savings in procuring merchandise and lowertransportation expense f
rom lower fuel costs in the Walmart U.S. segment. Additionally, improvement in certain markets' inventory management and cost analyticsprograms in the Walmart Internati
onal segment also positively impacted our gross profit rate for fiscal 2017 . For fiscal 2016 , the increase in gross prof it rate wasprimarily due to improv
ed margins in food, general merchandise, and consumables in the Walmart U.S. segment. Changes in the merchandise mix in the WalmartInternational segmen
t and a reduction in low margin fuel sales in the Sam's Club segment also positively impacted our fiscal 2016 gross profit rate, while pha rmacyreimbursement pressure at the
 Walmart U.S. segment negatively impacted our fiscal 2016 gross profit rate. Operating expenses as a perc
entage of net sales increased 88 and 91 basis points for fiscal 2017 and 2016 , respectively, when compar ed to the previous fiscal year.For fiscal 
2017 , the increase in opera ting expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in wage expense at the Walmart U.S. and Sam'sClub segments resulting from 
the continued investment in associate wage structure; a $370 million charge related to discontinued domestic real estate projects andseverance; and our continu
ed investments in digital retail and information technology. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for fiscal2017 
was partially offset by th e impact of store closures in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 . For fiscal 2016 , the increase in opera ting expenses as a percentage ofnet sales was due to an incre
ase in wage expense at the Walmart U.S. segment due to the new associate wage structure and increased associate hours to improve theoverall customer expe
rience, the approximately $0.9 billion charge for the store closures announced in January 2016 and our investments in digital retail andinformation technology.
Membership and other incom
e increased  $1.0 billion  for fiscal 2017 and was relatively fla t for fiscal 2016 , respectively, when compar ed to the same periods inthe previous fiscal yea
r. For fiscal 2017 , the increase in memb ership and other income was primarily due the recognition of a $535 million gain in the secondquarter of fiscal 2017 f
rom the sale of certain assets relating to Yihaodian, our e-commerce operations in China, including the Yihaodian brand, website andapplication, to JD, and a $194 mil
lion gain from the sale of shopping malls in Chile.Our effective income 
tax rate was 30.3% for both fiscal 2017 and 2016 , and 32.2% for fiscal 2015 , respectively. Our effe ctive tax rate fluctuates from period toperiod and may be impact
ed by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in laws,outcomes of administra
tive audits, the impacts of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. The reconciliation from theU.S. statutory rate to the ef
fective income tax rates for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 is presented in Note 9 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financi al Statements."10

increases in net sales were primarily due to increases in comparable store sales of 1.6% and 1.0% for fiscal 2017 and 2016 , respectively, driven primarily by po
sitive customer traffic, as well as year-over-year growth in retail square feet of 1.4% for both fiscal 2017 and 2016 . Additionally, e- commerce sales contributed

ased 24 and 12 basis points for fiscal 2017 and 2016 , respectively, when compar ed to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2017 , the increase in gross profit rate was pri
marily due to improved margin in food and consumables, including the impact of savings in procuring merchandise and lowertransportation expense f
rom lower fuel costs. For fiscal 2016 , the increase in gross prof it rate was primarily due to improved margin in food, general merchandiseand consumables, partial

entage of segment net sales increased 101 and 113 basis points for fiscal 2017 and 2016 , respectively, when compar ed to the previousfiscal year. For fiscal 
2017 , the increase was prima rily driven by an increase in wage expense due to the continued investment in the associate wage structure; a$249 million charge related
 to discontinued real estate projects; and our continued investments in digital retail and information technology. The increase inoperating expenses as a per
centage of segment net sales for fiscal 2017 was partially offset by th e impact of store closures in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 . For fiscal 
2016 , the increase was prima rily driven by an increase in wage expense due to the new associate wage structure and increased associate hours.Enhancements to the cu
stomer-facing areas of the store to improve the overall customer experience drove the increase in associate hours as well as increasedmaintenance expenses. In 
addition, the $670 million charge to operating expenses for the closures of 150 stores announced in January 2016, an increase in storeassociate incentive 
expense and our investments in digital retail and information technology contributed to the fiscal 2016 increase in operating expenses as apercentage of segment n

fiscal 2017 were impacted by positive comparable store sales in all of our markets, except in the United Kingdom, and year-over-yeargrowth in retail square f

ease in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2017 was primarily due to decl ining sales on relatively flat fixed costsin the United Kingdom as well as adjus
tments to useful lives of certain assets and impairment charges in certain markets. The increase in operating expenses as apercentage of segment n
et sales for fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by the approximately $150 million charge for the announced closure of 115 underperformingstores in Brazil and other L
atin American markets in January 2016, increased employment claim contingencies and higher utility rates in Brazil and investments indigital retail and 
information technology.Membership and other incom

fiscal 2017 increase in net sales was p rimarily due to an increase in comparable club sales without fuel driven by higher e-commercesales, and a year-over-year
 increase in retail square feet of 0.9% , partially offset by a d ecrease of $0.4 billion in fuel sales primarily from l ower fuel prices. Thefiscal

Gross profit rate incre
ased 39 and 30 basis points for fiscal 2017 and 2016 , respectively, when compar ed to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2017 , the increase was primarily due to marg

2017 , the increase in opera ting expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily due to an increase in wage, benefit and incentive expenses fromthe continued investment 
in the associate wage structure; our continued investments in digital retail and information technology; and an increase in advertisingexpense. For fiscal

Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
The strength and stability o
f our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities,supplemented with our long-te
rm debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that supportthe long-term growth of our ope
rations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund the dividends on our common stock andshare repurchases. We be
lieve our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations, finance our global expansion activities, pay dividends andfund our share repurchases fo
r the foreseeable future.Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
 
 Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)
 2017  2016  2015 Net cash provided by operating activities
 $31,530  $27,389  $28,564 Net cash provided by operating a
ctivities was $31.5 billion , $27.4 billion and $28.6 billion for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The incr ease in net cashprovided by operating activ
ities for fiscal 2017 , when compared to the previous f iscal year, was primarily due to improved working capital management.Additionally, we benefited f
rom the application of new tax regulations related to the accelerated deduction of remodels and related expenses. The decrease in netcash provided by operating ac
tivities for fiscal 2016 , when compared to the previous f iscal year, was primarily due to lower income from continuing operations,partially offset by i
mproved working capital management.Cash Equivalents and Working Capital
Cash and cash equivalents were 
$6.9 billion and $8.7 billion at January 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Our working capi tal deficit was $9.2 billion and $4.4billion 
at January 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The incr ease in our working capital deficit reflects the Company's leverage achieved through savings fromprocuring merchandise and 
improved inventory management. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in fundingoperations, consistent ac
cess to the capital markets and in providing returns to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases.We use intercompany fin
ancing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum costpossible. We do not believe i
t will be necessary to repatriate earnings held outside of the U.S. and anticipate our domestic liquidity needs will be met through cashflows provided by domestic opera
ting activities, supplemented with long-term debt and short-term borrowings. Accordingly, we intend, with only certainexceptions, to continue to ind
efinitely reinvest our earnings held outside of the U.S. in our foreign operations. When the income earned, either from operations orthrough intercompany finan
cing arrangements, and indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. is taxed at local country tax rates, which are generally lower than theU.S. statutory rate, we reali
ze an effective tax rate benefit. If our intentions with respect to reinvestment were to change, most of the amounts held within ourforeign operations could be 
repatriated to the U.S., although any repatriation under current U.S. tax laws would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, lessapplicable foreign t
ax credits. Although there can be no assurance of the impact on the Company of potential federal tax reform in the U.S., we do not expectcurrent local laws, othe
r existing limitations or potential taxes on anticipated future repatriations of cash amounts held outside of the U.S. to have a material effecton our overall liquidity, f
inancial condition or results of operations.As of 
January 31, 2017 and 2016 , cash and cash equivalents of $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion , respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to locallaws or other restrict

For the fiscal year ended J

, authorization for $9.2 billion of share repurchases re mained under the current share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retiredand returned to an unissued sta
tus. The Company intends to utilize the current share repurchase authorization through the fiscal year ending January 31, 2018.We regularly review sha
re repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things,current cash needs, capa
city for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a significantmajority of the ongoing shar
e repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flows. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis,the number of shares repur

ing InterestsIn fiscal 2016, as described 
in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Sta tements, we completed the purchase of all of the remaining noncontrolling interest inYihaodian, our e-commerc
e operations in China, for approximately $760 million, using existing cash to complete this transaction. Additionally, during fiscal 2015,we completed the purchase o
f substantially all of the remaining noncontrolling interest in Walmart Chile for approximately $1.5 billion, using existing cash tocomplete this transaction.
Capital Resources
We believe cash flows fro
m continuing operations, our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipatedoperating cash needs, which inc
lude funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, dividend payments and sharerepurchases.
We have strong commerc
ial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due atfavorable rates in c
apital markets. At January 31, 2017 , the ratings assigned to our co mmercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were asfollows:
Rating agency
  Commercial paper   Long-term debt Standard & Poor's
  A-1+   AA Moody's Investors Service
  P-1   Aa2 Fitch Ratings
  F1+   AA Credit rating agencies 
review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time.Accordingly, we are not able to p
redict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings includechanges in our operating per
formance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt andcapitalization, and 
changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs orimpair our ability to access
 capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratingscould impair our ability t
o access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to relymore heavily on more expens
ive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper ordebt securities. Each r
ating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of anyother rating. Moreover, e
ach credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.18

ayments are based on our principal amounts and expected maturities of all debt outstanding at January 31, 2017 , and assumes interest ra tesremain at current levels for o
ur variable rate debt.Purchase obligations include 
legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capitalexpenditures, software acqu
isition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. Purchase orders for inventory and other services are not includedin the table above. Purchase o
rders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. For the purposes of this table, contractual obligations forthe purchase of goods or servic
es are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed orminimum quantities to b
e purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Our purchase orders are based onour current inventory needs 
and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods. We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, theobligations under these cont
racts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty.The expected timing for p
ayment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid withrespect to some unrecord
ed contractual commitments may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amountsfor some obligations.
In addition to the amounts shown in th
e table above, $1.1 billion of unrecognized tax benef its are considered uncertain tax positions and have been recorded asliabilities. The timing of t
he payment, if any, associated with these liabilities is uncertain. Refer to Note 9 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financi al Statements" foradditional discussion of unre
cognized tax benefits.Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of January 31, 2017, we had no off-balance sh
eet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidatedfinancial condition, r
esults of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.19

Table of ContentsMarket Risk
In addition to the risks inhe
rent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates and fluctuations in currency exchangerates.
The analysis presented below fo
r each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does notrepresent our view of futur
e market changes. The effect of a change in a particular assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption. In reality,however, a change in one facto
r could cause a change in another, which may magnify or negate other sensitivities.Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to changes in 
interest rates as a result of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt issuances. We hedge a portion of our interest rate risk bymanaging the mix of fixed 
and variable rate debt and by entering into interest rate swaps. For fiscal 2017 , the net fair value of ou r interest rate swaps decreasedapproximately  
$177 million primarily due to fluctuation s in market interest rates.The table below provides infor
mation about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations, the table represents theprincipal cash flows and re
lated weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps, the table represents the contractual cash flowsand weighted-average int
erest rates by the contractual maturity date, unless otherwise noted. The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual cash flows tobe exchanged under the contr
acts. The weighted-average variable rates are based upon prevailing market rates at January 31, 2017 .

The long-term debt amounts in the table exclude the Company's derivatives c lassified as fair value hedges.As of 
January 31, 2017 , our variable rate bor rowings, including the effect of our commercial paper and interest rate swaps, represented 17% of our total short-term and long-term debt. Based on 
January 31, 2017 debt levels, a 100 basis point change in prevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to change byapproximately 
$63 million . 20

Table of ContentsForeign Currency Risk
We are exposed to fluctu
ations in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our net investments and operations in countries other than the U.S. For fiscal 2017 , movements in currency ex
change rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets of the Company's subsidiaries in the United Kingdom andMexico were the primary 
cause of the  $2.7 billion loss in the currency trans lation and other category of accumulated other comprehensive loss. We hedge aportion of our foreign curr
ency risk by entering into currency swaps and designating certain foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as net investmenthedges.
We hold currency swaps to hedge th
e currency exchange component of our net investments and also to hedge the currency exchange rate fluctuation exposureassociated with the fore
casted payments of principal and interest of non-U.S. denominated debt. The aggregate fair value of these swaps was in a liability positionof 
$147 million and $290 million at January 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The chang e in the fair value of these swaps was due to fluctuations in currencyexchange rates, primarily the
 strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in fiscal 2017 . A hypothetical 10% increas e or decrease in the currencyexchange rates underlying 
these swaps from the market rate at January 31, 2017 would have resulted in a loss or ga in in the value of the swaps of $521 million . A hypothetical 10% change
 in interest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect at January 31, 2017 would have resulted in a loss or ga in in valueof the swaps of 
$11 million . In addition to currency swaps, we hav
e designated foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as nonderivative hedges of net investments of certain of ourforeign operations. At 
January 31, 2017 and 2016 , we had £2.5 billion of outstanding long-term deb t designated as a hedge of our net investment in the UnitedKingdom. At 
January 31, 2017 , a hypothetical 10% incr ease or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound would have resulted in a gainor loss in the value of the deb
t of $284 million . In addition, we had outstanding long- term debt of ¥10 billion at January 31, 2017 and 2016 , that was designated as a hedge of our net investmen
t in Japan. At January 31, 2017 , a hypothetical 10% incr ease or decrease in value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Japanese yen wouldhave resulted in a gain or 
loss in the value of the debt of $8 million . In certain countries, we
 also enter into immaterial foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase and payment of purchase commitments denominated innon-functional currencies.

Table of ContentsSummary of Critical Accounting Estimates
Management strives to r
eport our financial results in a clear and understandable manner, although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex andrequire us to use technic
al terminology. In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in theU.S. These principles require us to 
make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in ourfinancial statem
ents. These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes. Actual results may differ from our estimates.Management continually 
reviews our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements. Following is asummary of our critic
al accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements.Inventories
We value inventories a
t the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method forsubstantially all of th
e Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory at the Walmart International segment is valued primarily by the retail inventory methodof accounting, using the firs
t-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. The retail method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market sincepermanent markdowns are i
mmediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the LIFOmethod.
Under the retail method o
f accounting, inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to each merchandisegrouping's retail value. The FIFO cost
-to-retail ratio is generally based on the fiscal year purchase activity. The cost-to-retail ratio for measuring any LIFOprovision is based on the initi
al margin of the fiscal year purchase activity less the impact of any permanent markdowns. The retail method of accounting requiresmanagement to make c
ertain judgments and estimates that may significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost, as well as the amount of gross profitrecognized. Judgments made 
include recording markdowns used to sell inventory and shrinkage. When management determines the ability to sell inventory hasdiminished, markdowns for cle
arance activity and the related cost impact are recorded. Factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current andanticipated demand, cus
tomer preferences and age of merchandise, as well as seasonal and fashion trends. Changes in weather and customer preferences couldcause material ch
anges in the amount and timing of markdowns from year to year.When necessary, we record a L
IFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end.Our LIFO provision is calculated bas
ed on inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price indices. At January 31, 2017 and 2016 , our inventories valued at LIFO approx
imated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO.We provide for estima
ted inventory losses, or shrinkage, between physical inventory counts on the basis of a historical percentage of sales. Following annualinventory counts, the provision is 
adjusted to reflect updated historical results.Impairment of Assets
We evaluate long-liv
ed assets other than goodwill and assets with indefinite lives for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstancesindicate their carrying amount
s may not be recoverable. Management's judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditionsand operational perfor
mance, such as operating income and cash flows. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cashflows, which is generally at th
e individual store level or, in certain markets, at the market group level. The variability of these factors depends on a number ofconditions, including uncert
ainty about future events and changes in demographics. Thus, our accounting estimates may change from period to period. Thesefactors could cause manageme
nt to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and require impairment tests be performed, which could result in managementdetermining the value o
f long-lived assets is impaired, resulting in a write-down of the related long-lived assets.Goodwill and other indefinite
-lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes incircumstances indicate that the 
value of a certain asset may be impaired. Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether aquantitative impairment test is 
necessary. If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit ismore likely than not less 
than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then aquantitative impairment test w
ould be performed. The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows,growth rates and economic and 
market conditions. These evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation methodsuch as discounted cash flow or a r
elative, market-based approach. Historically, our reporting units have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwilland other indefinite-
lived acquired intangible assets. Because of the nature of the factors used in these tests, if different conditions occur in future periods, futureoperating results could
 be materially impacted.22

Table of ContentsIncome Taxes
Income taxes have a signi
ficant effect on our net earnings. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, thedetermination of our prov
ision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Oureffective income tax rate is affected 
by many factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, increases and decreases in valuationallowances, changes in tax l
aw, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and internationaloperations where the statu
tory rates are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate, and may fluctuate as a result.Our tax returns are routin
ely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions arerecorded in our financi
al statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, fromtaxing authorities. When 
facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. Weaccount for uncertain 
tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in thefinancial statem
ents. This determination requires the use of significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductibleand taxable items.
Deferred tax assets rep
resent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporarydifferences between th
e financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred taxassets are evaluated 
for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. Many factorsare considered when assessing wheth
er it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations offuture taxable income, carryfor
ward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated byassessing the adequac
y of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings andavailable tax planning strate
gies. This evaluation relies heavily on estimates.23

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
General
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("
Walmart" or the "Company") helps people around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – in retail stores orthrough the Company's e-commer
ce and mobile capabilities. Through innovation, the Company is striving to create a customer-centric experience that seamlesslyintegrates digital 
and physical shopping and saves time for our customers. Each week, the Company serves over 260 million customers who visit its 11,695 stores under 
59 banners in 28 countries and e-commerce websites in 11 countries. The Company's strategy is to lead on price, invest to differentiate on access, becompetitive on assortment a
nd deliver a great experience.The Company's operations comprise 
three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.Principles of Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Stat
ements include the accounts of Walmart and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017 ("fiscal 2017 "), January 31, 2016 
("fiscal 2016 ") and January 31, 2015 ("fiscal 2015 "). All material intercompany  accounts and transactions have been eliminated inconsolidation. We con
solidate variable interest entities where it has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of those entities' operations.Investments in unconsolidat
ed affiliates, which are 50% or less owned and do not otherwise meet consolidation requirements, are accounted for primarily using theequity method. These investm
ents are immaterial to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.The Company's Consolidated Financial Sta
tements are based on a fiscal year ending on January 31 for the United States ("U.S.") and Canadian operations. TheCompany consolidates all othe
r operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events duringJanuary 
2017 that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements.Use of Estimates
The Consolidated Financial Stat
ements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Those principles require managementto make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure ofcontingent assets and liab
ilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual resultsmay differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers investments wi
th a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents. All credit card, debit card and electronicbenefits transfer t
ransactions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash and cash equivalents. The amounts due from banks for these transactionsclassified as cash and c
ash equivalents totaled $1.5 billion and $3.4 billion at January 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. In addit ion, cash and cash equivalentsincluded restricted cash of 
$265 million and $362 million at January 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, which was prim arily related to cash collateral holdings fromvarious counterparties, a
s required by certain derivative and trust agreements.The Company's cash balances are h
eld in various locations around the world. Of the Company's $6.9 billion and $8.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents atJanuary 31, 2017 
and 2016 , respectively, $5.9 billion and $4.5 billion , respectively, were held ou tside of the U.S. and were generally utilized to support liquidityneeds in the Company's non-U.S. operations.
The Company uses intercompany fin
ancing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimumcost possible. Management does no
t believe it will be necessary to repatriate earnings held outside of the U.S. and anticipates the Company's domestic liquidityneeds will be met through cash 
flows provided by domestic operating activities, supplemented with long-term debt and short-term borrowings. Accordingly, theCompany intends, with only certain 
exceptions, to continue to indefinitely reinvest the Company's earnings held outside of the U.S. in our foreign operations.When the income earned, 
either from operations or through intercompany financing arrangements, and indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. is taxed at localcountry tax rates, which ar
e generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate, the Company realizes an effective tax rate benefit. If the Company's intentions with respectto reinvestment were to 
change, most of the amounts held within the Company's foreign operations could be repatriated to the U.S., although any repatriation undercurrent U.S. tax laws would be subject to U.S. fed
eral income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. Although there can be no assurance of the impact on theCompany of potential feder
al tax reform in the U.S., the Company does not expect current local laws, other existing limitations or potential taxes on anticipatedfuture repatriat
ions of earnings held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on the Company's overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.32

Table of ContentsAs of 
January 31, 2017 and 2016 , cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion , respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S.due to local laws or other r
estrictions.Receivables
Receivables are stat
ed at their carrying values, net of a reserve for doubtful accounts. Receivables consist primarily of amounts due from:•
insurance companies resulting from pharmacy sales;•
banks for customer credit and debit cards and electronic bank transfers that take in excess of seven days to process;•
consumer financing programs in certain international operations;•
suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; and•
real estate transactions.The Walmart International segment
 offers a limited number of consumer credit products, primarily through its financial institutions in select countries. Thereceivable balance from consumer
 credit products was $1.2 billion , net of a reserve for doubt ful accounts of $79 million at January 31, 2017 , compared to a receivable balance of 
$1.0 billion , net of a reserve for doubt ful accounts of $ 70 million at January 31, 2016 . These balances are inc luded in receivables, net, in theCompany's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Inventories
The Company values inventories a
t the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out("LIFO") method for substantial
ly all of the Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory at the Walmart International segment is valued primarily by theretail inventory me
thod of accounting, using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. The retail inventory method of accounting results in inventory being valued atthe lower of cost or marke
t since permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory. The inventory at the Sam's Clubsegment is valued using the LIFO me
thod. At January 31, 2017 and January 31, 2016 , the Company's inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventoriesas if they were valued at FIFO.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are s
tated at cost. Gains or losses on disposition are recognized as earned or incurred. Costs of major improvements are capitalized, whilecosts of normal repairs 
and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. The following table summarizes the Company's property and equipment balances andincludes the estimated usef
ul lives that are generally used to depreciate the assets on a straight-line basis: 
   Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)
 Estimated Useful Lives  2017  2016 Land
 N/A  $24,801  $25,624 Buildings and improvements
 3-40 years  98,547  96,845 Fixtures and equipment
 1-30 years  48,998  47,033 Transportation equipment

 N/A  4,301  4,539 Property and equipment
   $179,492  $176,958 Accumulated depreciation
   (71,782 )  (66,787 ) Property and equipment, net
   $107,710  $110,171 Leasehold improvements are
 depreciated or amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining expected lease term. Totaldepreciation and amor
tization expense for property and equipment, property under financing obligations and property under capital leases for fiscal 2017 , 2016and 
2015 was $10.0 billion , $9.4 billion and $9.1 billion , respectively. Inter est costs capitalized on construction projects were $36 million , $39 million and $59million 
in fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Leases
The Company estimates the exp
ected term of a lease by assuming the exercise of renewal options where an economic penalty exists that would preclude theabandonment of the lease 
at the end of the initial non-cancelable term and the exercise of such renewal is at the sole discretion of the Company. The expected termis used in the determina
tion of whether a store or club lease is a capital or operating lease and in the calculation of straight-line rent expense. Additionally, theuseful life of leasehold im
provements is limited by the expected lease term or the economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter. If significant expenditures aremade for leasehold improveme
nts late in the expected term of a lease and renewal is reasonably assured, the useful life of the leasehold improvement is limited tothe end of the renewal per
iod or economic life of the asset, whichever is33

Table of Contentsshorter. Rent abatements
 and escalations are considered in the calculation of minimum lease payments in the Company's capital lease tests and in determiningstraight-line rent expense f
or operating leases.The Company is often involved in the 
construction of its leased stores. In certain cases, payments made for certain structural components included in the lessor'sconstruction of the leas
ed assets result in the Company being deemed the owner of the leased assets for accounting purposes. As a result, the payments, regardlessof the significance, a
re automatic indicators of ownership and require the Company to capitalize the lessor's total project cost with a corresponding financingobligation. Upon completion of th
e lessor's project, the Company performs a sale-leaseback analysis to determine if these assets and the related financingobligation can be derecogn
ized from the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the Company is deemed to have "continuing involvement," the leased assetsand the related finan
cing obligation remain on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and are generally amortized over the lease term. At the end of the leaseterm, including exerc
ise of any renewal options, the net remaining financing obligation over the net carrying value of the fixed asset will be recognized as a non-cash gain on sale of the prope
rty.Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets are sta
ted at cost. Management reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate thatthe carrying amount may no
t be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual store or club levelor, in certain circu
mstances, a market group of stores. Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets' usefullives based on updated projec
tions. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measuredbased upon the fair value of 
the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. Impairment charges oflong-lived assets for fis
cal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 were not material. Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess o
f the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reportingunit when acquired. Other acqui
red intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intendeduse of the related asse
t. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; rather, they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever eventsor changes in circumstance
s indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired. Definite-lived intangible assets are considered long-lived assets and are amortizedon a straight-line basis ov
er the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided.Goodwill is evaluated for imp
airment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the Company's reporting units. Generally, a qualitativeassessment is first performe
d to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. If management determines, after performing an assessmentbased on the qualitative 
factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reportingunit substantially in exc
ess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. The quantitative test forgoodwill impairment is pe
rformed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units. Fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow methodand relative marke
t-based approaches.The Company's reporting units were ev
aluated using a quantitative impairment test. Management determined the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than thecarrying amount and, acco
rdingly, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill.The following table refl
ects goodwill activity, by reportable segment, for fiscal 2017 and 2016 : (Amounts in millions)

Goodwill recorded for fiscal 2016 acquisitions relates to acquisitions that are not significan t, individually or in the aggregate, to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.(2)
Goodwill recorded for fiscal 2017 Walmart U.S. acquisitions primarily relates to Jet.com, Inc. ("jet.com"). Indefinite-lived in
tangible assets are included in other assets and deferred charges in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. These assets are evaluated forimpairment based on the
ir fair values using valuation techniques which are updated34

Table of Contentsannually based on t
he most recent variables and assumptions. There were no significant impairment charges related to indefinite-lived intangible assets recordedfor fiscal 
2017 , 2016 and 2015 . Self Insurance Reserves
The Company self-insures a numbe
r of risks, including, but not limited to, workers' compensation, general liability, auto liability, product liability and certainemployee-related healthcare benefits.
 Standard actuarial procedures and data analysis are used to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks as of the balancesheet date on an un
discounted basis. The recorded liabilities reflect the ultimate cost for claims incurred but not paid and any estimable administrative run-outexpenses related to the p
rocessing of these outstanding claim payments. On a regular basis, claims reserve valuations are provided by independent third-partyactuaries to ensure l
iability estimates are appropriate. To limit exposure to some risks, the Company maintains insurance coverage with varying limits andretentions, including stop-
loss insurance coverage for workers' compensation, general liability and auto liability.Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted f
or under the balance sheet method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequencesattributable to differences bet
ween the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases ("temporarydifferences"). Deferred tax a
ssets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to berecovered or settled. The
 effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.Deferred tax assets ar
e evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized.Many factors are conside
red when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings,expectations of future taxa
ble income, carryforward periods, and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets isevaluated by assessin
g the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operatingearnings and available 
tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates.In determining the provis
ion for income taxes, an annual effective income tax rate is used based on annual income, permanent differences between book and taxincome, and statutory inco
me tax rates. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.The Company records a liabil
ity for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Companyrecords interest and pen
alties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, inthe Company's Consolidated Statemen
ts of Income. Refer to Note 9 for additional income tax disclosures.Revenue Recognition 
    Sales
The Company recognizes sales r
evenue, net of sales taxes and estimated sales returns, at the time it sells merchandise to the customer. Digital retail sales includeshipping revenue and are re
corded upon delivery to the customer.Membership Fee Revenue
The Company recognizes membe
rship fee revenue both in the U.S. and internationally over the term of the membership, which is typically 12 months. Thefollowing table summarizes
 membership fee activity for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 :  
 Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)
 2017  2016  2015 Deferred membership fee revenue, beginning of year
 $744  $759  $641 Cash received from members

 (1,372 )  (1,348 )  (1,292 ) Deferred membership fee revenue, end of year
 $743  $744  $759 Membership fee revenue 
is included in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The deferred membership fee isincluded in accrued li
abilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.Shopping Cards
Customer purchases of shopping cards, 
to be utilized in our stores or on our e-commerce websites, are not recognized as revenue until the card is redeemed and thecustomer purchases mer
chandise using the shopping card. Shopping cards in the U.S. do not carry an expiration date; therefore, customers and members canredeem their shopping ca
rds for merchandise indefinitely. Shopping cards in certain foreign countries where the Company does business may have expiration dates.A
35

Table of Contentscertain number of shopping c
ards, both with and without expiration dates, will not be fully redeemed. Management estimates unredeemed shopping cards andrecognizes revenue for 
these amounts when it is determined the likelihood of redemption is remote. Management periodically reviews and updates its estimates.Financial and Other Services
The Company recognizes revenue 
from service transactions at the time the service is performed. Generally, revenue from services is classified as a component ofnet sales in the Company's Consolidat
ed Statements of Income.Cost of Sales
Cost of sales includes actua
l product cost, the cost of transportation to the Company's distribution facilities, stores and clubs from suppliers, the cost oftransportation from th
e Company's distribution facilities to the stores, clubs and customers and the cost of warehousing for the Sam's Club segment and importdistribution centers. Cost of s
ales is reduced by supplier payments that are not a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs.Payments from Suppliers
The Company receives consider
ation from suppliers for various programs, primarily volume incentives, warehouse allowances and reimbursements for specificprograms such as markdowns, margin p
rotection, advertising and supplier-specific fixtures. Payments from suppliers are accounted for as a reduction of cost ofsales and are recogniz
ed in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income when the related inventory is sold, except in certain limited situations when thepayment is a reimbursement 
of specific, incremental and identifiable costs.Operating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Operating, selling, genera
l and administrative expenses include all operating costs of the Company, except cost of sales, as described above. As a result, themajority of the cost of wa
rehousing and occupancy for the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities is included in operating,selling, general and adm
inistrative expenses. Because the Company does not include most of the cost of its Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments'distribution facili
ties in cost of sales, its gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales may not be comparable to those of other retailers that may includeall costs related to their di
stribution facilities in cost of sales and in the calculation of gross profit.Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed

ries are translated from the respective local currencies to the U.S. dollar using average exchange rates for the period covered by the incomestatements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Revenue Recognition
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting St
andards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). 
This ASU is a comprehensive new revenue r ecognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goodsor services to a custome
r at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Management continues toevaluate the impac
t this ASU, the related amendments and the interpretive guidance will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Whilemanagement does not expec
t this ASU to materially impact the Company's consolidated net income, balance sheet or cash flows, the ASU will impact the timing ofrecognition of some revenu
e and may impact the gross amount of revenue presented for certain contracts. Management expects the most significant timing changeto result from the rev
enue associated36

f Company issued gift cards, which will be recognized over the expected redemption period of the gift card under the new standardrather than waiting unti
l the likelihood of redemption becomes remote or waiting for the gift card to expire. Additionally, management continues to assess theguidance and the related i
nterpretation to determine if that guidance will impact the gross amount of revenue presented for certain contracts. The Company isplanning to adopt this ASU on February 1, 2018 under the 
modified retrospective approach, which will result in a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings.Leases
In February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02, 
Leases (Topic 842) . FASB issued ASU 2016-02 to increase transparency and co mparability among organizationsby recognizing lease asse
ts and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Certain qualitative and quantitativedisclosures are requir
ed, as well as a retrospective recognition and measurement of impacted leases. The Company is planning to adopt the ASU on February 1,2019. Management is evaluat
ing this ASU and currently expects it to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Management is stillevaluating the effe
ct on consolidated net income, cash flows and disclosures.Financial Instruments
In January 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-01, 
Financial Instruments–Overall ( Topic 825 ). ASU 2016-01 updates certain aspects o f recognition, measurement,presentation and disclosur
e of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Management is currentlyevaluating this ASU to determin
e its impact on the Company's consolidated net income, balance sheet and disclosures.In June 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-13, 
Financial Instruments–Credit Losses (Topic 326) . ASU 2016-13 modifies the measuremen t of expected credit losses ofcertain financia
l instruments. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2019. Management iscurrently evaluating 
this ASU to determine its impact on the Company's consolidated net income, balance sheet, cash flows and disclosures.Stock Compensation
In March 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-09, 
Compensation–Stock Compensation (Topic 718) . ASU 2016-09 includes new guidance on stock compensa tion, whichis intended to simplify a
ccounting for share-based payment transactions. The guidance will change several aspects of the accounting for share-based paymentaward transactions, includ
ing accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. Management has determined that theCompany will adopt ASU 2016-09 in the first quar
ter of the year ended January 31, 2018 ("fiscal 2018"). Management has evaluated this ASU and determined that,upon adoption, it will have an im
material retrospective impact on the classification of cash flows between operating and financing activities.37

inistrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The total income tax benefit recognized for share-basedcompensation was 
$212 million , $151 million and $173 million for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The following table summarizes the Company'sshare-based compensation 
expense by award type:

ck Incentive Plan of 2015 (the "Plan") became effective June 5, 2015 and amended and restated the Company's StockIncentive Plan of 2010. The Plan was est
ablished to grant stock options, restricted (non-vested) stock, performance share units and other equity compensationawards for which 
210 million shares of common stock issued or to be issued under the Plan have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. TheCompany believes that such awards s
erve to align the interests of its associates with those of its shareholders.The Plan's award types are summa
rized as follows:•
Restricted Stock and Performance Shar e Units. Restricted stock awards ar e for shares that vest based on the passage of time and include restrictionsrelated to employmen
t. Performance share units vest based on the passage of time and achievement of performance criteria and may range from 0% to 
150% of the original award amoun t. Vesting periods for these awards are generally between one and three years. Restricted stock and p erformanceshare units may be settl
ed or deferred in stock and are accounted for as equity in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value ofrestricted stock awards 
is determined on the date of grant and is expensed ratably over the vesting period. The fair value of performance share units isdetermined on the date o
f grant using the Company's stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and isrecognized over the vest
ing period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of performance share unitsin fiscal 
2017 , 2016 and 2015 was 8.3% , 7.4% and 7.1% , respectively. •
Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units provid e rights to Company stock after a specified service period; generally 50% vest three years from the grant date and the r
emaining 50% vest five years from the grant date. The fair value of each restricted stock unit is determined on the date of grantusing the stock price discount
ed for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized ratably over the vesting period. Theexpected dividend yield is b
ased on the anticipated dividends over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used todetermine the fair value of restricte
d stock units granted in fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 was 9.0% , 8.7% and 9.5% , respectively. In addition to the Plan, the Company's subs
idiary in the United Kingdom has stock option plans for certain colleagues which generally vest over three years. The stock option share-based comp
ensation expense is included in the Other line in the table above.The following table shows the act

repurchases. At January 31, 2017 , authorization for $9.2 billion of share repurchases remaine d under the current sharerepurchase program. Any repur
chased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.The Company considers several f
actors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage,cost of borrowings, its results of op
erations and the market price of its common stock. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number ofshares repurchased, avera

Table of ContentsNote 7. Fair Value Measurements
The Company records and discloses c
ertain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The fair value of an asset is the price at which the assetcould be sold in an ordinary tr
ansaction between unrelated, knowledgeable and willing parties able to engage in the transaction. The fair value of a liability is theamount that would be paid to tr
ansfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liabilitywith the creditor. Assets and l
iabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.The levels of the fair v
alue hierarchy are:•
Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;•
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and•
Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions.Recurring Fair Value Measurements
The Company holds derivative inst
ruments that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair values are the estimated amounts theCompany would receive or pay upon ter
mination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates. The fair values have been measured using theincome approach and Level 2 
inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves. As of January 31, 2017 and 2016 , the notional amounts and fair values of 
these derivatives were as follows:

lable-for-sale securities that are measured at fair value on recurring basis using Level 1 inputs. Changes in fair value arerecorded in accumula
ted other comprehensive loss.Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements
In addition to assets and li
abilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities, such as goodwill, other indefinite-livedacquired intangible ass
ets, and investments, are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurringbasis as a result of impa
irment charges. The Company did not record any significant impairment charges to assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basisduring the fiscal years 
ended January 31, 2017 or 2016 . Other Fair Value Disclosures
The Company records cash and cash equ
ivalents and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due totheir short-term maturities.
The Company's long-term debt is a
lso recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing ratefor similar types of bor
rowing arrangements. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of January 31, 2017 and 2016 , are as follows:

Table of ContentsNote 8. Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company uses derivative fin
ancial instruments for hedging and non-trading purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchangerates, as well as to main
tain an appropriate mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt. Use of derivative financial instruments in hedging programs subjects the Companyto certain risks, such as m
arket and credit risks. Market risk represents the possibility that the value of the derivative financial instrument will change. In a hedgingrelationship, the change 
in the value of the derivative financial instrument is offset to a great extent by the change in the value of the underlying hedged item.Credit risk related to 
a derivative financial instrument represents the possibility that the counterparty will not fulfill the terms of the contract. The notional, orcontractual, amount of 
the Company's derivative financial instruments is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the Company'sexposure due to credit risk. Cr
edit risk is monitored through established approval procedures, including setting concentration limits by counterparty, reviewingcredit ratings and requirin
g collateral (generally cash) from the counterparty when appropriate.The Company only enters into deriv
ative transactions with counterparties rated "A-" or better by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. Subsequent toentering into derivat
ive transactions, the Company regularly monitors the credit ratings of its counterparties. In connection with various derivative agreements,including master nett
ing arrangements, the Company held cash collateral from counterparties of $242 million and $345 million at January 31, 2017 and January 31,2016 
, respectively. The Company re cords cash collateral received as amounts due to the counterparties exclusive of any derivative asset. Furthermore, as part ofthe master netting a
rrangements with each of these counterparties, the Company is also required to post collateral with a counterparty if the Company's netderivative liabil
ity position exceeds $150 million with such counterparties. The Comp any did not have any cash collateral posted with counterparties at January 31, 2017 
, and had an insignificant a mount of cash collateral posted with counterparties at January 31, 2016 . The Company records cash colla teral it posts withcounterparties as amounts
 receivable from those counterparties exclusive of any derivative liability.The Company uses derivative fin
ancial instruments for the purpose of hedging its exposure to interest and currency exchange rate risks and, accordingly, thecontractual terms o
f a hedged instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item, providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation. Contracts that areeffective at meeting the risk red
uction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting. If a derivative financial instrument is recorded using hedgeaccounting, depending on the natu
re of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the instrument will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedgedassets, liabilities o
r firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.Any hedge ineffectiveness is 
immediately recognized in earnings. The Company's net investment and cash flow instruments are highly effective hedges and theineffective portion h
as not been, and is not expected to be, significant. Instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, or contracts for which theCompany has not elected hedge a
ccounting, are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings during the period of the change.Fair Value Instruments
The Company is a party to rece
ive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge the fair value of fixed-rate debt. The notionalamounts are used to measur
e interest to be paid or received and do not represent the Company's exposure due to credit loss. The Company's interest rate swaps thatreceive fixed-interest rate payments
 and pay variable-interest rate payments are designated as fair value hedges. As the specific terms and notional amounts of thederivative instrumen
ts match those of the fixed-rate debt being hedged, the derivative instruments are assumed to be perfectly effective hedges. Changes in the fairvalues of these derivat
ive instruments are recorded in earnings, but are offset by corresponding changes in the fair values of the hedged items, also recorded inearnings, and, accordingly, do not 
impact the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. These fair value instruments will mature on dates ranging fromOctober 2020 
to April 2024 . Net Investment Instruments
The Company is a party to cross-cu
rrency interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge its net investments. The agreements are contracts to exchange fixed-rate payments in one curre
ncy for fixed-rate payments in another currency. All changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in accumulated othercomprehensive loss, offset
ting the currency translation adjustment of the related investment that is also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Theseinstruments will matur
e on dates ranging from July 2020 to February 2030 . The Company has issued foreign-cur
rency-denominated long-term debt as hedges of net investments of certain of its foreign operations. These foreign-currency-denominated long-term d
ebt issuances are designated and qualify as nonderivative hedging instruments. Accordingly, the foreign currency translation of these debtinstruments is recorded i
n accumulated other comprehensive loss, offsetting the foreign currency translation adjustment of the related net investments that is alsorecorded in accumula
ted other comprehensive loss. At January 31, 2017 and January 31, 2016 , the Company had ¥10.0 billion of outstanding long-term debt designated as a hedge of its n
et investment in Japan, as well as outstanding long-term debt of £2.5 billion at January 31, 2017 and January 31, 2016 that was designated as a hedge of its n
et investment in the United Kingdom. These nonderivative net investment hedges will mature on dates ranging from July 2020 to January 2039

Table of ContentsCash Flow Instruments
The Company is a party to rece
ive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the currency exposure associated with the forecastedpayments of principal and 
interest of certain non-U.S. denominated debt. The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of the currency risk related to payments onthe non-U.S. denominated debt. The ef
fective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of foreign exchange risk isrecorded in accumulated other
 comprehensive loss and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affectsearnings. The hedge
d items are recognized foreign currency-denominated liabilities that are re-measured at spot exchange rates each period, and the assessment ofeffectiveness (and m
easurement of any ineffectiveness) is based on total changes in the related derivative's cash flows. As a result, the amount reclassified intoearnings each period inc
ludes an amount that offsets the related transaction gain or loss arising from that re-measurement and the adjustment to earnings for theperiod's allocable port
ion of the initial spot-forward difference associated with the hedging instrument. These cash flow instruments will mature on dates rangingfrom 
April 2022 to March 2034 . Financial Statement Presentat
ionAlthough subject to master ne
tting arrangements, the Company does not offset derivative assets and derivative liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets.Derivative instruments wi
th an unrealized gain are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as either current or non-current assets, based onmaturity date, and those h
edging instruments with an unrealized loss are recorded as either current or non-current liabilities, based on maturity date. Refer to Note 7 for the net presentat

econciliationThe Company's effective inco

ing structures and certain U.S. tax credits as further discussed in the "Cash and Cash Equivalents" section of the Company'ssignificant accounting po
licies in Note 1 . The Company's non-U.S. income is generally sub ject to local country tax rates that are below the 35% U.S. statutory taxrate. Certain non-U.S. earnings hav

U.S. income taxes have not been provid

$26.1 billion as of January 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, as the Company intends to permanently reinvest these amounts outside of the U.S. However, ifany portion were to be distribu
ted, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by foreign income taxes paid on those earnings. Determination of the unrecognizeddeferred tax liabi
lity related to these undistributed earnings is not practicable because of the complexities with its hypothetical calculation. The Company providesdeferred or current 
income taxes on earnings of international subsidiaries in the period that the Company determines it will remit those earnings.Net Operating Losses, Tax Credit Carryforwards and Valuation Allowances
At 
January 31, 2017 , the Company had net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards totaling approximately $6.1 billion . Of these carryforwards, approximately 
$3.6 billion will expire, if not util ized, in various years through 2037 . The remaining carryfo rwards have no expiration. At January 31, 2017 , the Company had foreign tax credi
t carryforwards of approximately $1.9 billion , which will expire in various ye ars through 2027 if not utilized. The recoverability of 
these future tax deductions and credits is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, includingtaxable income in prior carry
back years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. To theextent the Company does not conside
r it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established. To the extent that avaluation allowance has be
en established and it is subsequently determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be recovered, thevaluation allowance will b
e released.48

Table of ContentsThe Company had valuation allowanc
es of approximately $1.5 billion as of January 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, on defer red tax assets associated primarilywith net operating loss car
ryforwards for which management has determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Net activity inthe valuation allowance du
ring fiscal 2017 related to releas es arising from the use of deferred tax assets, changes in judgment regarding the future realization ofdeferred tax assets, increase
s from certain net operating losses and deductible temporary differences arising in fiscal 2017 , decreases due to operat ing lossexpirations and fluctuatio
ns in currency exchange rates. Management believes that it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets will be fullyrealized.
Uncertain Tax Positions
The benefits of uncerta
in tax positions are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probabilitythat the uncertain t
ax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities.As of 
January 31, 2017 and 2016 , the amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations was $1.1 billion and $607 million , respectively. The amount of unrecognized tax b
enefits that would affect the Company's effective income tax rate was $703 million and $522 million for January 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
A reconciliation of unre
cognized tax benefits from continuing operations is as follows: 
Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)
2017  2016  2015 Unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of year

$ 1,050  $607  $838 The Company classifies inte
rest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits as interest expense and as operating, selling, general and administrative expenses,respectively. During fisc
al 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , the Company recognized inte rest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $35 million , $5 million and $18million 
, respectively. As of January 31, 2017 and 2016 , accrued interest r elated to uncertain tax positions of $72 million and $60 million , respectively, was recorded in the Company's Consolidat
ed Balance Sheets. The Company did not have any accrued penalties recorded for income taxes as of January 31, 2017 or 2016 
. During the next twelve months, it 
is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce unrecognized tax benefits by between $50 million and $300 million, either because the t
ax positions are sustained on audit or because the Company agrees to their disallowance. The Company is focused on resolving tax audits asexpeditiously as possible. As a resu
lt of these efforts, unrecognized tax benefits could potentially be reduced beyond the provided range during the next twelvemonths. The Company does not expect any ch
ange to have a significant impact to its Consolidated Financial Statements.The Company remains subject to 
income tax examinations for its U.S. federal income taxes generally for fiscal 2013 through 2017 . The Company also remains subject to income tax exami
nations for international income taxes for fiscal 2000 through 2017 , and for U.S. state and local inco me taxes generally for the fiscalyears ended 
2011 through 2017 . Other Taxes
The Company is subject to tax exa
minations for value added, sales-based, payroll and other non-income taxes. A number of these examinations are ongoing invarious jurisdictions. In c
ertain cases, the Company has received assessments from the respective taxing authorities in connection with these examinations. Unlessotherwise indicated, the poss
ible losses or range of possible losses associated with these matters are individually immaterial, but a group of related matters, ifdecided adversely to the Comp
any, could result in a liability material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.In particular, Brazi
l federal, state and local laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations, and the Company's subsidiaries in Brazil are party to a largenumber of non-income tax ass
essments. One of these interpretations common to the retail industry in Brazil relates to whether credits received from suppliersshould be treated as a redu
ction of cost for purposes of calculating certain indirect taxes. The Company believes credits received from suppliers are reductions incost and that it has substant
ial legal defenses in this matter and intends to defend this matter vigorously. As such, the Company has not accrued for this matter,although the Company may be requi
red to deposit funds in escrow or secure financial guarantees to continue the judicial process in defending this matter in Brazil.49

Table of ContentsNote 10. Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in a number of 
legal proceedings. The Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflectedin the Company's Consolidated Financia
l Statements. For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore anaccrual has not been mad
e. However, where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed. The Company may enter intodiscussions regarding settl
ement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and itsshareholders.
Unless stated otherwise, the m
atters, or groups of related matters, discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in theaggregate, may result 
in a liability material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.ASDA Equal Value Claims
ASDA Stores, Ltd. ("ASDA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is a def
endant in over 10,000 "equal value" claims that are  proceeding before anEmployment Tribunal in Manch
ester (the "Employment Tribunal") in the United Kingdom ("UK") on behalf of current and former ASDA store employees, whoallege that the work per
formed by female employees in ASDA's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs to that ofmale employees working in ASDA's warehouse and dis
tribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not objectivelyjustified. Claimants a
re requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouse and distribution facilities and those higher wage rates on aprospective basis as part o
f these equal value proceedings. ASDA believes that further claims may be asserted in the future. On March 23, 2015, ASDA asked theEmployment Tribunal to stay 
all proceedings and to "strike out" substantially all of the claims. On July 23, 2015, the Employment Tribunal denied ASDA'srequests. Following additional pro
ceedings, the Employment Appeal Tribunal agreed to review the "strike out" issue and the Court of Appeals agreed to review thestay issue. On May 26, 2016, the Court of Appeals deni
ed ASDA's appeal of the stay issue. On October 14, 2016, following a preliminary hearing, the EmploymentTribunal ruled that cl
aimants could compare their positions in ASDA's retail stores with those of employees in ASDA's warehouse and distribution facilities.Claimants will now proceed to th
e next phase of their claims. That phase will determine whether the work performed by the claimants is of equal value to the workperformed by employees in ASDA's warehouse and d
istribution facilities. On November 23, 2016, ASDA filed a request with the Employment Appeal Tribunal tohear an appeal of the Octob
er 14, 2016 ruling, which was granted on January 11, 2017. At present, the Company cannot predict the number of such claims that maybe filed, and cannot reason
ably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings. The Company believes it has substantial factual and legaldefenses to these clai
ms, and intends to defend the claims vigorously.FCPA Investigation and Related Mat
tersThe Audit Committee (the "Audit Com
mittee") of the Board of Directors of the Company has been conducting an internal investigation into, among other things,alleged violations of th
e U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and other alleged crimes or misconduct in connection with foreign subsidiaries, includingWal-Mart de México, S.A.B. de C.V. ("Walm
ex"), and whether prior allegations of such violations and/or misconduct were appropriately handled by the Company.The Audit Committee and the Company h
ave engaged outside counsel from a number of law firms and other advisors who are assisting in the on-goinginvestigation of these m
atters.The Company has also been conducting a vo
luntary global review of its policies, practices and internal controls for anti-corruption compliance. The Company isengaged in strengthening its g
lobal anti-corruption compliance program through appropriate remedial anti-corruption measures.  In November 2011, the Companyvoluntarily disclosed tha
t investigative activity to the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Since theimplementation of th
e global review and the enhanced anti-corruption compliance program, the Audit Committee and the Company have identified or been madeaware of additional al
legations regarding potential violations of the FCPA. When such allegations have been reported or identified, the Audit Committee and theCompany, together with their th
ird party advisors, have conducted inquiries and when warranted based on those inquiries, opened investigations. Inquiries orinvestigations regarding 
allegations of potential FCPA violations were commenced in a number of foreign markets where the Company operates, including, but notlimited to, Brazil, China 
and India.As previously disclosed, the Company is unde
r investigation by the DOJ and the SEC regarding possible violations of the FCPA. The Company has beencooperating with the agenc
ies and discussions have begun with them regarding the resolution of these matters. As these discussions are preliminary, the Companycannot currently predict the
 timing, the outcome or the impact of a possible resolution of these matters.A number of federal and loc
al government agencies in Mexico have also initiated investigations of these matters. Walmex is cooperating with the Mexicangovernmental agencies 
conducting these investigations. Furthermore, lawsuits relating to the50

Table of Contentsmatters under investig
ation have been filed by several of the Company's shareholders against it, certain of its current directors, certain of its former directors,certain of its current and f
ormer officers and certain of Walmex's current and former officers.The Company could be exposed to a vari
ety of negative consequences as a result of the matters noted above. There could be one or more enforcement actions inrespect of the matt
ers that are the subject of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments,settlements, fines, pen
alties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties and the shareholder lawsuitsreferenced above may 
result in judgments against the Company and its current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings. The Companyexpects that there wil
l be on-going media and governmental interest, including additional news articles from media publications on these matters, which couldimpact the percept
ion among certain audiences of the Company's role as a corporate citizen.In addition, the Company has incur
red and expects to continue to incur costs in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimonyand other information in 
connection with the government investigations, in defending the shareholder lawsuits, and in conducting the review and investigations.These costs will be expensed as in
curred. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , the Company incurred the fol lowing third-party expenses inconnection with the FCPA investigation and 
related matters:

that it is probable that it will incur a loss from these matters, given the on-going nature and complexity of the review, inquiries andinvestigations, the Company canno

at these matters will have a material adverse effect on its business, given the inherent uncertainties in such situations, the Company canprovide no assurance that th
ese matters will not be material to its business in the future.Note 11. Commitments

es the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com. Corporate and support consists of corporateoverhead and other items no
t allocated to any of the Company's segments.The Company measures the resul
ts of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporateoverhead allocations. From 
time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations,as determined by the info
rmation regularly reviewed by its CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances arereclassified to be co
mparable to the current period's presentation.Information for the Company's s

the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Wal-MartStores, Inc.'s management is 
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internalcontrol over financia
l reporting included in the accompanying Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion onthe Company's internal contro
l over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that weplan and perform the au
dit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audit included obtaining an und
erstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluatingthe design and operating ef
fectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in thecircumstances. We be
lieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A company's internal control ov
er financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation of financial statement
s for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financialreporting includes tho
se policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions and dispositions o
f the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation offinancial statements in accordance
 with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only inaccordance with authori
zations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, us
e or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent l
imitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to futu
re periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate.In our opinion, Wal-
Mart Stores, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2017 , based on the COSO criteria.
