Item 1.
Business This Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated here
in by reference contain forward-looking statements based on expectations,estimates, and projections as of the da
te of this filing. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. See Item 1A of PartI — “Risk Factors.”
Amazon.com, Inc. was incorporat
ed in 1994 in the state of Washington and reincorporated in 1996 in the state of Delaware. Our principal corporate officesare located in Seatt
le, Washington. We completed our initial public offering in May 1997 and our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Marketunder the symbol “AMZN.”
As used herein, “Amazon.com,” “we,” 
“our,” and similar terms include Amazon.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.General
We seek to be Earth’s most 
customer-centric company. We are guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion forinvention, commitment 
to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers,sellers, developers, ent
erprises, and content creators. In addition, we provide services, such as advertising to sellers, vendors, publishers, and authors, throughprograms such as sponsored ads, display, 
and video advertising.        We have organized our oper
ations into three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). These segments reflect the waythe Company evaluates its busin
ess performance and manages its operations. Information on our net sales is contained in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statementsand Supplementary Data — Note 10 — Segmen
t Information.” The financial results of Whole Foods Market, Inc. (“Whole Foods Market”) have been included inour consolidated financi
al statements from the date of acquisition on August 28, 2017.Consumers
We serve consumers through our on
line and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We design our stores to enable hundreds ofmillions of unique products to b
e sold by us and by third parties across dozens of product categories. Customers access our offerings through our websites, mobileapps, Alexa, devices, stream
ing, and physically visiting our stores. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices, including Kindle, Fire tablet, Fire TV, Echo,Ring, and other devices, and we develop 
and produce media content. We seek to offer our customers low prices, fast and free delivery, easy-to-use functionality,and timely customer se
rvice. In addition, we offer Amazon Prime, a membership program that includes unlimited free shipping on over 100 million items, accessto unlimited stream
ing of tens of thousands of movies and TV episodes, including Amazon Original content, and other benefits.We fulfill custome
r orders in a number of ways, including through: North America and International fulfillment and delivery networks that we operate; co-sourced and outsourced arrang
ements in certain countries; digital delivery; and through our physical stores. We operate customer service centers globally, whichare supplemented by co-sour
ced arrangements. See Item 2 of Part I, “Properties.”Sellers
We offer programs tha
t enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us. We are not the seller of recordin these transactions. We
 earn fixed fees, a percentage of sales, per-unit activity fees, interest, or some combination thereof, for our seller programs.Developers and Enterprises
We serve developers and en
terprises of all sizes, including start-ups, government agencies, and academic institutions, through our AWS segment, whichoffers a broad set of globa
l compute, storage, database, and other service offerings.3

Table of ContentsContent Creators
We serve authors and independ
ent publishers with Kindle Direct Publishing, an online service that lets independent authors and publishers choose a royaltyoption and make their books ava
ilable in the Kindle Store, along with Amazon’s own publishing arm, Amazon Publishing. We also offer programs that allowauthors, musicians, film
makers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell content.Competition
Our businesses encompass a large v
ariety of product types, service offerings, and delivery channels. The worldwide marketplace in which we compete isevolving rapidly and intense
ly competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world. Our current andpotential competito
rs include: (1) physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the productswe offer and sell to consume
rs and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and all distributionchannels; (3) web search eng
ines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, oracquiring goods an
d services, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including websitedevelopment and hosting, omnich
annel sales, inventory, and supply chain management, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment processing;(5) companies that provid
e fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties, whether online or offline; (6) companies that provide informationtechnology services or produc
ts, including on-premises or cloud-based infrastructure and other services; (7) companies that design, manufacture, market, or sellconsumer electronics, telecommu
nication, and electronic devices; and (8) companies that sell grocery products online and in physical stores. We believe that theprincipal competitive factors in
 our retail businesses include selection, price, and convenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitivefactors for our selle
r and enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers’ ability and willingness tochange business practices. Som
e of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brand recognition, andgreater control over 
inputs critical to our various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictivedistribution agreemen
ts that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive terms,and devote more resources 
to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, whichenhances the ability of n
ew, smaller, or lesser-known businesses to compete against us. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the developmentof new business models and the entry o
f new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthentheir competitive positions.
Intellectual Property
We regard our trademarks, 
service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectualproperty as critica
l to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements withour employees, customers, pa
rtners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. andinternational domain n
ames, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain ofour proprietary technology. 
We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties.Seasonality
Our business is affected by season
ality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31. Werecognized 
34% , 31%, and 31%  of our annual revenue during the fourth quarter of 2017 , 2018, and 2019 . Fourth quarter 2017 results inc lude revenue attributableto Whole Foods Market, which we acquir
ed on August 28, 2017.Employees
We employed approximately 
798,000  full-time and part -time employees as of December 31, 2019 . However, employment levels f luctuate due to seasonalfactors affecting ou
r business. Additionally, we utilize independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. We have works councils,statutory employee rep
resentation obligations, and union agreements in certain countries outside the United States and at certain of our studio operations within theUnited States. We consider our 
employee relations to be good. Competition for qualified personnel has historically been intense, particularly for softwareengineers, computer sci
entists, and other technical staff.4

Risk Factors Please carefully consid
er the following discussion of significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky. The eventsand consequences discussed in thes
e risk factors could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a materialadverse effect on our busin
ess, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results), cash flows,liquidity, and stock price. Th
ese risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that arenot presently known to us or that we cur
rently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. In addition, the global economic climate amplifiesmany of these risks.
We Face Intense Competition
Our businesses are rapidly evolv
ing and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors across geographies, including cross-border competition, andin different industries, i
ncluding physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-commerce services, web and infrastructure computing services, electronicdevices, digital conten
t, advertising, grocery, and transportation and logistics services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longerhistories, more custome
rs, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer geographic regions. Theymay secure better t
erms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.Competition continues to int
ensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as ourcompetitors enter in
to business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. Inaddition, new and enhanced techno
logies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices continue to increaseour competition. The Inte
rnet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser known businesses tocompete against us. As a resul
t of competition, our product and service offerings may not be successful, we may fail to gain or may lose business, and we may berequired to increase ou
r spending or lower prices, any of which could materially reduce our sales and profits.Our Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources
We are continuing to rap
idly and significantly expand our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling ourinfrastructure to suppor
t our retail and services businesses. The complexity of the current scale of our business can place significant strain on our management,personnel, operations, systems, 
technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions, and our expansion increases thesefactors. Failure to man
age growth effectively could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.Our Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks
We may have limited o
r no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings. These offerings,which can present new and diffi
cult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures orother quality issues. In addi
tion, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations, and we may not be successful enough in these neweractivities to recoup ou
r investments in them. Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the valueof those investments being wri
tten down or written off.We Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate
We are not always able to 
accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion ofour expenses and investments is 
fixed, and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected.Our revenue growth may not be sustain
able, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on thecontinued growth of demand for th
e products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditionsworldwide. A softening of demand, whether 
caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in decreasedrevenue or growth.
Our sales and operating resul
ts will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to factors described elsewhere in this section and the following:•
our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers’ demands;6

Table of Contents•
our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers;•
our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders;•
the introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements;•
changes in usage or adoption rates of the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and web services, including outside the U.S.;•
timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure;•
the success of our geographic, service, and product line expansions;•
the extent to which we finance, and the terms of any such financing for, our current operations and future growth;•
the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief and could have a material adverseimpact on our operating r
esults;•
variations in the mix of products and services we sell;•
variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns;•
the extent to which we offer fast and free delivery, continue to reduce prices worldwide, and provide additional benefits to our customers;•
factors affecting our reputation or brand image;•
the extent to which we invest in technology and content, fulfillment, and other expense categories;•
increases in the prices of fuel and gasoline, as well as increases in the prices of other energy products and commodities like paper and packing suppliesand hardware products;
•
the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our stores successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired andunconstrained access to our on
line services;•
our ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due;•
the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware, viruses, phishing and other spam emails, denial of service attacks, data theft, computerintrusions, outages, and simil
ar events; and•
disruptions from natural or man-made disasters, extreme weather, geopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks and armedhostilities), labor or 
trade disputes, and similar events.Our International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks
Our international activities are
 significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In certain international market segments,we have relatively li
ttle operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, andmaintain internat
ional operations and stores, and promote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not become profitable on a sustained basis.In addition to risks describ
ed elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:•
local economic and political conditions;•
government regulation (such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition); restrictive governmental actions (such as tradeprotection measures, in
cluding export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs); nationalization; and restrictions on foreign ownership;•
restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content, includinguncertainty as a result of
 less Internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regardingthe physical and digital
 distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights;•
business licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices;•
limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;•
limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure;•
shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow;•
laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, privacy, network security, encryption, payments, advertising, and restrictions on pricing ordiscounts;
7

Table of Contents•
lower levels of use of the Internet;•
lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.;•
lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk;•
difficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;•
different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions;•
compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officialsand other third parties;
•
laws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and•
geopolitical events, including war and terrorism.As international physical, 
e-commerce, and omnichannel retail and other services grow, competition will intensify, including through adoption of evolvingbusiness models. Local compani
es may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, aswell as their more est
ablished local brand names. The inability to hire, train, retain, and manage sufficient required personnel may limit our international growth.The People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and Ind
ia regulate Amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in country through regulations and licenserequirements that may restrict (i) f
oreign investment in and operation of the Internet, IT infrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii) Internetcontent, and (iii) the s
ale of media and other products and services. For example, in order to meet local ownership, regulatory licensing, and cybersecurityrequirements, we provide c
ertain technology services in China through contractual relationships with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services. InIndia, the government res
tricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multi-brand retail trading activities. Forwww.amazon.in, we provide certain m
arketing tools and logistics services to third-party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we holdindirect minority in
terests in entities that are third-party sellers on the www.amazon.in marketplace. Although we believe these structures and activities complywith existing laws, they involve uniqu
e risks, and the PRC and India may from time to time consider and implement additional changes in their regulatory,licensing, or other requi
rements that could impact these structures and activities. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of PRC and Indianlaws and regulations, and it is poss
ible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. In addition, our Chinese and Indian businesses andoperations may be unable to 
continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or, in China, enforce contractual relationships we orour affiliates have 
in place. Violation of any existing or future PRC, Indian, or other laws or regulations or changes in the interpretations of those laws andregulations could result 
in our businesses in those countries being subject to fines and other financial penalties, having licenses revoked, or being forced torestructure our opera
tions or shut down entirely.We Face Risks Related to Successfully Optim
izing and Operating Our Fulfillment Network and Data CentersFailures to adequately 
predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully from time to timeresult in excess or insuff
icient fulfillment or data center capacity, increased costs, and impairment charges, any of which could materially harm our business. As wecontinue to add fulfill
ment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements, our fulfillment and data center networks becomeincreasingly complex and op
erating them becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively.In addition, failure to op
timize inventory in our fulfillment network increases our net shipping cost by requiring long-zone or partial shipments. We and ourco-sourcers may be una
ble to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers. Under some of our commercial agreements, we maintain theinventory of other compani
es, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network. Our failure to properly handle suchinventory or the inabili
ty of the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services to accurately forecast product demand may result in usbeing unable to secure suff
icient storage space or to optimize our fulfillment network or cause other unexpected costs and other harm to our business andreputation.
We rely on a limited nu
mber of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. The inability to negotiate acceptableterms with these compani
es or performance problems or other difficulties experienced by these companies or by our own transportation systems could negativelyimpact our operating r
esults and customer experience. In addition, our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers alsomay be negatively aff
ected by natural or man-made disasters, extreme weather, geopolitical events and security issues, labor or trade disputes, and similar events.8

Table of ContentsThe Seasonality of Our Retail Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations
We expect a disproportion
ate amount of our retail sales to occur during our fourth quarter. Our failure to stock or restock popular products in sufficientamounts such that we fail to 
meet customer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. When we overstock products, we may berequired to take significant
 inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could materially reduce profitability. We regularly experienceincreases in our net shipping 
cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for theholiday season. If too many custo
mers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand, we may experience system interruptions thatmake our websites unavailab
le or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the attractiveness of ourproducts and services. In addi
tion, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods anddelivery and other fulf
illment companies and customer service co-sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. Risks described elsewhere in this Item 1Arelating to fulfil
lment network optimization and inventory are magnified during periods of high demand.We generally have paym
ent terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customers.As a result of holiday sales, as o
f December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level (otherthan as a result of cash f
lows provided by or used in investing and financing activities). This operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payableas of December 31. Our accounts pay
able balance generally declines during the first three months of the year, resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash, cashequivalents, and marketable
 securities balances.Our Commercial Agreements, Strategic Allianc
es, and Other Business Relationships Expose Us to RisksWe provide physical, e-c
ommerce, and omnichannel retail and other services to businesses through commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and businessrelationships. Under these ag
reements, we provide web services, technology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services, as well as enable sellers tooffer products or servic
es through our stores. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other resourcecommitments, which may l
imit the amount of business we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, and develop the components of thesecommercial relationships, w
hich may include web services, fulfillment, customer service, inventory management, tax collection, payment processing, hardware,content, and third-party so
ftware, and engaging third parties to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercialagreements is parti
ally dependent on the volume of the other company’s sales. Therefore, when the other company’s offerings are not successful, the compensationwe receive may be lower
 than expected or the agreement may be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to enter into additional or alternative commercialrelationships and strat
egic alliances on favorable terms. We also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we areunsuccessful in implemen
ting, maintaining, or developing these services.As our agreements termin
ate, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We may in the future enter intoamendments on less favorab
le terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our operatingresults.
Our present and fut
ure e-commerce services agreements, other commercial agreements, and strategic alliances create additional risks such as:•
disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;•
impairment of other relationships;•
variability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and•
difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements.Our Business Suffers When We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Acquisitions and Investments
We have acquired and inves
ted in a number of companies, and we may in the future acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additionalcompanies. These transac
tions create risks such as:•
disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;•
problems retaining key personnel;•
additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested;•
the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, including as a result of acquisitions;9

Table of Contents•
the potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result ofany integration of opera
tions;•
the difficulty of completing such transactions and achieving anticipated benefits within expected timeframes, or at all;•
the difficulty of incorporating acquired operations, technology, and rights into our offerings, and unanticipated expenses related to such integration;•
the difficulty of integrating a new company’s accounting, financial reporting, management, information and information security, human resource, andother administrative systems
 to permit effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not successfully implemented;•
losses we may incur as a result of declines in the value of an investment or as a result of incorporating an investee’s financial performance into ourfinancial results;
•
for investments in which an investee’s financial performance is incorporated into our financial results, either in full or in part, the dependence on theinvestee’s accounting, f
inancial reporting, and similar systems, controls, and processes;•
the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger public company;•
the risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face;•
potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest; and•
for foreign transactions, additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political, andregulatory risks associate
d with specific countries.As a result of future acquis
itions or mergers, we might need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt, contingent liabilities, oramortization expenses 
related to intangible assets, any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business or only be available on unfavorable terms, ifat all. In addition, valu
ations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly. We could determine that such valuations haveexperienced impairments or ot
her-than-temporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results.We Have Foreign Exchange Risk
The results of operations of, 
and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international stores and product and service offerings are exposedto foreign exchange rat
e fluctuations. Due to these fluctuations, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains orlosses on the remeasurem
ent of intercompany balances. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations hasincreased. We also hold c
ash equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign currencies including British Pounds, Euros, and Japanese Yen. When theU.S. Dollar strengthens compared to 
these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, when translated, may be materially less than expectedand vice versa.
The Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel or the Failure to Hire and Retain H
ighly Skilled and Other Key Personnel Could Negatively Affect OurBusiness
We depend on our senior manage
ment and other key personnel, particularly Jeffrey P. Bezos, our President, CEO, and Chairman. We do not have “keyperson” life insurance po
licies. We also rely on other highly skilled personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the technology industry has historically beenintense, particular
ly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees or theinability to hire, tr
ain, retain, and manage qualified personnel, could harm our business.We Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Breaches
Because we collect, process, s
tore, and transmit large amounts of data, including confidential, sensitive, proprietary, and business and personal information,failure to prevent or 
mitigate data loss, theft, misuse, or other security breaches or vulnerabilities affecting our or our vendors’ or customers’ technology, products,and systems, could expose us or our custo
mers to a risk of loss, disclosure, or misuse of such information, adversely affect our operating results, result in litigation,regulatory action (in
cluding under privacy or data protection laws), and potential liability for us, deter customers or sellers from using our stores and services, andotherwise harm our business and r
eputation. We use third-party technology and systems for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, encryption andauthentication techno
logy, employee email, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions. Some of our systems have experienced pastsecurity breaches, and,
10

Table of Contentsalthough they did not have a ma
terial adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future. Although we havedeveloped systems and processes 
that are designed to protect customer information and prevent such incidents, including systems and processes designed to reducethe impact of a secur
ity breach at a third-party vendor or customer, such measures cannot provide absolute security and may fail to operate as intended or becircumvented.
We Face Risks Related to System Interruption and Lack of Redundancy
We experience occas
ional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us fromefficiently acc
epting or fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties, which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services.Steps we take to add software and ha
rdware, upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and improve the stability and efficiency of our systems may not besufficient to avoid syste
m interruptions or delays that could adversely affect our operating results.Our computer and communica
tions systems and operations in the past have been, or in the future could be, damaged or interrupted due to events such asnatural or man-made disasters
, extreme weather, geopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities), computer viruses,physical or electroni
c break-ins, and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data, and couldprevent us from accept
ing and fulfilling customer orders and providing services, which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject usto liability. Our systems a
re not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient. In addition, our insurance may not provide sufficientcoverage to compensate 
for related losses. Any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy.We Face Significant Inventory Risk
In addition to risks describ
ed elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties, we are exposed tosignificant inventory r
isks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles andpricing, defective m
erchandise, changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products, spoilage,and other factors. We end
eavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and/or sell. Demand forproducts, however, can change signi
ficantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. In addition, when we begin selling ormanufacturing a new product, 
it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecastdemand. The acquisition of c
ertain types of inventory or components requires significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. We carry abroad selection and signif
icant inventory levels of certain products, such as consumer electronics, and at times we are unable to sell products in sufficient quantitiesor to meet demand during th
e relevant selling seasons. Any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results.We Face Risks Related to Adequately Protec
ting Our Intellectual Property Rights and Being Accused of Infringing Intellectual Property Rights of ThirdParties
We regard our trademarks, 
service marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and similar intellectual property as critical toour success, and we rely on trade
mark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees,customers, and others to prot
ect our proprietary rights. Effective intellectual property protection is not available in every country in which our products andservices are made av
ailable. We also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business. Furthermore,regulations governing domain n
ames may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiringdomain names that are s
imilar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.We are not always able to d
iscover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. Actions taken by third parties that license ourproprietary rights may 
materially diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. The protection of our intellectual property requires the expenditure ofsignificant financi
al and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property do not always adequately protect our rights orprevent third parties 
from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwiseacquire equivalent or su
perior technology or other intellectual property rights.We have been subject to, and 
expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectualproperty rights of third pa
rties. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, have in the past, and may in the future, result in the expenditure of significant financialand managerial resour
ces, injunctions against us, or significant payments for damages, including to satisfy indemnification obligations or to obtain licenses fromthird parties who allege 
that we have infringed their rights. Such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. These risks have been amplifiedby the increase in third p
arties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims.11

Table of ContentsOur digital content offe
rings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content. Breach or malfunctioningof the digital rights m
anagement technology that we use could subject us to claims, and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service.We Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highl
y VolatileWe have a rapidly evolving bus
iness model. The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to, among other risks, the risksdescribed elsewhere in th
is Item 1A, as well as:•
changes in interest rates;•
conditions or trends in the Internet and the industry segments we operate in;•
quarterly variations in operating results;•
fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for Internet-related companies in particular;•
changes in financial estimates by us or decisions to increase or decrease future spending or investment levels;•
changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;•
changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public;•
changes in the valuation methodology of, or performance by, other e-commerce or technology companies; and•
transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, and speculation.Volatility in our stock pri
ce could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees orgrant larger stock awards 
than we have historically, which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders, orboth.
Government Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business
We are subject to gene
ral business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, physical, e-commerce, andomnichannel retail, d
igital content, web services, electronic devices, artificial intelligence technologies and services, and other products and services that we offeror sell. These regulations 
and laws cover taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, transportation, mobile communications,electronic device certification, electronic
 waste, energy consumption, environmental regulation, electronic contracts and other communications, competition,consumer protection, emp
loyment, trade and protectionist measures, web services, the provision of online payment services, registration, licensing, andinformation reporting 
requirements, unencumbered Internet access to our services or access to our facilities, the design and operation of websites, health, safety,and sanitation standard
s, the characteristics, legality, and quality of products and services, product labeling, the commercial operation of unmanned aircraftsystems, and other matte
rs. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, data protection, and personal privacy apply toaspects of our operatio
ns such as the Internet, e-commerce, digital content, web services, electronic devices, and artificial intelligence technologies and services. Alarge number of jurisdi
ctions regulate our operations, and the extent, nature, and scope of such regulations is evolving and expanding as the scope of our businessesexpand. We are regular
ly subject to formal and informal reviews and investigations by governments and regulatory authorities under existing laws, regulations, orinterpretations or pursu
ing new and novel approaches to regulate our operations. For example, the European Commission announced that it has opened aninvestigation to assess whethe
r aspects of our operations with marketplace sellers violate EU competition rules. Unfavorable regulations, laws, decisions, orinterpretations by govern
ment or regulatory authorities applying those laws and regulations, or inquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions threatened orinitiated by them, could 
cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetaryfines), diminish the dem
and for, or availability of, our products and services, increase our cost of doing business, require us to change our business practices in amanner material
ly adverse to our business, damage our reputation, impede our growth, or otherwise have a material effect on our operations.Claims, Litigation, Government Investigat
ions, and Other Proceedings May Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of OperationsAs an innovative company offer
ing a wide range of consumer and business products and services around the world, we are regularly subject to actual andthreatened claims, 
litigation, reviews, investigations, and other proceedings, including proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities, involving a widerange of issues, including pat
ent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy and data protection,consumer protection, com
mercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. The number and scale of these proceedingshave increased over ti
me as our businesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach and our products, services, and operations have become more complexand available to, and used by, mo
re people. Any of these types of12

Table of Contentsproceedings can have an adve
rse effect on us because of legal costs, disruption of our operations, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, and otherfactors. The outcomes of th
ese matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. Determining legal reserves or possible losses from suchmatters involves judgmen
t and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes. Until the final resolution of such matters, we may beexposed to losses in excess of the 
amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to havebeen incorrect, it cou
ld have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, it is possible that aresolution of one or more such p
roceedings, including as a result of a settlement, could involve licenses, sanctions, consent decrees, or orders requiring us to makesubstantial future paym
ents, preventing us from offering certain products or services, requiring us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverseto our business, requiring develop
ment of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies, damaging our reputation, or otherwise having a materialeffect on our operations.
We Face Additional Tax Liabilities and Colle
ction ObligationsWe are subject to a va
riety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We may recognizeadditional tax expense and b
e subject to additional tax liabilities, including other liabilities for tax collection obligations due to changes in laws, regulations,administrative pra
ctices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accountingrules in various jurisdic
tions. Such changes could come about as a result of economic, political, and other conditions. An increasing number of jurisdictions areconsidering or have adopted l
aws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes, targeting online commerce and theremote selling of goods and se
rvices. These include new obligations to collect sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and remotesellers, or other requi
rements that may result in liability for third party obligations. For example, the European Union, certain member states, and other countrieshave proposed or enacted tax
es on online advertising and marketplace service revenues. Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely effected byadditional taxes of this n
ature imposed on us prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collectionobligations or failure 
to provide information about our customers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies. Insome cases we also may not have su
fficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collectionobligations by the effec
tive date.Our tax expense and liabili
ties are also affected by other factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into newbusinesses and geographies, inte
rcompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able torealize relat
ed tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, and changes in ourdeferred tax assets and 
liabilities and their valuation. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense and liabilities. In the ordinarycourse of our business, there a
re many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, the legislation known asthe U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “U.S. Tax Act”) requ
ires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by U.S. tax law,significant judgments to b
e made in interpretation of the provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis ofinformation not previously 
relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies will continue to interpret orissue guidance on how provisions of the U.S. Tax Act wil
l be applied or otherwise administered. As future guidance is issued, we may make adjustments toamounts that we have previously 
recorded that may materially impact our financial statements in the period in which the adjustments are made.We are also subject to 
tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax assessments against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or othertax controversy can have a 
material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior andsubsequent periods. We regula
rly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals.Although we believe our tax esti
mates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different fromour historical tax accruals.
Our Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks
We have significant suppl
iers, including content and technology licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of supply, that are important to oursourcing, services, manufa
cturing, and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of oursuppliers to guarantee av
ailability of merchandise, content, components, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. Decisions by ourcurrent suppliers to stop se
lling or licensing merchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including as a result of oneor more supplier bankruptc
ies due to poor economic conditions, as a result of natural disasters, or for other reasons, may result in our being unable to procurealternatives from o
ther suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, violations by our suppliers or other vendors ofapplicable laws, regula
tions, contractual13

Table of Contentsterms, intellectu
al property rights of others, or our Supply Chain Standards, as well as products or practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous, couldexpose us to claims, damage ou
r reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.We Are Subject to Risks Related to Government Contracts and Relat
ed Procurement RegulationsOur contracts with U.S., as well as stat
e, local, and foreign, government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirementsrelating to their fo
rmation, administration, and performance. We are subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violationscould result in various civ
il and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeitureof profits, payment of fin
es, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, some of these contracts provide for termination by thegovernment at any time, wi
thout cause.We Are Subject to Product Liability Clai
ms When People or Property Are Harmed by the Products We Sell or ManufactureSome of the products we sell or m
anufacture expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness, death, or environmentalor property damage, and can 
require product recalls or other actions. Third parties who sell products using our services and stores increase our exposure to productliability claims, su
ch as when these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims. Although we maintain liability insurance, we cannot be certain thatour coverage will be a
dequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all.Although we impose contractual 
terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect, enforce, or collectsufficient damages fo
r breaches of such agreements. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability.We Are Subject to Payments-Related Risks
We accept payments using
 a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, credit accounts (including promotional financing), gift cards, direct debitfrom a customer’s bank a
ccount, consumer invoicing, physical bank check, and payment upon delivery. For existing and future payment options we offer to ourcustomers, we currently a
re subject to, and may become subject to additional, regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implementenhanced authenticat
ion processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For certain paymentmethods, including credit 
and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability.We rely on third parti
es to provide certain Amazon-branded payment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debitcards, electronic ch
ecks, and promotional financing. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide theseservices to us. We also off
er co-branded credit card programs, which could adversely affect our operating results if renewed on less favorable terms or terminated.We are also subject to pa
yment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic fundstransfers, which could change o
r be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. Failure to comply with these rules or requirements, as well asany breach, compromise, or 
failure to otherwise detect or prevent fraudulent activity involving our data security systems, could result in our being liable for cardissuing banks’ costs, subject to f
ines and higher transaction fees, and loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, processelectronic funds trans
fers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.In addition, we provide regula
ted services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to thirdparties, and because we provid
e services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf. Jurisdictions subject us to requirements for licensing, regulatoryinspection, bonding and capita
l maintenance, the use, handling, and segregation of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, maintaining or processing data, andauthentication. We a
re also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, money laundering, internationalmoney transfers, privacy 
and information security, and electronic fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could besubject to additional r
equirements and civil and criminal penalties, or forced to cease providing certain services.We Are Impacted by Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Se
llersThe law relating to the l
iability of online service providers is currently unsettled. In addition, governmental agencies have in the past and could in the futurerequire changes in the way th
is business is conducted. Under our seller programs, we maintain policies and processes designed to prevent sellers from collectingpayments, fraudulently or o
therwise, when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’descriptions, and to prevent s
ellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen goods, selling14

Table of Contentsgoods in an unlawful or unethical 
manner, violating the proprietary rights of others, or otherwise violating our policies. When these policies and processes arecircumvented or fail to operate
 sufficiently, it can harm our business or damage our reputation and we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activitiesby our sellers. Under our A2Z Guarantee, we 
reimburse buyers for payments up to certain limits in these situations, and as our third-party seller sales grow, thecost of this program will in
crease and could negatively affect our operating results.Item 1B.

Our primary source of revenue is the sale o
f a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered through our s tores includemerchandise and content we h
ave purchased for resale and products offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices and producemedia content. General
ly, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items soldby third-party sellers 
as service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numerous product categories. Wealso offer other servi
ces such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, advertising, publishing, and digital content subscriptions.Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainab
le growth in free cash flows1. Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income andefficiently manag
ing working capital2 and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operatingincome primarily r
esult from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make inlonger-term strat
egic initiatives, including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer experience. To increase sales of products and services, we focuson improving all aspect
s of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasingselection, producing origin
al content, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improvingreliability, and ea
rning customer trust.We seek to reduce our variabl
e costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include p roduct and content costs, payment processingand related transac
tion costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and aportion of our marketing cos
ts. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to ouronline stores, web services, e
lectronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment and delivery networks and related facilities. Variablecosts generally change di
rectly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, categoryexpansion, and other factors. To d
ecrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing,increase discounts from supp
liers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies andmaintain a lean culture.

Working capital consists of accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable.19

Table of ContentsBecause of our model we are able to turn our inv
entory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle3. On average, our high inventory velocity meanswe generally collect from co
nsumers before our payments to suppliers come due. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected bynumerous factors, including ou
r product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selectionof product offerings, our inves
tment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We alsoexpect some variabil
ity in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix o
f suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms withsuppliers.
We expect spending in te
chnology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, andmerchandising employees. Our technology and con
tent investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due togeographic expansion and the cross-func
tionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, includingAWS, and expansion of new and existing product 
categories and service offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience andimprove our process efficienc
ies. We believe that advan ces in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, the advances of wirelessconnectivity, and the 
practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet andincrease its ubiquity in p
eople’s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in initiatives to build and deployinnovative and effici
ent software and electronic devices. We are also investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and otherservice offerings to dev
elopers and enterprises of all sizes.We seek to effici
ently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions,and aligning employee compensation with shareho
lders’ interests. We utilize restr icted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because webelieve this compensat
ion model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested andunvested stock awards outstanding, withou
t regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 507 million  and 512 million
 as of December 31, 2018  and 2019 . Our financial reporting currency is 
the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens y
ear-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses willbe higher than if curren
cies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, ourconsolidated net sales and op
erating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond theU.S. economy through our growing internation
al businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operatingresults and growth rates befo
re and after the effect of currency changes.In addition, the remeasu
rement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreigncurrency exchange rat
es. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidatedtrends and comparisons.

Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Judgments
The preparation of finan
cial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates andassumptions that affec
t the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidatedfinancial statem
ents and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal ofthe company’s financia
l condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result ofthe need to make estimates 
of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgmentsaddressed below. We also have oth
er key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understandingour results. For additional in
formation, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and AccountingPolicies.” Although we believe th
at our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual resultsmay differ signific
antly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.Inventories
Inventories, consisting of produ
cts available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost andnet realizable va
lue. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such asthrough sales to individual cus
tomers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptionsabout future disposition of inv
entory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in thefuture. As a measure of sensi
tivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2019 , we would have recorded an addition al costof sales of approximately 
$230 million . In addition, we enter
 into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on forecastedcustomer demand. If we redu
ce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.Income Taxes
We are subject to inco
me taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles,and interpretations in v
arious jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, andsignificant judgment is 
required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinarycourse of business for which the ul
timate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in ourbusiness operations, acquisit
ions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings,including earnings being lower 
than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we havehigher statutory rates, 
losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes inforeign currency exchang
e rates, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations,administrative pra
ctices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accountingrules in various jurisdic
tions. In addition, a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as theU.S. tax reform legislation 
commonly known as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “U.S. Tax Act”). Finally, foreign governments may enact tax laws inresponse to the U.S. Tax Act that could r
esult in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.The U.S. Tax Act significantly changed how th
e U.S. taxes corporations. The U.S. Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were notpreviously required by U.S. tax law, signi
ficant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, significant estimates in calculations,and the preparation and an
alysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-settingbodies will continue to inte
rpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the U.S. Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered. As future guidance is issued,we may make adjustments to 
amounts that we have previously recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which theadjustments are made.
We are also current
ly subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us.Developments in an audit, inves
tigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods forwhich that development occu
rs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from theseproceedings to determin
e the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, andany other tax controversi
es could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.21

Cash flow information, which ref

 Year Ended December 31,  
2018  2019 Cash provided by (used in):
   Operating activities
$ 30,723  $38,514 Investing activities
(12,369 )  (24,281 ) Financing activities
(7,686 )  (10,066 ) Our principal sources of liqu
idity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fairvalue, were 
$41.3 billion  and $55.0 billion  as of December 31, 2018  and 2019 . Amounts held in foreign curren cies were $13.8 billion  and $15.3 billion  as of December 31, 2018
 and 2019 , and were primarily Euros, Bri tish Pounds, and Japanese Yen.Cash 
provided by (used in)  operating activities was $30.7 billion  and $38.5 billion  in 2018 and 2019 . Our operating cash flows result p rimarily from cashreceived from our consum
er, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and advertisers, offset by cash payments we make for products andservices, employee comp
ensation, payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term obligations. Cashreceived from our custo
mers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, ourreceivables from consu
mers settle quickly. The increase  in operating cash flow in 2019 , compared to the prior  year, is primarily due to the increase in net income,excluding non-cash charges such 
as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation. Cash provided by (used in)  operating activiti es is also subject tochanges in working capital. Wo
rking capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and categoryexpansion, the timing of cash 
receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.Cash 
provided by (used in)  investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received fromproperty and equipment vendors, p
roceeds from asset sales, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, andpurchases, sales, and matur
ities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in)  investing activities was $(12.4) billion  and $(24.3) billion  in 2018 and 2019 , with the variability c
aused primarily by our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment and purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities.Cash capital expenditures we
re $11.3 billion , and $12.7 billion  in 2018 and 2019 , which primarily reflect ad ditional capacity to support our fulfillment operationsand additional investmen
ts in support of continued business growth in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS). We made cashpayments, net of acquired 
cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $2.2 billion  and $2.5 billion  in 2018 and 2019 . Cash 
provided by (used in)  financing activities was $(7.7) billion  and $(10.1) billion  in 2018 and 2019 . Cash outflows from financing ac tivities result fromprincipal repayments o
f finance leases and financing obligations and repayments of long-term debt and other, and were $8.5 billion  and $12.3 billion  in 2018 and 2019
. Property and equipment acqui red under finance leases was $10.6 billion  and $13.7 billion  in 2018 and 2019 , with the increase  reflecting investments in support of continued business growth pri
marily due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS, which investments we expect to continue over time.We had no borrowings outstanding under th
e commercial paper program (the “Commercial Paper Program”) or unsecured revolving credit facility (the“Credit Agreement”) and 
$740 million  of borrowings outstanding under our $740 million  secured revolving credi t facility (the “Credit Facility”) as ofDecember 31, 2019
. See Item 8 of Part II, “Finan cial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 6 — Debt” for additional information. In 
2018 and 2019 , we recorded net tax provisions o f $1.2 billion  and $2.4 billion . Certain foreign subsidiary earnings are subject to U.S. taxation under theU.S. Tax Act, which also repeals U.S. taxation on th
e subsequent repatriation of those earnings. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiaryearnings, as well as our capi
tal in our foreign22

ely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. As ofDecember 31, 2019
, cash, cash equivalents, and m arketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $13.4 billion . Tax benefits relating 
to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our U.S. taxable income. The U.S.Tax Act enhanced and extended a
ccelerated depreciation deductions by allowing full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. Cashtaxes paid (net of refunds
) were $1.2 billion  and $881 million  for 2018 and 2019 . As of December 31, 2019 , we had approximately $1.7 billion  of federal tax credits potentially available to
 offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit. As weutilize our federa
l tax credits we expect cash paid for taxes to increase. We endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reportingbasis. In connection with the Europ
ean Commission’s October 2017 decision against us on state aid, Luxembourg tax authorities computed an initial recoveryamount, consistent with the Europ
ean Commission’s decision, of approximately €250 million , that we deposited into escrow in M arch 2018, subject to adjustmentpending conclusion of all appe
als.Our liquidity is als
o affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for real estate leases, amounts due to third-party sellers in certainjurisdictions, debt, and standby 
and trade letters of credit. To the extent we process payments for third-party sellers or offer certain types of stored value to ourcustomers, some jurisdic
tions may restrict our use of those funds. These restrictions would result in the reclassification of a portion of our cash and cashequivalents from “Cash and c
ash equivalents” to restricted cash, which is classified within “Accounts receivable, net and other” and “Other assets” on ourconsolidated balance she
ets. As of December 31, 2018  and 2019 , restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $426 million  and $321 million . See Item 8 of Part II, “Finan
cial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 7 — Commitments and Contingencies” for additional discussion of our principalcontractual commi
tments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, purchase obligations and open purchase orders, consisting of inventory and significant non-inventory commitments, we
re $15.7 billion  as of December 31, 2019 . These purchase obligations and op en purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or inpart through the contrac
tual provisions.We believe that cash 
flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowingarrangements, will be suf
ficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs andcash flows are subject to subst
antial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debtsecurities, obtain cr
edit facilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, orrepurchase, refinanc
e, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position.The sale of additional equ
ity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider theacquisition of, or investm
ent in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidityrequirements or cause us 
to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines orfinancing instruments wil
l be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.23

Table of ContentsResults of Operations
We have organized our oper
ations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates itsbusiness performance and m
anages its operations. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 10 — Segment Information.”Net Sales
Net sales include product and s
ervice sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media contentwhere we record revenue gross. Serv
ice sales primarily represent third-party seller fees, which includes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees,AWS sales, Amazon Prime membersh

increased  21% in 2019, compared to the prior ye ar. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers. Incre

y, and increased selection.International sales 
increased  13% in 2019, compared to the prior ye ar. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-partysellers. Increased uni

Cost of sales primarily cons
ists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation anddelivery centers and wher
e we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music.The 
increase in cost of sales in absolute do llars in 2019 , compared to the prior ye ar, is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting fromincreased sales.
Shipping costs to receive produc
ts from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers.Shipping costs, which include sortat
ion and delivery centers and transportation costs, were $27.7 billion  and $37.9 billion  in 2018 and 2019 . We expect our cost of shipping to continue to incre
ase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we reduce shipping rates, we use moreexpensive shipping methods, includ
ing faster delivery, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achievinghigher sales volumes, optim
izing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe thatoffering low prices to our cus
tomers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.Costs to operate our AWS segment ar
e primarily classified as “Technology and content” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internaltechnology requirements 
and external sales to AWS customers.26

Table of ContentsFulfillment
Fulfillment costs prim
arily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, physical stores,and customer service c
enters and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in fulfillment, AWS costsare primarily cl
assified as “Technology and content.” Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processingand related transac
tion costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the extent to which thirdparty sellers utili
ze Fulfillment by Amazon services, timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services providedby third parties, mix of produ
cts and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations andenhancements to our custom
er self-service features. Additionally, because payment processing costs associated with seller transactions are based on the grosspurchase price of underly
ing transactions, and payment processing and related transaction costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales, sales byour sellers have higher pay
ment processing costs as a percent of net sales.The 
increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2019 , compared to the prior ye ar, is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increasedproduct and service sales vo
lume and inventory levels and costs from expanding our fulfillment network, which includes physical stores.We seek to expand our fulfi
llment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes fromsales of our own products as well as sa
les by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.Technology and Content
Technology and content costs inc
lude payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products andservices, development, des
ign, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructurecosts. Infrastructure 
costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessaryto support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Coll
ectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services toour customers.
We seek to invest effi
ciently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our processefficiency through rap
id technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital spendingprojects often support a va
riety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expectspending in technology and content 
to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segmentsbased on usage. The 
increase  in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2019 , compared to the prior ye ar, is primarily due to an increase in spending ontechnology infrastructu
re and increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services andinitiatives to introdu
ce new products and service offerings. We expect technology and content costs to grow at a slower rate in 2020 due to an increase in theestimated useful li
fe of our servers, which will impact each of our segments. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 —Description of Business and Accounting Poli

ertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissionsrelated to AWS. We direc
t customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, third party customer referrals,social and online advert
ising, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates.To the extent there is in
creased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see acorresponding change in our ma
rketing costs.The 
increase in marketing costs in absolu te dollars in 2019 , compared to the prior ye ar, is primarily due to increased spending on marketing channels, as wellas payroll and related 
expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities.While costs associated wi
th Amazon Prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effectiveworldwide marketing tools, and in
tend to continue offering them indefinitely.27

Table of ContentsGeneral and Administrative
The 
increase in general and administ rative costs in absolute dollars in 2019 , compared to the prior ye ar, is primarily due to increases in payroll and relatedexpenses.
Other Operating Expense (Income), Net
Other operating expense (in
come), net was $296 million  and $201 million  during 2018  and 2019 , and is primarily rel ated to the amortization of intangibleassets.
Interest Income and Expense
Our interest income was 
$440 million  and $832 million  during 2018  and 2019 . We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds andinvestment grade short- 
to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on theprevailing rates, which va
ry depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested.Interest expense was 
$1.4 billion  and $1.6 billion  in 2018 and 2019 . The increase  is primarily rela ted to finance leases.Our long-term lease li
abilities were $9.7 billion  and $39.8 billion  as of December 31, 2018  and 2019 . Our long-term debt was $23.5 billion  and $23.4 billion as of 
December 31, 2018  and 2019 . See Item 8 of Part II, “Finan cial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 4 — Leases and Note 6 — Debt” for additionalinformation.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), ne
t was $(183) million  and $203 million  during 2018  and 2019 . The primary components of oth er income (expense), net are relatedto equity securities and wa
rrant valuations and foreign currency.Income Taxes
Our effective tax ra
te is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix ofjurisdictions to which they r
elate, intercompany transactions, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments,audit-related deve
lopments, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses),changes in statutes, regul
ations, case law, and administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework,competition, and other l
aws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized.Additionally, our effect
ive tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our ef
fective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower.We recorded a provision fo
r income taxes of $1.2 billion  and $2.4 billion  in 2018 and 2019 . Our provision for income taxes in 2019 was higher than in 2018primarily due to an inc
rease in U.S. pre-tax income, a decline in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, and the one-time provisional tax benefit of theU.S. Tax Act recognized in 2018.
Tax benefits relating 
to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our U.S. taxable income. The U.S.Tax Act enhanced and extended a
ccelerated depreciation deductions by allowing full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. As ofDecember 31, 2019
, we had approximately $1.7 billion  of federal tax credits pote ntially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits areprimarily relat
ed to the U.S. federal research and development credit.See Item 8 of Part II, “Finan
cial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 9 — Income Taxes” for additional information.Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measur
es, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our me
asures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet thedefinition of non-GAAP financial m
easures.We provide multiple m
easures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property andequipment with cash and through f
inance leases and financing obligations. We adopted new lease accounting guidance on January 1, 2019 without retrospectivelyadjusting prior periods. As a resu
lt, the line items used in our calculation of measures of free cash flows have changed. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statementsand Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Descr
iption of Business and Accounting Policies.”28

as of January 30, 2020 , and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materiallyaffected by many fac
tors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate ofgrowth of the Internet, onlin
e commerce, and cloud services, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.”First Quarter 2020 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $69.0 billion and $73.0 billion, or to grow between 16% and 22% compared with first quarter 2019. This guidanceanticipates a favor
able impact of approximately 5 basis points from foreign exchange rates.•
Operating income is expected to be between $3.0 billion and $4.2 billion, compared with $4.4 billion in first quarter 2019. This guidance includesapproximately $800 mill
ion lower depreciation expense due to an increase in the estimated useful life of our servers beginning on January 1, 2020.•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.31

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market ri
sk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments.Information relat
ing to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion andAnalysis of Financial Condition and Resul
ts of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.”Interest Rate Risk
Our exposure to market risk fo
r changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. Our long-term debt is carried atamortized cost and flu
ctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at afixed rate, will gener
ally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing ratesof interest. We gener
ally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Fixedincome securities may have t
heir fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securitiesthat have declined in m
arket value due to changes in interest rates.The following table provides in

$ 2,250 Based upon quoted market prices 
and Level 2 inputs, the fair value of our total debt was $27.8 billion  as of December 31, 2019 . Foreign Exchange Risk
During 
2019 , net sales from our Inte rnational segment accounted for 27%  of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from ourinternationally-fo
cused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in thefunctional currenci
es of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of ourintercompany balances 
associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, asforeign exchange rates v
ary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on theremeasurement of intercompany 
balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect theprior year, Internat
ional segment net sales decreased  by $2.4 billion in comparison with the prior y ear.We have foreign exchange 
risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance offoreign funds as of 
December 31, 2019 , of $15.3 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of$765 million
, $1.5 billion, and $3.1 billion . Fluctuations in fair valu e are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component ofstockholders’ equity.
 Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and aremeasured at fair va
lue with changes recognized in net income.We have foreign exchange 
risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as ofDecember 31, 2019
, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of $195 million , $385 million, and $775 million , recorded to “Other incom
e (expense), net.”See Item 7 of Part II, “Man
agement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Effect ofForeign Exchange Rates” for addi
tional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates.Equity Investment Risk
As of 
December 31, 2019 , our recorded value in equi ty and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was $3.3 billion . Our equity and equity warrant investmen
ts in publicly traded companies represent $679 million  of our investments as of December 31, 2019 , and are recorded at f air value, whichis subject to market price 
volatility. We perform a qualitative assessment for our equity investments in private companies to identify impairment. If this assessmentindicates that an imp
airment exists, we estimate the fair value of the investment and, if the fair value is less than carrying value, we write down the investment tofair value. Our assessment 
includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly availabledata. The current global
 economic climate provides additional uncertainty. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readilyavailable market d
ata. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.33

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the ac
companying consolidated balance sheets of Amazon.com, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2019  and 2018 , and the related consolidated statemen
ts of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019
 and the related notes (c ollectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly,in all material 
respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2019  and 2018 , and the results of its oper ations and its cash flows for each of thethree years in the per
iod ended December 31, 2019 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We also have audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’sinternal control over financial
 reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on criteria est ablished in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by theCommittee of Sponsoring Organiza
tions of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated January 30, 2020  expressed an unqualified opin ionthereon.
Adoption of New Accounting Standard
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidat
ed financial statements, the Company has changed its method for accounting for leases in 2019 due to the adoption ofASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financ
ial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’sconsolidated financia
l statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respectto the Company in accordance wi
th the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and thePCAOB.
We conducted our audits in a
ccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance about whet
her the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performingprocedures to assess the risks o
f material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures thatrespond to those risks. Such procedures 
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financialstatements. Our audits also 
included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overallpresentation of the consol
idated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated
 below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that wascommunicated or required to
 be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financialstatements and (2) involv
ed our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any wayour opinion on the consolidated f
inancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separateopinion on the critical 
audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Uncertain Tax Positions
Description of the Matter
The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions and, as discussed in Note 9 of the consolidatedfinancial statem
ents, during the ordinary course of business, there are many tax positions for which the ultimate tax determination isuncertain. As a result, signi
ficant judgment is required in evaluating the Company’s tax positions and determining its provision forincome taxes. The Company uses signi
ficant judgment in (1) determining whether a tax position’s technical merits are more likely thannot to be sustained and (2) me
asuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. As of December 31, 2019, the Companyaccrued liabilit
ies of $3.9 billion for various tax contingencies.Auditing the measurement o
f the Company’s tax contingencies was challenging because the evaluation of whether a tax position is morelikely than not to be sustain
ed and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significantjudgment, and is based on interp
retations of tax laws and legal rulings.35

Table of ContentsHow We Addressed the
Matter in Our Audit
We tested controls over the Company’s process to assess the technical merits of its tax contingencies, including controls over theassessment as to whether a t
ax position is more likely than not to be sustained, management’s process to measure the benefit of its taxpositions, and the development o
f the related disclosures.We involved our internat
ional tax, transfer pricing, and research and development tax professionals in assessing the technical merits ofcertain of the Company’s t
ax positions. Depending on the nature of the specific tax position and, as applicable, developments with therelevant tax authori
ties relating thereto, our procedures included obtaining and examining the Company’s analysis including theCompany’s correspondence with such t
ax authorities and evaluating the underlying facts upon which the tax positions are based. Weused our knowledge of, and experienc
e with, international, transfer pricing, and other income tax laws by the relevant income taxauthorities to evaluate the 
Company’s accounting for its tax contingencies. We evaluated developments in the applicable regulatoryenvironments to assess potent
ial effects on the Company’s positions. We analyzed the Company’s assumptions and data used todetermine the amount of tax
 benefits to recognize and tested the accuracy of the Company’s calculations. We have also evaluated theCompany’s income tax disclosur
es included in Note 9 in relation to these matters./s/ Ernst & Young LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNote 1 — DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS A
ND ACCOUNTING POLICIESDescription of Business
We seek to be Earth’s most 
customer-centric company. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers,developers, enterprises, 
and content creators. We serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We offerprograms that enable se
llers to sell their products in our stores and fulfill orders through us, and programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, skill and appdevelopers, and others to publish 
and sell content. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through our AWS segment, which offers a broad set of globalcompute, storage, databas
e, and other service offerings. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices. In addition, we provide services, such as advertising tosellers, vendors, publishers, and 
authors, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising.We have organized our oper
ations into three  segments: North America, In ternational, and AWS. See “Note 10 — Segment Information.”Prior Period Reclassifications
Certain prior period amoun
ts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation, including the addition of restricted cash to cash and cashequivalents on our consolidat
ed statements of cash flows and the reclassification of long-term capital lease obligations that existed at December 31, 2018  from “Other long-term liab
ilities” to “Long-term lease liabilities” within the consolidated balance sheets, as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance. See“Accounting Pronouncements Recent
ly Adopted.”Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financi
al statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities (collectively, the “Company”), consisting of itswholly-owned subsidiaries and those en
tities in which we have a variable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in Indiaand certain entities that su
pport our seller lending financing activities. Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated. Thefinancial results of 
Whole Foods Market, Inc. (“Whole Foods Market”) have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition onAugust 28, 2017.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of finan
cial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets andliabilities, revenu
es and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates areused for, but not limited to, 
income taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-basedcompensation forfeitu
re rates, vendor funding, and inventory valuation. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. For example, in Q4 2019 wecompleted a useful li
fe study for our servers and are increasing the useful life from three years  to four years for servers in January 2020, which, bas ed on serversthat are included in “Prop
erty and equipment, net” as of December 31, 2019, will have an anticipated impact to our 2020 operating income of $2.3 billion . Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per share is 
calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common sh
ares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a netloss, stock awards are excluded 
from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect.42

Table of ContentsThe following table shows the cal
culation of diluted shares (in millions):

ic earnings per share480  487  494 Total dilutive effe
ct of outstanding stock awards13  13  10 Shares used in computation of di
luted earnings per share493  500  504 Revenue
Revenue is measured based on the 
amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by estimates for return allowances, promotional discounts, andrebates. Revenue also exclud
es any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have multipleperformance obligations, t
he transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We generally determinestand-alone selling pri
ces based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin.A description of our principa
l revenue generating activities is as follows:Retail sales
 - We offer consumer produ cts through our online and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to thecustomer, which generally o
ccurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.Third-party seller services
 - We offer programs th at enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us. We are not the seller ofrecord in these transa
ctions. The commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services arerendered, which generally o
ccurs upon delivery of the related products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.Subscription services
 - Our subscription sales includ e fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to content including audiobooks, digitalvideo, digital music, e-books, 
and other non-AWS subscription services. Prime memberships provide our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefitsthat represent a singl
e stand-ready obligation. Subscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from such arrangements isrecognized over the subscr
iption period.AWS
 - Our AWS arrangements include g lobal sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is allocated to services using stand-aloneselling prices and is pri
marily recognized when the customer uses these services, based on the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacitydelivered on-demand. Cert
ain services, including compute and database, are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognizedratably. Sales commissions we p
ay in connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term.Other
 - Other revenue primar ily includes sales of advertising services, which are recognized as ads are delivered based on the number of clicks orimpressions.
Return Allowances
Return allowances, which reduce 
revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience. Liabilities for return allowances are included in“Accrued expenses and other” 
and were $468 million , $623 million, and $712 million  as of December 31, 2017 , 2018, and 2019 . Additions to the allowance were $1.8 billion
, $2.3 billion, and $2.5 billion  and deductions from the al lowance were $1.9 billion , $2.3 billion, and $2.5 billion  in 2017, 2018, and 2019 . Included in “Inventories” on our consolid
ated balance sheets are assets totaling $406 million , $519 million, and $629 million  as of December 31, 2017 , 2018, and 2019 , for the rights to recover products 
from customers associated with our liabilities for return allowances.Cost of Sales
Cost of sales primarily cons
ists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation anddelivery centers and wher
e we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music.Shipping costs to receive produc
ts from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers.Payment processing and rela
ted transaction costs, including those associated with seller transactions, are classified in “Fulfillment” on our consolidated statementsof operations.
43

Table of ContentsVendor Agreements
We have agreements with ou
r vendors to receive funds primarily for cooperative marketing efforts, promotions, incentives, and volume rebates. We generallyconsider these amounts re
ceived from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and arerecorded as a reduction o
f the cost of inventory, cost of services, or cost of property and equipment. Volume rebates typically depend on reaching minimumpurchase thresholds. We eva
luate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When volume rebates can bereasonably estimated, we 
record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold.Fulfillment
Fulfillment costs prim
arily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International segments’ fulfillment centers,physical stores, and custome
r service centers, including costs attributable to buying, receiving, inspecting, and warehousing inventories; picking, packaging, andpreparing customer orde
rs for shipment; payment processing and related transaction costs, including costs associated with our guarantee for certain sellertransactions; responding to 
inquiries from customers; and supply chain management for our manufactured electronic devices. Fulfillment costs also includeamounts paid to third part
ies that assist us in fulfillment and customer service operations.Technology and Content
Technology and content costs inc
lude payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products andservices, development, des
ign, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructurecosts. Infrastructure 
costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessaryto support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Coll
ectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services toour customers. Technology and cont
ent costs are generally expensed as incurred.Marketing
Marketing costs primar
ily consist of advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including salescommissions related to 
AWS. We pay commissions to third parties when their customer referrals result in sales. We also participate in cooperative advertisingarrangements with cer
tain of our vendors, and other third parties.Advertising and other promotion
al costs to market our products and services are expensed as incurred and were $6.3 billion , $8.2 billion, and $11.0 billion  in 2017
, 2018, and 2019 . General and Administrative
General and administra
tive expenses primarily consist of costs for corporate functions, including payroll and related expenses; facilities and equipmentexpenses, such as depreciat
ion and amortization expense and rent; and professional fees and litigation costs.Stock-Based Compensation
Compensation cost for all sto
ck awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the service period. The fair valueof restricted stock uni
ts is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense overthe service period, net 
of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment,and to the extent actual re
sults or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the periodestimates are revised. We con
sider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including historical forfeiture experience and employee level.Other Operating Expense (Income), Net
Other operating expen
se (income), net, consists primarily of marketing-related, contract-based, and customer-related intangible asset amortization expense,and expenses related to l
egal settlements.44

Table of ContentsOther Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), ne
t, consists primarily of adjustments to and gains on equity securities of $18 million , $145 million, and $231 million  in 2017, 2018
, and 2019 , equity warrant valuation g ains (losses) of $109 million , $(131) million, and $11 million  in 2017, 2018, and 2019 , and foreign currency gains (losses) of 
$247 million , $(206) million, and $(20) million  in 2017, 2018, and 2019 . Income Taxes
Income tax expense includ
es U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings are subject to U.S. taxation under the U.S.Tax Act, which also repeals U.S. taxat
ion on the subsequent repatriation of those earnings. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings,as well as our capital in ou
r foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs uponrepatriation of such a
mounts.Deferred income tax balances
 reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and arestated at enacted tax rates ex
pected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.Deferred tax assets are eval
uated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We considermany factors when assessing the 
likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative loss experience and expectations offuture earnings, capit
al gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.We utilize a two-step 
approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the tax positionfor recognition by deter
mining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution ofrelated appeals or l
itigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized uponultimate settle
ment. We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments andwhich may not accurately 
forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense.Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair value is defined as th
e price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants atthe measurement date. To i
ncrease the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used tomeasure fair value:
Level 1 — 
Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.Level 2 — 
Valuations based on observable inpu ts other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilitiesin active markets, quoted
 prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can becorroborated by observable 
market data.Level 3 — 
Valuations based on unobservable inpu ts reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by othermarket participan
ts. These valuations require significant judgment.For our cash, cash equivalents, or 
marketable securities, we measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based onquoted prices in active mar
kets for identical assets or liabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactivemarkets or based on quoted ma
rket prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did nothold significant amount
s of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, or marketable securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2018  and 2019 . We hold equity warrants giving us 
the right to acquire stock of other companies. As of December 31, 2018  and 2019 , these warrants had a fai r value of $440 million
 and $669 million , and are recorded within “Oth er assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. These assets are primarily classified as Level 2 assets.Cash and Cash Equivalents
We classify all highly 
liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.45

Table of ContentsInventories
Inventories, consisting of produ
cts available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost andnet realizable va
lue. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such asthrough sales to individual cus
tomers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category.We provide Fulfillment by Am
azon services in connection with certain of our sellers’ programs. Third-party sellers maintain ownership of their inventory,regardless of whether ful
fillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and therefore these products are not included in our inventories.We also purchase electronic 
device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for ourproducts. During the normal cours
e of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements withcontract manufacturers and s
uppliers for certain electronic device components. A portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreementsconsists of firm, non-canc
ellable commitments. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incuradditional costs. We also h
ave firm, non-cancellable commitments for certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores.Accounts Receivable, Net and Other
Included in “Accounts rece
ivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to customers, vendors, and sellers. As ofDecember 31, 2018
 and 2019 , customer receivabl es, net, were $9.4 billion  and $12.6 billion , vendor receivables, net, we re $3.2 billion  and $4.2 billion , and seller receivables, net, were 
$710 million  and $863 million . Seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which provides fundingto sellers primari
ly to procure inventory.We estimate losses on r
eceivables based on known troubled accounts and historical experience of losses incurred. Receivables are considered impaired andwritten-off when it is probab
le that all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The allowance for doubtfulaccounts was 
$348 million , $495 million, and $718 million  as of December 31, 2017 , 2018, and 2019 . Additions to the allowance were $626 million , $878 million, and 
$1.0 billion, and deductions to the allowanc e were $515 million , $731 million, and $793 million  in 2017, 2018, and 2019 . Software Development Costs
We incur software develop
ment costs related to products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, internal-use software, and our websites. Softwaredevelopment costs capit
alized were not significant for the years presented. All other costs, including those related to design or maintenance, are expensed asincurred.
Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipme
nt are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Incentives that we receive from property and equipment vendorsare recorded as a redu
ction in our costs. Property includes buildings and land that we own, along with property we have acquired under build-to-suit leasearrangements when we have cont
rol over the building during the construction period and finance lease arrangements. Equipment includes assets such as serversand networking equipment, heavy equ
ipment, and other fulfillment equipment. Depreciation and amortization  is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimateduseful lives of the assets
 (generally the lesser of 40 years  or the remaining lif e of the underlying building, three years  for our servers, five years  for networking equipment, 
ten years  for heavy equipment, and three  to seven years for other fulfillm ent equipment). Depreciation and amortization expense is classified within thecorresponding operating expens
e categories on our consolidated statements of operations.Leases
We categorize leases with co
ntractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. Finance leases are generally those leases that allow usto substantially utili
ze or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life. Assets acquired under finance leases are recorded in property and equipment, net. All otherleases are categor
ized as operating leases. Our leases generally have terms that range from one  to ten years for equipment and one  to twenty years for property. Certain lease contra
cts include obligations to pay for other services, such as operations and maintenance. For leases of property, we account for these otherservices as a component of 
the lease. For substantially all other leases, the services are accounted for separately and we allocate payments to the lease and otherservices components based on es
timated stand-alone prices.46

Table of ContentsLease liabilities are recognized at
 the present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives using a discount rate based on similarlysecured borrowings availabl
e to us. Lease assets are recognized based on the initial present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives, plusany direct costs from exec
uting the leases or lease prepayments reclassified from “Other assets” upon lease commencement. Leasehold improvements arecapitalized at cost and amortized
 over the lesser of their expected useful life or the lease term.When we have the o
ption to extend the lease term, terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, or purchase the leased asset, and it is reasonablycertain that we will ex
ercise the option, we consider these options in determining the classification and measurement of the lease. Our leases may include variablepayments based on measures th
at include changes in price indices, market interest rates, or the level of sales at a physical store, which are expensed as incurred.Costs associated with operating 
lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease. Finance lease assetsare amortized within op
erating expenses on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or, in the instance where title does nottransfer at the end of the
 lease term, the lease term. The interest component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the effectiveinterest method over th
e lease term.We establish assets and
 liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Suchassets are depreciated over t
he lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs.Financing Obligations
We record assets and li
abilities for estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during theconstruction period. If we con
tinue to control the building after the construction period, the arrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a lease.The building is depreciat
ed over the shorter of its useful life or the term of the obligation.If we do not control the building 
after the construction period ends, the assets and liabilities for construction costs are derecognized, and we classify the leaseas either operating or 
finance.Goodwill
We evaluate goodwill for 
impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not berecoverable. In test
ing goodwill for impairment, we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value ofa reporting unit is less th
an its carrying amount. If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform a two-stepimpairment test. We test goo
dwill for impairment under the two-step impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of thereporting units. If the f
air value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, asecond step is performe
d to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimatethe fair value of the 
reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operatingexpenses, based primarily on 
expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions.We completed the requ
ired annual testing of goodwill for impairment for all reporting units as of April 1, 2019 , and determined that goodwil l is no t impairedas the fair value of our 
reporting units substantially exceeded their book value. There were no events that caused us to update our annual impairment test. See“Note 5 — Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Acquired In
tangible Assets.”Other Assets
Included in “Other as
sets” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to acquired intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization;video and music conte
nt, net of accumulated amortization; long-term deferred tax assets; certain equity investments; marketable securities restricted for longer thanone year, the majority of
 which are attributable to collateralization of bank guarantees and debt related to our international operations; lease prepayments madeprior to lease commencement; an
d equity warrant assets.Digital Video and Music Content
We obtain video content, in
clusive of episodic television and movies, and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide rangeof licensing provisions includ
ing both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the license fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonablyestimable and the cont
ent is available to us, we recognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as payments aremade and we
47

Table of Contentsamortize the asset 
to “Cost of sales” on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line basis. If the licensing fee is notdeterminable or re
asonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred. We also develop original video content forwhich the production costs are 
capitalized and amortized to “Cost of sales” predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the viewing patterns associated withthe content. The weighted ave
rage remaining life of our capitalized video content is 2.7 years . Our produced and licensed video con
tent is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each major geography where we offerAmazon Prime membership
s. These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is lessthan the carrying value. Th
e total capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2018  and 2019  were $3.8 billion and 
$5.8 billion. Total video and music expense was $6.7 billion  and $7.8 billion  for the year ended December 31, 2018  and 2019 . Total video and music expense includes licensing and produc
tion costs associated with content offered within Amazon Prime memberships, and costs associated with digital subscriptions andsold or rented content.
Investments
We generally invest our 
excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Suchinvestments are included i
n “Cash and cash equivalents” or “Marketable securities” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Marketable debt securitiesare classified as available-for-sale a
nd reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).”Equity investments are a
ccounted for using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence, but notcontrol, over an investee. Equ
ity-method investments are included within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. Our share of the earnings or losses asreported by equity-method 
investees, amortization of basis differences, and related gains or losses, if any, are classified as “Equity- method investment activity, netof tax” on our consolidated st
atements of operations.Equity investments without re
adily determinable fair values and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for atcost with adjustments for obse
rvable changes in prices or impairments and are classified as “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets with adjustmentsrecognized in “Other inco
me (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2018 and 2019, these investments had a carryingvalue of 
$282 million  and $1.5 billion . Equity investments that
 have readily determinable fair values are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fairvalue with changes recogniz
ed in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statement of operations.We periodically evaluate whet
her declines in fair values of our investments indicate impairment. For debt securities and equity-method investments, we alsoevaluate whether decl
ines in fair value of our investments below their book value are other-than-temporary. This evaluation consists of several qualitative andquantitative facto
rs regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted recoveryoccurs. Additionally, we assess whethe
r we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell any investment before recovery ofits amortized cost basis.
 Factors considered include: quoted market prices; recent financial results and operating trends; implied values from any recent transactionsor offers of investee sec
urities; credit quality of debt instrument issuers; other publicly available information that may affect the value of our investments; durationand severity of the decl
ine in value; and our strategy and intentions for holding the investment.Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, other than goodwi
ll, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of theassets might not be recove
rable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of anasset, a significant ch
ange in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount ofan asset or group of assets may no
t be recoverable.For long-lived assets used in oper
ations, including lease assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable throughits undiscounted, probability
-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fairvalue. Long-lived assets ar
e considered held for sale when certain criteria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset, the assetis available for sal
e in its immediate condition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of costor fair value less costs 
to sell. Assets held for sale were not significant as of December 31, 2018  and 2019 . 48

Table of ContentsAccrued Expenses and Other
Included in “Accrued e
xpenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to leases and asset retirement obligations,payroll and related exp
enses, unredeemed gift cards, customer liabilities, current debt, acquired digital media content, and other operating expenses.As of 
December 31, 2018  and 2019 , our liabilities for payr oll related expenses were $3.4 billion  and $4.3 billion  and our liabilities fo r unredeemed gift cardswere 
$2.8 billion  and $3.3 billion . We reduce the liabi lity for a gift card when redeemed by a customer. The portion of gift cards that we do not expect to beredeemed is recogniz
ed based on customer usage patterns.Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue is record
ed when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service period.Unearned revenue primar
ily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2018  was $7.9 billion
, of which $6.3 billion  was recognized as revenue dur ing the year ended December 31, 2019  and our total unearned rev enue as of December 31, 2019 was 
$10.2 billion. Included in “Other long-te rm liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets was $1.4 billion  and $2.0 billion  of unearned revenue as of December 31, 2018
 and 2019 . Additionally, we have perform
ance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that havenot yet been recognized in ou
r financial statements. For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were $29.8 billion
 as of December 31, 2019 . The weighted average rem aining life of our long-term contracts is 3.3 years . However, the amount and timing of revenuerecognition is largely d
riven by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term.Other Long-Term Liabilities
Included in “Other lo
ng-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to deferred tax liabilities, financing obligations,asset retirement ob
ligations, tax contingencies, and digital video and music content.Foreign Currency
We have internationa
lly-focused stores for which the net sales generated, as well as most of the related expenses directly incurred from those operations, aredenominated in local fun
ctional currencies. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these stores is generally the same as the localcurrency. Assets and liabil
ities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at period-end foreign exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translatedat average rates pr
evailing throughout the period. Translation adjustments are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separatecomponent of stockholders’ equ
ity, and in the “Foreign currency effect on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash,” on our consolidated statements of cashflows. Transaction gains and losses 
including intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved areincluded in “Other income 
(expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the settlement and remeasurement of intercompanybalances, we recorded gains 
(losses) of $202 million , $(186) million, and $95 million  in 2017, 2018, and 2019 . Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting St
andards Board (“FASB”) issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) amending revenue recognition guidanceand requiring more deta
iled disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flowsarising from contrac
ts with customers. We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2018 for all revenue contracts with our customers using the modified retrospectiveapproach and increased r
etained earnings by approximately $650 million . The adjustment primar ily relates to the unredeemed portion of our gift cards, which arenow recognized over the expec
ted customer usage period rather than waiting until gift cards expire or when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote. Wechanged the recognition and 
classification of Amazon Prime memberships, which are now accounted for as a single performance obligation and recognized ratablyover the membership per
iod as service sales. Previously, Prime memberships were considered to be arrangements with multiple deliverables and were allocatedamong product sales and servi
ce sales. Other changes relate primarily to the presentation of revenue. Certain advertising services are now classified as revenuerather than a reduct
ion in cost of sales, and sales of apps, in-app content, and certain digital media content are presented on a net basis. Prior year amounts have notbeen adjusted and continue to b
e reported in accordance with our historic accounting policy.The impact of applying this ASU for th
e year ended December 31, 2018 primarily resulted in a decrease in product sales and an increase in service salesdriven by the reclassificatio
n of Prime membership fees of approximately $3.8 billion . Service sales also incr eased by approximately $3.0 billion  for the year ended December 31, 2018
 due to the reclassification of certain advertising services.49

Table of ContentsIn January 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that updates cert
ain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.Under this ASU, certain equity invest
ments are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 with no materialimpact to our consolidate
d financial statements.In February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the account
ing for leases, primarily requiring the recognition of lease assets and liabilities foroperating leases with te
rms of more than twelve months on our consolidated balance sheets. Under the new guidance, leases previously described as capital leaseobligations and finance l
ease obligations are now referred to as finance leases and financing obligations, respectively. We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2019 byrecording an immate
rial cumulative adjustment to retained earnings rather than retrospectively adjusting prior periods. Prior period amounts were not adjusted andcontinue to be reported in 
accordance with our historic accounting policies resulting in a balance sheet presentation that is not comparable to the prior period in thefirst year of adoption. The 
adoption of this ASU resulted in the recognition of operating lease assets and liabilities of approximately $21 billion , which included the reclassification o
f finance lease obligations to operating leases of $1.2 billion . As of December 31, 2018, amounts rela ted to finance lease obligations andconstruction liabilities totaled 
$9.6 billion , of which $1.5 billion  was derecognized for buildings that we do not control during the construction period and $5.4 billion
 and $1.5 billion  were reclassified to finance  leases and operating leases, respectively.In October 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the account
ing for income taxes. The new guidance requires the recognition of the income taxconsequences of an interco
mpany asset transfer, other than transfers of inventory, when the transfer occurs. For intercompany transfers of inventory, the incometax effects will cont
inue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 with an increase of approximately $250 million
 to retained earnings and d eferred tax assets net of valuation allowances.In November 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the present
ation of restricted cash within the consolidated statements of cash flows. The newguidance requires that 
restricted cash be added to cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statements of cash flows. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 on aretrospective basis with 
the following impacts to our consolidated statements of cash flows (in millions):Year Ended December 31, 2017

lents, and restricted cash$ 475  $734  $1,209 In March 2019, the FASB issued an ASU amending the account
ing for film costs, inclusive of episodic television and movie costs. The new guidance alignsthe accounting for product
ion costs of episodic television with that of movies by requiring production costs to be capitalized. Previously, we only capitalized aportion of the production costs 
related to our produced episodic television content. We adopted this ASU as of January 1, 2019 and began capitalizing substantiallyall of our production costs. Adoption o
f this ASU resulted in approximately $1.0 billion  of incremental capitalized film cost s classified in “Other Assets” as ofDecember 31, 2019

Pledged Assets
As of 
December 31, 2018  and 2019 , we have pledged or otherwise res tricted $575 million  and $994 million  of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketablesecurities, and cert
ain property and equipment as collateral for real estate leases, amounts due to third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby andtrade letters of c
redit. Additionally, we have pledged our cash and seller receivables for debt related to our Credit Facility. See “Note 6 — Debt.”Suppliers
During 
2019 , no vendor accounted for 10% or mo re of our purchases. We generally do not have long-term contracts or arrangements with our vendors toguarantee the availability of merc
handise, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits.Other Contingencies
In 2016, we determined that we pro
cessed and delivered orders of consumer products for certain individuals and entities located outside Iran covered by theIran Threat Reduction and Syri
a Human Rights Act or other United States sanctions and export control laws. The consumer products included books, music, othermedia, apparel, home and k
itchen, health and beauty, jewelry, office, consumer electronics, software, lawn and patio, grocery, and automotive products. Ourreview is ongoing and we have voluntar
ily reported these orders to the United States Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and the United StatesDepartment of Commerce
’s Bureau of Industry and Security. We intend to cooperate fully with OFAC and BIS with respect to their review, which may result inthe imposition of penalt
ies. For additional information, see Item 9B of Part II, “Other Information — Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act.”We are subject to cl
aims related to various indirect taxes (such as sales, value added, consumption, service, and similar taxes), including in jurisdictions inwhich we already collect 
and remit such taxes. If the relevant taxing authorities were successfully to pursue these claims, we could be subject to significantadditional tax liabi
lities. For example, in June 2017, the State of South Carolina issued an assessment for uncollected sales and use taxes for the period fromJanuary 2016 to March 2016, including in
terest and penalties. South Carolina is alleging that we should have collected sales and use taxes on59

Table of Contentstransactions by our third-p
arty sellers. In September 2019, the South Carolina Administrative Law Court ruled in favor of the Department of Revenue and we haveappealed the decision to 
the state Court of Appeals. We believe the assessment is without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If othertax authorities were suc
cessfully to seek additional adjustments of a similar nature, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities.Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved from tim
e to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the following:Beginning in August 2013, a number of compla
ints were filed alleging, among other things, that Amazon.com, Inc. and several of its subsidiaries failed tocompensate hourly workers for 
time spent waiting in security lines and otherwise violated federal and state wage and hour statutes and common law. In August2013, Busk v. Integrity Staffing Solutions, In

fied amount of damages, interest, injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees. We have been named in several other similar cases. In December2014, the Supreme Court ruled in Busk that 
time spent waiting for and undergoing security screening is not compensable working time under the federal wage andhour statute. In February 2015, the 
courts in those actions alleging only federal law claims entered stipulated orders dismissing those actions without prejudice. InMarch 2016, the United States Distr
ict Court for the Western District of Kentucky dismissed the Vance case with prejudice. In April 2016, the plaintiffs appealedthe district court’s 
judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In March 2017, the court of appeals affirmed the district court’sdecision. In June 2017, the United Stat

In 
2017, 2018, and 2019 , we recorded net tax provisions o f $769 million , $1.2 billion, and $2.4 billion . Tax benefits relating to excess stock-basedcompensation deductions and a
ccelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our U.S. taxable income. Cash taxes paid, net of refunds, were $957 million , $1.2billion
, and $881 million  for 2017, 2018, and 2019 . The U.S. Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The U.S. Tax Act s
ignificantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things,lowering the statutory corpo
rate tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminating certain deductions, imposing a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreignsubsidiaries, introducing new t
ax regimes, and changing how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. The U.S. Tax Act also enhanced and extended accelerateddepreciation deductions by 
allowing full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. We reasonably estimated the effects of the U.S. TaxAct and recorded provisional 
amounts in our financial statements as of December 31, 2017. We recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the U.S. TaxAct of approximately 
$789 million . This amount wa s primarily comprised of the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the permanentreduction in the U.S. statutory co
rporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, after taking into account the mandatory one-time tax on the accumulated earnings of ourforeign subsidiaries. The a
mount of this one-time tax was not material. In 2018, we completed our determination of the accounting implications of the U.S. TaxAct.

The U.S. Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal statutory rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018.(2)
Includes non-deductible stock-based compensation and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Our tax provision includes $1.3 billion , $1.6billion
, and $1.4 billion  of excess tax benefits f rom stock-based compensation for 2017 , 2018, and 2019 . Our provision for income taxes 
in 2018 was higher than in 2017 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income and the one-time provisional tax benefitof the U.S. Tax Act recognized in 2017. This was pa
rtially offset by the reduction to the U.S. federal statutory tax rate in 2018, a decline in the proportion offoreign losses for which we may not 
realize a tax benefit and an increase in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.We regularly assess whethe
r it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate. Inperforming this assessmen
t with respect to each jurisdiction, we review all available evidence, including recent cumulative loss experience and expectations offuture earnings, capit
al gains, and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. InQ2 2017, we

We are subject to inco
me taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our taxpositions and determining our p
rovision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which theultimate tax determination is u
ncertain. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxeswill be due. These reserves a
re established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fullysupportable. We adjust thes
e reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits. The provision for income taxes includes theimpact of reserve prov
isions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.65

As of December 31, 2019 , we had approximately $3.9 billion  of accrued tax contingen cies of which $2.1 billion , if fully recognized, would de crease oureffective tax rate.
As of 
December 31, 2018  and 2019 , we had accrued intere st and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, related to tax contingencies of $127 million  and $131 million
. Interest and penalti es, net of federal income tax benefit, recognized for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2018, and 2019  was $40 million , $20million
, and $4 million . We are under examina
tion, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the calendar year 2007 and thereafter. These examinations may lead 
to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination aswell as subsequent periods.
In October 2014, the European Commission op
ened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard tothe corporate income 
tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that d
eterminations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on that decision theEuropean Commission announced an est
imated recovery amount of approximately €250 million , plus interest, for the pe riod May 2006 through June 2014, andordered Luxembourg tax author
ities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg computed an initial recovery amount,consistent with the European Comm
ission’s decision, that we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. InDecember 2017, Luxembourg appeal
ed the European Commission’s decision. In May 2018, we appealed. We believe the European Commission’s decision to bewithout merit and will cont
inue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictionsincluding China, Germany, India, Jap
an, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. We are under, or may be subj ect to, audit or examination and additionalassessments by the rele
vant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2009  and thereafter. Changes in state, federal, 
and foreign tax laws may increase our tax contingencies. The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highlyuncertain, and the amounts u
ltimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It isreasonably possible that with
in the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income taxexaminations in one or mor
e jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on tax filings in yearsthrough 
2019 . The actual amount of any ch ange could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements. We cannot currentlyprovide an estimate of 
the range of possible outcomes.Note 10 — SEGMENT INFORMATION
We have organized our oper
ations into three  segments: North America, In ternational, and AWS. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses“Fulfillment,” “Techno
logy and content,” “Marketing,” and “General and administrative” based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which thecosts are incurred. The m
ajority of technology infrastructure costs are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. The majority of the remaining non-infrastructure te
chnology costs are incurred in the U.S. and are allocated to our North America segment. There are no internal revenue transactions between ourreportable segments. Thes
e segments reflect the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the Company’s business performance and manages itsoperations.

Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We carried out an eva

fficer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined inRule 13a-15(e) of the 1934 Act, as of

at, as of December 31, 2019 , our internal control ove r financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding thereliability of financial reporting
 and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.Ernst & Young has independently assessed 
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and its report is included below.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our int
ernal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2019  that materially affected, or are reas onablylikely to materially affect, our i
nternal control over financial reporting.Limitations on Controls
Our disclosure controls and proc
edures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving theirobjectives as specifi
ed above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reportingwill prevent or detect 
all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide onlyreasonable, not absolute, assu
rance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to erroror fraud will not occur or th
at all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.71

Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on criteria est ablished in Internal Control —Integrated Framework issued by 
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion,Amazon.com, Inc. (the
 Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidatedbalance sheets of the Company 
as of December 31, 2019  and 2018 , and the related consolid ated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’equity, and cash flows for each o
f the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019  and the related notes and ou r report dated January 30, 2020  expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s mana
gement is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness ofinternal control over 
financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is toexpress an opinion on the Company’s int
ernal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB andare required to be indep
endent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of theSecurities and Exchange Commiss
ion and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in a
ccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance about whet
her effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audit included obtaining an und
erstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing andevaluating the design and ope
rating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessaryin the circumstances. 
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over F
inancial ReportingA company’s internal c
ontrol over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reportingand the preparation of f
inancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control overfinancial reporting includes
 those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions and dispositions o
f the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation offinancial statements in accordance
 with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only inaccordance with authori
zations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, us
e, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent l
imitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to futu
re periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLP
