ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Founded in 1982, Adobe Systems Incorporated is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world. 
We offer a line of products and services used by creative professionals, marketers, knowledge workers, application developers, 
enterprises and consumers for creating, managing, delivering, measuring, optimizing and engaging with compelling content and 
experiences across multiple operating systems, devices and media. We market and license our products and services directly to 
enterprise customers through our sales force and to end users through app stores and our own website at www .adobe.com. We 
offer many of our products via a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) model or a managed services model (both of which are referred 
to as a hosted or cloud-based model) as well as through term subscription and pay-per -use models. We also distribute certain 
products and services through a network of distributors, value-added resellers (“VARs”), systems integrators (“SIs”), independent 
software vendors (“ISVs”), retailers, software developers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). In addition, we license 
our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions. Our 
products run on personal and server -based computers, as well as on smartphones, tablets and other devices, depending on the 
product. We have operations in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia-Pacific (“AP AC”). See Note 
18 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further geographical information.

BUSINESS OVER VIEW
 
For over 30 years, Adobe’ s innovations have transformed how individuals, businesses and governments interact. Across 
these markets, we help our customers create and deliver the most compelling experiences in a streamlined workflow , and optimize 
those experiences for greater return on investment. Our solutions turn ordinary interactions into valuable digital experiences, across 
media and devices, anywhere, anytime.
While we continue to offer a broad portfolio of products and solutions, we focus our investments in two strategic growth 
areas:
Digital Media —providing tools, services and solutions that enable individuals, small and medium businesses and enterprises 
to create, publish and promote their content anywhere. Our customers include content creators, web designers, app developers 
and digital media professionals, as well as management in marketing departments and agencies, companies and publishers. Our 
customers also include knowledge workers who create, collaborate and distribute documents. This is the core of what we have 
delivered for over 25 years, and we have evolved our business model rapidly to provide these customers with a more complete 
and integrated workflow across the variety of new devices, formats and business models that continue to emer ge.
Digital Marketing —providing solutions and services for creating, managing, executing, measuring and optimizing digital 
advertising and marketing campaigns across multiple channels. Our customers include marketers, advertisers, agencies, publishers, 
merchandisers, web analysts, marketing executives, information management executives, product development executives, and 
4sales and support executives. We process over forty trillion data transactions a year via our SaaS products, providing our customers 
with analytics, social, targeting, media optimization, digital experience management, cross-channel campaign management, 
audience management and video solutions. This complements our digital media franchise, bringing together the art of creating 
and managing content with the science of measuring and optimizing it, enabling our customers to achieve their optimal business 
outcomes.
We believe we are uniquely positioned to be a leader in both the Digital Media and Digital Marketing categories, where 
our mission is to change the world through digital experiences. By integrating products from each of these two areas of Adobe’ s 
business, our customers are able to utilize a comprehensive suite of solutions and services that no other entity currently offers. In 
addition, our ability to deliver innovation and productivity improvements across customer workflows involving the creation, 
management, delivery , measurement and optimization of rich and engaging content favorably positions Adobe as our customers 
invest more to engage their constituents digitally .
SEGMENTS
Our business is organized into three reportable segments: Digital Media, Digital Marketing and Print and Publishing. These 
segments provide Adobe’ s senior management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. Our segments are 
aligned around the company’ s two strategic growth opportunities described above, placing our Print and Publishing business in a 
third segment that contains many of our mature products and solutions.
This overview provides an explanation of our markets and a discussion of strategic opportunities in fiscal 2016  and beyond 
for each of our segments.  See “Results of Operations” within Part II, Item 7 titled “Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations”  and Note 18 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further segment 
information.
PRODUCTS AND SER VICES OVER VIEW
Digital Media
Digital Media Opportunity
Recent trends in digital communications continue to provide a significant market opportunity for Adobe in digital media. 
Due to the increase in mobile computing, rich media consumed in digital environments and the rise of online social communities, 
the demand for digital media solutions to create engaging online experiences is higher than ever. Adobe is in a unique position to 
capitalize on this opportunity by delivering rapid innovation to increase our customer reach, deepen engagement with communities 
and accelerate long-term revenue growth by focusing on cloud-based offerings, which are licensed on a subscription basis.
The flagship of our Digital Media business is Creative Cloud—a subscription service that allows members to download 
and install the latest versions of our creative products such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator , Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe 
Photoshop Lightroom and Adobe InDesign. Creative Cloud members can also access a growing marketplace of digital content 
through Adobe Stock, a leading online marketplace for photos, graphics and videos. Creative Cloud also offers members access 
to online services to sync, store, and share files, participate in our Behance community of more than five million creative 
professionals, publish and deliver digital content via app stores, develop mobile apps, and create and manage websites. Adobe is 
redefining the creative process with Creative Cloud so that our customers can obtain everything they need to create, collaborate 
and deliver engaging digital content.
Creative Cloud addresses the needs of creative professionals including graphic designers, production artists, web designers 
and developers, user interface designers, videographers, motion graphic artists, prepress professionals, video game developers, 
mobile application developers, students and administrators. They rely on our solutions for publishing, web design and development, 
video and animation production, mobile app and gaming development and document creation and collaboration. End users of our 
creative tools work in businesses ranging from large publishers, media companies and global enterprises, to smaller design agencies, 
small and medium-sized businesses and individual freelancers. Moreover , our creative products are used to create much of the 
printed and online information people see, read and interact with every day, including video, animation, mobile and advertising 
content. Knowledge workers, educators, hobbyists and consumers also use our products to create and deliver creative content.
In addition to Creative Cloud, our Digital Media business offers many of the products included in Creative Cloud on a 
standalone basis, including subscriptions to the Creative Cloud version of certain point products, and also offers a range of other 
creative tools and services, including our hobbyist products such as Adobe Photoshop Elements and Adobe Premiere Elements, 
Adobe Digital Publishing Solution (formerly Adobe Digital Publishing Suite), Adobe Typekit and mobile apps such as Adobe 
Photoshop Mix, Adobe Photoshop Sketch, Adobe Photoshop Fix and Adobe Premiere Clip that run on tablets and mobile devices. 
Further descriptions of our Digital Media products are included below under “Principal Products and Services”.
5Adobe’ s Digital Media segment also includes our Document Cloud business, built around our Acrobat family of products, 
the Adobe Acrobat Reader and a set of integrated cloud-based document services. For over twenty years, Adobe Acrobat has 
provided for the reliable creation and exchange of electronic documents, regardless of platform or application source type. Users 
can collaborate on documents with electronic comments and tailor the security of a file in order to distribute reliable Adobe PDF 
documents that can be viewed, printed or filled out utilizing our free Adobe Acrobat Reader . Acrobat provides essential electronic 
document capabilities and services to help knowledge workers accomplish a wide range of tasks ranging from simple publications 
and forms to mission-critical engineering documentation and architectural plans. With our Acrobat product and its innovative 
cloud services, we have extended the capabilities of our solution. Users can take advantage of electronic document signing with 
Adobe eSign (formerly EchoSign) and manage, track and control documents through Adobe Send & Track.
Digital Media Strategy
Our goal is to be the leading provider of tools and services that allow individuals, small and medium businesses and 
enterprises to create, publish and monetize their content anywhere.
Creative Cloud, a subscription service with competitive monthly pricing, is attractive to users of older versions of our 
products who desire to use our latest releases and services, but who in the past have been unwilling to upgrade to newer versions 
due to price sensitivity . Similarly , as we gain new customers, we expect to continue to drive new user adoption of our creative 
business over the next several years outside of our core creative professional target market because of Creative Cloud’ s attractive 
monthly subscription pricing combined with the strong brand of our creative products and the broad value proposition provided 
by Creative Cloud. We anticipate that our sustained focus on a subscription model will continue to increase the amount of our 
recurring revenue that is ratably reported, driven by broader Creative Cloud adoption over the next several years.
To accelerate the adoption of Creative Cloud, we have focused on migrating existing users of our creative products from 
perpetual licenses to a subscription-based offering, as well as driving new customer adoption. Aspects of this strategy include: 
focusing future innovation by our engineering teams on delivering new cloud-based functionality , such as Creative Cloud Libraries 
and Adobe CreativeSync, to enable our customers to use our creative tools and services across a variety of devices in ways that 
are not possible with previous desktop versions; integrating Creative Cloud with our Adobe Stock online marketplace offerings; 
increasing the value of Creative Cloud by delivering frequent product updates and enhancements to subscribers to address their 
content creation challenges; using promotions to attract customers to the offering; expanding our go-to-market reach through 
channel partners to reach new customers; and utilizing Creative Cloud for teams and Creative Cloud for enterprise offerings to 
drive broad adoption with customers who license our products in volume.
As part of our Creative Cloud strategy , we utilize our digital marketing solutions to drive customer awareness of our creative 
products and increase sales of our products through our website and across other channels. Adobe.com is increasingly becoming 
the destination site where we engage individual and small business customers to sign up for and renew Creative Cloud subscriptions. 
We utilize channel partners to target mid-size creative customers with our Creative Cloud for teams offering. Our direct sales force 
is focused on building relationships with our largest customers and driving adoption of our Creative Cloud for enterprise offering.
In our Document Cloud business, although Acrobat has achieved strong market adoption in document-intensive industries 
such as government, financial services, pharmaceutical, legal, aerospace, insurance and technical publishing, we believe there are 
tens of millions of users who still need the capabilities provided by Acrobat. We plan to continue to market the benefits of our 
Document Cloud solutions, combined with the low entry point of subscription-based pricing, to individuals as well as small and 
medium-sized businesses, large enterprises and government institutions around the world and increase our seat penetration in these 
markets through the utilization of our corporate and volume licensing programs. We also intend to increase our focus on marketing 
and licensing Acrobat in targeted vertical markets such as education, financial services, telecommunications and government, as 
well as on expanding into emer ging markets, while simultaneously enhancing and building out the delivery of cloud-based document 
services to our Acrobat and Adobe Acrobat Reader users. We intend to continue to promote the capabilities of our cloud-based 
document solution, such as its integration with users’  Dropbox documents, to millions of Acrobat users and hundreds of millions 
of Adobe Acrobat Reader users. Our Adobe eSign services provide a green alternative to costly paper -based solutions, and are an 
easier way for customers to manage their contract workflows. We believe that by growing the awareness of eSign services in the 
broader contract delivery and signing market and continuing to add new capabilities to this offering, we can help our customers 
migrate away from paper -based express mailing and adopt our solution, growing our revenue with this business in the process.
Digital Marketing
Digital Marketing Opportunity
Consumers today increasingly demand personalized content and experiences in their online interactions, across multiple 
channels and devices. As a result, any business or entity with an online presence must figure out how to best attract, engage, acquire 
and retain customers in a world where the reach and quality of experiences directly impacts success. Delivering the best experience 
6to a consumer at a given moment requires the right combination of data, insights and content. Marketing executives are increasingly 
demanding solutions that optimize their consumers’  experiences and deliver the greatest return on their marketing spend so they 
can demonstrate the success of their programs using objective metrics.
We believe there is a significant opportunity to address these challenges and help customers transform their businesses. 
Chief Marketing Officers, digital marketers, advertisers and publishers are increasingly steering their marketing, advertising, and 
development budgets toward digital media. Many industry analysts predict more advertising dollars will be spent in digital than 
in traditional media in the future. As marketers make this move to digital, our opportunity is accelerating as customers look for 
vendors to help them navigate this transition. However , marketing in a digital world is not simply about executing campaigns in 
each digital channel. Marketers, and entire enterprises, also need to ensure they deliver meaningful experiences to their consumers 
across both digital and traditional channels and in areas such as sales, support, and product interactions where consumers expect 
experiences to be personalized.
Our Digital Marketing business targets this large and growing opportunity by providing comprehensive solutions that include 
analytics, social marketing, targeting, media optimization, digital experience management, cross-channel campaign management, 
audience management, premium video delivery and monetization. We deliver these capabilities through our Adobe Marketing 
Cloud, an integrated offering enabling marketers to measure, personalize and optimize marketing campaigns and digital experiences 
across channels for optimal marketing performance. With its broad set of solutions, including Adobe Analytics, Adobe Target, 
Adobe Social, Adobe Media Optimizer , Adobe Experience Manager , Adobe Campaign, Adobe Audience Manager and Adobe 
Primetime, as well as real-time dashboards and a collaborative interface, customers of Adobe Marketing Cloud are able to combine 
data, insights and digital content to deliver a personalized brand experience to their consumers.
In addition to Chief Marketing Officers and digital marketers, users of our Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions include 
marketing professionals such as search engine marketers, media managers, media buyers and marketing research analysts. 
Customers also include web content editors, web analysts and web marketing managers. These customers often are involved in 
workflows that utilize other Adobe products, such as our Digital Media offerings and our video workflow and delivery technologies. 
By combining the creativity of our Digital Media business with the science of our Digital Marketing business, we help our customers 
to more efficiently and effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their content across every channel with an end-to-end 
workflow and feedback loop.
Our Digital Marketing segment also contains two legacy enterprise software offerings: our Adobe Connect web conferencing 
platform and Adobe LiveCycle, an enterprise document and forms platform. Since fiscal 2012, the focus of marketing and licensing 
of these products has been to financial services and government markets, driven by a subset of our enterprise sales force. We have 
also been focused on migrating some legacy LiveCycle customers to an updated offering with similar capabilities based on our 
Adobe Experience Manager solution.
Digital Marketing Strategy
Our goal is to be the leading provider of marketing solutions and a standard for the way digital advertising and marketing 
is created, measured, managed, executed and optimized.
We believe that our success will be driven by focusing our efforts on making Adobe Marketing Cloud the most comprehensive 
and integrated marketing solution available. Adobe Marketing Cloud consists of eight key solutions—Adobe Analytics, Adobe 
Target, Adobe Social, Adobe Media Optimizer , Adobe Experience Manager , Adobe Campaign, Adobe Audience Manager and 
Adobe Primetime. Adobe Marketing Cloud provides marketers with key capabilities, such as the ability to:
• Combine data across the Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions and third-party data sources, such as customer relationship 
management, point of sale, email, and survey , to create a single view of the consumer;
• Deliver personalized customer experiences across channels and on any device;
• Use predictive analytics to enable marketers to utilize past marketing program data and success to predict and drive 
their future success with digital marketing programs;
• Access all Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions from one centralized platform and visualize, socialize, and collaborate 
across teams with the interface;
• Interact with creatives through integration with Creative Cloud, enabling content creators and marketers to collaborate 
and communicate in real time within a cloud-based platform;
• Accurately forecast and continually optimize their mix of campaigns across digital media;
7• Provide robust cross-channel campaign management capabilities utilizing real-time insights, rich customer data and a 
sophisticated automation and execution platform;
• Manage, publish, track, and monetize social programs;
• Store, assemble, and distribute digital assets to deliver high-quality brand, campaign, and content experiences;
• Build unique audience profiles, allowing marketers to identify their most valuable segments and use them across digital 
channels;
• Easily add, alter, and deploy marketing tags on websites, resulting in consistent page performance and accurate data 
collection; and
• Integrate with a robust network of partners, covering the expansive digital marketing ecosystem.
To drive growth of Adobe Marketing Cloud, we also intend to streamline how customers learn about, acquire and deploy 
Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions. We believe we can accelerate the growth of our business by continuing to build out more direct 
sales capacity , as well as continuing to enable a rich ecosystem of agencies and SIs who sell, implement and service our solutions. 
We believe these investments will result in continued growth in revenue in our Digital Marketing segment in fiscal 2016 and 
beyond.
Print and Publishing
Our Print and Publishing segment contains legacy products and services that address diverse market opportunities including 
eLearning solutions, technical document publishing, web application development and high-end printing. Graphics professionals 
and professional publishers continue to require quality , reliability and efficiency in production printing, and our Adobe PostScript 
and Adobe PDF printing technologies provide advanced functionality to meet the sophisticated requirements of this marketplace. 
As high-end printing systems evolve and transition to fully digital, composite workflows, we believe we are uniquely positioned 
to be a supplier of software and technology based on the PostScript and Adobe PDF standards for use by this industry .
We generate revenue by licensing our technology to OEMs that manufacture workflow software, printers and other output 
devices. In fiscal 2015, we maintained a relatively consistent quarterly revenue run-rate with the mature products we market and 
license in our Print and Publishing business. 
PRINCIP AL PRODUCTS AND SER VICES
Digital Media Pr oducts
Creative Cloud
Creative Cloud is a subscription offering that enables the creation of rich and engaging digital content. Through Creative 
Cloud, users can easily explore, create, publish and share their work across devices, the desktop and the web. Members have access 
to a vibrant creative community , publishing services to deliver apps and websites, cloud storage to easily access their work, the 
ability to sync their files to virtually any device, collaboration capabilities with team members, and new products and exclusive 
updates as they are developed.
Creative Cloud members can build a Creative Profile which persists wherever they are. A user’s Creative Profile moves 
with them via Creative Cloud services from app-to-app and device-to-device, giving them immediate access to their personal files, 
photos, graphics, colors, fonts, text styles, desktop setting customizations and other important assets. Furthermore, CreativeSync 
synchronizes all files, photos, fonts and other assets used in a particular workflow so that users can begin creative work on any 
device and seamlessly continue it on another .
New Creative Cloud services have been developed and delivered to subscribers to increase the utilization of Creative Cloud 
capabilities beyond the use of our desktop applications. One of these new services, Adobe Stock, is an online marketplace with 
over 40 million curated photos, graphics and videos that is deeply integrated with Creative Cloud apps. We believe services such 
as Adobe Stock will drive higher user interaction with Creative Cloud and create upsell opportunities as users increasingly utilize 
higher -tiered versions of these services.
New mobile apps that run on tablets and smartphones enable connections between essential Creative Cloud desktop tools 
and a new family of mobile apps that extend the capabilities of Photoshop, Illustrator , Premiere Pro and Lightroom onto mobile 
devices.  Our mobile apps enable users to create designs with tablets and bring them into their creative workflows.
8We license Creative Cloud to individuals and teams of users through Adobe.com either on a monthly subscription basis or 
as an annual subscription. Channel partners also license Creative Cloud with annual team subscriptions to small or medium-sized 
businesses, or to workgroups in enterprises. With larger enterprise customers, our direct sales force utilizes enterprise term license 
agreements (“ETLAs”), for volume-based agreements often for multi-year terms.
Photoshop
Adobe Photoshop CC is the world’ s most advanced digital imaging software. It is used by photographers, designers, 
animators, web professionals, and video professionals, and is available to Creative Cloud subscribers. Customers can also subscribe 
to Photoshop CC as an individual subscription product, or through our Creative Cloud Photography Plan, which is an offer targeted 
at photographers and photo hobbyists and includes our popular Photoshop Lightroom product as a companion tool to Photoshop.  
We also offer Photoshop Elements separately , which is targeted at consumers who desire the brand and power of Photoshop through 
an easy-to-use interface. For tablet and smartphone users, we offer several mobile apps including Photoshop Sketch, Photoshop 
Mix, Lightroom for mobile and Photoshop Fix—all of which enable sophisticated photo editing and content creation using a touch-
based interface on tablet and mobile devices.
Illustrator
Adobe Illustrator CC is our industry-standard vector graphics software used worldwide by designers of all types who want 
to create digital graphics and illustrations for all kinds of media: print, web, interactive, video, and mobile. Illustrator is available 
to Creative Cloud subscribers, and customers can also subscribe to use it as an individual subscription product. Users can also 
utilize mobile apps such as Illustrator Draw to gain access to Illustrator capabilities on their tablets and mobile devices, and sync 
their work through CreativeSync for use with Illustrator on their desktop.
InDesign
InDesign is the leading professional page layout software for print and digital publishing. Our customers use it to design, 
preflight, and publish a broad range of content including newspapers and magazines for print, online, and tablet app delivery . 
Customers can create simple or complex layouts quickly and efficiently with precise control over typography , built-in creative 
tools, and an intuitive design environment. Tight integration with other Adobe software such as Photoshop, Illustrator , Acrobat, 
and Adobe Animate enables customers to work productively in print and digital workflows. Customers can also access Adobe 
Digital Publishing Solution from within InDesign to create and publish engaging apps for a broad range of devices, including iOS, 
Android and Amazon-based devices.
InDesign is built for designers, prepress and production professionals, and print service providers who work for magazines, 
design firms, advertising agencies, newspapers, book publishers, and catalog companies, as well as in corporate design, commercial 
printing, and other leading-edge publishing environments. Customers using InDesign often use Adobe InCopy , a companion 
product used for professional writing and editing to enable an efficient collaborative workflow between design and editorial staff. 
InDesign and InCopy are available to Creative Cloud subscribers, and customers can also subscribe to use InDesign as an individual 
subscription product.
Adobe Premier e Pro
Adobe Premiere Pro is our powerful, customizable, nonlinear video editing tool used by video professionals. Customers 
can import and combine virtually any type of media, from video shot on a smartphone to raw 4K and higher resolution footage, 
and then edit in its native format without transcoding. The user interface includes a customizable timeline and numerous editing 
shortcuts which enable faster , keyboard-driven editing.
With the demands of shorter production schedules and high-resolution digital media formats, real-time performance is 
crucial to videographers. Premiere Pro utilizes our Mercury Playback Engine to provide the fastest performance solution in the 
industry . It also supports a vast majority of formats, and customers can now use multiple graphics cards to accelerate render and 
export times. As part of Creative Cloud, Premiere Pro tightly integrates with other Adobe creative applications. Customers can

Other  Products and Solutions
We also offer a broad range of other enterprise and digital media products and solutions. Information about other products 
not referenced here can be found on our corporate website, www .adobe.com, under the “Products” tab available in the “Menu”.
COMPETITION
The markets for our products and services are characterized by intense competition, new industry standards, evolving 
business and distribution models, disruptive software and hardware technology developments, frequent new product introductions, 
short product life cycles, price cutting with resulting downward pressure on gross margins and price sensitivity on the part of 
consumers. Our future success will depend on our ability to enhance and better integrate our existing products, introduce new 
products on a timely and cost-ef fective basis, meet changing customer needs, provide best-in-class information security to build 
customer confidence and combat cyber -attacks, extend our core technology into new applications and anticipate and respond to 
emer ging standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological changes.
Digital Media
No single company has offerings identical to our Creative Cloud products and services, but we face collective competition 
from a variety of point offerings, free products and downloadable apps. Our competitors include offerings from companies such 
as Apple, Autodesk, Avid, Corel, Microsoft, Quark, Getty Images, Shutterstock and others, as well as from many lower -end 
offerings available on touch-enabled devices via app stores, and from various open source initiatives. We believe our greatest 
advantage in this market is the scope of our integrated solutions, which work together as part of Creative Cloud. With Creative 
Cloud we also compete favorably on the basis of features and functionality , ease of use, product reliability , value and performance 
characteristics.
Professional digital imaging, drawing and illustration products are characterized by feature-rich competition, brand 
awareness and price sensitivity . Competition in this market is also emer ging with drawing and illustration applications on tablet 
and smartphone platforms. The demand for professional web page layout and professional web content creation tools is constantly 
evolving and highly volatile. In this area we face direct and indirect competition from desktop software companies and various 
proprietary and open source web-authoring tools. 
The needs of digital imaging and video editing software users are constantly evolving due to rapid technology and hardware 
advancements in digital cameras, digital video cameras, printers, personal computers, tablets, smartphones and other new devices. 
Our imaging and video software offerings, including Photoshop, Lightroom, After Effects and Premiere Pro, face competition 
from established and emer ging companies offering similar products. 
New image editing applications for mobile devices and tablets with features that compete with our professional products 
are also emer ging as adoption of these devices grows. Our consumer digital imaging and video editing offerings are subject to 
intense competition, including customer price sensitivity , competitor brand awareness and competitor strength in OEM bundling 
12and retail distribution. We face direct and indirect competition in the consumer digital imaging market from a number of companies 
that market software that competes with ours.
The stock content market has significant competition, especially in the microstock segment, where Adobe primarily operates 
today with Fotolia.com and the newly launched Adobe Stock offering. Key competitors in this market include Shutterstock,Getty 
Images and a number of smaller companies.  Adobe Stock’ s deep product integration with Creative Cloud and superior reach and 
relationships with creative professionals around the world differentiate our offerings.
In addition, we face competition from device, hardware and camera manufacturers as they try to differentiate their offerings 
by bundling, for free, their own digital imaging software, or those of our competitors. Similarly , we face potential competition 
from operating system manufacturers as they integrate or offer hobbyist-level digital imaging and image management features 
with their operating systems. We also face competition from smartphone and tablet manufacturers that integrate imaging and video 
software into their devices to work with cameras that come as part of their smartphone and tablet offerings. In addition, social 
networking platforms such as Facebook (including Instagram), Snapchat, Twitter (including Vine) and Pinterest, as well as portal 
sites such as Google and Yahoo! are becoming a direct means to post, edit and share images, bypassing the step of using image 
editing and sharing software. Online storage and synchronization are becoming free and ubiquitous. Consumers in particular will 
be encouraged to use the image and video editing software offered by those storage products, thus competing with our software.
Competition is also emer ging with imaging and video applications on smartphone and tablet platforms. Competitors are 
extending their products and feature sets to platforms such as Apple’ s iPhone and iPad, and other smartphone and tablet devices. 
Similarly , new cloud-based offerings continue to emer ge which offer image editing and video-editing capabilities, as well as social 
and sharing features.
As customers such as publishers and media companies increase their desire to deliver their assets to new platforms, we 
expect new and existing companies to continue to offer solutions that address these challenges that are competitive with our Digital 
Publishing Solution. Many design agencies are building capabilities to offer such solutions, and companies such as Amazon, Apple 
and Google offer an alternative format and business model for the delivery of newspaper and magazine content to mobile devices.
The nature of traditional digital document creation, storage, and collaboration has been rapidly evolving as knowledge 
workers and consumers shift their behavior increasingly to non-desktop workflows. Competitors like Microsoft, Google, Box and 
Dropbox all offer competitive alternatives to our Document Cloud business for creating and managing PDFs. In addition, other 
PDF creation solutions can be found at a low cost or for free on the web. To address these competitive threats, we are working to 
ensure our Adobe Document Cloud applications stay at the forefront of innovation in emer ging opportunities such as PDF document 
generation, document collaboration and document security .
As electronic signatures with Adobe eSign Services are quickly becoming a core element of digital documents, competitors 
such as DocuSign and Citrix have been jumping in to take advantage of the growing space. We face strong competition from these 
and other companies in this market.
Digital Marketing 
The markets in which our Digital Marketing business unit competes are growing rapidly and characterized by intense 
competition. Our Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions face competition from large companies such as Google, IBM, Oracle, 
salesforce.com, SAP, SAS, Teradata and others, in addition to point product solutions and focused competitors. Additionally , new 
competitors are constantly entering these markets. Some of these competitors provide SaaS solutions to customers, generally 
through a web browser , while others provide software that is installed by customers directly on their servers. In addition, we 
compete at times with our customers’  or potential customers’  internally developed applications. Of the competitors listed above, 
no single company has products identical to our Adobe Marketing Cloud offerings. Adobe Marketing Cloud competes in a variety 
of areas, including: reporting and analytics; cross-channel marketing and optimization; online and social marketing; audience 
management; video delivery and monetization; web experience management and others.
Many of the companies with which we compete offer a variety of products or services and as a result could also bundle 
their products or services, which may result in these companies effectively selling their products or services at or below market 
prices for individual products. In addition, large software, Internet and database management companies have expanded their 
offerings in the digital marketing area, either by developing competing services or by acquiring existing competitors or strategic 
partners of ours. We believe competitive factors in our markets include the proven performance, security , scalability , flexibility 
and reliability of services; the strategic relationships and integration with third-party applications; the intuitiveness and visual 
appeal of user interfaces; demonstrable cost-ef fective benefits to customers; pricing; the flexibility of services to match changing 
business demands; enterprise-level customer service and training; perceived market leadership; the usability of services; real-time 
data and reporting; independence from portals and search engines; the ability to deploy the services globally; and success in 
educating customers in how to utilize services effectively . We believe we compete favorably with both the enterprise and low-
13cost alternatives based on many of these competitive factors including our strong feature set, the breadth of our offerings, our 
focus on global, multi-brand companies, our superior user experience, tools for building multi-screen, cross-channel applications, 
standards-based architecture, scalability and performance and leadership in industry standards efforts.
Creative and digital agencies, as well as SIs, are increasingly investing in acquiring their own digital marketing technology 
platforms to complement their creative services offerings. Adobe may face competition from these agencies and SIs as they come 
to market with best-of-breed offerings in one or more digital marketing capabilities, or if agencies attempt to create a more complete 
technology platform offering. We believe our creative tools heritage differentiates us from our competitors. We have worked 
closely with marketing and creative customers for over thirty years. We also believe we have leadership in this market, with current 
customers representing leading global brands. Our comprehensive solutions extend more broadly than any other company in 
serving the needs of marketers and addressing this market opportunity; we integrate content and data, analytics, personalization, 
web experience management, cross-channel campaign management, audience management, video delivery and monetization and 
social capabilities in our Adobe Marketing Cloud, surpassing the reach of any competitor . Most importantly , we provide a vision 
for our digital marketing customers as we engage with them across the important aspects of their business, extending from their 
use of Creative Cloud, to how they manage, deliver , measure and monetize their content with our Adobe Marketing Cloud.
Print and Publishing
Our Print and Publishing product offerings face competition from large-scale electronic and web publishing systems, XML-
based publishing companies as well as lower -end desktop publishing products. Depending on the product line, competition is 
based on a number of factors, including: the quality and features of products, ease-of-use, printer service support, the level of 
customization and integration with other publishing system components, the number of hardware platforms supported, service 
and price. We believe we can successfully compete based upon the quality and features of our products, our strong brand among 
users, the widespread adoption of our products among printer service bureaus, and our extensive application programming interface.
In printing technologies, we believe the principal competitive factors for OEMs in selecting a page description language 
or a printing technology are product capabilities, market leadership, reliability , price, support and engineering development 
assistance. We believe that our competitive advantages include our technology competency , OEM customer relationships and our 
intellectual property portfolio.

of packages for retail and other applications products is controlled by our product delivery operations organization. We outsource 
our procurement, production, inventory and fulfillment activities to third parties in the United States, Germany and Singapore.
To date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in obtaining raw materials for the manufacture of our products or 
in the replication of DVDs, printing and assembly of components.
14Our evolution to a services and subscription-based business model has decreased the need to produce and distribute physical 
products. We still produce packaged products for a subset of our business, but that percentage is declining as the digital delivery 
of our services and subscriptions continues to grow .

Investments
We make direct investments in privately held companies. We enter into these investments with the intent of securing financial 
returns as well as for strategic purposes as they often increase our knowledge of emer ging markets and technologies, as well as 
expand our opportunities to provide Adobe products and services. 
PRODUCT  DEVELOPMENT
 
As the software industry is characterized by rapid technological change, a continuous high level of investment is required 
for the enhancement of existing products and services and the development of new products and services. We develop our software 
internally as well as acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing the stock or assets of the business entity 
that owned the technology . In other instances, we have licensed or purchased the intellectual property ownership rights of programs 
developed by others with license or technology transfer agreements that may obligate us to pay a flat license fee or royalties, 
typically based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the revenue generated by those programs.
During fiscal 2015 , 2014  and 2013 , our research and development expenses were $862.7 million , $844.4 million  and $826.6 
million , respectively .
PRODUCT  PROTECTION
We regard our software as proprietary and protect it under the laws of copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets. 
We have a number of domestic and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and 
technology . While we believe our patents have value, no single patent is material to us or to any of our reporting segments. We 
protect the source code of our software programs as trade secrets and make source code available to third parties only under limited 
circumstances and subject to specific security and confidentiality constraints. From time to time, we secure rights to third-party 
intellectual property if beneficial to our business.
Our products are generally licensed to end users under one of the following two methods:
(1) We offer products on a “right to use” basis pursuant to a license that restricts the use of the products to a designated 
number of devices, users or both. We also rely on copyright laws and on “shrink wrap” and electronic licenses that are 
not physically signed by the end user. Copyright protection may be unavailable under the laws of certain countries and 
the enforceability of “shrink wrap” and electronic licenses has not been conclusively determined in all jurisdictions. 
(2) We offer products under a SaaS or on-demand model, where hosted software is provided on demand to customers, 
generally through a web browser . The use of these products is governed by either the online terms of use or an enterprise 
licensing agreement associated with the product.
Policing unauthorized use of computer software is difficult and software piracy is a persistent problem for the software 
industry . This problem is particularly acute in international markets. We conduct piracy conversion and prevention programs 
16directly and through certain external software associations. In addition, we have activation technology in certain products to guard 
against illegal use and will continue to do so in certain future products.

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACT ORS
As previously discussed, our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Factors that might 
cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below . These and many other factors described 
in this report could adversely affect our operations, performance and financial condition.
If we cannot continue to develop, market and offer new products and services or enhancements to existing products and services 
that meet customer requirements, our operating results could suffer.
The process of developing new high technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is 
complex, costly and uncertain. If we fail to anticipate customers’  changing needs and emer ging technological trends, our market 
share and results of operations could suffer. We must make long-term investments, develop or obtain appropriate intellectual 
property and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for 
our products and services. If we are unable to extend our core technologies into new applications and new platforms and to anticipate 
or respond to technological changes, the market’ s acceptance of our products and services could decline and our results would 
suffer. Additionally , any delay in the development, production, marketing or offering of a new product or service or enhancement 
to an existing product or service could result in customer attrition or impede our ability to attract new customers, causing a decline 
in our revenue, earnings or stock price and weakening our competitive position. We maintain strategic relationships with third 
parties to market certain of our products and services and support certain product functionality . If we are unsuccessful in establishing 
or maintaining our relationships with these third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace, to reach new customers and 
geographies or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our operating results could suffer.
We offer our products on a variety of personal computers, tablet and mobile devices. Recent trends have shown a technological 
shift from personal computers to tablet and mobile devices. If we cannot continue to adapt our products to tablet and mobile 
devices, our business could be harmed. To the extent that consumer purchases of these devices slow down, or to the extent that 
significant demand arises for our products or competitive products on other platforms before we offer our products on those 
platforms, our business could be harmed. Releases of new devices or operating systems may make it more difficult for our products 
to perform or may require significant costs in order for us to adapt our solutions to such devices or operating systems. These 
potential costs and delays could harm our business.
Introduction of new products, services and business models by competitors or others could harm our competitive position and 
results of operations.
The markets for our products and services are characterized by intense competition, evolving industry standards, emer ging 
business and distribution models, disruptive technology developments, short product and service life cycles, price sensitivity on 
the part of customers and frequent new product introductions (including alternatives with limited functionality available at lower 
costs or free of charge). Any of these factors could create downward pressure on pricing and gross margins and could adversely 
affect our renewal and upgrade rates, as well as our ability to attract new customers. Our future success will depend on our ability 
to enhance our existing products and services, introduce new products and services on a timely and cost-ef fective basis, meet 
changing customer needs, extend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate and respond to emer ging standards, 
business models, software delivery methods and other technological developments, such as the evolution and emer gence of digital 
application marketplaces as a direct sales and software delivery environment. These digital application marketplaces often have 
exclusive distribution for certain platforms, which may make it more difficult for us to compete in these markets. If any competing 
products, services or operating systems (that do not support our solutions) achieve widespread acceptance, our operating results 
could suffer. In addition, consolidation has occurred among some of the competitors in the markets in which we compete. Further 
consolidations in these markets may subject us to increased competitive pressures and may therefore harm our results of operations. 
The introduction of certain technologies may reduce the effectiveness of our products. For example, some of our products 
rely on third-party cookies, which are placed on individual browsers when consumers visit websites that contain advertisements. 
We use these cookies to help our customers more effectively advertise, to gauge the performance of their advertisements, and to 
detect and prevent fraudulent activity . Consumers can block or delete cookies through their browsers or “ad-blocking” software 
19or applications. The most common Internet browsers allow consumers to modify their browser settings to prevent cookies from 
being accepted by their browsers, or are set to block third-party cookies by default. Increased use of methods, software or applications 
that block cookies could harm our business. 
For additional information regarding our competition and the risks arising out of the competitive environment in which 
we operate, see the section entitled “Competition” contained in Part I, Item 1 of this report. 
If we fail to successfully manage transitions to new business models and markets, our results of operations could suffer.
We often release new offerings and employ new product and services delivery methods in connection with our diversification 
into new business models and markets. It is uncertain whether these strategies will prove successful or whether we will be able to 
develop the necessary infrastructure and business models more quickly than our competitors. Market acceptance of new product 
and service offerings will be dependent in part on our ability to (1) include functionality and usability that address customer 
requirements, and (2) optimally price our products and services in light of marketplace conditions, our costs and customer demand. 
New product and service offerings may increase our risk of liability related to the provision of services and cause us to incur 
significant technical, legal or other costs. For example, with our cloud-based services and subscription-based licensing models, 
such as Creative Cloud, we have entered markets that may not be fully accustomed to cloud-based subscription offerings. Market 
acceptance of such services is affected by a variety of factors, including information security , reliability , performance, customer 
preference, social and community engagement, local government regulations regarding online services and user-generated content, 
the sufficiency of technological infrastructure to support our products and services in certain geographies, customer concerns with 
entrusting a third party to store and manage its data, consumer concerns regarding data privacy and the enactment of laws or 
regulations that restrict our ability to provide such services to customers in the United States or internationally . If we are unable 
to respond to these threats, our business could be harmed.
From time to time we open-source certain of our technology initiatives, provide broader open access to our technology , 
license certain of our technology on a royalty-free basis, or release selected technology for industry standardization. Additionally , 
customer requirements for open standards or open-source products could impact adoption or use of some of our products or services. 
To the extent we incorrectly predict customer requirements for such products or services, or if there is a delay in market acceptance 
of such products or services, our business could be harmed. 
We also devote significant resources to the development of technologies and service offerings in markets where our operating 
history is less extensive, such as the marketplace for stock imagery . These new offerings and markets may require a considerable 
investment of technical, financial, compliance and sales resources, and a scalable organization. Some of our competitors may have 
advantages over us due to their larger presence, larger developer network, deeper market experience and larger sales, consulting 
and marketing resources. In addition, the metrics we use to gauge the status of our business model transition may evolve over the 
course of the transition as significant trends emer ge. If we are unable to successfully establish new offerings in light of the 
competitive environment, our results of operations could suffer. 
Subscription offerings and ETLAs could create risks related to the timing of revenue recognition.
Our subscription model creates certain risks related to the timing of revenue recognition and potential reductions in cash 
flows. A portion of the subscription-based revenue we report each quarter results from the recognition of deferred revenue relating 
to subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. A decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any period may 
not be immediately reflected in our reported financial results for that period, but may result in a decline in our revenue in future 
quarters. If we were to experience significant downturns in subscription sales and renewal rates, our reported financial results 
might not reflect such downturns until future periods. Our subscription model could also make it difficult for us to rapidly increase 
our revenue from subscription-based or hosted services through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers 
will be recognized over the applicable subscription term. Further , any increases in sales under our subscription sales model could 
result in decreased revenue over the short term if they are offset by a decline in sales from perpetual license customers.
Additionally , in connection with our sales efforts to enterprise customers and our use of ETLAs, a number of factors could 
affect our revenue, including longer than expected sales and implementation cycles, potential deferral of revenue due to multiple-
element revenue arrangements and alternate licensing arrangements. If any of our assumptions about revenue from our new 
businesses or our addition of a subscription-based model prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those 
anticipated, estimated or projected.
Uncertainty about current and future economic conditions and other adverse changes in general political conditions in any of 
the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our operating results. 
As our business has grown, we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in economic 
and political conditions, both domestically and globally . Uncertainty about the effects of current and future economic and political 
20conditions on us, our customers, suppliers and partners makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions 
about future investments. If economic growth in countries where we do business slows, customers may delay or reduce technology 
purchases, advertising spending or marketing spending. This could result in reductions in sales of our products and services, longer 
sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. Our customers include government entities, 
including the U.S. federal government, and if spending cuts impede the government’ s ability to purchase our products and services, 
our revenue could decline. Deterioration in economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business could also cause 
slower or impaired collections on accounts receivable, which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition.  
A financial institution credit crisis could impair credit availability and the financial stability of our customers, including 
our distribution partners and channels. A disruption in the financial markets may also have an effect on our derivative counterparties 
and could also impair our banking partners, on which we rely for operating cash management. Any of these events would likely 
harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Political instability in or around any of the major countries in which we do business would also likely harm our business, 
results of operations and financial condition.
The increased emphasis on a cloud strategy may give rise to risks that could harm our business. 
Over the past several years, our business has shifted away from pre-packaged creative software to focus on a subscription 
model that prices and delivers our products and services in a way that differs from the historical pricing and delivery methods of 
our creative tools and document services products. These changes reflect a significant shift from perpetual license sales and 
distribution of our software in favor of providing our customers the right to access certain of our software in a hosted environment 
or use downloaded software for a specified subscription period. This cloud strategy requires continued investment in product 
development and cloud operations, and may give rise to a number of risks, including the following:
• if customers desire only perpetual licenses or to purchase or renew subscriptions for specific products rather than acquire 
the entire Creative Cloud offering, our subscription sales may lag behind our expectations;
• our cloud strategy may raise concerns among our customer base, including concerns regarding changes to pricing over 
time, service availability , information security of a cloud solution and access to files while offline or once a subscription 
has expired;
• customers may turn to competitive or open-source offerings;
• we may be unsuccessful in maintaining our target pricing, new seat adoption and projected renewal rates; or we may 
have to rely heavily on promotional rates to achieve target seat adoption, which could reduce average revenue per user; 
and
• we may incur costs at a higher than forecasted rate as we expand our cloud operations.
We may be unable to predict subscription renewal rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating 
results. 
The hosted business model we utilize in our Adobe Marketing Cloud offerings typically involves selling services on a 
subscription basis pursuant to service agreements that are generally one to three years in length. Our individual Creative Cloud 
and Document Cloud subscription agreements are generally month-to-month or one year in length, ETLAs for our Digital Media 
products and services are generally three years in length, and subscription agreements for other products and services may provide 
for shorter or longer terms. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of 
their initial subscription period, and some customers elect not to renew . We cannot provide assurance that our subscriptions will 
be renewed at the same or higher level of service, for the same number of seats or licenses or for the same duration of time, if at 
all. Moreover , under certain circumstances, some of our customers have the right to cancel their service agreements prior to the 
expiration of the terms of their agreements. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to accurately predict future customer 
renewal rates. Our customers’  renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their level of 
satisfaction with our services, our ability to continue to regularly add features and functionality , the reliability (including uptime) 
of our subscription services, the prices of our services, the actual or perceived information security of our systems and services, 
the prices of services offered by our competitors, mergers and acquisitions affecting our customer base, reductions in our customers’  
spending levels, or declines in customer activity as a result of economic downturns or uncertainty in financial markets. If our 
customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or if they renew on terms less favorable to us, our revenue may decline.
Our future growth is also affected by our ability to sell additional features and services to our current customers, which 
depends on a number of factors, including customers’  satisfaction with our products and services, the level of innovation reflected 
21in those additional features, the prices of our offerings and general economic conditions. If our efforts to cross-sell and upsell to 
our customers are unsuccessful, the rate at which our business grows might decline.
Security vulnerabilities in our products and systems could lead to reduced revenue or to liability claims.
Maintaining the security of our products, computers and networks is a critical issue for us and our customers. Security 
researchers, criminal hackers and other third parties regularly develop new techniques to penetrate computer and network security 
measures and, as we have previously disclosed, certain parties have in the past managed to breach certain of our data security 
systems and misused certain of our systems and software in order to access our end users’  authentication and payment information. 
In addition, cyber -attackers also develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs, some of which may 
be specifically designed to attack our products, systems, computers or networks. Sophisticated hardware and operating system 
applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including bugs and other 
problems that could unexpectedly compromise the security of the system, or impair a customer ’s ability to operate or use our 
products. The costs to prevent, eliminate or alleviate cyber - or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software 
programs and security vulnerabilities are significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could 
result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. It is impossible to predict the extent, 
frequency or impact of these problems on us.
Outside parties have in the past and may in the future attempt to fraudulently induce our employees or users of our products 
or services to disclose sensitive information via illegal electronic spamming, phishing or other tactics. Unauthorized parties may 
also attempt to gain physical access to our facilities in order to infiltrate our information systems. These actual and potential 
breaches of our security measures and the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unauthorized dissemination of proprietary 
information or sensitive, personal or confidential data about us, our employees or our customers, including the potential loss or 
disclosure of such information or data as a result of hacking, fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us, our 
employees, our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information. This may result in litigation 
and potential liability or fines, governmental inquiry or oversight or a loss of customer confidence, any of which could harm our 
business or damage our brand and reputation, possibly impeding our present and future success in retaining and attracting new 
customers and thereby requiring time and resources to repair our brand. 
These problems affect our products and services in particular because cyber -attackers tend to focus their efforts on the most 
popular offerings (such as those with a large user base), and we expect them to continue to do so. Critical vulnerabilities may be 
identified in certain of our applications. These vulnerabilities could cause such applications to crash and could allow an attacker 
to take control of the affected system, which could result in liability to us or limit our ability to conduct our business and deliver 
our products and services to customers. We devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through engineering 
more secure products, enhancing security and reliability features in our products and systems, code hardening, conducting rigorous 
penetration tests, deploying updates to address security vulnerabilities and improving our incident response time, but these security 
vulnerabilities cannot be totally eliminated. The cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins, and we may be unable to 
implement these measures quickly enough to prevent cyber -attackers from gaining unauthorized access into our systems and 
products. Despite our preventative efforts, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and systems may harm our 
reputation or lead to claims against us (and have in the past led to such claims), and could lead some customers to seek to return 
products, to stop using certain services, to reduce or delay future purchases of products or services, or to use competing products 
or services. If we do not make the appropriate level of investment in our technology systems or if our systems become out-of-date 
or obsolete and we are not able to deliver the quality of data security customers require, our business could be adversely affected. 
Customers may also adopt security measures designed to protect their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay 
adoption of new technologies. Further , if we or our customers are subject to a future attack, or our technology is utilized in a third-
party attack, it may be necessary for us to take additional extraordinary measures and make additional expenditures to take 
appropriate responsive and preventative steps. Any of these events could adversely affect our revenue or margins. Moreover , 
delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers resulting from the disruptions of cyber -attacks or preventative measures could 
adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.
Some of our lines of business rely on us or our third-party service providers to host and deliver services and data, and any 
interruptions or delays in these hosted services, security or privacy breaches, or failures in data collection could expose us to 
liability and harm our business and reputation.
Some of our lines of business and services, including our online store at adobe.com, Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, 
other hosted Digital Media offerings and our Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions, rely on hardware and services hosted and controlled 
directly by us or by our third-party service providers. We do not have redundancy for all of our systems, many of our critical 
applications reside in only one of our data centers, and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. If our 
business relationship with a third-party provider of hosting or content delivery services is negatively affected, or if one of our 
content delivery suppliers were to terminate its agreement with us, we might not be able to deliver the corresponding hosted 
22offerings to our customers, which could subject us to reputational harm and cause us to lose customers and future business, thereby 
reducing our revenue.
We hold large amounts of customer data, some of which is hosted in third-party facilities. A security incident at those 
facilities or ours may compromise the confidentiality , integrity or availability of customer data. Unauthorized access to customer 
data stored on our computers or networks may be obtained through break-ins, breach of our secure network by an unauthorized 
party , employee theft or misuse, or other misconduct. It is also possible that unauthorized access to customer data may be obtained 
through inadequate use of security controls by customers. Accounts created with weak passwords could allow cyber -attackers to 
gain access to customer data. Additionally , failure by customers to remove accounts of their own employees, or granting of accounts 
by the customer in an uncontrolled manner , may allow for access by former or unauthorized customer representatives. If there 
were an inadvertent disclosure of personal information, or if a third party were to gain unauthorized access to the personal information 
we possess on behalf of our customers, our operations could be disrupted, our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject 
to claims or other liabilities. In addition, such perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of the information we collect or breach 
of our security could damage our reputation, result in the loss of customers and harm our business.
Because of the large amount of data that we collect and manage on behalf of our customers, it is possible that hardware or 
software failures or errors in our systems (or those of our third-party service providers) could result in data loss or corruption or 
cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our customers regard as significant. Furthermore, 
our ability to collect and report data may be delayed or interrupted by a number of factors, including access to the Internet, the 
failure of our network or software systems, security breaches or significant variability in visitor traffic on customer websites. In 
addition, computer viruses or other malware may harm our systems, causing us to lose data, and the transmission of computer 
viruses or other malware could expose us to litigation. We may also find, on occasion, that we cannot deliver data and reports to 
our customers in near real time because of a number of factors, including significant spikes in customer activity on their websites 
or failures of our network or software. If we supply inaccurate information or experience interruptions in our ability to capture, 
store and supply information in near real time or at all, our reputation could be harmed and we could lose customers, or we could 
be found liable for damages or incur other losses.
We may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, and integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our 
business and management.
We may not realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition of a company , division, product or technology , each of which 
involves numerous risks. These risks include:
• difficulty in integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired company;
• difficulty in effectively integrating the acquired technologies, products or services with our current technologies, 
products or services;
• difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and integration;
• entry into markets in which we have minimal prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger 
market positions;
• disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and other employees from other opportunities 
and challenges;
• inability to retain personnel of the acquired business;
• inability to retain key customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the acquired business;
• inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses;
• inability to take advantage of anticipated tax benefits as a result of unforeseen difficulties in our integration activities;
• incurring acquisition-related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact our operating 
results;
• potential elevated delinquency or bad debt write-of fs related to receivables of the acquired business we assume;
• potential additional exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates;
• potential additional costs of bringing acquired companies into compliance with laws and regulations applicable to us 
as a multinational corporation;
23• potential impairment of our relationships with employees, customers, partners, distributors or third-party providers of 
our technologies, products or services;
• potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other challenges of an 
acquired company or technology , including, but not limited to, issues with the acquired company’ s intellectual property , 
product quality or product architecture, data back-up and security (including security from cyber -attacks), privacy 
practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, employee, customer or partner issues or legal and financial 
contingencies;
• exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of, an 
acquisition, including, but not limited to, claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other 
third parties;
• incurring significant exit charges if products or services acquired in business combinations are unsuccessful;
• potential inability to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective;
• potential inability to obtain, or obtain in a timely manner , approvals from governmental authorities, which could delay 
or prevent such acquisitions; 
• the failure of strategic investments to perform as expected or to meet financial projections
• potential delay in customer and distributor purchasing decisions due to uncertainty about the direction of our product 
and service offerings; and
• potential incompatibility of business cultures.
Mergers and acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky . If we do not complete an announced acquisition 
transaction or integrate an acquired business successfully and in a timely manner , we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition 
to the extent anticipated, and in certain circumstances an acquisition could harm our financial position. 
We may incur substantial costs enforcing or acquiring intellectual property rights and defending against third-party claims as 
a result of litigation or other proceedings.
In connection with the enforcement of our own intellectual property rights, the acquisition of third-party intellectual property 
rights, or disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights, 
we have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations and complex, protracted litigation. Intellectual 
property disputes and litigation are typically costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and 
energies of management and key technical personnel. Although we have successfully defended or resolved many past lawsuits 
and other disputes, we may not prevail in every case in the future. Third-party intellectual property disputes, including those 
initiated by patent assertion entities, could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing 
arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent us from licensing certain of our products or offering certain of our services, subject 
us to injunctions restricting our sale of products or services, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we 
compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers, including contractual provisions under various 
license arrangements and service agreements. In addition, we may incur significant costs in acquiring the necessary third-party 
intellectual property rights for use in our products, in some cases to fulfill contractual obligations with our customers. Any of these 
occurrences could significantly harm our business.
Our intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset and we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights, including 
our source code, from infringement or unauthorized copying, use or disclosure.
Our intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset. Infringement or misappropriation of assets in this portfolio can result 
in lost revenues and thereby ultimately reduce their value. Preventing unauthorized use or infringement of our intellectual property 
rights is inherently difficult. We actively combat software piracy as we enforce our intellectual property rights, but we nonetheless 
lose significant revenue due to illegal use of our software. If piracy activities continue at historical levels or increase, they may 
further harm our business.
Additionally , we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of our confidential information and trade secrets, including 
our source code. Despite these measures, as we have previously disclosed, hackers have managed to access certain of our source 
code and may obtain access in the future. If unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs through security breach, cyber -
attack or otherwise, we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code. The loss of future trade secret 
protection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality , which could cause us to 
24lose customers and could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. We also seek to protect our confidential information 
and trade secrets through the use of non-disclosure agreements with our customers, contractors, vendors and partners. However , 
there is a risk that our confidential information and trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization, and in 
these situations, enforcing our rights may be difficult or costly .
Increasing regulatory focus on privacy issues and expanding laws and regulations could impact our new business models and 
expose us to increased liability .
Our industry is highly regulated, including for privacy and data security . We are also expanding our business in countries 
that have more stringent data protection laws than those in the United States, and such laws may be inconsistent across jurisdictions 
and are subject to evolving and differing interpretations. Privacy laws, including laws enforcing a “right to be forgotten” by 
consumers are changing and evolving globally . Governments, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly 
scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data. New laws and industry self-regulatory 
codes have been enacted and more are being considered that may affect our ability to reach current and prospective customers, to 
understand how our products and services are being used, to respond to customer requests allowed under the laws, and to implement 
our new business models effectively . Any perception of our practices, products or services as an invasion of privacy , whether or 
not consistent with current regulations and industry practices, may subject us to public criticism, class action lawsuits, reputational 
harm or claims by regulators, industry groups or other third parties, all of which could disrupt our business and expose us to 
increased liability . Additionally , both laws regulating privacy , as well as third-party products purporting to address privacy concerns, 
could affect the functionality of and demand for our products and services, thereby harming our revenue.
On behalf of certain customers, we collect and store anonymous and personal information derived from the activities of 
end users with various channels, including traditional websites, mobile websites and applications, email interactions, direct mail, 
point of sale, text messaging and call centers. Federal, state and foreign governments and agencies have adopted or are considering 
adopting laws regarding the collection, use and disclosure of this information. Our compliance with privacy laws and regulations 
and our reputation among consumers depend in part on our customers’  adherence to privacy laws and regulations and their use of 
our services in ways consistent with such consumers’  expectations. We also rely on contractual representations made to us by 
customers that their own use of our services and the information they provide to us via our services do not violate any applicable 
privacy laws, rules and regulations or their own privacy policies. We contractually obligate customers to represent to us that they 
provide their consumers the opportunity to “opt out” of the information collection associated with our services, as applicable. We 
do not formally audit such customers to confirm compliance with these representations. If these representations are false or if our 
customers do not otherwise comply with applicable privacy laws, we could face adverse publicity and possible legal or other 
regulatory action. In addition, some countries are considering enacting laws that would expand the scope of privacy-related 
obligations required of service providers, such as Adobe, that would require additional compliance expense and increased liability .
 In the past we have relied on the U.S.-European Union and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks, as agreed to by the 
U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Union (“EU”) and Switzerland as a means to legally transfer European personal 
information from Europe to the United States. However , on October 6, 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated the U.S.-
EU Safe Harbor framework and the Swiss data protection authorities later invalidated the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor framework. As 
a result, we have been establishing alternate legitimate means of transferring personal data from the European Economic Area to 
the United States. The legitimacy of these alternate means are subject to differing interpretations among various European 
jurisdictions.  The requirements or rulings of these jurisdictions may reduce demand for our services, restrict our ability to offer 
services in certain locations, impact our customers’  ability to deploy our solutions in Europe, or subject us to sanctions, including 
fines and a prohibition on data transfers, by EU data protection regulators. Furthermore, the European Court of Justice’ s decision 
may result in different European data protection regulators applying differing standards for the transfer of personal data, which 
could result in increased regulation, cost of compliance and limitations on data transfer for us and our customers. These developments 
could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We may incur losses associated with currency fluctuations and may not be able to effectively hedge our exposure.
Because our products are distributed and used globally , our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency 
exchange rates. We attempt to mitigate a portion of these risks through foreign currency hedging, based on our judgment of the 
appropriate trade-of fs among risk, opportunity and expense. We have established a program to partially hedge our exposure to 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for various currencies. We regularly review our hedging program and make adjustments 
as necessary based on the factors discussed above. Our hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial 
impact resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our financial 
condition or results of operations.
25If we fail to process transactions effectively , our revenue and earnings may be harmed.
We process a significant volume of transactions on a daily basis in both our Digital Marketing and Digital Media businesses. 
Due to the size and volume of transactions that we handle, effective processing systems and controls are essential, but even the 
most sophisticated systems and processes may not be effective in preventing all errors. The systems supporting our business are 
comprised of multiple technology platforms that may be difficult to scale. If we are unable to effectively manage these systems 
and processes, we may be unable to process customer data in an accurate, reliable and timely manner , which may harm our customer 
relationships or results of operations.
Failure to manage our sales and distribution channels and third-party customer service and technical support providers 
effectively could result in a loss of revenue and harm to our business.
We contract with a number of software distributors, none of which is individually responsible for a material amount of our 
total net revenue for any recent period. If any single agreement with one of our distributors were terminated, any prolonged delay 
in securing a replacement distributor could have a negative impact on our results of operations.
Successfully managing our indirect channel efforts to reach various customer segments for our products and services is a 
complex process across the broad range of geographies where we do business or plan to do business. Our distributors and other 
channel partners are independent businesses that we do not control. Notwithstanding the independence of our channel partners, 
we face potential legal risk and reputational harm from the activities of these third parties including, but not limited to, export 
control violations, workplace conditions, corruption and anti-competitive behavior . We cannot be certain that our distribution 
channel will continue to market or sell our products and services effectively . If our distribution channel is not successful, we may 
lose sales opportunities, customers and revenue. 
Our distributors also sell our competitors’  products and services, and if they favor our competitors’  products or services for 
any reason, they may fail to market our products or services effectively or to devote resources necessary to provide effective sales, 
which would cause our results to suffer. We also distribute some products and services through our OEM channel, and if our OEMs 
decide not to bundle our applications on their devices, our results could suffer. 
In addition, the financial health of our distributors and our continuing relationships with them are important to our success. 
Some of these distributors may be adversely impacted by changes to our business model or unable to withstand adverse changes 
in economic conditions, which could result in insolvency and/or the inability of such distributors to obtain credit to finance purchases 
of our products and services. In addition, weakness in the end-user market could negatively affect the cash flows of our distributors 
who could, in turn, delay paying their obligations to us, which would increase our credit risk exposure. Our business could be 
harmed if the financial condition of some of these distributors substantially weakened and we were unable to timely secure 
replacement distributors.
We also sell certain of our products and services through our direct sales force. Risks associated with this sales channel 
include longer sales and collection cycles associated with direct sales efforts, challenges related to hiring, retaining and motivating 
our direct sales force, and substantial amounts of training for sales representatives, including regular updates to cover new and 
upgraded systems, products and services. Moreover , recent hires may not become as productive as we would like, as in most cases 
it takes a significant period of time before they achieve full productivity . Our business could be seriously harmed if our expansion 
efforts do not generate a corresponding significant increase in revenue and we are unable to achieve the efficiencies we anticipate. 
In addition, the loss of key sales employees could impact our customer relationships and future ability to sell to certain accounts 
covered by such employees.
We also provide products and services, directly and indirectly , to a variety of government entities, both domestically and 
internationally . Risks associated with licensing and selling products and services to government entities include longer sales cycles, 
varying governmental budgeting processes and adherence to complex procurement regulations and other government-specific 
contractual requirements. Ineffectively managing these risks could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative 
sanctions, including termination of contracts, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business, 
as well as harm to our reputation. 
We outsource a substantial portion of our customer service and technical support activities to third-party service providers. 
We rely heavily on these third-party customer service and technical support representatives working on our behalf, and we expect 
to continue to rely heavily on third parties in the future. This strategy provides us with lower operating costs and greater flexibility , 
but also presents risks to our business due to the fact that we may not be able to influence the quality of support as directly as we 
would be able to do if our own employees performed these activities. Our customers may react negatively to providing information 
to, and receiving support from, third-party organizations, especially if the third-party organizations are based overseas. If we 
encounter problems with our third-party customer service and technical support providers, our reputation may be harmed and we 
could lose customers and associated revenue.
26Certain of our enterprise offerings have extended and complex sales cycles.
Sales cycles for some of our enterprise offerings, including our Adobe Marketing Cloud Solutions and ETLAs in our Digital 
Media business, are multi-phased and complex. The complexity in these sales cycles is due to a number of factors, including:
• the need for our sales representatives to educate customers about the use and benefit of our large-scale deployments of 
our products and services, including technical capabilities, security features, potential cost savings and return on 
investment;
• the desire of large and medium size organizations to undertake significant evaluation processes to determine their 
technology requirements prior to making information technology expenditures; 
• the need for our representatives to spend a significant amount of time assisting potential customers in their testing and 
evaluation of our products and services;
• the negotiation of large, complex, enterprise-wide contracts, as often required by our and our customers’  business and 
legal representatives;
• the need for our customers to obtain requisition approvals from various decision makers within their organizations; 
and
• customer budget constraints, economic conditions and unplanned administrative delays.
We spend substantial time and expense on our sales efforts without any assurance that potential customers will ultimately 
purchase our solutions.  As we target our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, these trends are expected to continue and could 
have a greater impact on our results of operations.  Additionally , our enterprise sales pattern has historically been uneven, where 
a higher percentage of a quarter ’s total sales occur during the final weeks of each quarter , which is common in our industry .  Our 
extended sales cycle for these products and services makes it difficult to predict when a given sales cycle will close.
Catastrophic events may disrupt our business.
We are a highly automated business and rely on our network infrastructure and enterprise applications, internal technology 
systems and our website for our development, marketing, operational, support, hosted services and sales activities. In addition, 
some of our businesses rely on third-party hosted services, and we do not control the operation of third-party data center facilities 
serving our customers from around the world, which increases our vulnerability . A disruption, infiltration or failure of these systems 
or third-party hosted services in the event of a major earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami or other weather event, power loss, 
telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, cyber -attack, war, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could 
cause system interruptions, reputational harm, loss of intellectual property , delays in our product development, lengthy interruptions 
in our services, breaches of data security and loss of critical data. Any of these events could prevent us from fulfilling our customers’  
orders or could negatively impact a country or region in which we sell our products, which could in turn decrease that country’ s 
or region’ s demand for our products. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, 
certain of our data centers and certain other critical business operations are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, and additional 
facilities where we conduct significant operations are located in the Salt Lake Valley Area, both of which are near major earthquake 
faults. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or 
information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future 
operating results could be adversely affected.
Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business.
 Access to clean water and reliable energy in the communities where we conduct our business, whether for our offices or 
for our vendors, is a priority .  Our major sites in California and India are vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change. 
 While we seek to partner with organizations that mitigate their business risks associated with climate change, we recognize that 
there are inherent risks wherever business is conducted.  In the event of a natural disaster that disrupts business due to limited 
access to these resources, Adobe has the potential to experience losses to our business, time required to recover , and added costs 
to resume operations.
 Additionally , climate change may pose regulatory and environmental challenges that af fect where we locate our 
offices, who we partner with, and how we deliver products and services to our customers.  
27Net revenue, margin or earnings shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to 
decline.
The market price for our common stock has in the past experienced significant fluctuations and may do so in the future. A 
number of factors may affect the market price for our common stock, including:
• shortfalls in our revenue, margins, earnings, the number of paid Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscribers, 
Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”), bookings within our Adobe Marketing Cloud business or other key 
performance metrics;
• changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;
• whether our results meet analysts’  expectations
• the announcement of new products and services, product enhancements or service introductions by us or our competitors;
• the loss of large customers or our inability to increase sales to existing customers, retain customers or attract new 
customers;
• variations in our or our competitors’  results of operations, changes in the competitive landscape generally and 
developments in our industry; and
• unusual events such as significant acquisitions, divestitures, litigation, general socio-economic, regulatory , political or 
market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance. 
We are subject to risks associated with compliance with laws and regulations globally which may harm our business.
We are a global company subject to varied and complex laws, regulations and customs, both domestically and internationally . 
These laws and regulations relate to a number of aspects of our business, including trade protection, import and export control, 
data and transaction processing security , payment card industry data security standards, records management, user-generated 
content hosted on websites we operate, privacy practices, data residency , corporate governance, employee and third-party 
complaints, gift policies, conflicts of interest, employment and labor relations laws, securities regulations and other regulatory 
requirements affecting trade and investment. The application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and 
may at times conflict. Compliance with these laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in our business 
practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability . Non-compliance could also result in fines, damages, criminal sanctions 
against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. We incur 
additional legal compliance costs associated with our global operations and could become subject to legal penalties if we fail to 
comply with local laws and regulations in U.S. jurisdictions or in foreign countries, which laws and regulations may be substantially 
different from those in the United States. In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common 
to engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. regulations applicable to us, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices 
Act. We cannot provide assurance that all of our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which we 
outsource certain of our business operations, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. 
laws may be customary , will not take actions in violation of our internal policies. Any such violation could have an adverse effect 
on our business.
We face various risks associated with our operating as a multinational corporation.
As a global business that generates approximately 42% of our total revenue from sales to customers outside of the Americas, 
we are subject to a number of risks, including:
• foreign currency fluctuations;
• changes in government preferences for software procurement;
• international and regional economic, political and labor conditions, including any instability or security concerns abroad;
• tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries);
• increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;
• unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements;
• changes in laws governing the free flow of data across international borders;
28• failure of laws to protect our intellectual property rights adequately;
• inadequate local infrastructure and difficulties in managing and staffing international operations;
• delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology , tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers;
• the imposition of governmental economic sanctions on countries in which we do business or where we plan to expand 
our business;
• operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices; and
• other factors beyond our control, including terrorism, war, natural disasters and pandemics.
If sales to any of our customers outside of the Americas are delayed or canceled because of any of the above factors, our 
revenue may decline.
In addition, approximately 53% of our employees are located outside the United States. Accordingly , we are exposed to 
changes in laws governing our employee relationships in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, including laws and regulations 
regarding wage and hour requirements, fair labor standards, employee data privacy , unemployment tax rates, workers’  compensation 
rates, citizenship requirements and payroll and other taxes, which likely would have a direct impact on our operating costs. We 
may continue to expand our international operations and international sales and marketing activities. Expansion in international 
markets has required, and will continue to require, significant management attention and resources. We may be unable to scale 
our infrastructure effectively or as quickly as our competitors in these markets, and our revenue may not increase to offset these 
expected increases in costs and operating expenses, which would cause our results to suffer. 
We have issued $1.9 billion  of notes in debt offerings and may incur other debt in the future, which may adversely affect our 
financial condition and future financial results. 
We have $1.9 billion  in senior unsecured notes outstanding. We also have a $1 billion  revolving credit facility , which is 
currently undrawn. This debt may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by, among other things: 
• requiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby 
reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions; 
and
• limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry .
Our senior unsecured notes and revolving credit facility impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance 
with specified covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach 
any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, any 
outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable. 
In addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our 
debt and equity securities, as well as the potential costs associated with a refinancing of our debt. Under certain circumstances, if 
our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility 
could increase. Downgrades in our credit ratings could also restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and could 
affect the terms of any such financing. 
Changes in accounting principles, or interpretations thereof, could have a significant impact on our financial position and 
results of operations.
We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America (“GAAP”). These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and 
create appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may 
even retroactively affect previously reported transactions. Additionally , the adoption of new or revised accounting principles may 
require that we make significant changes to our systems, processes and controls.
For example, the U.S.-based Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) is currently working together with the 
International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) on several projects to further align accounting principles and facilitate more 
comparable financial reporting between companies who are required to follow GAAP  under SEC regulations and those who are 
required to follow International Financial Reporting Standards outside of the United States. These efforts by the FASB and IASB 
may result in different accounting principles under GAAP  that may result in materially different financial results for us in areas 
including, but not limited to, principles for recognizing revenue and lease accounting. Additionally , significant changes to GAAP  
29resulting from the FASB’ s and IASB’ s efforts may require that we change how we process, analyze and report financial information 
and that we change financial reporting controls.
It is not clear if or when these potential changes in accounting principles may become effective, whether we have the proper 
systems and controls in place to accommodate such changes and the impact that any such changes may have on our financial 
position and results of operations.
If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we could be required to record a significant charge to earnings. 
Under GAAP , we review our goodwill and amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in 
circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. GAAP  requires us to test for goodwill impairment at least 
annually . Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable 
intangible assets may not be recoverable include declines in stock price, market capitalization or cash flows and slower growth 
rates in our industry . We could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period 
in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets were determined, negatively impacting our results of 
operations. 
Changes in tax rules and regulations, or interpretations thereof, may adversely affect our effective tax rates.
We are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant portion 
of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. In addition to providing for U.S. income 
taxes on earnings from the United States, we provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the 
subsidiaries’  earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the United States. While we do not anticipate changing our 
intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are 
repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. 
Our income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to 
discrete items and to earnings considered as permanently reinvested in foreign operations. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates 
could affect our future results of operations. Our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates 
in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in or our interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in 
which we do business, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, or by changes 
in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The United States, countries in the EU and other countries where we do 
business have been considering changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including 
changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as Adobe. These potential changes could adversely affect our 
effective tax rates or result in other costs to us.
In addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service 
(“IRS”) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities, including a current examination by the IRS of our fiscal 2010, 2011 and 
2012 tax returns. These tax examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other 
matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our 
provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from the current examinations. We cannot 
provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results 
and financial position.
If we are unable to recruit and retain key personnel, our business may be harmed.
Much of our future success depends on the continued service, availability and performance of our senior management. 
These individuals have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to Adobe. The loss of any of these individuals could 
harm our business, especially in the event that we have not been successful in developing adequate succession plans. Our business 
is also dependent on our ability to retain, hire and motivate talented, highly skilled personnel across all levels of our organization. 
Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense in 
many areas where our employees are located. If we are unable to continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel, our 
business may be harmed. Effective succession planning is also a key factor for our long-term success. Our failure to enable the 
effective transfer of knowledge and facilitate smooth transitions of our key employees could adversely affect our long-term strategic 
planning and execution.
We believe that a critical contributor to our success to date has been our corporate culture, which we have built to foster 
innovation, teamwork and employee satisfaction. As we grow , including from the integration of employees and businesses acquired 
in connection with previous or future acquisitions, we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture, 
which could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel who are essential to our future success.
30Our investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the financial markets.
Our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of November 27, 2015  consisted of corporate bonds and 
commercial paper , U.S. agency securities and U.S. Treasury securities, foreign government securities, money market mutual funds, 
municipal securities, time deposits and asset-backed securities. We follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines 
to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits 
our exposure to any one issuer , as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes.
Should financial market conditions worsen in the future, investments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising 
from market liquidity and credit concerns. In addition, any deterioration of the capital markets could cause our other income and 
expense to vary from expectations. As of November 27, 2015 , we had no material impairment charges associated with our short-
term investment portfolio, and although we believe our current investment portfolio has little risk of material impairment, we 
cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity , or credit availability , and can provide no assurance that our investment 
portfolio will remain materially unimpaired.

32ITEM 3.  LEGAL  PROCEEDINGS  
In connection with disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, 
including patent rights, we have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations or complex, protracted 
litigation. Intellectual property disputes and litigation may be very costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by 
diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel. Although we have successfully defended or 
resolved past litigation and disputes, we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation and disputes. Third-party intellectual 
property disputes could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable 
terms, prevent us from licensing certain of our products or offering certain of our services, subject us to injunctions restricting our 
sale of products or services, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy 
indemnification commitments with our customers including contractual provisions under various license arrangements and service 
agreements.
Between May 4, 2011 and July 14, 2011, five putative class action lawsuits were filed in Santa Clara Superior Court and 
Alameda Superior Court in California. On September 12, 2011, the cases were consolidated into In Re High-T ech Employee 
Antitrust Litigation (“HTEAL”) pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, San Jose 
Division. In the consolidated complaint, Plaintif fs alleged that Adobe, along with Apple, Google, Intel, Intuit, Lucasfilm and Pixar , 
agreed not to recruit each other ’s employees in violation of Federal and state antitrust laws. Plaintif fs claim the alleged agreements 
suppressed employee compensation and deprived employees of career opportunities. Plaintif fs seek injunctive relief, monetary 
damages, treble damages, costs and attorneys fees. All defendants deny the allegations and that they engaged in any wrongdoing 
of any kind. On October 24, 2013, the court certified a class of all persons who worked in the technical, creative, and/or research 
and development fields on a salaried basis in the United States for one or more of the following: (a) Apple from March 2005 
through December 2009; (b) Adobe from May 2005 through December 2009; (c) Google from March 2005 through December 
2009; (d) Intel from March 2005 through December 2009; (e) Intuit from June 2007 through December 2009; (f) Lucasfilm from 
January 2005 through December 2009; or (g) Pixar from January 2005 through December 2009, excluding retail employees, 
corporate officers, members of the boards of directors, and senior executives of all defendants. During the first quarter of fiscal 
2015, the parties reached an agreement to settle the litigation. In March 2015, the court granted preliminary approval of the 
settlement and on September 2, 2015, the court granted final approval of the settlement. We expect to incur no additional losses 
associated with this matter .
In addition to intellectual property disputes, we are subject to legal proceedings, claims and investigations in the ordinary 
course of business, including claims relating to commercial, employment and other matters. Some of these disputes and legal 
proceedings may include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We consider all claims on a 
quarterly basis in accordance with GAAP  and based on known facts assess whether potential losses are considered reasonably 
possible, probable and estimable. Based upon this assessment, we then evaluate disclosure requirements and whether to accrue 
for such claims in our financial statements. This determination is then reviewed and discussed with the Audit Committee of the 
Board of Directors and our independent registered public accounting firm.
We make a provision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss 
can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, 
settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Unless otherwise 
specifically disclosed in this note, we have determined that no provision for liability nor disclosure is required related to any claim 
against us because: (a) there is not a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding amounts already recognized (if any) may be 
incurred with respect to such claim; (b) a reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated; or (c) such estimate is 
immaterial.
All legal costs associated with litigation are expensed as incurred. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However , we 
believe that we have valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against us. It is possible, nevertheless, that our 
consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations could be negatively affected by an unfavorable resolution of 
one or more of such proceedings, claims or investigations.
In connection with our anti-piracy efforts, conducted both internally and through organizations such as the Business Software 
Alliance, from time to time we undertake litigation against alleged copyright infringers. Such lawsuits may lead to counter -claims 
alleging improper use of litigation or violation of other laws. We believe we have valid defenses with respect to such counter -
claims; however , it is possible that our consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations could be negatively 
affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these counter -claims.

35ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANAL YSIS OF FINANCIAL  CONDITION AND RESUL TS OF 
OPERA TIONS  
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.
ACQUISITIONS 
During fiscal 2015, we completed our acquisition of privately held Fotolia, a leading marketplace for royalty-free photos, 
images, graphics and HD videos, for $807.5 million . During fiscal 2015, we integrated Fotolia into our Digital Media reportable 
segment. 
During fiscal 2013, we completed our acquisitions of privately held Neolane, a leader in cross-channel campaign 
management technology for  $616.7 million , and privately held Behance, an online social media platform to showcase and discover 
creative work for $111.1 million . During fiscal 2013, we integrated Neolane and Behance into our Digital Marketing and Digital 
Media reportable segments, respectively . 
We also completed other immaterial business acquisitions during the fiscal years presented. Pro forma information has not 
been presented for any of our fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 acquisitions as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was 
not material.
See Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these acquisitions. 
CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMA TES
In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP  and pursuant to the rules and regulations of 
the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, 
and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical 
experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially 
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and 
estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, business 
combinations, goodwill impairment and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and 
estimates, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically , our assumptions, judgments and estimates 
relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.
Revenue Recognition
Our revenue is derived from the licensing of subscription, perpetual and time-based software products, associated software 
maintenance and support plans, non-software related hosted services, consulting services, training and technical support.
We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. 
Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have 
a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. 
We enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software, upgrades, 
maintenance and support, hosted services and consulting.
For our software and software-related multiple element arrangements, we must: (1) determine whether and when each 
element has been delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered 
products and services; (3) determine the fair value of each undelivered element using vendor -specific objective evidence (“VSOE”); 
and (4) allocate the total price among the various elements. VSOE of fair value is used to allocate a portion of the price to the 
undelivered elements and the residual method is used to allocate the remaining portion to the delivered elements. Absent VSOE, 
revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which VSOE of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all elements 
of the arrangement have been delivered. However , if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support, the entire 
arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. Changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the 
elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a 
particular period.
36We determine VSOE for each element based on historical stand-alone sales to third parties or from the stated renewal rate 
for the elements contained in the initial arrangement. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling 
prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range.
We have established VSOE for our software maintenance and support services, custom software development services, 
consulting services and training, when such services are sold optionally with software licenses.
For multiple-element arrangements containing our non-software services, we must: (1) determine whether and when each 
element has been delivered; (2) determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of VSOE of selling price, 
third-party evidence (“TPE”) of selling price or best-estimated selling price (“BESP”), as applicable; and (3) allocate the total 
price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method.
For multiple-element arrangements that contain both software and non-software elements, we allocate revenue to software 
or software-related elements as a group and any non-software elements separately based on the selling price hierarchy . We determine 
the selling price for each deliverable using VSOE of selling price, if it exists, or TPE of selling price. If neither VSOE nor TPE 
of selling price exist for a deliverable, we use BESP . Once revenue is allocated to software or software-related elements as a group, 
we recognize revenue in conformance with software revenue accounting guidance. Revenue is recognized when revenue recognition 
criteria are met for each element.
We are generally unable to establish VSOE or TPE for non-software elements and as such, we use BESP . BESP  is generally 
used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand-alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings. We determine BESP  
for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, major product groupings, geographies, market 
conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. Pricing practices taken into 
consideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable and our price lists. We must estimate 
certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. While we believe we can make 
reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly , our assumptions and judgments 
regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially 
impacting our financial position and results of operations.
Product revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met. We reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future 
returns, price protection and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded. In determining our estimate for returns and in 
accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by 
our distributors on which we have recognized revenue, we rely upon historical data, the estimated amount of product inventory 
in our distribution channel, the rate at which our product sells through to the end user, product plans and other factors. Our estimated 
provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs. Product returns may be more or less than what was estimated. The 
amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated. Our estimate of the rate of sell-through for product 
in the channel could be different than what actually occurs. There could be a delay in the release of our products. These factors 
and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns, 
thus impacting our financial position and results of operations.
In the future, actual returns and price protection may exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels 
are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms, 
product updates or competing products. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates 
are inherently subjective. Accordingly , if our estimates change, our returns and price protection reserves would change, which 
would impact the total net revenue we report.
We recognize revenue for hosted services that are based on a committed number of transactions ratably beginning on the 
date the services are first made available to the customer and continuing through the end of the contractual service term. Over -
usage fees, and fees billed based on the actual number of transactions from which we capture data, are billed in accordance with 
contract terms as these fees are incurred. We record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue 
or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.
Our consulting revenue is recognized on a time and materials basis and is measured monthly based on input measures, such 
as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as 
contract milestones, when applicable.
Business Combinations
We allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, 
assumed equity awards, as well as to in-process research and development based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition 
37date. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the 
acquisition date with respect to intangible assets, deferred revenue obligations and equity assumed. 
Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical 
experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not 
limited to:
• future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and 
acquired developed technologies and patents;
• expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated 
cash flows from the projects when completed;
• the acquired company’ s trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade 
name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined company’ s product portfolio; and
• discount rates.
In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue 
obligations assumed. The estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost 
build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. 
The estimated costs to fulfill the obligations are based on the historical costs related to fulfilling the obligations.
In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the equity awards 
assumed. The estimated fair value is determined utilizing a modified binomial option pricing model which assumes employees 
exercise their stock options when the share price exceeds the strike price by a certain dollar threshold. If the acquired company 
has significant historical data on their employee’ s exercise behavior , then this threshold is determined based upon the acquired 
company’ s history . Otherwise, our historical exercise experience is used to determine the exercise threshold. Zero coupon yields 
implied by U.S. Treasury issuances, implied volatility for our common stock and our historical forfeiture rate are other inputs to 
the binomial model.
Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates 
or actual results.
Goodwill Impairment
We complete our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis, during the second quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently , 
if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may 
exist. In order to estimate the fair value of goodwill, we typically estimate future revenue, consider market factors and estimate 
our future cash flows. Based on these key assumptions, judgments and estimates, we determine whether we need to record an 
impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value. Assumptions, judgments 
and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external 
factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts. 
Although we believe the assumptions, judgme nts and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, 
different assumptions, judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results.
We completed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2015  and determined there was no impairment. 
The results of our annual impairment test indicate that the fair values of our reporting units are significantly in excess of their 
carrying values.
Accounting for  Income Taxes
We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized 
for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized 
for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and 
liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates 
to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance 
to be recorded against a deferred tax asset.
Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax 
laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic 
38tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could 
be challenged by tax authorities. In addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and 
other domestic and foreign tax authorities, including a current examination by the IRS of our fiscal 2010, 2011 and 2012 tax 
returns. We expect future examinations to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. We regularly 
assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from the current examinations. We believe such estimates to be 
reasonable; however ,  the final determination of any of these examinations could significantly impact the amounts provided for 
income taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the 
amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations or capital gains income. Actual operating results 
and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates 
of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our 
actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.
We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant 
portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. In addition to providing for U.S. 
income taxes on earnings from the United States, we provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless 
the subsidiaries’  earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the United States. While we do not anticipate changing 
our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested 
are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. 
Our income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to 
discrete items and to earnings considered as permanently reinvested in foreign operations. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates 
could affect our future results of operations. Our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax 
rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in, or our interpretation of, tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions 
in which we do business, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, or by 
changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The United States, countries in the European Union and other 
countries where we do business have been considering changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and 
interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as Adobe. These potential changes could 
adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in other costs to us.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
On November 20, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet 
Classification of Deferred Taxes, requiring all deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any related valuation allowance, to be classified 
as non-current on the balance sheet. The classification change for all deferred taxes as non-current simplifies entities’  processes 
as it eliminates the need to separately identify the net current and net non-current deferred tax asset or liability in each jurisdiction 
and allocate valuation allowances. We elected to prospectively adopt the accounting standard in the beginning of our fourth quarter 
of fiscal 2015. Prior periods in our Consolidated Financial Statements were not retrospectively adjusted. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective
On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, requiring an entity to 
recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. 
The updated standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP  when it becomes effective and 
permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 
2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date, which deferred the effective date of the new 
revenue standard for periods beginning after December 15, 2016 to December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted but not 
earlier than the original effective date. Accordingly , the updated standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We 
have not yet selected a transition method and we are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our 
Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.
With the exception of the new revenue standard discussed above, there have been no new accounting pronouncements not 
yet effective that have significance, or potential significance, to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
39RESUL TS OF  OPERA TIONS
Overview of 2015
For fiscal 2015, we reported financial results consistent with the continued execution of our long-term plans for our two 
strategic growth areas, Digital Media and Digital Marketing, while continuing to market and license a broad portfolio of products 
and solutions.
In our Digital Media segment, we are a market leader with Adobe Creative Cloud, our subscription-based offering for 
creating and publishing content and applications. Creative Cloud, first delivered in May 2012, is our next-generation offering that 
supersedes our historical model of licensing our creative products with perpetual licenses. Creative Cloud delivers value through 
more frequent product updates, storage and access to user files stored in the cloud with syncing of files across users' machines, 
access to marketplace, social and community-based features with our Adobe Stock and Behance services, app creation capabilities 
and lower entry point pricing for cost-sensitive customers.
We offer Creative Cloud for individuals and for teams, and we enable larger enterprise customers to acquire Creative Cloud 
capabilities through Enterprise Term License Agreements (“ETLAs”). The three Creative Cloud offerings address the multiple 
routes to market we use to license our creative software to targeted customers. Adoption of Creative Cloud has transformed our 
business model, and we continue to expect this to drive higher long-term revenue growth through an expansion of our customer 
base by acquiring new users through a lower cost of entry and delivery of additional features and value, as well as keeping existing 
customers current on our latest release. We have also built out a marketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers, most notably with 
our acquisition of Fotolia in January of 2015, to enable the delivery and purchase of stock assets in our new service called Adobe 
Stock.  Overall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, attract more new 
customers, and shift our revenue to be more recurring and predictable as revenue is recognized ratably .
We continue to implement strategies that will accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our 
Creative Cloud offering. These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive such as offering new mobile 
applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to try out and ultimately 
subscribe to Creative Cloud.  Because of the shift towards Creative Cloud subscriptions and ETLAs, perpetual revenue for older 
Creative products has continued to decline, and revenue from perpetual licensing of these products was immaterial for fiscal 2015.
We are also a market leader with our Document Cloud offerings built around our Acrobat family of products, the Adobe 
Reader DC and a set of integrated cloud-based document services, including Adobe eSign. Adobe Acrobat provides reliable creation 
and exchange of electronic documents, regardless of platform or application source type.  In the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we 
delivered the next generation of this offering called Adobe Document Cloud, which we believe enhances the way people manage 
critical documents at home, in the office and across devices.  Adobe Document Cloud includes all-new Adobe Acrobat DC and 
Adobe eSign releases and a set of integrated services enable users to create, review , approve, sign and track documents whether 
on a desktop or mobile device. Acrobat DC, with a touch-enabled user interface, is licensed both through subscription and perpetual 
pricing.
Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) is currently our key performance metric to assess the health and trajectory of our 
overall Digital Media segment. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue 
as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. We plan to adjust our reported ARR 
on an annual basis to reflect any material exchange rates changes. We calculate ARR as follows:
Creative ARRAnnual Value of Creative Cloud Subscriptions and Services
+ 
Annual Digital Publishing Suite Contract Value 
+ 
Annual Creative ETLA  Contract Value 
Document Cloud ARRAnnual Value of Document Cloud Subscriptions and Services

Document Cloud ARR
40Total Creative ARR exiting fiscal 2015 was $2.60 billion , up from $1.61 billion  at the end of fiscal 2014. We exited fiscal 
2015 with 6.167 million  paid Creative Cloud subscriptions, up 78% from 3.458 million  at the end of fiscal 2014. 
Our Digital Media segment also includes our Document Cloud products and solutions, including our newly released Acrobat 
DC product which helped grow Document Cloud ARR to $397 million  exiting fiscal 2015, up from $265 million  at the end of 
fiscal 2014.
Total Digital Media ARR grew to approximately $3.00 billion  at the end of fiscal 2015, up from $1.88 billion  at the end of 
fiscal 2014, demonstrating the progress we have made with the transformation of our business to a more recurring, ratable and 
predictable revenue model. Our reported ARR results in fiscal 2015 are based on currency rates set at the start of fiscal 2015 and 
held constant throughout the year. Revaluing our ending ARR for fiscal 2015 using currency rates at the beginning of fiscal 2016, 
our Digital Media ARR at the end of fiscal 2015 would be $2.88 billion  or approximately $114 million  lower than the ARR reported 
above.
We are a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by our Digital Marketing segment. Our Adobe Marketing 
Cloud now includes eight solutions which address the expanding needs of marketers.  In fiscal 2015, we achieved record Marketing 
Cloud revenue of  $1.36 billion , which represents 16% year-over -year revenue growth. In addition, we drove strong demand and 
bookings growth for our Marketing Cloud solutions, which we expect will positively benefit revenue growth in future quarters.
Financial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2015
• During fiscal 2015 , our subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased  to 67% from 50% compared 
with fiscal 2014 , as we transitioned more of our business to a subscription-based model.
• Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $3.00 billion  as of November 27, 2015  increased  by $1.12 billion , or 60%, 
from $1.88 billion  as of November 28, 2014 . The change in our Digital Media ARR was primarily due to increases in 
the number of paid Creative Cloud individual and team subscriptions and continued adoption of our ETLAs, and to a 
lesser extent, the adoption of our Document Cloud offering through our ETLAs and increases in Document Cloud 
subscriptions. 
• Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $1.36 billion  increased  by $188.5 million , or 16%, during fiscal 2015 , from $1.17 
billion  in fiscal 2014 . The increases were primarily due to continued adoption of our Adobe Experience Manager 
(“AEM”) offering and increases in Adobe Campaign and Adobe Analytics revenue.
• Our total deferred revenue of $1.49 billion  as of November 27, 2015  increased  by $330.0 million , or 29%, from $1.16 
billion  as of November 28, 2014 , primarily due to increases in Creative Cloud individual and team subscriptions, 
ETLAs and new contracts and existing renewals for our Adobe Marketing Cloud services. Also contributing to the 
increase in deferred revenue were the increases associated with our stock photography offering from the acquisition 
of Fotolia in fiscal 2015.
• Cost of revenue of $744.3 million  increased  by $122.2 million , or 20%, during fiscal 2015 , from $622.1 million  in 
fiscal 2014 . The increases were primarily due to increases in costs associated with compensation and related benefits 
driven by additional headcount and costs of professional services driven by the increase in our professional services 
business.
• Operating expenses of $3.15 billion  increased  by $35.8 million  during fiscal 2015 , from $3.11 billion  in fiscal 2014 . 
The increase is due to higher costs associated with compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount 
and amortization of intangibles from the Fotolia acquisition in fiscal 2015. 
• Net income of $629.6 million  increased  by $361.2 million , or 135% , during fiscal 2015  from $268.4 million  in fiscal 
2014  primarily due to revenue growth. 
• Net cash flow from operations of $1.47 billion  during fiscal 2015  increased  by $182.0 million , or 14%, from $1.29 
billion  during fiscal 2014  primarily due to higher net income.

Fiscal 2015 Revenue Compar ed to Fiscal 2014 Revenue
Digital Media
Revenue from Digital Media increased  $492.0 million  during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily driven by 
increases in revenue associated with our creative offerings due to continued strong adoption of Creative Cloud. Document Cloud 
revenue remained stable during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.
Creative revenue, which includes our Creative Cloud and perpetual creative offerings, increased during fiscal 2015 as 
compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the increase in subscription revenue associated with our Creative Cloud offerings driven 
by the increase in number of paid Creative Cloud team, individual and enterprise subscriptions. The increases associated with our 
creative products were offset in part by expected declines in revenue associated with our perpetual creative offerings.
Document Cloud revenue, which includes our Acrobat product family , remained stable during fiscal 2015 as compared to 
the year ago period, as increases in revenue associated with eSign and our Document Cloud subscription offering were offset by 
decreases in revenue associated with our Document Cloud perpetual license offerings. Driving the increase in our Document Cloud 
subscription revenue was the adoption of our cloud offering through subscriptions and ETLAs.
Digital Marketing
Revenue from Digital Marketing increased  $153.7 million  during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to 
continued revenue growth associated with our Adobe Marketing Cloud, which increased 16% as compared with the year-ago 
period. Contributing to this increase was the continued adoption of our AEM term-based offering, and to a lesser extent, increases 
in revenue associated with Adobe Campaign, Adobe Analytics and Adobe Target. 
Print and Publishing
Revenue from Print and Publishing remained stable during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.
Fiscal 2014 Revenue Compar ed to Fiscal 2013 Revenue
Digital Media
Revenue from Digital Media decreased slightly during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. The slight decrease was 
primarily driven by declines in revenue associated with our perpetual creative offerings, distribution of third-party software 
downloads and Hobbyist products launched in fiscal 2013. With respect to the Hobbyist product revenue decline, we began actively 
migrating customers to our Creative Cloud Photography Plan in fiscal 2014, for which revenue is recognized ratably . Largely 
offsetting these decreases were increases in Creative Cloud and Document Cloud revenue.
Creative revenue, which includes our Creative Cloud, Creative Suite editions and CS point products, decreased slightly 
during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due to decreases in revenue from CS point products and Creative Suite editions, as 
we discontinued the general availability of our perpetually licensed CS6 products in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. Also 
contributing to the decline in creative revenue were decreases in revenue associated with the distribution of third-party software 
downloads and Hobbyist products launched in fiscal 2013. Decreases were largely offset by increases in revenue from subscriptions 
and ETLAs and revenue from our Digital Publishing Suite. 
Document Cloud revenue, which includes our Acrobat product family , increased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 
2013 primarily due to increases in our Document Cloud subscription revenue.  Increases were slightly offset by decreases due to 
our continued shift to ETLAs.
43Digital Marketing
Revenue from Digital Marketing increased $126.3 million during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due to continued 
revenue growth associated with our Adobe Marketing Cloud, which increased 15% during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. 
Contributing to this increase was Adobe Campaign and the strong adoption of AEM.
Print and Publishing
Revenue from Print and Publishing decreased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to decreases in 
legacy product revenue and increased ETLAs for certain products in this group.

Fiscal 2015 Revenue by Geography Compar ed to Fiscal 2014 Revenue by Geography
Revenue increased in the Americas and EMEA  during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 while revenue in APAC 
remained stable during fiscal 2015 compared with the year-ago period. Revenue in the Americas and EMEA  increased primarily 
due to growth in Digital Media and Digital Marketing revenue. The overall increase in EMEA  revenue was slightly offset by 
declines due to strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro, British Pound and other EMEA  currencies in fiscal 2015. Within 
the Americas and EMEA, fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment were attributable to the factors noted in the segment 
information above.
 Revenue in APAC remained stable during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 due to an increase in Digital Marketing 
revenue offset by a decrease in Digital Media revenue.The increase in Digital Marketing revenue in APAC was attributable to the 
factors noted in the segment information above. The decline in Digital Media revenue was primarily due to expected decreases 
in perpetual license revenue, partially offset by increases in subscription revenue during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. 
Fiscal 2014 Revenue by Geography Compar ed to Fiscal 2013 Revenue by Geography
Overall revenue increased in the Americas and EMEA  during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. Revenue in the 
Americas increased due to growth in Digital Media and Digital Marketing revenue. Revenue in EMEA  increased primarily due 
to growth in Digital Marketing revenue. Digital Media and Print and Publishing revenue in EMEA  remained relatively stable. 
Despite strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and the British Pound during the latter part of fiscal 2014, the overall 
weakening of the U.S. Dollar against these currencies during fiscal 2014 also caused revenue in EMEA  to increase as compared 
to fiscal 2013. Within the Americas and EMEA, the fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment were attributable to the factors 
noted in the segment information above. 
Revenue in APAC decreased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily as a result of decreases in Digital 
Media revenue due to slower adoption of Creative Cloud in Japan compared to other countries and the strengthening of the U.S. 
Dollar against the Japanese Yen and other Asian currencies. Digital Marketing and Print and Publishing revenue in APAC remained 
relatively stable during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013.
44Included in the overall change in revenue for fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014  were impacts associated with foreign currency as 
shown below . Our currency hedging program is used to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency impact to revenue.

 During fiscal 2015, the U.S. Dollar strengthened against the Euro, British Pound, Japanese Yen and other Asian currencies 
causing revenue in EMEA  and APAC measured in U.S. Dollar equivalents to decrease as compared to fiscal 2014. These decreases 
were partially offset by hedging gains from our EMEA  currencies and Japanese Yen hedging programs during fiscal 2015. 
During fiscal 2014, the U.S. Dollar strengthened against the Japanese Yen and other Asian currencies causing revenue in 
APAC measured in U.S. Dollar equivalents to decrease compared to fiscal 2013. This decrease was offset in part by the favorable 
impact to revenue measured in EMEA  currencies as the U.S. Dollar weakened against the Euro and the British Pound for the 
majority of fiscal 2014. Our EMEA  and Yen currency hedging programs resulted in hedging gains during fiscal 2014.
See Note 18 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further geographic information.
Product Backlog
The actual amount of product backlog at any particular time may not be a meaningful indicator of future business prospects. 
Shippable backlog is comprised of unfulfilled orders, excluding those associated with new product releases, those pending credit 
review and those not shipped due to the application of our global inventory policy . We had minimal shippable backlog at the end 
of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014 . We expect that our shippable backlog will continue to be insignificant in future 
periods.
Deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year , non-
cancelable commercial subscription agreements or government contracts with fiscal funding clauses. Unbilled deferred revenue 
represents expected future billings which are contractually committed under our existing subscription, SaaS and managed services 
agreements that have not been invoiced and are not recorded in deferred revenue within our financial statements. Our presentation 
of unbilled deferred revenue backlog may differ from that of other companies in the industry . As of November 27, 2015 , we had 
unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately $2.89 billion  of which approximately 40% to 50% is not reasonably expected 
to be billed during fiscal 2016. As of November 28, 2014 , we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately $2.19 
billion , which has been updated to include $433 million  of individual annual subscriptions which were not captured in the prior 
year due to current year enhancements to our management reporting system. 
We expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue backlog will change from period to period due to certain factors, 
including the timing and duration of large customer subscription, SaaS and managed service agreements, varying billing cycles 
of these agreements, the timing of customer renewals, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue backlog is to be billed, changes 
in customer financial circumstances and foreign currency fluctuations. Additionally , the unbilled deferred revenue backlog for 
multi-year subscription agreements that are billed annually is typically higher at the beginning of the contract period, lower prior 
to renewal and typically increases when the agreement is renewed. Accordingly , fluctuations in unbilled deferred revenue backlog 
may not be a reliable indicator of future business prospects and the related revenue associated with these contractual commitments.

Cost of subscription revenue consists of third-party royalties and expenses related to operating our network infrastructure, 
including depreciation expenses and operating lease payments associated with computer equipment, data center costs, salaries and 
related expenses of network operations, implementation, account management and technical support personnel, amortization of 
intangible assets and allocated overhead. We enter into contracts with third parties for the use of their data center facilities and 
our data center costs largely consist of amounts we pay to these third parties for rack space, power and similar items.

Total change ......................................................................................................................... 22% 21%
Cost of subscription revenue increased during fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  primarily due to data center costs, 
compensation and related benefits, royalty cost, depreciation expense, and purchased intangible amortization. Data center costs 
increased primarily due to higher transaction volumes in our Adobe Marketing Cloud and Creative Cloud services. Depreciation 
expense increased primarily due to higher capital expenditures in recent periods as we continue to invest in our network and data 
center infrastructure to support the growth of our subscription and hosted services business. Royalty cost increased primarily due 
to increases in subscriptions and downloads of our SaaS offerings and increased royalties due to the introduction of our stock 
photography offering from our acquisition of Fotolia in fiscal 2015. Amortization of purchased intangibles increased primarily 
due to amortization of intangibles acquired from our acquisition of Fotolia in fiscal 2015. 
Cost of subscription revenue increased during fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  primarily due to data center costs, 
compensation and related benefits, depreciation expense, and royalty cost. Data center costs increased primarily due to higher 
transaction volumes in our Adobe Marketing Cloud and Creative Cloud services. Compensation cost and related benefits increased 
primarily due to additional headcount in fiscal 2014, including from our acquisition of Neolane in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. 
Depreciation expense increased primarily due to higher capital expenditures as we continued to invest in our network and data 
center infrastructure to support the growth of our business. Royalty cost increased primarily due to increases in subscriptions and 
downloads of our SaaS offerings.
Product
 Cost of product revenue includes product packaging, third-party royalties, excess and obsolete inventory , amortization 
related to localization costs, purchased intangibles and acquired rights to use technology and the costs associated with the 
manufacturing of our products.
46Fluctuations in cost of product revenue are due to the following:

Various individually insignificant items ................................................................................. (1) (5)
Total change ......................................................................................................................... (7)% (30)%
Cost of product revenue decreased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to decreases in excess and 
obsolete inventory , cost of sales and amortization of purchased intangibles, partially offset by an increase in royalty cost. The 
increase in royalty cost was driven by royalty payments related to our stock photography perpetual offering from our acquisition 
of Fotolia in fiscal 2015. 
Cost of product revenue decreased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to decreases in amortization 
of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements, cost of sales and royalty cost, slightly offset by an increase in 
excess and obsolete inventory . Amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements decreased as we entered 
into certain technology licensing arrangements for which payments of $26.5 million related to historical use of certain technology 
licensing arrangements were expensed as cost of product revenue during fiscal 2013. Cost of sales decreased due to decreases in 
the number of perpetual units sold and associated packaging costs as we continued to focus our development and sales efforts on 
Creative Cloud. Royalty cost decreased primarily due to decreases in revenue from our perpetual offerings. Excess and obsolete 
inventory increased as a result of changes in reserve requirements for CS6 shrink boxes as we discontinued the general availability 
of CS6 on a perpetual licensing basis.
Services and Support
Cost of services and support revenue is primarily comprised of employee-related costs and associated costs incurred to 
provide consulting services, training and product support.
Cost of services and support revenue increased in all periods presented due to increases in compensation and related benefits 
driven by additional headcount and third-party fees to support the increase in our professional services business.

47Resear ch and Development, Sales and Marketing and General and Administrative Expenses 
Research and development and sales and marketing expenses increased slightly during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 
2014 primarily due to increases in compensation and related benefits associated with headcount. General and administrative 
expenses decreased slightly during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the reversal of a previously anticipated 
loss associated with the HTEAL  proceedings, offset in part by increases in compensation and related benefits associated with 
headcount. 
The increase in research and development and general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 
2013 was primarily due to increases in cash incentive and stock-based compensation. The increase in stock-based compensation 
was driven by a change in the vesting term for stock awards granted as part of our annual review process beginning in fiscal 2013, 
which decreased the term from four years to three years. The increase in sales and marketing expense during fiscal 2014 as 
compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to compensation and related benefits associated with additional headcount.
Resear ch and Development 
Research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit expenses for software developers, contracted 
development efforts, related facilities costs and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development.

We believe that investments in research and development, including the recruiting and hiring of software developers, are 
critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced 
products, subscription and solution offerings. We will continue to focus on long-term opportunities available in our end markets 
and make significant investments in the development of our application, tool, subscription and service offerings.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit expenses, sales commissions, travel expenses and 
related facilities costs for our sales, marketing, order management and global supply chain management personnel. Sales and 
marketing expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as advertising, trade shows, public 
relations and other market development programs.

General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefit expenses, travel expenses and related

administrative expenses also include outside legal and accounting fees, provision for bad debts, expenses associated with computer 
equipment and software used in the administration of the business, charitable contributions and various forms of insurance.

The decrease in loss contingency during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 is due to the reversal of a previously

further information regarding the HTEAL  proceedings.
Restructuring and Other Char ges
During the past several years, we have initiated various restructuring plans consisting of reductions in workforce and the 
consolidation of facilities to better align our resources around our business strategies. As of November 27, 2015 , we considered 
all our restructuring plans to be substantially complete. We continue to make cash outlays to settle obligations under these plans, 
however the current impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements is not material.
During fiscal 2015, we recorded immaterial credits and charges to our restructuring plans. 
During fiscal 2014, in connection with our Fiscal 2014 Restructuring Plan, we recorded $19.4 million  associated with 
termination benefits and closing redundant facilities. In connection with our Other Restructuring Plans, we recorded insignificant 
charges associated with closing redundant facilities.
 During fiscal 2013, we sold land, building and other assets located in Waltham, Massachusetts for net proceeds of $24.3 
million . Because the total carrying amount of these assets was $47.4 million  at the time it was classified as held for sale, we 
recorded a write-down of $23.1 million during fiscal 2013. 
Also during fiscal 2013, in connection with our Fiscal 2011 Restructuring Plan and Other Restructuring Plans, we recorded 
immaterial charges and credits associated with termination benefits and closing redundant facilities during the fiscal year. 
See Note 10 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our restructuring plans.
Amortization of Pur chased Intangibles
During the last several years, we have completed a number of business combinations and asset acquisitions. As a result of 
these acquisitions, we purchased intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to 
fourteen  years.  
Amortization expense increased  during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to amortization expense 
associated with intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of Fotolia in fiscal 2015, partially offset by the decrease in 
amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of Efficient Frontier and Day 
Software Holding AG that were fully amortized at the end of fiscal 2014.
Amortization expense remained stable during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013.

Inter est and Other Income (Expense), Net  
Interest and other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed 
income investments. Interest and other income (expense), net also includes gains and losses on fixed income investments and 
foreign exchange gains and losses other than any gains recorded to revenue from our hedging programs.
Interest and other income (expense), net increased  in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the gain on 
the sale of certain property assets and, to a lesser extent, an increased average investment balance and average interest rate. See 
Note 6 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding the sale of our property assets.
Interest and other income (expense), net increased  in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to decreased 
foreign currency losses and increased realized gains on fixed income investments. The increases were partially offset by decreased 
interest income on our investment in lease receivable due to the purchase of the East and West Towers of our corporate headquarter 
offices during fiscal 2014. See Note 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding our 
investment in lease receivables.
Inter est Expense
Interest expense primarily represents interest associated with our senior notes and interest rate swaps. Interest on our senior 
notes is payable semi-annually , in arrears, on February 1 and August 1. Floating interest payments on the interest rate swaps are 
paid monthly . The fixed-rate interest receivable on the swaps is received semi-annually concurrent with the senior notes interest 
payments.
Interest expense increased  during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the increase in total debt, partially 
offset by the favorable impact of the interest rate swaps.  
Interest expense decreased  during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due to the favorable impact of the interest rate 
swaps.  See Notes 5 and 13 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding our interest rate swaps.  
Investment Gains (Losses), Net
Investment gains (losses), net consists principally of realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable equity investments, 
other -than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities and unrealized holding gains and 
losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities) and gains and losses associated with 
our direct and indirect investments in privately held companies. 
During fiscal 2015, total investment gains (losses), net remained stable compared to fiscal 2014.
During fiscal 2014, total investment gains (losses), net increased  to net gains primarily due to write-downs for other -than-
temporary declines in value of our direct investments in privately held companies in fiscal 2013 that did not recur in fiscal 2014, 
offset in part by a decrease in net gains related to our trading securities.

Effective tax rate ....................................................... 28% 26% 19%   
Our effective tax rate increased by approximately two percentage points during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. The 
increase was primarily due to tax costs associated with licensing acquired company assets to Adobe’ s trading companies. The 
increase was partially offset by tax benefits related to the reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit in 
December 2014. The reinstatement of the credit was retroactive to January 1, 2014. 
Our effective tax rate increased by approximately seven percentage points during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. 
The increase was primarily due to the expiration of the federal research and development tax credit in December 2013 and stronger 
domestic profits for fiscal 2014.
In December 2015, the United States Congress passed the permanent extension of the federal research and development 
tax credit. As a result, we expect that our income tax provision for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 will include a discrete tax benefit 
for the 2015 credit which will reduce our effective tax rate for the quarter and, to a lesser extent, the effective annual tax rate.
We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant 
portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. In addition to providing for U.S. 
income taxes on earnings from the United States, we provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless 
the subsidiaries’  earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the United States. While we do not anticipate changing 
our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested 
are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. Currently , there 
are a significant amount of foreign earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided. See Note 9 of our Notes to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our provision for income taxes.  
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
The gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at November 27, 2015  was $258.7 million , exclusive of interest and 
penalties. If the total unrecognized tax benefits at November 27, 2015  were recognized in the future, $220.2 million  of unrecognized 
tax benefits would decrease the effective tax rate, which is net of an estimated $38.5 million  federal benefit related to deducting 
certain payments on future federal and state tax returns.
As of November 27, 2015 , the combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax 
returns was approximately $27.8 million . This amount is included in non-current income taxes payable.
The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments 
that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of 
current and non-current assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain 
audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties 
described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging 
from $0 to approximately $10 million .

Our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. The primary uses of cash are payroll related expenses, general operating 
expenses including marketing, travel and office rent, and cost of revenue. Other sources of cash are proceeds from the exercise 
of employee options and participation in the employee stock purchase plan. Other uses of cash include our stock repurchase 
program, which is described below , business acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment. 
Cash Flows fr om Operating Activities
For fiscal 2015, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.47 billion  was primarily comprised of net income plus the 
net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred 
revenue, income taxes payable and trade payables. The increase in deferred revenue is primarily due to increased subscriptions 
for our team, individual and enterprise Creative Cloud offerings and increases in Digital Marketing hosted services. The increase 
in income taxes payable is primarily due to higher taxable income levels during fiscal 2015. Trade payables increased primarily 
due to the timing of payments to web services vendors as certain invoices were received in the final weeks of fiscal 2015. The 
primary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables which were principally due to higher revenue levels. 
For fiscal 2014, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.29 billion  was primarily comprised of net income plus the 
net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred 
revenue and accrued expenses. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscription and ETLA  activity 
for our individual, team and enterprise Creative Cloud offerings and increases in Digital Marketing and Digital Publishing hosted 
services, offset in part by decreases in billings for our maintenance and Creative product software upgrade plans which we 
discontinued in January 2013. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to accruals for contract terminations and employee 
transition payments associated with business realignment initiatives implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. 
For fiscal 2013, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.15 billion  was primarily comprised of net income plus the 
net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred 
revenue and accrued expenses and decreases in trade receivables. Deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased 
subscription and ETLA  activity for our Creative Cloud offering and increases in Digital Marketing hosted services, offset in part 
by decreases in billings for our maintenance and Creative product software upgrade plans which were discontinued in January 
2013. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to amounts due under our fiscal 2013 annual incentive plan and sales commission 
accruals associated with higher achievement levels. Trade receivables declined primarily due to lower perpetual license revenue 
levels and improved collections compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. 
The primary working capital uses of cash for fiscal 2013 were decreases in taxes payable and increases in prepaid expenses 
and other assets. The decrease in taxes payable was largely attributed to tax payments made combined with audit settlement 
adjustments, offset in part by tax expense and other adjustments during fiscal 2013. Prepaid expenses and other assets increased 
primarily due to increases in short-term income tax receivables related to the carryback of federal research and development and 
foreign tax credits in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.
52Cash Flows fr om Investing Activities
For fiscal 2015, net cash used for investing activities of $1.49 billion  was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments 
and our acquisition of Fotolia. Other uses of cash during fiscal 2015 represented purchases of property and equipment, and long-
term investments and other assets. These cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments and 
proceeds received from the sale of certain property assets. See Note 2 and Note 6 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for 
more detailed information regarding our acquisition of Fotolia and sale of property assets, respectively .
For fiscal 2014, net cash used for investing activities of $490.7 million  was primarily due to purchases of short-term 
investments, purchases of property and equipment and a business acquisition. These cash outflows were offset in part by sales 
and maturities of short-term investments.
For fiscal 2013, net cash used for investing activities of $1.18 billion  was primarily due to our acquisitions of Neolane and 
Behance. Other uses of cash during fiscal 2013 represented purchases of short-term investments, purchases of property and 
equipment associated with our construction projects in Oregon and India and purchases of long-term technology licenses. These 
cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments and the sale of certain property assets. See Note 
2 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information regarding our acquisitions of Neolane and 
Behance.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
In January 2015, we issued $1 billion  of 3.25%  senior notes due February 1, 2025  (the “2025 Notes”). Our proceeds were 
approximately $989.3 million  which is net of an issuance discount of $10.7 million . The 2025 Notes rank equally with our other 
unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $7.9 million  in connection with our 2025 
Notes. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2025 Notes using the 
effective interest method.
We used $600 million  of the proceeds from the 2025 Notes offering to repay the outstanding balance plus accrued and 
unpaid interest of the $600 million  3.25%  senior notes due February 1, 2015 (“2015 Notes”). The remaining proceeds were used 
for general corporate purposes.  See Note 16 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information. 
In addition to the 2025 Notes issuance and 2015 Notes repayment, other financing activities during fiscal 2015  include 
payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds 
from the issuance of treasury stock and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
 For fiscal 2014  and 2013 , net cash used for financing activities of $507.3 million  and $559.1 million , respectively , was 
primarily due to payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in 
part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. See the section titled 
“Stock Repur chase Program” discussed below .
We expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, venture capital, facilities 
expansion and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and 
administrative staff. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to 
strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business. 
Restructuring
During the past several years, we have initiated various restructuring plans. We consider our restructuring plans to be 
substantially complete.
As of November 27, 2015 , we have accrued total restructuring charges of $4.7 million , substantially all of which relate to 
the cost of closing redundant facilities and is expected to be paid under contract through fiscal 2021 for which approximately 75% 
will be paid through fiscal 2017. During fiscal 2015, we made payments related to our restructuring plans totaling $18.2 million  
which consisted of $16.6 million  in payments associated with termination benefits and contract terminations and the remaining 
payments related to the closing of redundant facilities.
As of November 28, 2014 , we had accrued total restructuring charges of $22.3 million  of which approximately $15.0 million  
related to termination benefits and contract terminations. The remaining accrued restructuring charges of $7.3 million  related to 
the cost of closing redundant facilities. During fiscal 2014, we made payments related to our restructuring plans totaling $11.0 
53million  which consisted of $5.7 million  and $5.3 million  in payments related to termination benefits and contract terminations 
and the closing of redundant facilities, respectively .
As of November 29, 2013 , we had accrued total restructuring charges of $13.9 million  of which approximately $11.7 million  
related to the cost of closing redundant facilities. The remaining accrued restructuring charges of $2.2 million  related to the cost 
of termination benefits and contract terminations. During fiscal 2013, we made payments related to our restructuring plans totaling 
$10.3 million  which primarily consisted of $9.0 million  in payments related to the closing of redundant facilities.
We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated from operations will be 
sufficient to meet cash outlays for the restructuring actions described above. 
See Note 10 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our restructuring 
plans.
Other  Liquidity and Capital Resour ces Considerations
Our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2016 due to changes in our planned 
cash outlay , including changes in incremental costs such as direct and integration costs related to our acquisitions. Our cash and 
investments totaled $3.99 billion  as of November 27, 2015 . Of this amount, approximately 85% was held by our foreign subsidiaries 
and subject to material repatriation tax effects. Our intent is to permanently reinvest a significant portion of our earnings from 
foreign operations, and current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our 
domestic operations. In the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the United States and if U.S. tax 
has not already been previously provided, we would provide for and pay additional U.S. taxes in connection with repatriating 
these funds.
Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed 
in Part I, Item 1A titled “Risk Factors”. However , based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our 
existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility 
will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. 
On March 2, 2012, we entered into a five-year $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (the “Credit 
Agreement”), providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries. On March 1, 2013, we exercised our option under the Credit 
Agreement to extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement by one year to March 2, 2018. On July 27, 2015, we entered into 
an amendment to further extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement to July 27, 2020 and reallocated the facility among the 
syndicate of lenders that are parties to the Credit Agreement. As of November 27, 2015 , there were no outstanding borrowings 
under this Credit Agreement and the entire $1 billion credit line remains available for borrowing. 
As of November 27, 2015 , the amount outstanding under our senior notes was $1.9 billion , consisting of $900 million  of 
4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the “2020 Notes”) and $1 billion  of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (together 
with the 2020 Notes, the “Notes”). 
Our short-term investment portfolio is primarily invested in corporate bonds and commercial paper , U.S. agency securities 
and U.S. Treasury securities, foreign government securities, municipal securities and asset-backed securities.W e use professional 
investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash. External investment firms managed, on average, 
57% of our consolidated invested balances during fiscal 2015 . 
Stock Repur chase Program
To facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock 
issuances, we may repurchase shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. In the 
first quarter of fiscal 2015, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program granting the Company authority to 
repurchase up to $2 billion  in common stock through the end of fiscal 2017. 
During fiscal 2015 , 2014  and 2013 , we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial 
institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $625 million , $600 million  and $1.1 billion , respectively . 
Of the $625 million  in prepayments made during fiscal 2015 , $425 million  were under the new $2 billion  stock repurchase program 
and the remaining $200 million  were under the previous $2 billion  authority . The $600 million  and $1.1 billion  in prepayments 
made during fiscal 2014  and 2013  were under the previous $2 billion  stock repurchase authority . We enter into these agreements 
in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average Price (“VW AP”) of 
our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher 
than our estimate of the foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit commissions 
54or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions 
to return any portion of the prepayment to us.
The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used 
to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the 
contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon 
discount. During fiscal 2015 , we repurchased approximately 8.1 million  shares at an average price of $77.38  through structured 
repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014 . During fiscal 2014 , we repurchased approximately 10.9 
million  shares at an average price of $63.48  through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2014  and fiscal 
2013 . During fiscal 2013 , we repurchased approximately 21.6 million  shares at an average price per share of $46.47  through 
structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2013  and fiscal 2012. 
For fiscal 2015 , 2014  and 2013 , the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at 
the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by November 27, 2015 , November 28, 2014  and November 29, 
2013  were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. As of November 27, 2015 , $38.2 million  of prepayments remained 
under the agreement. See Note 13 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our stock repurchase 
programs.
Subsequent to November 27, 2015 , as part of our $2 billion  stock repurchase program, we entered into a structured stock 
repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $150 million . This 
amount will be classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon completion of the $150 million  stock  
repurchase agreement, $1.43 billion  remains under our current authority .
See Item 5, Market for Registrant’ s Common Equity , Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

In January 2015, we issued the 2025 Notes and settled the 2015 Notes. As of November 27, 2015 , our outstanding notes 
payable consists of the 2020 Notes and 2025 Notes with a total carrying value of $1.91 billion . At November 27, 2015 , our 
55maximum commitment for interest payments under the Notes was $501.1 million  for the remaining duration of our Notes. In June 
2014, we entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest 
rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a fixed number of basis points through February 1, 2020.
Covenants
 Our credit facility and Almaden Tower lease contain a financial covenant requiring us not to exceed a maximum leverage 
ratio. As of November 27, 2015 , we were in compliance with all of our covenants. We believe these covenants will not impact our 
credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. Our Notes do not contain any financial 
covenants. 
Under the terms of our credit agreement and lease agreements, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless 
payment would trigger an event of default or one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable 
future.
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
The gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at November 27, 2015  was $258.7 million , exclusive of interest and 
penalties. 
The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments 
that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of 
current and non-current assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain 
audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties 
described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging 
from $0 to approximately $10 million .  
Royalties
We have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is 
generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue.
Indemnifications
In the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual 
property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims 
by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically , costs related to these indemnification provisions have not 
been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future 
results of operations.
To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for 
certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity . The indemnification 
period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director ’s or officer’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of 
future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however , we have director 
and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. 
ITEM 7A.  QUANTIT ATIVE AND QUALIT ATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT  MARKET  RISK
All market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non-trading purposes.
Foreign Curr ency Risk
Foreign Curr ency Exposur es and Hedging Instruments
In countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and various other currencies which subject us 
to exposure from movements in exchange rates. We may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge 
our foreign currency revenue. Additionally , we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign 
exchange forward contracts. We hedge these exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected 
by changes in exchange rates. 
56Our significant foreign currency revenue exposures for fiscal 2015 , 2014  and 2013  were as follows (in millions, except 
Yen):
Fiscal
2015Fiscal
2014Fiscal
2013
Euro ........................................................................................................... € 589.6 € 455.5 € 434.7
Yen (in billions) ......................................................................................... ¥ 29.7 ¥ 28 ¥ 32.5
British Pounds ........................................................................................... £ 192.0 £ 159.1 £ 145.3
As of November 27, 2015 , the total absolute value of all outstanding foreign exchange contracts, including options and 
forwards, was $661.0 million  which included the notional equivalent of $318.5 million  in Euros, $144.4 million  in British Pounds, 
$118.7 million  in Yen and $79.4 million  in other foreign currencies. As of November 27, 2015 , all contracts were set to expire at 
various dates through June 2016. The bank counterparties in these contracts could expose us to credit-related losses which would 
be largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value 
of these contracts fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements 
which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement transactions.
A sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of November 27, 2015 . This sensitivity 
analysis measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. 
Dollar . For option contracts, the Black-Scholes option pricing model was used. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar and 
a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our 
financial hedging instruments by $39.0 million . Conversely , a 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. Dollar would result in a 
decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by $18.4 million .
As a general rule, we do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in 
countries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries, revenue in the local currencies substantially offsets the 
local currency denominated operating expenses. 
We also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non-U.S. Dollar 
functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of November 27, 2015  and November 28, 2014 , this long-term investment exposure 
totaled an absolute notional equivalent of $61.9 million  and $161.7 million , respectively . At this time, we do not hedge these long-
term investment exposures.
We do not use foreign exchange contracts for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure 
in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. We regularly review our hedging program and 
assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis.
Cash Flow Hedging—Hedges of Forecasted Foreign Curr ency Revenue 
We may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge foreign currency revenue denominated in 
Euros, British Pounds and Yen.  We hedge these cash flow exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be 
adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, may have maturities 
between one and twelve months. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted revenue in the normal course 
of business and accordingly , they are not speculative in nature.
We record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income until the 
forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge 
to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur , or it becomes probable that it will not occur , we 
reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other 
income, net on our Consolidated Statements of Income at that time. For the fiscal year ended November 27, 2015 , there were no 
net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur .
Balance Sheet Hedging—Hedging of Foreign Curr ency Assets and Liabilities
We hedge exposures related to our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward 
contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange 
rates. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as interest and other income, 
net. These foreign exchange contracts do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because 
57gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged. At November 27, 
2015 , the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less.
See Note 5 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our hedging activities.
Inter est Rate Risk
Short-T erm Investments and Fixed Income Securities
At November 27, 2015 , we had debt securities classified as short-term investments of $3.1 billion . Changes in interest rates 
could adversely affect the market value of these investments. The following table separates these investments, based on stated 
maturities, to show the approximate exposure to interest rates (in millions):
Due within one year ............................................................................................................................................. $ 853.0
Due within two years ............................................................................................................................................ 1,202.6
Due within three years .......................................................................................................................................... 771.3
Due after three years ............................................................................................................................................ 284.6
Total ................................................................................................................................................................... $ 3,111.5
A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of November 27, 2015 . The analysis is based on an 
estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield 
curve of various magnitudes.
The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our debt securities classified as short-term investments assuming 
immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS and 150 BPS.  The analysis is shown as of 
November 27, 2015  and November 28, 2014  (dollars in millions):
-150 BPS -100 BPS -50 BPSFair Value
11/27/15 +50 BPS +100 BPS +150 BPS
$ 3,172.3 $ 3,156.6 $ 3,135.2 $ 3,111.5 $ 3,087.7 $ 3,063.9 $ 3,040.1
-150 BPS -100 BPS -50 BPSFair Value
11/28/14 +50 BPS +100 BPS +150 BPS
$ 2,663.3 $ 2,656.3 $ 2,641.9 $ 2,621.6 $ 2,599.8 $ 2,578.0 $ 2,556.2
Senior Notes
As of November 27, 2015 , the amount outstanding under our senior notes was $1.9 billion . In June 2014, we entered into 
interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on the LIBOR 
plus a fixed number of basis points through February 1, 2020. Accordingly , our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates 
is on the hedged fixed-rate debt of $900 million . An immediate hypothetical 50 basis points increase or decrease in market interest 
rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations.
As of November 27, 2015 , the total carrying amount of the Notes was $1.91 billion  and the related fair value based on 
inactive market prices was $1.97 billion .
Other  Market Risk
Privately Held Long-T erm Investments
The privately held companies in which we invest can still be considered in the start-up or development stages which are 
inherently risky . The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may 
never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. The evaluation of 
privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure 
regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy 
of the data received from these companies. We have minimal exposure on our long-term investments in privately held companies 
as these investments were insignificant as of November 27, 2015  and November 28, 2014 .

NOTE 1.  BASIS OF  PRESENT ATION AND SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Operations
Founded in 1982, Adobe Systems Incorporated is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world. 
We offer a line of products and services used by creative professionals, marketers, knowledge workers, application developers, 
enterprises and consumers for creating, managing, delivering, measuring, optimizing and engaging with compelling content and 
experiences across multiple operating systems, devices and media. We market and license our products and services directly to 
enterprise customers through our sales force and to end users through app stores and our own website at www .adobe.com. We 
offer many of our products via a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) model or a managed services model (both of which are referred 
to as a hosted or cloud-based model) as well as through term subscription and pay-per -use models. We also distribute certain 
products and services through a network of distributors, value-added resellers (“VARs”), systems integrators, independent software 
vendors (“ISVs”), retailers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). In addition, we license our technology to hardware 
manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions. Our products run on personal 
and server -based computers, as well as on smartphones, tablets and other devices, depending on the product. We have operations 
in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia-Pacific (“AP AC”). 
Basis of Pr esentation
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include those of Adobe and its subsidiaries, after elimination of all 
intercompany accounts and transactions. We have prepared the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance 
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations 
of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
Use of Estimates
In preparing Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP  and pursuant to the rules 
and regulations of the SEC, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, sales allowances and programs, bad debts, stock-
based compensation, determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, excess inventory and purchase 
commitments, restructuring charges, facilities lease losses, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, litigation, income taxes 
and investments. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.
Fiscal Y ear
Our fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the Friday closest to November 30. Fiscal 2015 , 2014  and 2013  were 
52-week years.
Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
Our revenue is derived from the licensing of subscription, time-based and perpetual software products, associated software 
maintenance and support plans, non-software related hosted services, consulting services, training and technical support.
We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. 
Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have 
a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. 
Multiple Element Arrangements
We enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software, upgrades, 
maintenance and support, hosted services, and consulting.
For our software and software-related multiple element arrangements, we must: (1) determine whether and when each 
element has been delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered 
ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORA TED
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS (Continued)
65products and services; (3) determine the fair value of each undelivered element using vendor -specific objective evidence (“VSOE”); 
and (4) allocate the total price among the various elements. VSOE of fair value is used to allocate a portion of the price to the 
undelivered elements and the residual method is used to allocate the remaining portion to the delivered elements. Absent VSOE, 
revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which VSOE of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all elements 
of the arrangement have been delivered. However , if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support, the entire 
arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. Changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements 
in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.
We determine VSOE for each element based on historical stand-alone sales to third parties or from the stated renewal rate 
for the elements contained in the initial arrangement. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling 
prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range.
We have established VSOE for our software maintenance and support services, custom software development services, 
consulting services and training, when such services are sold optionally with software licenses. 
For multiple-element arrangements containing our non-software services, we must: (1) determine whether and when each 
element has been delivered; (2) determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of VSOE of selling price, 
third-party evidence (“TPE”) of selling price or best-estimated selling price (“BESP”), as applicable; and (3) allocate the total 
price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method.
For multiple-element arrangements that contain both software and non-software elements, we allocate revenue to software 
or software-related elements as a group and any non-software elements separately based on the selling price hierarchy . We determine 
the selling price for each deliverable using VSOE of selling price, if it exists, or TPE of selling price. If neither VSOE nor TPE 
of selling price exist for a deliverable, we use BESP . Once revenue is allocated to software or software-related elements as a group, 
we recognize revenue in conformance with software revenue accounting guidance. Revenue is recognized when revenue recognition 
criteria are met for each element.
We are generally unable to establish VSOE or TPE for non-software elements and as such, we use BESP . BESP  is generally 
used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand-alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings. We determine BESP  
for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to major product groupings, geographies, market 
conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. Pricing practices taken into 
consideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable and our price lists. We must estimate 
certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. While we believe we can make 
reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly , our assumptions and judgments 
regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially 
impacting our financial position and results of operations.
Subscription and Services and Support Revenue
We recognize revenue for hosted services that are based on a committed number of transactions, ratably beginning on the 
date the services are first made available to the customer and continuing through the end of the contractual service term. Over -
usage fees, and fees billed based on the actual number of transactions from which we capture data, are billed in accordance with 
contract terms as these fees are incurred. We record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue 
or revenue, depending on whether all revenue recognition criteria have been met.
Our services and support revenue is composed of consulting, training and maintenance and support, primarily related to 
the licensing of our enterprise, mobile and device products and solutions. Our support revenue also includes technical support and 
developer support to partners and developer organizations related to our desktop products.
Our consulting revenue is recognized using a time and materials basis and is measured monthly based on input measures, 
such as hours incurred to date, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones when applicable. 
Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers to receive product upgrades and enhancements on a when 
and if available basis or technical support, depending on the offering, are recognized ratably over the performance period of the 
arrangement.
ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORA TED
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS (Continued)
66Our software subscription offerings, which may include product upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available 
basis, hosted services, and online storage are generally offered to our customers over a specified period of time and we recognize 
revenue associated with these arrangements ratably over the subscription period.
Product Revenue
We recognize our product revenue upon shipment, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Our desktop 
application product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing limited rights of return, rebates and price protection. 
Our direct sales and OEM sales are also subject to limited rights of return. Accordingly , we reduce revenue recognized for estimated 
future returns, price protection and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded. The estimates for returns are adjusted 
periodically based upon historical rates of returns, inventory levels in the distribution channel and other related factors.
We recognize OEM licensing revenue, primarily royalties, when OEMs ship products incorporating our software, provided 
collection of such revenue is deemed probable. For certain OEM customers, we must estimate royalty revenue due to the timing 
of securing customer information. This estimate is based on a combination of our generated forecasts and actual historical reporting 
by our OEM customers. To substantiate our ability to estimate revenue, we review license royalty revenue reports ultimately 
received from our significant OEM customers in comparison to the amounts estimated in the prior period.
Our product-related deferred revenue includes maintenance upgrade revenue and customer advances under OEM license 
agreements. Our maintenance upgrade revenue for our desktop application products is included in our product revenue line item 
as the maintenance primarily entitles customers to receive product upgrades. In cases where we provide a specified free upgrade 
to an existing product, we defer the fair value for the specified upgrade right until the future obligation is fulfilled or when the 
right to the specified free upgrade expires.
Rights of Return, Rebates and Price Pr otection
As discussed above, we offer limited rights of return, rebates and price protection of our products under various policies 
and programs with our distributors, resellers and/or end-user customers. We estimate and record reserves for these programs as 
an offset to revenue and accounts receivable. Below is a summary of each of the general provisions in our contracts:
• Distributors are allowed limited rights of return of products purchased during the previous quarter . In addition, distributors 
are allowed to return products that have reached the end of their lives, as defined by us, and products that are being 
replaced by new versions.
• We offer rebates to our distributors, resellers and/or end user customers. The amount of revenue that is reduced for 
distributor and reseller rebates is based on actual performance against objectives set forth by us for a particular reporting 
period (volume, timely reporting, etc.). If mail-in or other promotional rebates are offered, the amount of revenue reduced 
is based on the dollar amount of the rebate, taking into consideration an estimated redemption rate calculated using 
historical trends.
• From time to time, we may offer price protection to our distributors that allow for the right to a credit if we permanently 
reduce the price of a software product. The amount of revenue that is reduced for price protection is calculated as the 
difference between the old and new price of a software product on inventory held by the distributor immediately prior to 
the effective date of the decrease.
Although our subscription contracts are generally non-cancellable, a limited number of customers have the right to cancel 
their contracts by providing prior written notice to us of their intent to cancel the remainder of the contract term. In the event a 
customer cancels its contract, they are not entitled to a refund for prior services we have provided to them.
On a quarterly basis, the amount of revenue that is reserved for future returns is calculated based on our historical trends 
and data specific to each reporting period. We review the actual returns evidenced in prior quarters as a percent of revenue to 
determine a historical returns rate. We then apply the historical rate to the current period revenue as a basis for estimating future 
returns. When necessary , we also provide a specific returns reserve for product in the distribution channel in excess of estimated 
requirements. This estimate can be affected by the amount of a particular product in the channel, the rate of sell-through, product 
plans and other factors.

Deferr ed Revenue
 Deferred revenue consists substantially of payments received in advance of revenue recognition for our products and 
services described above. We recognize deferred revenue as revenue only when the revenue recognition criteria are met.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which reflects our best estimate of potentially uncollectible trade receivables. 
The allowance is based on both specific and general reserves. We regularly review our trade receivables allowances by considering 
such factors as historical experience, credit-worthiness, the age of the trade receivable balances and current economic conditions 
that may affect a customer ’s ability to pay and we specifically reserve for those deemed uncollectible.

________________________________________
(1)  Deductions related to the allowance for doubtful accounts represent amounts written off against the allowance, less recoveries.
Property and Equipment
We record property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Property and equipment are 
depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from 1 to 5 years for computers and equipment 
as well as server hardware under capital leases, 1 to 6 years for furniture and fixtures, and up to 40 years for buildings. Leasehold 
improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the remaining respective lease term or estimated 
useful lives ranging from 1 to 15 years.
Goodwill, Pur chased Intangibles and Other Long-Lived Assets
Goodwill is assigned to one or more reporting segments on the date of acquisition. We evaluate goodwill for impairment 
by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting segments to its carrying value, including the associated goodwill. To determine 
the fair values, we use the equal weighting of the market approach based on comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines 
of businesses and the income approach based on estimated discounted future cash flows. Our cash flow assumptions consider 
historical and forecasted revenue, operating costs and other relevant factors.
We review our goodwill for impairment annually , or more frequently , if facts and circumstances warrant a review . We 
completed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 . We elected to use the Step 1 quantitative assessment 
for our reporting units and determined there was no impairment of goodwill. 
We amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives and review them for impairment whenever 
an impairment indicator exists. We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts 
of our long-lived assets, including our intangible assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances 
occur , we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the undiscounted 
ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORA TED
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS (Continued)
68expected future cash flows. If the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets, we recognize 
an impairment loss based on any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. We did not recognize any intangible 
asset impairment charges in fiscal 2015 , 2014  or 2013 .
During fiscal 2015, our intangible assets were amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from 1 to 14 years. 
Amortization is based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset will be consumed or on a straight-line 
basis when the consumption pattern is not apparent. The weighted average useful lives of our intangible assets were as follows:
 Weighted 
Average
Useful Life 
(years )

Customer contracts and relationships .................................................................................................................... 8
Trademarks ............................................................................................................................................................. 8
Acquired rights to use technology ......................................................................................................................... 8
Localization ............................................................................................................................................................ 1
Other intangibles .................................................................................................................................................... 5 
Softwar e Development Costs
Capitalization of software development costs for software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed begins upon the 
establishment of technological feasibility , which is generally the completion of a working prototype that has been certified as 
having no critical bugs and is a release candidate. Amortization begins once the software is ready for its intended use, generally 
based on the pattern in which the economic benefits will be consumed. To date, software development costs incurred between 
completion of a working prototype and general availability of the related product have not been material.
Internal Use Softwar e
We capitalize costs associated with customized internal-use software systems that have reached the application development 
stage. Such capitalized costs include external direct costs utilized in developing or obtaining the applications and payroll and 
payroll-related expenses for employees who are directly associated with the development of the applications. Capitalization of 
such costs begins when the preliminary project stage is complete and ceases at the point in which the project is substantially 
complete and is ready for its intended purpose.
Income T axes
We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized 
for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized 
for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, 
and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount 
for which realization is more likely than not.
Taxes Collected from Customers
We net taxes collected from customers against those remitted to government authorities in our financial statements. 
Accordingly , taxes collected from customers are not reported as revenue.
Treasury Stock
We account for treasury stock under the cost method. When treasury stock is re-issued at a price higher than its cost, the 
difference is recorded as a component of additional paid-in-capital in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. When treasury stock is 
re-issued at a price lower than its cost, the difference is recorded as a component of additional paid-in-capital to the extent that 
there are previously recorded gains to offset the losses. If there are no treasury stock gains in additional paid-in-capital, the losses 
upon re-issuance of treasury stock are recorded as a reduction of retained earnings in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORA TED
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS (Continued)
69Advertising Expenses
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses for fiscal 2015 , 2014  and 2013  were $113.6 million , $87.9 
million  and $88.5 million , respectively .
Foreign Curr ency T ranslation
We translate assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, whose functional currency is their local currency , at exchange 
rates in effect at the balance sheet date. We translate revenue and expenses at the monthly average exchange rates. We include 
accumulated net translation adjustments in stockholders’  equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
Foreign Curr ency and Other Hedging Instruments
In countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and in various other currencies. We use foreign 
exchange option and forward contracts for revenue denominated in Euros, British Pounds and Yen. We hedge our net recognized 
foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows 
will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. 
We recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them 
at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and 
whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are adjusted to fair 
value through earnings. See Note 5 for information regarding our hedging activities.
Gains and losses from foreign exchange forward contracts which hedge certain balance sheet positions are recorded each 
period as a component of interest and other income, net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Foreign exchange option 
contracts hedging forecasted foreign currency revenue are designated as cash flow hedges with gains and losses recorded net of 
tax, as a component of other comprehensive income in stockholders’  equity and reclassified into revenue at the time the forecasted 
transactions occur .
Concentration of Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are short-term fixed-income investments, 
structured repurchase transactions, foreign currency and interest rate hedge contracts and trade receivables.
Our investment portfolio consists of investment-grade securities diversified among security types, industries and issuers. 
Our cash and investments are held and primarily managed by recognized financial institutions that follow our investment policy . 
Our policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one security issue or issuer and we believe no significant concentration of 
credit risk exists with respect to these investments.
We enter into foreign currency hedge contracts with bank counterparties that could expose us to credit related losses in the 
event of their nonperformance. This is largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received 
or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, 
we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit related losses with the same counterparty 
by permitting net settlement transactions. 
The aggregate fair value of foreign currency contracts in net asset positions as of November 27, 2015  and November 28, 
2014  was $19.1 million  and $33.0 million  respectively . These amounts represent the maximum exposure to loss at the reporting 
date as a result of all of the counterparties failing to perform as contracted. These exposures could be reduced by certain immaterial 
liabilities included in master netting arrangements with those same counterparties. 
Credit risk in receivables is limited to OEMs, dealers and distributors of hardware and software products to the retail market, 
customers to whom we license software directly and our SaaS offerings. A credit review is completed for our new distributors, 
dealers and OEMs. We also perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’  financial condition and require letters of credit 
or other guarantees, whenever deemed necessary . The credit limit given to the customer is based on our risk assessment of their 
ability to pay, country risk and other factors and is not contingent on the resale of the product or on the collection of payments 
from their customers. We also purchase credit insurance to mitigate credit risk in some foreign markets where we believe it is 
ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORA TED
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS (Continued)
70warranted. If we license our software or provide SaaS services to a customer where we have a reason to believe the customer ’s 
ability to pay is not probable, due to country risk or credit risk, we will not recognize the revenue. We will revert to recognizing 
the revenue on a cash basis, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition has been met.
We derive a significant portion of our OEM PostScript and Other licensing revenue from a small number of OEMs. Our 
OEMs on occasion seek to renegotiate their royalty arrangements. We evaluate these requests on a case-by-case basis. If an 
agreement is not reached, a customer may decide to pursue other options, which could result in lower licensing revenue for us.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
On November 20, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet 
Classification of Deferred Taxes, requiring all deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any related valuation allowance, to be classified 
as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The classification change for all deferred taxes as noncurrent simplifies entities’  processes as 
it eliminates the need to separately identify the net current and net noncurrent deferred tax asset or liability in each jurisdiction 
and allocate valuation allowances. We elected to prospectively adopt the accounting standard in the beginning of our fourth quarter 
of fiscal 2015. Prior periods in our Consolidated Financial Statements were not retrospectively adjusted. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective
On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, requiring an entity to 
recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The 
updated standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP  when it becomes effective and permits 
the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date, which deferred the effective date of the new revenue 
standard for periods beginning after December 15, 2016 to December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted but not earlier than 
the original effective date. Accordingly , the updated standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We have not yet 
selected a transition method and we are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated 
financial statements and related disclosures.
With the exception of the new revenue standard discussed above, there have been no new accounting pronouncements that 
have significance, or potential significance, to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
NOTE 2.   ACQUISITIONS
Fotolia
On January 27, 2015 , we completed our acquisition of privately held Fotolia, a leading marketplace for royalty-free photos, 
images, graphics and HD videos. During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we began integrating Fotolia into our Digital Media 
reportable segment. 
Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Fotolia's net tangible and intangible 
assets based upon their estimated fair values as of January 27, 2015 . During fiscal 2015, we recorded immaterial purchase accounting 
adjustments based on changes to management’ s estimates and assumptions in regards to assumed intangible assets, calculation of 
deferred tax assets, liabilities and equity awards. The total final purchase price for Fotolia was $807.5 million  of which $745.1 
million  was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $204.4 million  to identifiable intangible assets and 
$142.0 million  to net liabilities assumed. 
Neolane
On July 22, 2013 , we completed our acquisition of privately held Neolane, a leader in cross-channel campaign management 
technology . During the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we began integrating Neolane into our Digital Marketing reportable segment. 
Neolane brings a platform for automation and execution of marketing campaigns across the web, e-mail, social, mobile, call center , 
direct mail, point of sale and other emer ging channels which will drive consistent brand experiences and personalized campaigns

million  of which $515.2 million  was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $115.0 million  to identifiable 
intangible assets and $13.5 million  to net liabilities assumed. 
Behance
On December 20, 2012 , we completed our acquisition of privately held Behance, an online social media platform to showcase 
and discover creative work. During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we began integrating Behance into our Digital Media reportable 
segment. Behance’ s community and portfolio capabilities have accelerated our strategy to bring additional community features to 
Creative Cloud. 
Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase price was allocated to Behance’ s net tangible and intangible 
assets based upon their estimated fair values as of December 20, 2012 . The total final purchase price for Behance was approximately 
$111.1 million  of which $91.4 million  was allocated to goodwill, $28.5 million  to identifiable intangible assets and $8.8 million  
to net liabilities assumed. 
We also completed other immaterial business acquisitions during the fiscal years presented. Pro forma information has not 
been presented for any of our fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 acquisitions as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was 
not material.
NOTE 3.  CASH, CASH EQUIV ALENTS AND SHOR T-TERM INVESTMENTS
Cash equivalents consist of instruments with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. We classify 
all of our cash equivalents and short-term investments as “available-for -sale.” In general, these investments are free of trading 
restrictions. We carry these investments at fair value, based on quoted market prices or other readily available market information. 
Unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is reflected as a separate 
component of stockholders’  equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains and losses are recognized when realized in our 
Consolidated Statements of Income. When we have determined that an other -than-temporary decline in fair value has occurred, 
the amount of the decline that is related to a credit loss is recognized in income. Gains and losses are determined using the specific 
identification method.

We review our debt and marketable equity securities classified as short-term investments on a regular basis to evaluate 
whether or not any security has experienced an other -than-temporary decline in fair value. We consider factors such as the length 
of time and extent to which the market value has been less than the cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the 
issuer and our intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the 
investment’ s amortized cost basis. If we believe that an other -than-temporary decline exists in one of these securities, we write 
down these investments to fair value. For debt securities, the portion of the write-down related to credit loss would be recorded 
to interest and other income, net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Any portion not related to credit loss would be recorded 
to accumulated other comprehensive income, which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders’  equity in our Consolidated 
Balance Sheets. For equity securities, the write-down would be recorded to investment gains (losses), net in our Consolidated 
Statements of Income. During fiscal 2015 , 2014  and 2013 , we did not consider any of our investments to be other -than-temporarily 
impaired.

See Note 3 for further information regarding the fair value of our financial instruments. 
Our fixed income available-for -sale securities consist of high quality , investment grade securities from diverse issuers with 
a minimum credit rating of BBB and a weighted average credit rating of AA-. We value these securities based on pricing from 
pricing vendors who may use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1 inputs) or inputs other than quoted prices 
that are observable either directly or indirectly (Level 2 inputs) in determining fair value. However , we classify all of our fixed 
income available-for -sale securities as having Level 2 inputs. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of our 
financial instruments and derivatives having Level 2 inputs were derived from non-binding market consensus prices that are 
corroborated by observable market data, quoted market prices for similar instruments, or pricing models such as discounted cash 
flow techniques. Our procedures include controls to ensure that appropriate fair values are recorded such as comparing prices 
obtained from multiple independent sources. 
Our deferred compensation plan assets consist of prime money market funds and mutual funds.
Assets and Liabilities Measur ed at Fair Value on a Nonr ecurring Basis
We also have direct investments in privately held companies accounted for under the cost method, which are periodically 
assessed for other -than-temporary impairment. If we determine that an other -than-temporary impairment has occurred, we write 
ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORA TED
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS (Continued)
77down the investment to its fair value. We estimate fair value of our cost method investments considering available information 
such as pricing in recent rounds of financing, current cash positions, earnings and cash flow forecasts, recent operational performance 
and any other readily available market data. During fiscal 2015  and 2014 , we determined there were no other -than-temporary 
impairments on our cost method investments.
As of November 27, 2015 , the carrying value of our lease receivables approximated fair value, based on Level 2 valuation 
inputs which include Treasury rates, London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) interest rates and applicable credit spreads. See 
Note 15 for further details regarding our investment in lease receivables. 
The fair value of our senior notes was $1.97 billion  as of November 27, 2015 , based on observable market prices in less 
active market and categorized as Level 2. See Note 16 for further details regarding our debt.
NOTE 5.  DERIV ATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
Hedge Accounting and Hedging Pr ograms
We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets 
and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of 
the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting.
We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively and record any 
ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income, net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The 
net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was 
insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), 
net in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are 
largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of 
certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting 
arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement 
of transactions. Our hedging policy also establishes maximum limits for each counterparty to mitigate any concentration of risk.
Fair V alue Hedging—Hedges of Inter est Rate Risks
During the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps designated as a fair value hedge related to our 
$900 million  of 4.75%  fixed interest rate senior notes due February 1, 2020  (the “2020 Notes”). In effect, the interest rate swaps 
convert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on the LIBOR. Under the terms of the swaps, we 
will pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR rate plus a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million  notional amount 
through February 1, 2020. In exchange, we will receive 4.75%  fixed rate interest from the swap counterparties. See Note 16 for 
further details regarding our debt.
The interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges and substantially offset the changes in fair value of the hedged 
portion of the underlying debt that are attributable to the changes in market risk. Therefore, the gains and losses related to changes 
in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are included in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements 
of Income. The fair value of the interest rate swaps is reflected in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Cash Flow Hedging—Hedges of For ecasted For eign Curr ency Revenue and Inter est Rate Risks
In countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and in various other currencies. We may use 
foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge certain cash flow exposures resulting from changes in these foreign 
currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to twelve months . We enter 
into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue in the normal 
course of business and accordingly , they are not speculative in nature.
To receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge, 
and the hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions. We record changes in 
ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORA TED
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS (Continued)
78the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, 
until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash 
flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur , or it becomes probable that it will not 
occur , we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and 
other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income at that time. If we do not elect hedge accounting, or the 
contract does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in fair value from period to period are recorded in interest 
and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. 
In December 2014, prior to issuing new long-term fixed rate debt, we entered into an interest rate lock agreement on a 
notional amount of $600 million  to hedge against the variability of future interest payments due to changes in the benchmark 
interest rate. This instrument was designated as a cash flow hedge. Upon issuance of our $1 billion  of 3.25%  senior notes due 
February 1, 2025 (the “2025 Notes”) in January 2015, we terminated the instrument and incurred a loss of $16.2 million . This loss 
was recorded in the stockholders’  equity section in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in accumulated other comprehensive income 
and will be reclassified to interest expense over a ten-year term consistent with the impact of the hedged item. See Note 16 for 
further details regarding our debt.
For fiscal 2015 , there were no net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions 
that did not occur . In fiscal 2014  and 2013  these net gains or losses were insignificant.
Balance Sheet Hedging —Hedges of For eign Curr ency Assets and Liabilities
We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts 
to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These 
contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the 
fair value recorded to interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. These contracts do not 
subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended 
to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged. 
As of November 27, 2015 , total notional amounts of outstanding contracts were $228.3 million  which included the notional 
equivalent of $75.8 million  in Euros, $44.3 million  in British Pounds, $37.8 million  in Australian Dollars, $28.8 million  in Japanese 
Yen, and $41.6 million  in other foreign currencies. As of November 28, 2014 , total notional amounts of outstanding contracts were 
$235.5 million  which included the notional equivalent of $137.2 million  in Euros, $30.9 million  in British Pounds and $67.4 
million  in other foreign currencies. At November 27, 2015  and November 28, 2014 , the outstanding balance sheet hedging 
derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less.

to sell these property assets was largely based upon a general lack of operational needs for the building and land, and recent 
improvements in market conditions for commercial real estate in the area. We began to actively market the assets during the second 
quarter of fiscal 2015 and finalized the sale of these assets on September 23, 2015 for total proceeds of $57.8 million . The gain 
on the sale of the property assets was included in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of 
Income.
In August 2014, we exercised our option to purchase the East and West Towers of our corporate headquarter offices for a 
total purchase price of $143.2 million . We capitalized the East and West Towers as property and equipment on our Consolidated 
Balance Sheets at $144.1 million , the lesser of cost or fair value, which represented the total purchase price plus other direct costs 
associated with the purchase. These buildings are depreciated over their useful life of 40 years on a straight-line basis.

The deferred tax assets and liabilities for fiscal 2015  and 2014  include amounts related to various acquisitions.  The total 
change in deferred tax assets and liabilities includes changes that are recorded to other comprehensive income, additional paid-
in capital, goodwill, unrecognized tax benefits and retained earnings.
We provide U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries’  earnings are considered 
permanently reinvested outside the United States. To the extent that the foreign earnings previously treated as permanently 
reinvested are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. As of 
November 27, 2015 , the cumulative amount of earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided is approximately 
$3.7 billion . The unrecognized deferred tax liability for these earnings is approximately $1.0 billion .
As of November 27, 2015 , we have net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $52.1 million  for federal, $16.4 
million  for state, and $7.6 million  for foreign. We also have state and foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $55.0 
million  and $21.8 million , respectively . The net operating loss carryforward assets and tax credits will expire in various years from 
fiscal 2016  through 2034 . The state tax credit carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely . The net operating loss carryforward 
assets and certain credits are subject to an annual limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382, but are expected to be fully 
realized.
In addition, we have been tracking certain deferred tax attributes of approximately $55.0 million  which have not been 
recorded in the financial statements pursuant to accounting standards related to stock-based compensation. These amounts are no 
longer included in our gross or net deferred tax assets. Pursuant to these standards, the benefit of these deferred tax assets will be 
recorded to equity if and when they reduce taxes payable.

85As of November 27, 2015 , a valuation allowance of $21.3 million  has been established for certain deferred tax assets related 
to the impairment of investments and certain state and foreign assets. For fiscal 2015 , the total change in the valuation allowance 
was immaterial.

Ending balance .................................................................................................................................. $258,718 $148,848
As of November 27, 2015 , the combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax 
returns and included in non-current income taxes payable was approximately $27.8 million .
We file income tax returns in the United States on a federal basis and in many U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. We are 
subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. Our 
major tax jurisdictions are Ireland, California and the United States. For Ireland, California and the United States, the earliest 
fiscal years open for examination are 2008 , 2010  and 2010 , respectively . We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting 
from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments 
that may result from the current examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however , there can be no assurance 
that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial 
position.
The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments 
that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of 
current and non-current assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain 
audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties 
described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging 
from $0 to approximately $10 million . 
NOTE 10.  RESTRUCTURING
Fiscal 2014 Restructuring Plan
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, in order to better align our global resources for Digital Media and Digital Marketing, 
we initiated a restructuring plan to vacate our Research and Development facility in China and our Sales and Marketing facility 
in Russia. This plan consisted of reductions of approximately 350 full-time positions and we recorded restructuring charges of 
approximately $21.0 million  through fiscal 2015 related to ongoing termination benefits for the positions eliminated. The amount 
accrued for the fair value of future contractual obligations under these operating leases was insignificant. During the first quarter 
of fiscal 2015 we vacated both of these facilities and as of November 27, 2015  we consider the Fiscal 2014 Restructuring Plan to 
be substantially complete. 
Other Restructuring Plans
During the past several years, we have implemented Other Restructuring Plans consisting of reductions in workforce and 
the consolidation of facilities to better align our resources around our business strategies. As of November 27, 2015 , we considered 
our Other Restructuring Plans to be substantially complete. We continue to make cash outlays to settle obligations under these 
plans, however the current impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements is not material.

restructuring, current and $3.2 million  related to long-term facilities obligations recorded in accrued restructuring, non-current on 
our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We expect to pay accrued termination benefits through fiscal 2016 and facilities-related liabilities 
under contract through fiscal 2021 of which approximately 75% will be paid through 2017.
NOTE 1 1.  BENEFIT  PLANS
Retir ement Savings Plan
In 1987, we adopted an Employee Investment Plan, qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, which is 
a retirement savings plan covering substantially all of our U.S. employees, now referred to as the Adobe 401(k) Retirement Savings 
Plan. Under the plan, eligible employees may contribute up to 65% of their pretax or after-tax salary , subject to the Internal Revenue 
Service annual contribution limits. In fiscal 2015 , we matched 50% of the first 6% of the employee’ s eligible compensation. We 
contributed $25.7 million , $24.8 million  and $22.3 million  in fiscal 2015 , 2014  and 2013 , respectively . Adobe is under no obligation 
to continue matching future employee contributions and at the Company’ s discretion may change its practices at any time.
Deferr ed Compensation Plan
On September 21, 2006, the Board of Directors approved the Adobe Systems Incorporated Deferred Compensation Plan, 
effective December 2, 2006 (the “Deferred Compensation Plan”). The Deferred Compensation Plan is an unfunded, non-qualified, 
deferred compensation arrangement under which certain executives and members of the Board of Directors are able to defer a 
portion of their annual compensation. Participants may elect to contribute up to 75% of their base salary and 100%  of other specified 
compensation, including commissions, bonuses, performance-based and time-based restricted stock units, and directors’  
fees. Participants are able to elect the payment of benefits to begin on a specified date at least three years after the end of the plan 
year in which the election is made in the form of a lump sum or annual installments over five, ten or fifteen years. Upon termination 
of a participant’ s employment with Adobe, such participant will receive a distribution in the form of a lump sum payment. All 
distributions will be made in cash, except for deferred performance-based and time-based restricted stock units which will be 
settled in stock. As of November 27, 2015  and November 28, 2014 , the invested amounts under the Deferred Compensation Plan 
total $32.1 million  and $25.7 million , respectively and were recorded as other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of 
November 27, 2015  and November 28, 2014 , $39.6 million  and $31.0 million , respectively , was recorded as long-term liabilities 
to recognize undistributed deferred compensation due to employees.

87NOTE 12.  ST OCK-BASED COMPENSA TION
Our stock-based compensation programs are long-term retention programs that are intended to attract, retain and provide 
incentives for employees, officers and directors, and to align stockholder and employee interests. We have the following stock-
based compensation plans and programs:
Restricted Stock Unit Plans
We currently grant restricted stock units to eligible employees under our 2003 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (“2003 
Plan”). In February 2015, the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors retired our remaining share reserves 
under the 2005 Equity Incentive Assumption Plan (“2005 Assumption Plan”). Restricted stock units granted under these plans as 
part of our annual review process vest annually over three years. Other restricted stock units granted under these plans generally 
vest over four years, the majority of which vest 25% annually . Certain grants have other vesting periods approved by our Board 
of Directors or an authorized committee of the Board of Directors.
We grant performance awards to officers and key employees under our 2003 Plan. Performance awards granted under this 
plan between fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2012 vest annually over three years, and performance awards granted in fiscal 2015 , 2014  and 
2013  cliff-vest after three years. 
As of November 27, 2015 , we had reserved 173.2 million  shares of common stock for issuance under our 2003 Plan and 
had 48.5 million  shares available for grant.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Our 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) allows eligible employee participants to purchase shares of our common 
stock at a discount through payroll deductions. The ESPP  consists of a twenty-four month offering period with four six-month 
purchase periods in each offering period. Employees purchase shares in each purchase period at 85% of the market value of our 
common stock at either the beginning of the offering period or the end of the purchase period, whichever price is lower . The ESPP  
will continue until the earlier of (i) termination by the Board or (ii) the date on which all of the shares available for issuance under 
the plan have been issued.
As of November 27, 2015 , we had reserved 93.0 million  shares of our common stock for issuance under the ESPP  and 
approximately 10.8 million  shares remain available for future issuance.
Stock Option Plans
The Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors eliminated the use of stock option grants for all employees 
in fiscal 2012. Stock option grants to non-employee directors were minimal in fiscal 2013, and in December 2013 the Board of 
Directors eliminated the use of option grants for directors as well.
The 2003 Plan allows us to grant options to all employees, including executive officers, outside consultants and non-
employee directors. This plan will continue until the earlier of (i) termination by the Board or (ii) the date on which all of the 
shares available for issuance under the plan have been issued and restrictions on issued shares have lapsed. Option vesting periods 
are generally four years and expire seven years from the effective date of grant. 
Performance Shar e Programs
On January 26, 2015, our Executive Compensation Committee approved the 2015 Performance Share Program, including 
the award calculation methodology , under the terms of our 2003 Equity Incentive Plan. Under our 2015 Performance Share Program 
(“2015 Program”), shares may be earned based on the achievement of an objective relative total stockholder return measured over 
a three-year performance period. The purpose of the 2015 Program is to help focus key employees on building stockholder value, 
provide significant award potential for achieving outstanding Company performance and enhance the ability of the Company to 
attract and retain highly talented and competent individuals. Performance share awards will be awarded and fully vest at the later 
of the three-year anniversary of the grant date on January 24, 2018 or the Executive Compensation Committee's certification of 
the level of achievement. Participants in the 2015 Program generally have the ability to receive up to 200%  of the target number 
of shares originally granted.
ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORA TED
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS (Continued)
88On January 24, 2014, our Executive Compensation Committee approved the 2014 Performance Share Program, including 
the award calculation methodology , under the terms of our 2003 Equity Incentive Plan. Under our 2014 Performance Share Program 
(“2014 Program”), shares may be earned based on the achievement of an objective relative total stockholder return measured over 
a three-year performance period. The purpose of the 2014 Program is to help focus key employees on building stockholder value, 
provide significant award potential for achieving outstanding company performance and enhance the ability of Adobe to attract 
and retain highly talented and competent individuals. Performance share awards will be awarded and fully vest at the later of the 
three-year anniversary of the grant date on January 24, 2017 or the Executive Compensation Committee’ s certification of the level 
of achievement. Participants in the 2014 Program generally have the ability to receive up to 200%  of the target number of shares 
originally granted.
Effective January 24, 2013, our Executive Compensation Committee modified our Performance Share Program by 
eliminating the use of qualitative performance objectives, with 100% of shares to be earned based on the achievement of an 
objective relative total stockholder return measured over a three-year performance period. Performance awards were granted under 
the 2013 Performance Share Program (“2013 Program”) pursuant to the terms of our 2003 Equity Incentive Plan. The purpose of 
the 2013 Program is to align key management and senior leadership with stockholders’  interests over the long term and to retain 
key employees. Performance share awards will be awarded and fully vest at the later of the three-year anniversary of the grant 
date on January 24, 2016 or the Executive Compensation Committee's certification of the level of achievement. Participants in 
the 2013 Program generally have the ability to receive up to 200%  of the target number of shares originally granted.
Issuance of Shares
Upon exercise of stock options, vesting of restricted stock and performance shares, and purchases of shares under the ESPP , 
we will issue treasury stock. If treasury stock is not available, common stock will be issued. In order to minimize the impact of 
on-going dilution from exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock and performance shares, we instituted a stock 
repurchase program. See Note 13 for information regarding our stock repurchase programs.
Valuation of Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. We are required to estimate 
forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. 
We use historical data to estimate forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected 
to vest.
 We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of ESPP  shares and stock options. The 
determination of the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by 
our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our 
expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, 
a risk-free interest rate and any expected dividends.
We estimate the expected term of options granted by calculating the average term from our historical stock option exercise 
experience. We estimate the volatility of our common stock by using implied volatility in market traded options. Our decision to 
use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that 
implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility . We base the risk-free interest rate 
that we use in the option valuation model on zero-coupon yields implied by U.S. Treasury issues with remaining terms similar to 
the expected term on the options. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an 
expected dividend yield of zero in the option valuation model. 
We eliminated the use of stock option grants for all employees effective fiscal 2012, and for all of the non-employee directors 
effective fiscal 2014.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2013, the Executive Compensation Committee certified the actual performance achievement 
of participants in the 2012 Performance Share Program (the “2012 Program”). Based upon the achievement of specific and/or 
market-based performance goals outlined in the 2012 Program, participants had the ability to receive up to 150%  of the target 
number of shares originally granted. Actual performance resulted in participants achieving 116% of target or approximately 1.3 
million  shares for the 2012 Program. One third of the shares under the 2012 Program vested in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and 
the remaining two thirds vested evenly on the following two anniversaries of the grant if not forfeited by the recipient.

Grants to Executive Officers
All equity awards granted to current executive officers are made after a review by and with the approval of the Executive 
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.
Grants to Non-Employee Directors  
The 2003 Plan provides for the granting of non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units to non-employee directors. 
The initial equity grant to a new non-employee director is a restricted stock unit award having an aggregate value of $0.3 million  
based on the average stock price over the 30 calendar days ending on the day before the date of grant and vest 100%  on the day 
preceding the next annual meeting. The actual target grant value will be prorated based on the number of days remaining before 
the next annual meeting or the date of the first anniversary of our last annual meeting if the next annual meeting is not yet scheduled. 
Annual equity grants to non-employee directors shall have an aggregate value of $0.3 million  as based on the average stock 
price over the 30 calendar days ending on the day before the date of grant and vest 100%  on the day preceding the next annual 
meeting. Starting in fiscal 2014, we eliminated the use of non-qualified stock options for our non-employee directors and restricted 
stock units became the primary form of their annual equity grants. 
Restricted stock units granted to directors for fiscal 2015 , 2014  and 2013  were as follows (in thousands):

93As part of the annual equity awards process in 2013, there were approximately 25 thousand options granted to non-employee 
directors with a $45.03 exercise price, equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. These options 
vested 100%  on the day preceding the fiscal 2014 annual meeting and had a seven -year term.
Compensation Costs
We recognize the estimated compensation cost of restricted stock units, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis 
over the requisite service period of the entire award, which is generally the vesting period. The estimated compensation cost is 
based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant.
We recognize the estimated compensation cost of performance shares, net of estimated forfeitures. The fiscal 2015 , 2014  
and 2013  awards are earned upon achievement of an objective total stockholder return measure at the end of the three-year 
performance period, as described above, and are valued using a Monte Carlo Simulation model. The fair value of the awards was 
fixed at grant date and amortized over the longer of the remaining performance or service period. For the fiscal 2012 performance 
shares, expense is being recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each vesting tranche of the award.
As of November 27, 2015 , there was $394.1 million  of unrecognized compensation cost, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, 
related to non-vested stock-based awards which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.5 years. Total unrecognized 
compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures.

Stock Repur chase Program  
To facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock 
issuances, we may repurchase shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. In the 
first quarter of fiscal 2015, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program granting the Company authority to 
repurchase up to $2 billion  in common stock through the end of fiscal 2017. 
ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORA TED
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS (Continued)
95During fiscal 2015 , 2014  and 2013 , we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial 
institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $625.0 million , $600.0 million , and $1.1 billion , respectively . 
Of the $625.0 million  prepayments during fiscal 2015 , $425.0 million  was under the new $2 billion  stock repurchase program and 
the remaining $200.0 million  was under the previous $2 billion  authority . The $600.0 million  and $1.1 billion  prepayments during 
fiscal 2014  and 2013  were under the previous $2 billion  stock repurchase authority . We enter into these agreements in order to 
take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average Price (“VW AP”) of our common 
stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than our 
estimate of the foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees 
on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return 
any portion of the prepayment to us.
The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used 
to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the 
contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon 
discount. During fiscal 2015 , we repurchased approximately 8.1 million  shares at an average price of $77.38  through structured 
repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014 . During fiscal 2014 , we repurchased approximately 10.9 
million  shares at an average price of $63.48  through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2014  and fiscal 
2013 . During fiscal 2013 , we repurchased approximately 21.6 million  shares at an average price per share of $46.47  through 
structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2013  and fiscal 2012. 
For fiscal 2015 , 2014  and 2013 , the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at 
the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by November 27, 2015 , November 28, 2014  and November 29, 
2013  were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. As of November 27, 2015 , $38.2 million  of prepayments remained 
under the agreement. 
Subsequent to November 27, 2015 , as part of our $2 billion  stock repurchase program, we entered into a structured stock 
repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $150 million . This 
amount will be classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon completion of the $150 million  stock 
repurchase agreement, $1.43 billion  remains under our current authority . 
NOTE 14.  NET  INCOME PER SHARE
Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, 
excluding unvested restricted stock. Diluted net income per share is based upon the weighted average common shares outstanding 
for the period plus dilutive potential common shares, including unvested restricted stock and stock options using the treasury stock 
method.

96For fiscal 2015, there were no options to purchase shares of common stock with exercise prices greater than the average 
fair market value of our stock of $79.22  that would have been anti-dilutive.
For fiscal 2014  and 2013 , options to purchase shares of common stock with exercise prices greater than the average fair 
market value of our stock of $65.93  and $45.08 , respectively , were not included in the calculation because the effect would have

 Lease Commitments
We lease certain of our facilities and some of our equipment under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire 
at various dates through 2028 . We also have one land lease that expires in 2091 . Rent expense includes base contractual rent and 
variable costs such as building expenses, utilities, taxes, insurance and equipment rental. Rent expense for these leases was 
approximately $92.9 million , $111.1 million , and $119.0 million  in fiscal 2015 , 2014  and 2013 . Our sublease income was immaterial 
for all periods presented.
We occupy three  office buildings in San Jose, California where our corporate headquarters are located. We reference these 
office buildings as the Almaden Tower and the East and West Towers. We own the land and the East and West Tower buildings,

The lease agreement for the Almaden Tower is effective through March 2017. We are the investors in the lease receivable 
related to the Almaden Tower lease in the amount of $80.4 million , which is recorded as investment in lease receivable on our 
Consolidated Balance Sheets.  As of November 27, 2015 , the carrying value of the lease receivable related to the Almaden Tower 
approximated fair value. Under the agreement for the Almaden Tower , we have the option to purchase the building at any time 
during the lease term for $103.6 million . If we purchase the building, the investment in the lease receivable may be credited against 
the purchase price. The residual value guarantee under the Almaden Tower obligation is $89.4 million . 
The Almaden Tower lease is subject to standard covenants including a certain financial ratio that is reported to the lessor 
quarterly . As of November 27, 2015 , we were in compliance with all of the covenants. In the case of a default, the lessor may 
demand we purchase the building for an amount equal to the lease balance, or require that we remarket or relinquish the building. 
If we choose to remarket or are required to do so upon relinquishing the building, we are bound to arrange the sale of the building 
to an unrelated party and will be required to pay the lessor any shortfall between the net remarketing proceeds and the lease balance, 
up to the residual value guarantee amount less our investment in lease receivable.  The Almaden Tower lease qualifies for operating 
lease accounting treatment and, as such, the building and the related obligation are not included in our Consolidated Balance 
Sheets.  
Unconditional Purchase Obligations
Our purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business.

The table above includes operating lease commitments related to our restructured facilities. See Note 10 for information 
regarding our restructuring charges.
Royalties
We have royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally 
based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Royalty expense, which was recorded under 
our cost of revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Income, was approximately $62.3 million , $45.2 million  and $40.2 million  
in fiscal 2015 , 2014  and 2013 , respectively .
Indemnifications
In the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual 
property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims 
by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically , costs related to these indemnification provisions have not 
been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future 
results of operations.
To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for 
certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity . The indemnification 
period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer’s or director ’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of 
future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however , we have director 
and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We 
believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal.
Legal Proceedings
In connection with disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including 
patent rights, we have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations or complex, protracted litigation. 
Intellectual property disputes and litigation may be very costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the 
attention and energies of management and key technical personnel. Although we have successfully defended or resolved past 
litigation and disputes, we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation and disputes. Third-party intellectual property disputes 
could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent 
us from licensing certain of our products or offering certain of our services, subject us to injunctions restricting our sale of products 
or services, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification 
commitments with our customers including contractual provisions under various license arrangements and service agreements.

98Between May 4, 2011 and July 14, 2011, five putative class action lawsuits were filed in Santa Clara Superior Court and 
Alameda Superior Court in California. On September 12, 2011, the cases were consolidated into In Re High-T ech Employee 
Antitrust Litigation (“HTEAL”) pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, San Jose 
Division. In the consolidated complaint, Plaintif fs alleged that Adobe, along with Apple, Google, Intel, Intuit, Lucasfilm and Pixar , 
agreed not to recruit each other ’s employees in violation of Federal and state antitrust laws. Plaintif fs claim the alleged agreements 
suppressed employee compensation and deprived employees of career opportunities. Plaintif fs seek injunctive relief, monetary 
damages, treble damages, costs and attorneys fees. All defendants deny the allegations and that they engaged in any wrongdoing 
of any kind. On October 24, 2013, the court certified a class of all persons who worked in the technical, creative, and/or research 
and development fields on a salaried basis in the United States for one or more of the following: (a) Apple from March 2005 
through December 2009; (b) Adobe from May 2005 through December 2009; (c) Google from March 2005 through December 
2009; (d) Intel from March 2005 through December 2009; (e) Intuit from June 2007 through December 2009; (f) Lucasfilm from 
January 2005 through December 2009; or (g) Pixar from January 2005 through December 2009, excluding retail employees, 
corporate officers, members of the boards of directors, and senior executives of all defendants. During the first quarter of fiscal 
2015, the parties reached an agreement to settle the litigation. In March 2015, the court granted preliminary approval of the 
settlement and on September 2, 2015, the court granted final approval of the settlement. We expect to incur no additional losses 
associated with this matter .
In addition to intellectual property disputes, we are subject to legal proceedings, claims and investigations in the ordinary 
course of business, including claims relating to commercial, employment and other matters. Some of these disputes and legal 
proceedings may include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We consider all claims on a 
quarterly basis in accordance with GAAP  and based on known facts assess whether potential losses are considered reasonably 
possible, probable and estimable. Based upon this assessment, we then evaluate disclosure requirements and whether to accrue 
for such claims in our financial statements. This determination is then reviewed and discussed with our Audit Committee and our 
independent registered public accounting firm.
We make a provision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can 
be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, 
settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Unless otherwise 
specifically disclosed in this note, we have determined that no provision for liability nor disclosure is required related to any claim 
against us because: (a) there is not a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding amounts already recognized (if any) may be 
incurred with respect to such claim; (b) a reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated; or (c) such estimate is 
immaterial.
All legal costs associated with litigation are expensed as incurred. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However , we 
believe that we have valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against us. It is possible, nevertheless, that our 
consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations could be negatively affected by an unfavorable resolution of 
one or more of such proceedings, claims or investigations.
In connection with our anti-piracy efforts, conducted both internally and through organizations such as the Business Software 
Alliance, from time to time we undertake litigation against alleged copyright infringers. Such lawsuits may lead to counter -claims 
alleging improper use of litigation or violation of other laws. We believe we have valid defenses with respect to such counter -
claims; however , it is possible that our consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations could be negatively 
affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these counter -claims.

Notes
 In February 2010, we issued $600 million  of 3.25%  senior notes due February 1, 2015  (the “2015 Notes”) and $900 million  
of 4.75%  senior notes due February 1, 2020  (the “2020 Notes”). Our proceeds were $1.5 billion  and were net of an issuance 
discount of $6.6 million . In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $10.7 million . Both the discount and issuance costs were or 
are being amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the 2015 and 2020 Notes using the effective interest method. 
The 2015 and 2020 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The effective interest rate 
including the discount and issuance costs was 3.45%  for the 2015 Notes and is 4.92%  for the 2020 Notes. Interest is payable semi-
annually , in arrears, on February 1 and August 1, and commenced on August 1, 2010 . The 2015 Notes were settled on February 1, 
2015 , as discussed below .
In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $900 million  designated as a fair value 
hedge related to our 2020 Notes. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating 
interest rate based on LIBOR plus a fixed number of basis points. Under the terms of the swaps, we will pay monthly interest at 
the one-month LIBOR floating interest rate plus a spread of a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million  notional amount. 
In exchange, we will receive 4.75%  fixed rate interest from the swap counterparties. See Note 5 for further details regarding our 
interest rate swap derivatives.
In December 2014, prior to issuing new long-term fixed rate debt, we entered into an interest rate lock agreement on a 
notional amount of $600 million  to hedge against the variability of future interest payments due to changes in the benchmark 
interest rate. This instrument was designated as a cash flow hedge. See Note 5 for further details regarding our interest rate lock 
agreement.
In January 2015, we issued $1 billion  of 3.25%  senior notes due February 1, 2025  (the “2025 Notes”). Our proceeds were 
approximately $989.3 million  which is net of an issuance discount of $10.7 million . In addition, we incurred issuance costs of 
$7.9 million . Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2025 Notes using 
the effective interest method. The 2025 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The effective 
interest rate including the discount, issuance costs and interest rate agreement is 3.67%  for the 2025 Notes. Interest is payable 
semi-annually , in arrears on February 1 and August 1, commencing on August 1, 2015 . A portion of the proceeds from this offering 
was used to repay $600 million  in aggregate principal amount of the 2015 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest due February 1, 
2015 . The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. 
As of November 27, 2015 , our outstanding notes payable consists of the 2020 Notes and 2025 Notes (the “Notes”) with a 
total carrying value of $1.91 billion . Based on quoted prices in inactive markets, the fair value of the Notes was $1.97 billion  as 
of November 27, 2015 . The total fair value of $1.97 billion  excludes the effect of fair value hedge of the 2020 Notes for which 
we entered into interest rate swaps as described above.

100We may redeem the Notes at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain change 
of control triggering events, we may be required to repurchase the Notes, at a price equal to 101%  of their principal amount, plus 
accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase. The Notes also include covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on 
assets and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to significant allowances. As of November 27, 2015 , we were in 
compliance with all of the covenants.
In February 2015, we made semi-annual interest payments on our 2015 and 2020 Notes totaling $31.1 million . In August 
2015, we made semi-annual interest payments on our 2020 and 2025 Notes totaling $38.1 million .
Credit Agreement
On March 2, 2012, we entered into a five-year $1 billion  senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (the “Credit 
Agreement”), providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, 
subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders, request up to an additional $500 million  in commitments, for a maximum 
aggregate commitment of $1.5 billion . Loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin, 
based on our public debt ratings, ranging from 0.795%  and 1.3%  or (ii) the base rate, which is defined as the highest of (a) the 
agent’ s prime rate, (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%  or (c) LIBOR plus 1.00%  plus a margin, based on our debt 
ratings, ranging from 0.00%  to 0.30% . Commitment fees are payable quarterly at rates between 0.08%  and 0.20%  per year, also 
based on our debt ratings. Subject to certain conditions stated in the Credit Agreement, we and any of our subsidiaries designated 
as additional borrowers may borrow , prepay and re-borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility at any time during the term 
of the Credit Agreement. 
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including a 
financial covenant, events of default and indemnification provisions in favor of the lenders. The negative covenants include 
restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and indebtedness, certain merger and acquisition transactions, dispositions and other 
matters, all subject to certain exceptions. The financial covenant, based on a quarterly financial test, requires us not to exceed a 
maximum leverage ratio. 
 On March 1, 2013, we exercised an option under the Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement 
by one year to March 2, 2018. 
On July 27, 2015, we entered into an amendment to further extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement to July 27, 
2020 and reallocated the facility among the syndicate of lenders that are parties to the Credit Agreement. 
The facility will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on the maturity date unless (a) the 
commitments are terminated earlier upon the occurrence of certain events, including an event of default, or (b) the maturity date 
is further extended upon our request, subject to the agreement of the lenders.
As of November 27, 2015 , there were no outstanding borrowings under this Credit Agreement and we were in compliance 
with all covenants.

104REPOR T OF INDEPENDENT  REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Adobe Systems Incorporated:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Adobe Systems Incorporated and subsidiaries as of 
November 27, 2015 and November 28, 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, 
stockholders’  equity , and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended November 27, 2015. We also have audited 
Adobe Systems Incorporated’ s internal control over financial reporting as of November 27, 2015, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 
(COSO). Adobe Systems Incorporated’ s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining 
effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial 
reporting, included in the accompanying Management’ s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing 
under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the 
Company’ s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United 
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial 
statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all 
material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by 
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting 
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, 
and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also 
included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide 
a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A company’ s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. A company’ s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions 
of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the 
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’ s 
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because 
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly , in all material respects, the financial 
position of Adobe Systems Incorporated and subsidiaries as of November 27, 2015 and November 28, 2014, and the results of 
their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended November 27, 2015, in conformity with 
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, Adobe Systems Incorporated maintained, in all material respects, 
effective internal control over financial reporting as of November 27, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - 
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosur e Contr ols and Procedur es
Our management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of November 27, 2015 . Based on their evaluation 
as of November 27, 2015 , our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls 
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were 
effective at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in this Annual Report on 
Form 10-K was (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’ s rules and 
regulations and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure 
controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no 
matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control 
system are met. Further , the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of 
controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of 
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Adobe have been detected.
Management’ s Annual Report on Internal Contr ol over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as 
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our management assessed the effectiveness 
of our internal control over financial reporting as of November 27, 2015 . In making this assessment, our management used the 
criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Contr ol-
Integrated Framework (2013) . Our management has concluded that, as of November 27, 2015 , our internal control over financial 
reporting is effective based on these criteria.
KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our financial statements included in this Annual 
Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.
Changes in Internal Contr ol over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended November 27, 2015  that 
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
