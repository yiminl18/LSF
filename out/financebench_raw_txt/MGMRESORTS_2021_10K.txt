MGM
 Resorts International is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1986 that acts largely as a holding company and, through subsidiaries, owns andoperates integrated 
casino, hotel, and entertainment resorts across the United States and in Macau.We believe
 we operate several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage. Wemake
 significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms, restaurants, entertainment and nightlife offerings, as well as other new featuresand
 amenities. We believe we operate the highest quality resorts in each of the markets in which we operate. Ensuring our resorts are the premier resorts in theirrespective markets requires capital
 investments to maintain the best possible experiences for our guests.MGM Growth Properties LLC
 (“MGP”), is a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. Substantially all of its assets are owned by and substantially all of itsbusinesses
 are conducted through its subsidiary MGM Growth Properties Operating Partnership LP (the “Operating Partnership”). As of December 31, 2021, welease

ese leases.Business Developments
In
 recent years, in furtherance of our vision to be the world’s premier gaming entertainment company, we have implemented an asset-light business model,which
 has involved a comprehensive review of our owned real estate assets to find opportunities to monetize those assets efficiently and allow unlocked capital tobe
 redeployed towards balance sheet improvements, new growth opportunities, and to return value to our shareholders. At the same time, we have continued tofocus
 on key growth opportunities that align with our vision, particularly by investing in U.S. online sports betting and iGaming through BetMGM, expanding ourdigital capabilit
ies, and seeking to diversify our Asia operations with development efforts in Japan.As
 part of that business strategy, we have sought, and executed on, opportunities to invest in our growth areas, divest our real estate assets, and acquire, orenter into venture tr
ansactions with respect to the operations of integrated casino, hotel, and entertainment resorts, including through the following transactions:•

Financial
 Impact of COVID-19. See  “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Description ofour business and key performance indicators — Financial Impact of CO
VID-19” for more information about the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our businessand
 our recovery. For a discussion of the risks to our business resulting from COVID-19, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business, Industry,and Market Conditions.”
Resort Operations
General
Most
 of our revenue is cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. We rely on theability
 of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development, acquisitions or investments,and repay debt financings.
Our
 results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature as all of our casino resorts, except as otherwise described related to the impact of COVID-19,typically operate 24 hours 
a day, every day of the year, with the exception of Empire City, which operates 20 hours a day, every day of the year, though a variety offactors may
 affect the results of any interim period, including the timing of major conventions, Far East baccarat volumes, the amount and timing of marketing andspecial
 events for our high-end gaming customers, and the level of play during major holidays, including New Year and Lunar New Year. Our primary casino andhotel
 operations are owned and managed by us. Other resort amenities may be owned and operated by us, owned by us but managed by third parties for a fee, orleased to third parti
es. We also lease space to third-party retail and food and beverage operators, particularly for branding opportunities.As
 of December 31, 2021, we have three reportable segments: Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations, and MGM China, as generally describedbelow. See Note 17 for detailed f
inancial information about our reportable segments.Las Vegas Strip Resorts and Regional Operations
Las
 Vegas Strip Resorts. Las  Vegas Strip Resorts consists of the following casino resorts: Aria (including Vdara) (upon acquisition in September 2021),Bellagio,
 MGM  Grand  Las  Vegas  (including  The  Signature),  Mandalay  Bay  (including  Delano  and  Four  Seasons),  The  Mirage,  Luxor,  New  York-New  York(including The Park), Excalibu
r, Park MGM (including NoMad Las Vegas) and Circus Circus Las Vegas (until the sale of such property in December 2019).Regional
 Operations. Regional  Operations consists of the following casino resorts:  MGM Grand Detroit in Detroit, Michigan;  Beau Rivage in Biloxi,Mississippi; Gold Strike Tunica in Tun
ica, Mississippi; Borgata in Atlantic City, New3

Jersey; MGM National Harbor in Prince George’s County, Maryland; MGM Springfield in Springfield, Massachusetts; Empire City in Yonkers, New York (uponits acquisition in January 2019
); and MGM Northfield Park in Northfield Park, Ohio (upon MGM’s acquisition of the operations from MGP in April 2019).Over
 half  of  the  net  revenue  from  our  Las  Vegas  Strip  Resorts  is  typically  derived  from  non-gaming  operations,  including  hotel,  food  and  beverage,entertainment
 and other non-gaming amenities and the majority of the net revenue from our Regional Operations is typically derived from gaming operations.Although
 our domestic customer mix has changed in the near term as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our long-term strategy continues to be to market todifferent
 customers and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes, which also leadsto better labor util
ization. Our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our properties, which in turn affects the price we can charge forour hotel rooms and other am
enities.Our
 casino operations feature a variety of slots and table games, and, through BetMGM, we offer online sports betting and iGaming in certain jurisdictionsin
 the  United  States.  In  addition,  we  provide  our  premium  players  access  to  high-limit  rooms  and  lounge  experiences  where  players  may  enjoy  an  upscaleatmosphere.
MGM China
We
 own  approximately  56%  of  MGM  China,  which  owns  MGM  Grand  Paradise,  S.A.  (“MGM  Grand  Paradise”),  the  Macau  company  that  owns  andoperates
 the MGM Macau and MGM Cotai casino resorts and holds the related gaming subconcession and land concessions. We believe our ownership interest inMGM
 China plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability. Although visitation during 2020 and2021
 was significantly reduced by the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect the long-term future growth of the Asian gaming market to drive additional visitation atMGM Macau and MGM Cotai.
Our current
 MGM China operations relate to MGM Macau and MGM Cotai, discussed further below. MGM China’s revenues are generated primarily fromgaming
 operations which are conducted under a gaming subconcession held by MGM Grand Paradise, a subsidiary of MGM China. The Macau government hasgranted three gaming con
cessions and each of these concessionaires has granted a subconcession. The MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession was granted bySJM
 Resorts S.A. ("SJMSA", formerly Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, S.A.), which expires in June 2022. The Macau government currently prohibits additionalconcessions
 and subconcessions, but does not place a limit on the number of casinos or gaming areas operated by the concessionaires and subconcessionaires,though
 additional  casinos  or  gaming  areas  require  government  approval  prior  to  commencing  operations.  See  “Risk  Factors  —  Risks  Related  to  our  MacauOperations
 —  The  Macau  government  can  terminate  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  subconcession  under  certain  circumstances  without  compensating  MGM  GrandParadise,
 exercise its redemption right with respect to the subconcession, or refuse to grant MGM Grand Paradise an extension of the subconcession in 2022, orMGM
 Grand Paradise may be unsuccessful in obtaining a gaming concession when a new public tender is held by the Macau government, any of which wouldhave a material adv
erse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.”As
 discussed above, gaming in Macau is currently administered by the Macau Government through concessions awarded to three different concessionairesand
 three  subconcessionaires,  of  which  a  subsidiary  of  MGM  China,  MGM  Grand  Paradise,  is  a  subconcessionaire.  In  2019,  the  expiration  of  MGM  GrandParadise's
 subconcession  term  was  extended  from  March  31,  2020  to  June  26,  2022,  consistent  with  the  expiration  of  the  other  concessionaires  andsubconcessionaires. Pursuant to th
e current Macau gaming law, upon reaching the maximum duration of 20 years, the term of the concessions may be extended oneor
 more times by order of the Chief Executive, which period may not exceed, in total, 5 years. On January 14, 2022, the Macau Government disclosed the contentof
 a bill to amend Macau gaming law, which followed a 45-day public consultation process regarding draft amendment proposals that were issued in September2021.
 Under  the  bill,  the  existing  subconcessions  will  be  discontinued  and  a  maximum  of  six  concessions  will  be  awarded  for  a  term  to  be  specified  in  theconcession contract that may not exceed 10 years and which may be extended b
y three years under certain circumstances. The bill is subject to debate and approvalby
 the Macau Legislative Assembly. The approval of the new gaming law bill will precede the public tender for the awarding of new gaming concessions and todate
 the  Macau  Government  has  provided  no  indication  as  to  whether  the  public  tender  will  take  place  before  expiry  of  the  existing  gaming  concessions  andsubconcessions but acknowledged that
 it could consider the extension of the existing concessions and subconcessions beyond their current term if the public tenderis
 held at a later date. Unless MGM Grand Paradise's gaming subconcession is extended or legislation with regard to reversion of casino premises is amended, thecasino
 area premises and gaming-related equipment subject to reversion will automatically be transferred to the Macau Government upon expiration, and MGMGrand Paradise
 will cease to generate any revenues from such gaming operations. In addition, certain events relating to the loss, termination, rescission, revocationor
 modification of MGM Grand Paradise’s gaming subconcession in Macau, where such events have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business,properties,
 or results of operations of MGM China, taken as a whole, may result in a special put option triggering event under MGM China’s senior notes and anevent of default under MGM China’s 
revolving credit facilities. MGM4

China continues to closely monitor developments regarding the retendering process or concession extensions including the issuance of guidance by the MacauGovernment.
 MGM China intends to respond proactively to all relevant Macau Government requirements when known relating to the retendering process. Wecannot
 provide any assurance that the gaming subconcession will be extended beyond the current term or that we will be able to obtain a gaming concession in apublic tender; however, man
agement believes that MGM Grand Paradise will be successful in obtaining a gaming concession when a public tender is held.Corporate and Other
We
 have additional business activities including our investments in unconsolidated affiliates, and certain other corporate and management operations. Ourunconsolidated
 affiliates  include  the  ventures  with  BREIT,  discussed  elsewhere,  and  BetMGM.  In  September  2021,  we  completed  the  acquisition  of  the  50%ownership interest in CityCenter held b
y Infinity World and now own 100% of the equity interest in CityCenter. Accordingly, we no longer account for our interestin CityCenter under the equity 
method of accounting, and we now consolidate CityCenter in our financial statements.5

 we operate, neighboring markets, and in other parts of the world, including non-gaming resort destinations such as Hawaii. Our gaming operations competeto
 a  lesser  extent  with  state-sponsored  lotteries,  off-track  wagering,  card  parlors,  iGaming  and  other  forms  of  legalized  gaming  in  the  United  States  andinternationally.
 For  further  discussion  of  the  potential  impact  of  competitive  conditions  on  our  business,  see  “Item  1A.  Risk  Factors  —  Risks  Related  to  ourBusiness, Industry, and Market Conditions — We face
 significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers inthe industries in which we compete, including increased competition throu
gh online sports betting and iGaming, and failure to compete effectively could materiallyadversely affect our bus
iness, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.”Our primary methods of success
ful competition include:•
Locating our resorts in desirable leisure and business travel markets and operating at superior sites within those markets;•
Constructing and maintaining high-quality resorts and facilities, including luxurious guestrooms, state-of-the-art convention facilities and premier dining,entertainment, retail and other ame
nities;•
Recruiting, training and retaining well-qualified and motivated employees who provide superior customer service;•
Providing unique, “must-see” entertainment attractions; and•
Developing distinctive and memorable marketing, promotional and customer loyalty programs.Las Vegas Strip Resorts and Regional Operations
Our customers include premium
 gaming customers; leisure and wholesale travel customers; business travelers, and group customers, including conventions,trade
 associations, and small meetings. We have a diverse portfolio of properties, which appeal to the upper end of each market segment and also cater to leisureand
 value-oriented tour and travel customers. Many of our properties have significant convention and meeting space which we utilize to drive business to ourproperties during midweek and o
ff-peak periods.Our
 Las Vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other hotel casinos in the Las Vegas area, including major hotel casinos on ornear
 the Las Vegas Strip, major hotel casinos in the downtown area, which is about five miles from the center of the Las Vegas Strip, and several major hotelcasinos
 elsewhere in the Las Vegas area. Our Las Vegas Strip Resorts also compete, in part, with each other. Major competitors, including new entrants, haveeither
 recently expanded their hotel room capacity and convention space offerings, or have plans to expand their capacity or construct new resorts in Las Vegas.Also, the growth of gaming in areas ou
tside Las Vegas has increased the competition faced by our operations in Las Vegas.Outside
 Nevada, our resorts primarily compete with other hotel casinos in their markets and for customers in surrounding regional gaming markets, wherelocation is a criti
cal factor to success. In addition, we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region.MGM China
The
 three primary customer bases in the Macau gaming market are VIP gaming operations, main floor gaming operations and slot machine operations. VIPgaming
 play has historically been sourced both internally and externally. Externally sourced VIP gaming play was obtained through external gaming promoterswho
 assist  VIP  players  with  their  travel  and  entertainment  arrangements.  Gaming  promoters  have  been  compensated  through  payment  of  revenue-sharingarrangements
 and  rolling  chip  turnover-based  commissions.  In-house  VIP  players  also  typically  receive  a  commission  based  on  the  program  in  which  theyparticipate.
 Unlike  gaming  promoters  and  in-house  VIP  players,  main  floor  players  do  not  receive  commissions.  The  profit  contribution  from  the  main  floorgaming
 operations has historically exceeded the VIP gaming operations due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters. We offer amenities to attract playerssuch
 as premium gaming lounges and stadium-style electronic table games terminals, which include both table games and slots to create a dedicated exclusivegaming space
 for premium main floor players’ use, as well as non-gaming amenities, such as The Mansion and MGM Cotai Emerald Villa to attract ultra-high endcustomers.
VIP
 gaming  at  MGM  China  is  conducted  by  the  use  of  special  purpose  nonnegotiable  gaming  chips.  Gaming  promoters  currently  purchase  thesenonnegotiable chips
 and in turn they sell these chips to their players. The nonnegotiable chips allow us to track the amount of wagering conducted by each gamingpromoters’
 clients in order to determine VIP gaming play. Gaming promoter commissions are currently based on a percentage of the gross table games win or apercentage
 of  the  table  games  turnover  they  generate.  They  also  receive  a  complimentary  allowance  based  on  a  percentage  of  the  table  games  turnover  theygenerate, which can be appl
ied to hotel rooms, food and beverage and other discretionary7

customer-related expenses. Gaming promoter commissions are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue. In-house VIP commissions are based on a percentage ofrolling chip turnover and a
re recorded as a reduction of casino revenue.In December 2021,
 we suspended operations with our primary gaming promoters. In January 2022, the Macau Government disclosed the content of a bill toamend
 the gaming law which includes some restrictions relating to gaming promoters, including: each gaming promoter can only exercise the activity of gamingpromotion
 for one concessionaire, revenue sharing arrangements between concessionaires and gaming promoters are prohibited, gaming promoters are prohibitedfrom having
 exclusive operation of casino reserved areas, and gaming promoters are restricted to only providing support to the concessionaires in the promotion ofcasino gaming activit
ies through commissions. The bill is subject to debate and approval by the Macau Legislative Assembly.We
 have focused our business on main floor gaming operations and, accordingly, we do not expect VIP gaming operations to be a significant source ofrevenue
 in future years. The majority of MGM China's casino revenue has been provided by main floor gaming operations in recent years and we expect thiscustomer base will be the p
rimary source of growth in the future.Our
 key  competitors  in  Macau  include  five  other  gaming  concessionaires  and  subconcessionaires.  If  the  Macau  government  were  to  grant  additionalconcessions or subconcessions, we would fac
e additional competition which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations orcash
 flows. Additionally, we face competition at our Macau and Cotai properties from concessionaires who have expanded their operations, primarily on the CotaiStrip.
We
 encounter competition from major gaming centers located in other areas of Asia and around the world including, but not limited to, Singapore, SouthKorea, Vietnam, Cambodia, the Phil
ippines, Australia, and Las Vegas.Marketing
Our
 marketing efforts are conducted through various means, including our loyalty programs. We advertise on radio, television, internet and billboards andin newspapers
 and magazines in selected cities throughout the United States and overseas, as well as by direct mail, email and through the use of social media. Wealso advertise through our regional marketing offices located in major U.S. and foreig
n cities. Our direct marketing efforts utilize advanced analytic techniques thatidentify
 customer preferences and help predict future customer behavior, allowing us to make more relevant offers to customers, influence incremental visits, andhelp build lasting custome
r relationships.MGM
 Rewards, our customer loyalty program, is a tiered program and allows customers to qualify for benefits across our participating resorts and in bothgaming
 and non-gaming areas, encouraging customers to keep their total spend within our casino resorts. In January 2022, we redesigned our loyalty program toexpand
 the ways in which our customers can earn benefits. We also offer the Golden Lion Club for gaming focused customers, in addition to M life Rewards, atMGM
 China. The structured rewards systems based on member value and tier level ensure that customers can progressively access the full range of services thatthe
 resorts provide. Our loyalty programs focus on building a rewarding relationship with our customers, encouraging members to increase both visitation andspend.
Strategy
We
 strive  to  be  a  leader  in  the  global  gaming,  entertainment  and  hospitality  industry  that  delivers  extraordinary  entertainment  across  a  portfolio  ofproperties in the United Sta
tes and Macau. The quality of our properties and amenities is evidenced by our success in winning numerous awards, both domestic andglobally, including severa
l Four and Five Diamond designations from the American Automobile Association, multiple Four and Five Star designations from ForbesTravel Guide and numerous cer
tifications of our Corporate Social Responsibility efforts.In
 order to achieve our vision of becoming the world's premier gaming entertainment company, we developed our strategic plan, which centers on fourpillars:
•
Strong People and Culture. Recruit, develop and reta in the best talent. Foster a culture of diversity and inclusion. Invest in the employee experience.•
Customer-Centric  Model.  Leverage  a  customer-centric  model  reinforced  by  a  strong  brand  and  deep  customer  insights  to  provide  unmatchedentertainment expe
riences for our guests and drive top-line growth.•
Operational Excellence.  Operating  model  refinement  to  maximize  operating  efficiencies  and  expand  margins.  Enhancement  of  digital  capabilities  tostrengthen customer loya
lty.•
Disciplined  Capital  Allocation  to  Maximize  Shareholder  Value. Pursuit  of  targeted,  attractive  ROI  opportunities  that  align  to  our  strategic  vision.Focus on shareholder returns. Forti
fy balance sheet.8

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting rapidly changing environment, our strategic direction must allow for flexibility. The strategic plan wasdeveloped with the intent to 
regularly revisit, measure, and reevaluate for emerging opportunities.In
 allocating resources, our financial strategy is focused on managing a proper mix of investments in our existing properties, strategic growth opportunities,debt
 repayment and shareholder returns. We believe there are reasonable investments for us to make in new initiatives and at our current resorts that will provideprofitable returns.
We
 regularly evaluate targeted opportunities that provide an attractive return on investment in domestic and international markets, including the ownership,management and
 operation of gaming facilities and accessing new markets for iGaming and online sports betting. We also leverage our management expertise andwell-recognized
 brands through strategic partnerships and international expansion opportunities. We feel that several of our brands are well-suited to new projectsin both gaming and non-gaming deve
lopments. We may undertake these opportunities either alone or in cooperation with one or more third parties.We
 continue  to  invest  in  our  operating  model  by  expanding  the  footprint  of  our  Centers  of  Excellence  and  enabling  best  in  class  operations  throughadjustments
 within corporate and property business units. In addition, we have implemented several improvement and cost cutting initiatives comprised of labor,sourcing, and revenue programs 
that have further improved our operating model and have positioned us as a stronger company.We have
 continued to focus on our key growth opportunities of developing an integrated resort in Japan and investing in BetMGM. In September 2021, we,together
 with our venture partner, ORIX, were selected by Osaka as the region’s integrated resort partner. This selection marks an important step in our long-termbid
 to develop one of Japan’s first integrated casino resorts. We are currently working with Osaka to submit an area development plan to the central governmentduring the
 application period. As it relates to BetMGM, we believe that BetMGM is positioned as a long-term leader in the U.S. online sports betting and iGamingindustries. As part of
 our commitment to the success of BetMGM, we have  integrated our MGM Rewards program with BetMGM and have BetMGM branded on-property sportsbooks
 and kiosks to drive higher value customers at lower acquisition costs through a robust omni-channel strategy. Further, we continue to explorebringing full-scale co
mmercial gaming to Empire City in New York.Technology
We
 believe  technology,  digital  and  advanced  data  science/analytics  capabilities  are  critical  to  optimizing  customer  experience  and  loyalty,  employeeproductivity
 and engagement, operational efficiency and revenue growth. We are focused on using these capabilities to achieve specific goals of creating ‘only atMGM’
 differentiation through unique content and experiences, establishing a perennial engagement with our guests for increased loyalty, digital diversificationthrough enhanced
 e-commerce and seamless integration of the physical integrated resorts business with digital casino and sports betting businesses, creating cross-property
 experiences and promotions in Las Vegas to provide much better value to the consumer, enhancing our data driven decisioning capabilities in all aspectsof our business for faster de
cision making, and optimizing our operations and employee productivity and experience through digitization.Environmental & Social Responsibility
At
 MGM Resorts we have had a long-standing commitment to environmental and social responsibility. For over a decade, we have had a dedicated boardcommittee
 focused on Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”). In 2019, we had bolstered governance of these topics by uniting our key pillars of Diversity andInclusion,
 Philanthropy  and  Community  Engagement  and  Environmental  Sustainability  under  one  Executive  Committee-level  leader  who  manages  the  MGMResorts
 Social Impact and Sustainability Center of Excellence, reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer and President, and serves as liaison to the CSR andSustainability
 board committee. This leader now also oversees the Human Resources function, and is thus able to integrate Environmental, Social and Governance(“ESG”) considerations more d
eeply into the core culture of our organization.The
 year 2021 was a critical one in terms of progress on our ESG initiatives. In May 2021, we published our 2020 Social Impact & Sustainability Reportcontaining our most robust ESG disclosures to date. In this
 report we showed the significant progress made towards many of our ESG goals that we had announcedpublicly in prior reports, 
and we expect to publish a report in 2022 reflecting our progress on these goals during 2021.Importantly,
 2021 saw the opening of the 100MW “MGM Resorts Mega Solar Array” in North Las Vegas. This is the hospitality industry’s largest direct-connect
 renewable electricity project world-wide and has significantly improved our trajectory to achieve our previously announced carbon reduction goals. Inconnection
 with the opening of this array, we enhanced our climate ambition by announcing two new 2030 goals: to cut global total operational carbon emissionsby
9

50%, and source 100% renewable electricity in the USA. Beyond the environmental benefits associated with the renewable electricity generated, the array will alsohelp us hedge our electri
city costs and reduce our exposure to price volatility risks.In
 2021,  we  also  made  substantial  progress  against  our  commitment  to  aligning  more  of  our  ESG  report  disclosures  to  leading  ESG  frameworks  bypublishing
 our  first  ever  disclosures  informed  by  guidelines  of  the  Global  Reporting  Initiative  (GRI)  and  Sustainability  Accounting  Standards  Board  (SASB)Hotels & Lodging and Casinos & Gaming Sector St
andards.Our
 full  list  of  ESG  goals  and  performance  against  them  are  available  in  our  2020  Social  Impact  &  Sustainability  Report,  available  atmgmresorts.com/focused.

 duration so long as they are used and periodically renewed. It is our intent to pursue and maintain our trademark registrations consistent with our goalsfor brand development and id
entification, and enforcement of our trademark rights.Human Capital
We
 are focused on fostering  a people-driven culture  exemplified  by how we lead and uphold our core values, which in 2021 evolved to: captivate ouraudience,
 inspire excellence, champion inclusion, and win together, to create an engaged and diverse workforce. Our long-term people strategy is designed toenhance
 talent  attraction  and  development  to  support  business  objectives,  guest  experience,  community  engagement,  and  financial  goals.  Our  workforcedevelopment
 strategies support local hiring and developing a robust workforce in the local communities in which we operate through veteran support, communitytraining and employment, 
fulfilling local hiring commitments (where applicable), and through internship and management development programs.Growth and Development
We
 invest significant resources to develop the talent needed, now and in the future, to continue to be a premier employer of choice across the gaming,hospitality,
 and entertainment industries. We are committed to a culture of continuous learning where employees, at all levels, are engaged in developing theirknowledge,
 skills, and abilities and we support the long-term career aspirations of our employees through education and professional/personal development. In2021,
 we introduced several new learning and development initiatives focused on a broad range of employee segments. Except  as otherwise temporarily impacteddue
 to  COVID-19,  we  offer  tuition  reimbursement,  contribute  toward  student  loan  debt  repayment,  and  have  partnered  with  the  Nevada  System  of  HigherEducation to allow employees 
to earn a degree online free of charge for all credit hours.Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion 
(“ED&I”)Our
 approach  to  ED&I  is  anchored  by  our  corporate  and  people  strategies  and  a  social  impact  and  sustainability  approach  that  centers  on  embracinghumanity
 and  protecting  the  planet.  A  concise  framework  lays  out  four  strategic  pillars  to  guide  our  work:  invest  in  people;  build  an  inclusive  culture;  growbusiness
 and customer engagement and supplier diversity; and, enhance marketplace leadership and community relations. As part of our commitment, we havecommitted
 to  the  following  four  long-range  goals:  (1)  ensure  that  all  employees  have  equal  access  to  leadership  opportunities,  (2)  spend  at  least  10%  of  ourbiddable
 procurement with diverse suppliers, (3) expand our Supplier Diversity Mentorship Program to achieve 50 graduates and (4) train 100% of managementemployees
 on  social  impact  policies  and  goals.  In  connection  with  each  goal,  we  have  established  robust  key  performance  indicators,  which  are  tracked  andpublished
 in  our  annual  Social  Impact  and  Sustainability  Report.In  addition,  we  have  detailed  internal  Human  Capital  workforce  reports,  which  includedemographic
 and  diversity  data,  and  are  reviewed  with  the  Corporate  Social  Responsibility  and  Sustainability  Committee  of  the  Board,  leadership  teams  andexecutive managemen
t on a regular basis.10

Internally, we use multiple channels to facilitate communication and to continuously advance our core value of inclusiveness. The channels include but arenot limited to open forums wi
th executives, employee engagement surveys with detailed action planning, and employee network groups.Work
 in  the  area  of  equity,  diversity  and  inclusion  is  advanced  through  a  range  of  programs  and  initiatives  which  include  education  and  training,community
 partnerships,  recruitment  and  talent  development,  advocacy,  engagement  and  outreach.  Responsibility  is  driven  and  led  by  the  Company’s  ChiefPeople,
 Inclusion and Sustainability Officer, who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer and President, and is supported by a centralized diversity andinclusion team and the Human Resou
rces department.Health, Safety, and Wellness
In
 order to promote our culture of overall employee health and wellness we provide benefits, tools and resources to help maintain or improve physical,mental,
 and  financial  health.  We  continue  to  align  benefit  offerings  to  the  needs  of  a  diverse  workforce  across  an  expanded  regional  presence  and  leverageinnovative
 solutions to expand access to health and wellness resources, including the recent addition of a service to help connect LGBTQIA+ people and theirloved ones with culturally and 
clinically competent health care providers.To
 ensure our employees' continued health, safety, and wellness in response to COVID-19, we coordinated with medical experts to put in place extensivetesting
 protocols for our employees and required COVID-19 vaccination as a condition of employment for all salaried employees and new hires throughout theUnited States.
 As a commitment to our employees impacted by the pandemic, we have maintained benefits eligibility for many employees who were furloughed in2020 and were unable to work enough hours to qual
ify for benefits until business conditions improved.Community Engagement and Philanthropy
Our
 philanthropic focus centers around: Embracing  Humanity and Protecting the Planet.  We organize our major programs and initiatives under the pillarsof 
caring for one another and investing  in the community.  We established the MGM Resorts Foundation in 2002 as an engagement opportunity for employees tocontribute
 to charitable causes, which provides two types of grants (1) the Employee Emergency Grant, which benefits our employees, and (2) the CommunityGrant,
 which benefits local communities. We endeavor to care for our communities through volunteerism and philanthropy and encourage all of our employees tovolunteer through
 a variety of programs. In addition, we offer opportunities for our employees to give back to their communities, including through programs suchas VolunteerREWARDS, which provides employees with oppor
tunities to earn grant money to their charity of choice based on volunteer hours.Employees and Labor Relations
As
 of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 42,000 full-time and 17,000 part-time employees domestically. In addition, we had approximately 10,000employees
 at MGM China. We had collective bargaining agreements with unions covering approximately 35,000 of our employees as of December 31, 2021.Collective bargaining

will continue throughout 2022. As of December 31, 2021, none of the employees of MGM China are part of alabor union and the MGM China resorts a
re not party to any collective bargaining agreements.Government Regulation and Licensing
The gaming
 industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. Each of our casinos is subjectto
 extensive  regulation  under the laws, rules  and regulations  of the jurisdiction  in which it is located.  These laws, rules and regulations  generally  concern  theresponsibility,
 financial stability and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interest in the gaming operations. Violations of laws in onejurisdiction could resul
t in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions.A
 more detailed description of the gaming regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, whichExhibit is incorporated he

 and  anti-money  laundering  regulations.  Such  laws  and  regulations  could  change  or  could  be  interpreted  differently  in  the  future,  or  new  laws  andregulations
 could be enacted. Material  changes, new laws or regulations,  or material  differences  in interpretations  by courts or governmental authorities  couldadversely affect our op
erating results.In

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS
You
 should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this section and elsewhere in this report or in any other of our filings with theSEC
 could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In evaluating us, you should consider carefully,among other things, the risks des
cribed below.Summary of Risk Factors
The following is a summary of th
e principal risks that could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.Risks Related to Our Substantial Financial Commitments
•
Our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments, including the fixed component of our rent payments and guarantees we provide onthe
 indebtedness of Bellagio BREIT Venture and MGP BREIT Venture could adversely affect our operations and financial results and impact our abilityto satisfy our obligations.
•
Current and future economic, capital and credit market conditions could adversely affect our ability to service our substantial indebtedness and significantfinancial commitments or make pla
nned expenditures.•
The agreements governing our senior credit facility and other senior indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect ourability to operate our bus
iness, as well as significantly affect our liquidity, and therefore could adversely affect our results of operations.•
We  are  required  to  pay  a  significant  portion  of  our  cash  flows  as  rent,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  ability  to  fund  our  operations  and  growthinitiatives, service our in
debtedness and limit our ability to react to competitive and economic changes.Risks Related to Our Announced Transactions
•
The VICI Transaction, The Cosmopolitan transaction, and The Mirage transaction each remain subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions,including
 the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, and any anticipated benefits from such transactions may take longer to realize than expected or maynot be realized at all.
•
The potential litigation instituted against us, our transaction counterparties, or our respective directors challenging the VICI Transaction may prevent suchtransaction from becoming effecti
ve within the expected timeframe or at all.Risks Related to Our Business, Industry, and Market Conditions
•
The global COVID-19 pandemic has continued to materially impact our business, financial results and liquidity, and such impact could worsen and lastfor an unknown period of time.
•
We face significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete,including
 increased  competition  through  online  sports  betting  and  iGaming,  and  failure  to  compete  effectively  could  materially  adversely  affect  ourbusiness, financial condit
ion, results of operations and cash flows.•
Our business is affected by economic and market conditions in the jurisdictions in which we operate and in the locations in which our customers reside.•
We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our cost savings initiatives, including those associated with our MGM 2020 Plan.15

•Our ability to pay ongoing regular dividends to our stockholders is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by our holdingcompany structure, exist
ing and future debt agreements entered into by us or our subsidiaries and state law requirements.•
All of our domestic gaming facilities are leased and could experience risks associated with leased property, including risks relating to lease termination,lease
 extensions, charges and our relationship with the lessor, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results ofoperations.
•
Paul Salem, our Chairman, Daniel J. Taylor, one of our directors, and Corey Sanders, and John M. McManus, members of our senior management, mayhave actual or potenti
al conflicts of interest because of their positions at MGP.•
Despite our ability to exercise control over the affairs of MGP as a result of our ownership of the single outstanding Class B share of MGP, MGP hasadopted
 a policy under which certain transactions with us, including transactions involving consideration in excess of $25 million, must be approved inaccordance with certain specifie
d procedures, which could affect our ability to execute our operational and strategic objectives.•
Because a significant number of our major gaming resorts are concentrated on the Las Vegas Strip, we are subject to greater risks than a gaming companythat is more geographic
ally diversified.•
We extend credit to a large portion of our customers and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables.•
We may incur impairments to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or long-lived assets which could negatively affect our future profits.•
Leisure  and  business  travel,  especially  travel  by  air,  are  particularly  susceptible  to  global  geopolitical  events,  such  as  terrorist  attacks,  other  acts  ofviolence or acts of war or hos
tility or the outbreak of infectious diseases.•
Co-investing in properties or businesses, including our investment in BetMGM, decreases our ability to manage risk.•
Any of our future construction, development or expansion projects will be subject to significant development and construction risks, which could have amaterial adverse impact on related 
project timetables, costs and our ability to complete the projects.•
Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer. In addition, our insurance costs may increase andwe may not be able to obtain si
milar insurance coverage in the future.•
Any failure to protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names and adversely affect our business.•
A significant portion of our labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements.•
Our business is particularly sensitive to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results.•
We may seek to expand through investments in other businesses and properties or through alliances or acquisitions, and we may also seek to divest someof our properties and other 
assets, any of which may be unsuccessful.•
The failure to maintain the integrity of our computer systems and customer information could result in damage to our reputation and/or subject us to fines,payment of damages, lawsuits 
and restrictions on our use of data.•
We are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility and reputation.•
We are subject to risks and costs related to climate change.Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters and Changes in Public Policy
•
Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations may adversely affect our businessand results of operations.
•
Any violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any other similar anti-corruption laws could have a negative impact on us.•
If the jurisdictions in which we operate increase gaming taxes and fees, as well as other taxes and fees, our results could be adversely affected.•
The future recognition of our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is uncertain, and the amount of valuation allowance we may apply against such deferredtax asset may change materially
 in future periods.•
We face risks related to pending claims that have been, or future claims that may be, brought against us.Risks Related to Our Macau Operations
•
We have agreed not to have any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in China, Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan, other than through MGM China.•
The Macau government can terminate MGM Grand Paradise’s subconcession under certain circumstances without compensating MGM Grand Paradise,exercise
 its redemption right with respect to the subconcession, or refuse to grant MGM Grand Paradise an extension of the subconcession in 2022, orMGM Grand Paradise may be unsuccessful 
in obtaining a gaming concession when a new public tender is held by the Macau government, any of16

which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.•
We are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.•
Conflicts of interest may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also directors of MGM China, the holding company for MGM GrandParadise which owns and operates MGM Macau 
and MGM Cotai.For a more complete discuss
ion of the material risks facing our business, please see below.Risks Related to Our Substantial Financial Commitments
Our substantial
 indebtedness and significant financial commitments, including the fixed component of our rent payments and guarantees we provide ofthe
 indebtedness of Bellagio BREIT Venture and MGP BREIT Venture could adversely affect our operations and financial results and impact our ability tosatisfy
 our obligations. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $12.9 billion of principal amount of indebtedness outstanding on a consolidated basis,including
 $4.3 billion of outstanding indebtedness of the Operating Partnership and $3.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness of MGM China. Any increase in theinterest
 rates applicable to our existing or future borrowings would increase the cost of our indebtedness and reduce the cash flow available to fund our otherliquidity
 needs. We do not guarantee MGM China’s or the Operating Partnership’s obligations under their respective debt agreements and, to the extent MGMChina or
 the Operating Partnership were to cease to produce cash flow sufficient to service their indebtedness, our ability to make additional investments into suchentities is limited by the c
ovenants in our existing senior credit facility.In addition, our substantial 
indebtedness and significant financial commitments could have important negative consequences on us, including:•
increasing our exposure to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•
limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;•
limiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, execution of our businessstrategy (including re
turning value to our shareholders) or other general operating requirements;•
making it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness; or•
placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less-leveraged competitors.We
 currently also provide shortfall guarantees of the $3.01 billion and $3.0 billion principal amount of indebtedness (and any interest accrued and unpaidthereon)
 of Bellagio BREIT Venture and MGP BREIT Venture, respectively. The terms of each guarantee provide that, after the lenders have exhausted certainremedies to
 collect on the obligations under the underlying indebtedness, we would then be responsible for any shortfall between the value of the collateral and thedebt
 obligation, which amount may be material, and we may not have sufficient cash on hand to fund any such obligation to the extent it is triggered in the future.If we do
 not have sufficient cash on hand, we may need to raise capital, including incurring additional indebtedness, in order to satisfy our obligation. There can beno assurance that any finan
cing will be available to us, or, if available, will be on terms that are satisfactory to us.Moreover, our businesses are capital intensive. For our ow
ned, leased and managed resorts to remain attractive and competitive, we must periodically investsignificant
 capital to keep the properties well-maintained, modernized and refurbished. The leases for our operating properties have fixed rental payments (withannual
 escalators) and also require us to apply a percentage of net revenues generated at the leased properties to capital expenditures at those properties. Suchinvestments
 require an ongoing supply of cash and, to the extent that we cannot fund expenditures from cash generated by operations, funds must be borrowed orotherwise
 obtained. Similarly, development projects, including any potential future development of an integrated resort in Japan, strategic initiatives, includingpositioning BetMGM
 as a leader in online sports betting and iGaming, and acquisitions could require significant capital commitments, the incurrence of additionaldebt,
 guarantees of third-party debt or the incurrence of contingent liabilities, any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition,results of operations and c
ash flows.Current
 and  future  economic,  capital  and  credit  market  conditions  could  adversely  affect  our  ability  to  service  our  substantial  indebtedness  andsignificant
 financial commitments or make planned expenditures.  Our ability to make payments on our substantial indebtedness and other significant financialcommitments, including the rent payments under our leases, and to fund plan
ned or committed capital expenditures and other investments depends on our ability togenerate
 cash flow, receive distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates and subsidiaries (including MGM China and the Operating Partnership), and borrowunder
 our senior credit facility or incur new indebtedness. In 2020 and 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant deterioration to the global economy,and substantial declines 
in our revenues from operations and expected distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates and subsidiaries. We expect that the recent17

emergence and global spread of COVID-19 variants may continue to impact consumer spending levels in 2022 and potentially thereafter, and if we fail to generatecash
 sufficient  to  fund  our  liquidity  needs  or  satisfy  the  financial  and  other  covenants  in  our  debt  and  lease  instruments,  we  cannot  assure  you  that  futureborrowings
 will be available to us under our senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or fund our other liquidityneeds or that we will be able 
to access the capital markets in the future to borrow additional debt on terms favorable to us, or at all.In
 addition,  we  have  a  significant  amount  of  indebtedness  maturing  in  2022,  and  thereafter.  Our  ability  to  fund  or  timely  refinance  and  replace  ourindebtedness
 will depend upon the economic and credit market conditions discussed above. If we are unable to fund or refinance our indebtedness on a timelybasis,
 we  might  be  forced  to  seek  alternate  forms  of  financing,  dispose  of  certain  assets  or  minimize  capital  expenditures  and  other  investments.  There  is  noassurance
 that any of these alternatives would be available to us, if at all, on satisfactory terms, on terms that would not be disadvantageous to us, or on terms thatwould not require us to breach th
e terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements or leases.The agreements
 governing our senior credit facility and other senior indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect ourability
 to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity, and therefore could adversely affect our results of operations.  Covenants governingour senior secured credi
t facility and certain of our debt securities restrict, among other things, our ability to:•
pay dividends or distributions, repurchase equity, prepay certain debt or make certain investments;•
incur additional debt;•
incur liens on assets;•
sell assets or consolidate with another company or sell all or substantially all of our assets;•
enter into transactions with affiliates;•
allow certain subsidiaries to transfer assets or enter into certain agreements; and•
enter into sale and lease-back transactions.Our
 ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. The breach of any such covenants or obligations not otherwisewaived or cured could result in
 a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations, which in turn could trigger cross-defaults
 under other agreements governing our long-term indebtedness. Any default under our senior credit facility or the indentures governing our other debtcould adversely affec
t our growth, our financial condition, our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt and other financial commitments.In
 addition, each of MGM China and the Operating Partnership has issued debt securities and is a borrower under credit facilities, all of which containcovenants
 that restrict the respective borrower’s ability to engage in certain transactions, require them to satisfy certain financial covenants and impose certainoperating
 and financial restrictions on them and their respective subsidiaries. These restrictions include, among other things, limitations on their ability to paydividends
 or distributions to us, incur additional debt, make investments or engage in other businesses, merge or consolidate with other companies, or transfer orsell assets.
We
 are  required  to  pay  a  significant  portion  of  our  cash  flows  as  rent,  which could  adversely  affect  our ability  to  fund  our operations  and growthinitiatives, service our indeb
tedness and limit our ability to react to competitive and economic changes.  As of December 31, 2021 we are required to make annualrent
 payments of $1.6 billion, in the aggregate, under the triple-net lease agreements, which leases are also subject to annual escalators as described elsewhere inthis
 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The leases also require us to spend a certain amount on capital expenditures at the leased properties. In addition, the leasesgoverning
 the Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas, Mandalay Bay, Aria (including Vdara) real estate assets require us to comply with certain financial covenantswhich, if
 not met, will require us to deposit cash collateral or issue letters of credit for the benefit of the applicable landlord equal to 1 year of rent under the MGMGrand
 Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay lease and the Aria lease and 2 years of rent under the Bellagio lease. As a result of the foregoing rent and capital expenditureobligations,
 our  ability  to  fund  our  operations,  raise  capital,  make  acquisitions,  make  investments,  service  our  debt  and  otherwise  respond  to  competitive  andeconomic changes may be adv
ersely affected. For example, our obligations under the leases may:•
make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to obtain additional indebtedness;•
increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business;•
require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to making rent payments, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow tofund working capital, capit
al expenditures, development projects, pay dividends, repurchase shares and other general corporate purposes;18

•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;•
restrict our ability to make acquisitions, divestitures and engage in other significant transactions; and•
cause us to lose our rights with respect to the applicable leased properties if we fail to pay rent or other amounts or otherwise default on the leases.Any of the above factors could hav
e a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Risks Related to Our Announced Transactions
The VICI Transaction, The Cosmopolitan transaction and The Mirage transaction each remain subject 
to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions,including
 the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, and any anticipated benefits from such transactions may take longer to realize than expected or may notbe
 realized at all. Each  of the VICI Transaction, The Cosmopolitan transaction and The Mirage transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, which may notbe
 satisfied within the anticipated timeframe or at all. For example, completion of the transactions remains subject to the receipt of certain regulatory approvals.There
 can be no assurance that any required regulatory approvals will be obtained, and the regulatory authorities from which approvals are required may imposeconditions
 on  the  consummation  of  the  transaction  or  require  changes  to  the  terms  of  the  transaction  or  agreements  to  be  entered  into  in  connection  with  thetransaction.
 Such conditions or changes and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could have the effect of delaying or impeding the completion of thetransactions,
 which  might  reduce  the  anticipated  benefits  to  us  of  the  transaction  or  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  ofoperations.
 The  completion  of  the  VICI  Transaction  is  also  subject  to  the  satisfaction  of  additional  closing  conditions,  including,  among  others,  (i)  receipt  ofapproval
 of VICI’s shareholders (which was obtained on October 29, 2021), (ii) the absence of any restraining order, injunction or other judgment, order or decreefrom
 any applicable governmental authority prohibiting the consummation of the transaction, (iii) the effectiveness of the registration statement for VICI’s sharesto be issued in the VICI Transaction and the authorizati
on for listing of those shares on the New York Stock Exchange, (iv) the absence of a material adverse effecton
 the parties to the master transaction agreement, (v) the accuracy of each party’s representations and warranties in the master transaction agreement, subject tocustomary
 materiality standards, and (vi) compliance of each party with its respective covenants under the master transaction agreement. No assurance can begiven
 that  these  or  any  other  required  conditions  to  closing  will  be  satisfied.  If  the  conditions  precedent  to  the  VICI  Transaction  are  not  satisfied,  the  VICITransaction
 will not be completed unless such conditions are validly waived. Such conditions may jeopardize or delay the completion of the transaction or mayreduce the anticipated benefits
 of the transaction.If any of the transact
ions are not completed, or are not completed on a timely basis, our business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of thebenefits of having comple
ted such transactions, we may be subject to additional risks, costs and expenses, including, but not limited to, the following:•
we  will  be  required  to  pay  our  costs  relating  to  such  transactions,  such  as  legal,  accounting,  financial  advisory  and  printing  fees,  whether  or  not  thetransactions are completed;
•
the diversion of time and resources committed by our management to matters relating to the transactions could otherwise have been devoted to pursuingother beneficial oppor
tunities;•
we may be subject to negative publicity or be negatively perceived by the investment or business communities as a result of the failure to consummateany or all of the transa
ctions;•
the price of our shares may decline to the extent that the current market price of our shares reflects a higher price than it otherwise would have based onthe assumption that any or a
ll of the transactions will be consummated;•
we would have incurred significant expenses relating to such transactions that we may be unable to recover, including termination fees if applicable; and•
we  may  be  subject  to  litigation  related  to  the  failure  to  consummate  the  transactions  or  to  perform  our  obligations  under  the  respective  transactionagreements.
In
 addition, we entered into the transactions as part of our current growth strategy. Even if the transactions are completed as currently anticipated, there canbe
 no assurances that any anticipated benefits from the transactions will be realized as expected or that such benefits will be achieved within the anticipated timeframe
 or at all. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transactions could adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows, cause dilution to ourearnings per share, decrea
se or delay any accretive effect of such transactions and negatively impact the price of our common stock.The potential litigation instituted against us,
 our transaction counterparties, or our respective directors challenging the proposed VICI Transaction mayprevent
 such  transaction  from  becoming  effective  within  the  expected  timeframe  or  at  all. Potential  litigation  related  to  the  VICI  Transaction  may  result  ininjunctive or other re
lief prohibiting, delaying or otherwise adversely affecting the parties’ ability to complete the VICI Transaction. One of the conditions to the19

VICI Transaction under the master transaction agreement is that no temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment, order ordecree
 issued by any governmental authority of competent jurisdiction prohibiting consummation of the VICI Transaction or any other transactions contemplatedby
 the master transaction agreement shall be in effect. Accordingly, any such injunctive or other relief may prevent the VICI Transaction from becoming effectivewithin the expected tim
eframe or at all. In addition, defending against such claims may be expensive and divert management’s attention and resources, which couldadversely affect our bus
iness and the businesses of the counterparties to such transactions.Risks Related to Our Business, Industry, and Market Conditions
The global COVID-19 pandemic has continued to materially impact
 our business, financial results and liquidity, and such impact could worsen and lastfor an
 unknown period of time. As of the date of this annual report, there continues to be uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic, its duration, and its impacton
 U.S. and global economic activity  and consumer behavior. The omicron variant of COVID-19, which appears to be the most transmissible  and contagiousvariant
 to  date,  has  caused  an  increase  in  COVID-19  cases  globally.  The  impact  of  the  omicron  variant,  or  of  any  other  variants  that  may  emerge,  cannot  bepredicted
 at this time, and could depend on numerous factors, including the availability of vaccines in different parts of the world, vaccination rates among thepopulation,
 the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against the variants, and the response by governmental bodies to reinstate mandated business closures, ordersto
 “shelter in place,” occupancy limitations, and travel and transportation restrictions. While restrictions have eased throughout 2021, new restrictions to combatthe
 spread of the variants, such as restrictions and bans on travel or transportation, stay-at-home directives, limitations on the size of gatherings, closures of workfacilities, schools, public buildings and
 businesses, cancellation of events, including sporting events, concerts, conferences and meetings, and quarantines and lock-downs
 may be put into place in the future. In addition, the spread of new variants, including omicron, has had a material impact on domestic and internationaltravel, which has resulted 
in reduced demand for hotel rooms, convention space and other casino resorts amenities.In
 Macau, while all of our properties were open during 2021, several travel and entry restrictions were in place in Macau, Hong Kong and mainland China(including
 the  temporary  suspension  of  ferry  services  between  Hong  Kong  and  Macau,  the  nucleic  acid  test  result  certificate  and  mandatory  quarantinerequirements
 for returning residents, for visitors from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and certain regions in mainland China, and bans on entry on other visitors) whichsignificantly
 impacted visitation to MGM Macau and MGM Cotai. In addition, from time to time during 2021 local COVID-19 cases were identified in Macau.Upon
 such  occurrences,  a  state  of  immediate  prevention  was declared  and mass  mandatory  nucleic  acid  testing  was imposed  in Macau,  the validity  period  ofnegative test
 results for re-entry into mainland China was shortened and quarantine requirements were imposed, certain events were cancelled or suspended, and insome
 instances certain entertainment and leisure facilities were closed throughout Macau. Although gaming and hotel operations have remained open during thesestates
 of  immediate  prevention,  such  measures  have  had  a  negative  effect  on  MGM  Grand  Paradise's  operations  and  it  is  uncertain  whether  further  closures,including the closure of MGM Grand Par
adise's properties, or travel restrictions to Macau will be implemented if additional local COVID-19 cases are identified.The
 extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and new variants continue to impact our business, results of operations, and financial results, including theduration
 and magnitude  of such effects,  will depend on numerous evolving factors  that we may not be able to accurately  predict  or assess, including, but notlimited
 to:  the  duration  and  scope  of  the  pandemic  (and  whether  there  is  a,  or  multiple,  further  resurgences  in  the  future);  the  efficacy  of  the  vaccine  againstexisting
 and new variants of the COVID-19 virus; the adoption rate of vaccines and the ability to effectively and efficiently distribute vaccines domestically andinternationally
 to allow travel to resume to pre-pandemic levels; the negative impact the pandemic has on global and regional economies and economic activity,including
 the duration and magnitude of its impact on unemployment rates and consumer discretionary spending; its short and longer-term impact on the demandfor
 travel, transient and group business, and levels of consumer confidence even after travel advisories and restrictions are lifted; our and our business partners'ability
 to successfully navigate the impacts of the pandemic; actions governments, businesses and individuals take in response to the pandemic (including the riseof
 variant strains of the virus), such as limiting or banning travel and limiting or banning leisure, casino and entertainment (including sporting events) activities,including
 the  complete  or  partial  closures  of  our  properties;  and  how  quickly  economies,  travel  activity,  and  demand  for  gaming,  entertainment  and  leisureactivities recove
rs after the pandemic subsides. We may also face unforeseen liability or be subject to additional obligations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,including
 as a result of claims alleging exposure to COVID-19 in connection with our operations or facilities or to the extent we are subject to a governmentalenforcement action
 as a result of health and safety compliance. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of exacerbating many of the otherrisks
 described in this section or in any other filings with the SEC. As a result of the foregoing, we cannot predict the ultimate scope, duration and impact theCOVID-19 pandemic
 will have on our results of operations, but it may continue to have a material impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results ofoperations (including rev
enues and profitability) and stock price.20

We  face  significant  competition  with  respect  to  destination  travel  locations  generally  and  with  respect  to  our  peers  in  the  industries  in  which  wecompete,
 including increased competition through online sports betting and iGaming, and failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect ourbusiness,
 financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  The hotel, resort, entertainment, and gaming industries are highly competitive. We do notbelieve that our competition is limited to a particular geographic area, and hotel, resort, entertainment, and gamin
g operations in other states or countries, as well asthe increased availability of online sports betting and iGaming
, could attract our customers. To the extent that new casinos enter our markets or hotel room capacityis
 expanded by others in major destination locations, competition will increase. Major competitors, including potential new entrants, may also expand their hotelroom capacity, expand
 their range of amenities, improve their level of service, or construct new resorts in Las Vegas, Macau or in the domestic regional markets inwhich we operate, all of which cou
ld attract our customers. Also, the growth of retail gaming in areas outside Las Vegas has increased the competition faced by ouroperations in Las Vegas and
 elsewhere. For instance, local referendums were recently passed to allow retail gaming in Virginia and Nebraska, with active lobbyingoccurring in additional s
tates. While we believe our principal competitors are major gaming and hospitality resorts with well-established and recognized brands, wealso
 compete against smaller hotel offerings and peer-to-peer inventory sources, which allow travelers to book short-term rentals of homes and apartments fromowners.
 We expect that we will continue to face increased competition from new channels of distribution, innovations in consumer-facing technology platformsand other transformations
 in the travel industry that could impact our ability to attract and retain customers and related business.We have
 also seen significant expansion across the United States in legalized forms of iGaming and online sports betting and expect additional jurisdictionswill
 likely legalize iGaming and online sports betting in the future. We participate in the domestic iGaming and online sports betting market through our venture,BetMGM, which faces significant 
competition from other industry participants as well as the broader gaming and entertainment industries. If BetMGM is unable tosustain
 or grow interest in its offerings it may not be able to gain the scale necessary to successfully compete in the growing market and, as a result, we may notreceive
 the anticipated benefits from our investment. In addition, the expansion of iGaming, online sports betting, and other types of gaming may further competewith our land-based operations by 
reducing customer visitation and spend at our properties.In
 addition, competition could increase if changes in gaming restrictions  in the United States and elsewhere are enacted, including the addition of newgaming
 establishments located closer to our customers than our casinos. For example, while our Macau operations compete to some extent with casinos locatedelsewhere in or near Asia,
 certain areas in the region have legalized casino gaming (including Japan) and others (such as Taiwan and Thailand) may legalize casinogaming (or iGaming) in the 
future. Furthermore, currently MGM Grand Paradise holds one of only six gaming concessions authorized by the Macau government tooperate
 casinos in Macau. If the Macau government were to allow additional competitors to operate in Macau through the grant of additional concessions or ifcurrent
 concessionaires  and  subconcessionaires  open  additional  facilities,  we  would  face  increased  competition.  Similarly,  as  a  result  of  Macau’s  GamingInspection
 and Co-ordination Bureau increasing scrutiny and restrictions imposed on gaming promoters, we along with certain other casino operators in Macau,suspended
 our primary gaming promoters, which has led to substantial declines in revenues from gaming promoters. As a result, we expect competition for themass
 market segment amongst Macau operators will grow and if we are unable to maintain and further develop our mass market business and replace revenuepreviously obtained through use of g
aming promoters, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.Most
 jurisdictions where casino gaming is currently permitted place numerical and/or geographical limitations on the issuance of new gaming licenses.Although
 a number of jurisdictions in the United States and foreign countries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming, in some cases new gamingoperations
 may be restricted to specific locations and we expect that there will be intense competition for any attractive new opportunities (which may includeacquisitions of existing prop
erties) that do arise.In
 addition to competition with other hotels, resorts and casinos, we compete with destination travel locations outside of the markets in which we operate.Our
 failure to compete successfully in our various markets and to continue to attract customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results ofoperations and cash flows.
Our business is affected
 by economic and market conditions in the jurisdictions in which we operate and in the locations in which our customers reside. Our
 business  is  particularly  sensitive  to  reductions  in  discretionary  consumer  spending  and  corporate  spending  on  conventions,  trade  shows  and  businessdevelopment.
 Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, economic contraction, economic uncertainty or the perception by our customers of weak orweakening
 economic conditions may cause a decline in demand for hotels, casino resorts, trade shows and conventions, and for the type of luxury amenities weoffer.
 In addition, changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences could be driven by factors such as the increased cost of travel, an unstablejob market, perceived o
r actual disposable consumer income and wealth, outbreaks of contagious diseases or fears of war and acts of terrorism or other21

acts of violence. Consumer preferences also evolve over time due to a variety of factors, including demographic changes, which, for instance, have resulted inrecent
 growth in consumer demand for non-gaming offerings. Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the preferences of consumers and timelyreact
 to these trends, and any failure to do so may negatively impact our results of operations. In particular, Aria, Bellagio and MGM Grand Las Vegas may beaffected
 by  economic  conditions  in  the  Far  East,  and  all  of  our  Nevada  resorts  are  affected  by  economic  conditions  in  the  United  States,  and  California  inparticular. A recession, 
economic slowdown or any other significant economic condition, including inflationary pressures, affecting consumers, corporations, or thesupply chain, generally is
 likely to cause a reduction in visitation to our resorts, which would adversely affect our operating results. In addition, due to the COVID-19
 pandemic, our business has also been impacted by labor shortages and global supply chain disruptions. If we are unable to hire and retain sufficient employeesto operate our properti
es or procure necessary supplies, our business, results of operations and reputation could be negatively impacted.In
 addition, since we expect a significant number of customers to come to MGM Macau and MGM Cotai (and, to a lesser extent, our domestic properties)from mainland
 China, general economic, regulatory, geopolitical and market conditions in China could impact our financial prospects. Any slowdown in economicgrowth
 or  changes  to  China’s  current  restrictions  on  travel  and  currency  conversion  or  movements,  including  continued  market  impacts  from  the  COVID-19outbreak
 and market impacts resulting from China’s anti-corruption campaign and related tightening of liquidity provided by non-bank lending entities and cross-border
 currency monitoring (including increased restrictions on Union Pay withdrawals and other ATM limits on the withdrawal of patacas and facial recognitiontechnology
 on  ATM  machines  in  Macau  to  strictly  enforce  the  "know  your  customer"  regulations  for  mainland  Chinese  bank  cardholders),  could  disrupt  thenumber of visitors from mainland China and/or the amounts the
y are willing to spend at our properties. It is unclear whether these and other measures will continueto be
 in effect, become more restrictive, or be readopted in the future. These developments have had, and any future policy developments that may be implementedmay have, the effect o
f reducing the number of visitors to Macau from mainland China, which could adversely impact tourism and the gaming industry in Macau.Furthermore, our operations 
in Macau may be impacted by competition for limited labor resources and our ability to retain and hire employees. We competewith
 a  large  number  of  casino  resorts  for  a  limited  number  of  employees  and  we  anticipate  that  such  competition  will  grow  in  light  of  the  opening  of  newdevelopments
 in Macau. While we seek employees from outside of Macau to adequately staff our resorts, certain Macau government policies limit our ability toimport
 labor in certain job classifications (for instance, the Macau government requires that we only hire Macau residents as dealers in our casinos) and any futuregovernment
 policies that freeze or cancel our ability to import labor could cause labor costs to increase (including limitations on our ability to import labor as aresult
 of temporary travel restrictions adopted as part of the COVID-19 mitigation efforts). Finally, because additional casino projects have commenced operationsand
 other projects are under construction, the existing transportation infrastructure may need to be expanded to accommodate increased visitation to Macau. Iftransportation
 facilities to and from Macau are inadequate to meet the demands of an increased volume of gaming customers visiting Macau, the desirability ofMacau as a gaming destina
tion, as well as the results of operations at our developments in Macau, could be negatively impacted.We
 may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our cost savings initiatives, including those associated with our MGM 2020 Plan. As  part of ourMGM
 2020 Plan, we undertook several initiatives to reduce costs and further position us for growth by the end of 2020. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19pandemic,
 we implemented several additional cost savings initiatives in 2020 to improve our operating model. However, we cannot be sure that we will be able tosuccessfully
 implement these cost savings initiatives in the time frames contemplated or at all, that we will ultimately be able to realize the expected benefits ofthese
 or any other cost savings initiatives, or that any new additional costs or increases in existing expenses will not offset any cost savings. If we fail to achievethe anticipated bene
fits of any current or future cost savings initiatives, our profitability and results of operations could be negatively impacted.Our
 ability to pay ongoing regular dividends to our stockholders is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by our holdingcompany
 structure, existing and future debt agreements entered into by us or our subsidiaries and state law requirements. During the  COVID-19 pandemic wesignificantly
 reduced our historic dividend rate. Although we intend to pay ongoing regular quarterly cash dividends on our common stock; our board of directorsmay,
 in its sole discretion, change the amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely. In addition, our ability to pay dividendsis restricted
 by certain covenants in our credit agreement, and because we are a holding company with no material direct operations, we are dependent on receivingcash
 from our operating subsidiaries to generate the funds from operations necessary to pay dividends on our common stock. Our subsidiaries ability to generatethe
 cash  flow  necessary  to  maintain  quarterly  dividend  payments  on  our  common  stock  is  subject  to  their  operating  results,  cash  requirements  and  financialcondition.
 In addition, our subsidiaries’ ability to make distributions to us is subject to any applicable provisions of state law that may limit the amount of fundsavailable to us, and compl
iance with covenants and financial ratios related to existing or future agreements governing any indebtedness at such subsidiaries and anylimitations in other 
agreements such subsidiaries may have with third parties. In addition, each of the companies in our22

corporate chain must manage its assets, liabilities and working capital in order to meet all of their respective cash obligations. As a consequence of these variouslimitations
 and  restrictions,  future  dividend  payments  may  be  further  reduced  or  eliminated  in  their  entirety.  Any  change  in  the  level  of  our  dividends  or  thesuspension of the payment ther
eof could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.All of
 our domestic gaming facilities are leased and could experience risks associated with leased property, including risks relating to lease termination,lease
 extensions, charges and our relationship with the lessor, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results ofoperations.
 All  of our domestic properties are subject to triple-net leases that, in addition to rent, require us to pay: (1) all facility maintenance, (2) all insurancerequired
 in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties, (3) taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties(other
 than taxes on the income of the lessor), (4) all capital expenditures, and (5) all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased propertiesand
 the business conducted on the leased properties. We are responsible for paying these expenses notwithstanding the fact that many of the benefits received inexchange
 for such costs shall accrue in part to the landlords as the owners of the associated facilities. Furthermore, our obligation to pay rent as well as the othercosts
 described above is absolute in virtually all circumstances, regardless of the performance of the properties and other circumstances that might abate rent inleases
 that now place these risks on the tenant, such as certain events of casualty and condemnation. Finally, our leases limit our ability to cease operations at ourproperties, subject to certai
n limited exceptions.Paul
 Salem, our Chairman, Daniel J. Taylor, one of our directors, and Corey Sanders, and John M. McManus, members of our senior management,may
 have  actual  or  potential  conflicts  of  interest  because  of  their  positions  at  MGP. Paul  Salem  serves  as  our  Chairman  and  as  the  Chairman  of  MGP.  Inaddition, Daniel J.
 Taylor, one of our directors, is also a director of MGP, and Corey Sanders and John M. McManus, members of our senior management, are alsodirectors
 of MGP. While we have procedures in place to address such situations and the organizational documents with respect to MGP contain provisions thatreduce or eliminate duties (including fiduciary duties) to any MGP shareholder to the fullest extent permitted by law, these overlap
ping positions could nonethelesscreate,
 or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our or MGP’s management and directors pursue the same corporate opportunities, such as potentialacquisition
 targets, or face decisions that could have different implications for us and MGP. Further, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection withthe
 resolution  of  any  dispute  between  us  and  MGP  (or  its  subsidiaries)  regarding  the  terms  of  the  agreements  governing  the  separation  and  the  relationship,between
 us and MGP, such as under the master lease. Potential conflicts of interest could also arise if we and MGP enter into any commercial or other adversearrangements with each o
ther in the future.Despite
 our ability to exercise control over the affairs of MGP as a result of our ownership of the single outstanding Class B share of MGP, MGP hasadopted
 a  policy  under  which  certain  transactions  with  us,  including  transactions  involving  consideration  in  excess  of  $25  million,  must  be  approved  inaccordance
 with certain specified procedures, which could affect our ability to execute our operational and strategic objectives. We own the single outstandingClass
 B share of MGP. The Class B Share is a non-economic interest in MGP which does not provide its holder any rights to profits or losses or any rights toreceive
 distributions from operations of MGP or upon liquidation or winding up of MGP, and which represents a majority of the voting power of MGP’s shares solong
 as the holder of the Class B share and its controlled affiliates’ (excluding MGP) aggregate beneficial ownership of the combined economic interests in MGPand the Operating Partnership do
es not fall below 30%. We, therefore, have the ability to exercise significant control over MGP’s affairs, including control over theoutcome of all matt
ers submitted to MGP’s shareholders for approval. MGP’s operating agreement, however, provides that whenever a potential conflict of interestexists
 or arises between us or any of our affiliates (other than MGP and its subsidiaries), on the one hand, and MGP or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand,any resolution or course of a
ction by MGP’s board of directors in respect of such conflict of interest shall be conclusively deemed to be fair and reasonable to MGPif
 it is (i) approved by a majority of a conflicts committee which consists solely of “independent” directors (which MGP refers to as “Special Approval”) (suchindependence
 determined in accordance with the NYSE’s listing standards, the standards established by the Exchange Act to serve on an audit committee of aboard
 of  directors  and  certain  additional  independence  requirements  in  our  operating  agreement),  (ii)  determined  by  MGP’s  board  of  directors  to  be  fair  andreasonable to MGP or (iii) approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting po
wer of MGP’s outstanding voting shares (excludingvoting shares owned by us and our affil
iates). Furthermore, MGP’s operating agreement provides that any transaction with a value, individually or in the aggregate,over
 $25 million between us or any of our affiliates (other than MGP and its subsidiaries), on the one hand, and MGP or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand(any
 such transaction (other than the exercise of rights by us or any of our affiliates (other than MGP and its subsidiaries) under any of the material agreementsentered
 into on the closing day of MGP’s formation transactions), a “Threshold Transaction”), shall be permitted only if (i) Special Approval is obtained or (ii)such transaction
 is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of MGP’s outstanding voting shares (excluding votingshares owned by us and our affilia
tes). As a result, certain transactions, including any Threshold Transactions that we may want to pursue with MGP and that couldhave significant benef
it to us may require Special Approval. There can be no assurance that the required approval will be23

obtained with respect to these transactions either from a conflicts committee comprised of independent MGP directors or the affirmative vote of a majority of theshares
 not held by us and our affiliates. The failure to obtain such requisite consent could materially affect our ability and the cost to execute our operational andstrategic objectives.
Because
 a significant number of our major gaming resorts are concentrated on the Las Vegas Strip, we are subject to greater risks than a gamingcompany
 that is more geographically diversified.  Given that a significant number of our major resorts are concentrated on the Las Vegas Strip, our business maybe significantly affected by risks common to the Las Vegas tourism in
dustry. For example, the cost and availability of air services and the impact of any events thatdisrupt air
 travel to and from Las Vegas can adversely affect our business. We cannot control the number or frequency of flights to or from Las Vegas, but we relyon
 air  traffic  for  a  significant  portion  of  our  visitors.  Reductions  in  flights  by  major  airlines  as  a  result  of  higher  fuel  prices  or  lower  demand,  as  a  result  oflimitations on travel imposed to address the COVI
D-19 pandemic or otherwise, can impact the number of visitors to our resorts. Additionally, there is one principalinterstate
 highway between Las Vegas and Southern California, where a large number of our customers reside. Capacity constraints of that highway or any othertraffic disruptions m
ay also affect the number of customers who visit our facilities.We extend
 credit to a large portion of our customers and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables.  We conduct a portion of our gaming activitieson
 a credit basis through the issuance of markers which are unsecured instruments. Table games players typically are issued more markers than slot players, andhigh-end
 players typically are issued more markers than patrons who tend to wager lower amounts. High-end gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming,and
 variances in win-loss results attributable to high-end gaming may have a significant positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particularquarter.
 Furthermore, the loss or a reduction in the play of the most significant of these high-end customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financialcondition,
 results  of  operations  and  cash  flows.  We  issue  markers  to  those  customers  whose  level  of  play  and  financial  resources  warrant,  in  the  opinion  ofmanagement, an extension o
f credit. Uncollectible receivables from high-end customers could have a significant impact on our results of operations.While
 gaming debts evidenced by markers and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of Nevada, and Nevada judgments ongaming
 debts are enforceable in all states under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution, other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement ofgaming debts
 is against public policy. Although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the U.S. of foreign debtors maybe reached to satisfy a 
judgment, judgments on gaming debts from United States courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations.Furthermore,
 we expect that MGM China will be able to enforce its gaming debts only in a limited number of jurisdictions, including Macau. To the extentMGM
 China gaming customers are from other jurisdictions, MGM China may not have access to a forum in which it will be able to collect all of its gamingreceivables
 because, among other reasons, courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and MGM China may encounter forums that will refuse toenforce such debts. Moreover, und
er applicable law, MGM China remains obligated to pay taxes on uncollectible winnings from customers.Even where gaming debts are enforceable,
 they may not be collectible. Our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on ouroperating results.
We may incur impairments to goodwill, inde
finite-lived intangible assets, or long-lived assets which could negatively affect our future profits.  We reviewour
 goodwill,  intangible  assets  and  long-lived  assets  on  an  annual  basis  and  during  interim  reporting  periods  in  accordance  with  the  authoritative  guidance.Significant negative
 trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates or lack of growth have resulted in write-downsand impairment
 charges in the past and, if one or more of such events occurs in the future, additional impairment charges or write-downs may be required in futureperiods.
 If  we  are  required  to  record  additional  impairment  charges  or  write-downs,  this  could  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on  our  consolidated  results  ofoperations.
Leisure
 and business travel,  especially travel by air,  are particularly susceptible to global geopolitical events,  such as terrorist attacks, other acts ofviolence or acts of war or hostility or 
the outbreak of infectious diseases. We are dependent on the willingness of our customers to travel by air. Since most of ourcustomers travel
 by air to our Las Vegas and Macau properties, any terrorist act or other acts of violence, outbreak of hostilities, escalation of war, or any actual orperceived
 threat to the security of travel by air, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the outbreak ofinfectious
 diseases, such as COVID-19, has severely disrupted, and is expected to continue to disrupt, domestic and international travel. The COVID-19 pandemichas
 resulted in governments, public institutions and other organizations imposing or recommending, and businesses and individuals implementing, restrictions onvarious
 activities or other actions to combat its spread, such as restrictions and bans on travel or transportation, stay-at-home directives, limitations on the size ofgatherings, closures of work fa
cilities, schools, public buildings and businesses,24

cancellation of events, including sporting events, concerts, conferences and meetings, and quarantines and lock-downs. Even  when those restrictions are removed,consumer willingness to attend large scale
 conferences may be impacted for the foreseeable future due to continued concerns over safety and social distancing. See“—The
 global COVID-19 pandemic has continued to materially impact our business, financial results and liquidity, and such impact could worsen and last for anunknown period of time.”
Furthermore, although we have been
 able to purchase some insurance coverage for certain types of terrorist acts, insurance coverage against physical loss orbusiness interruption resul
ting from war and some forms of terrorism continues to be unavailable.Co-investing
 in  properties  or  businesses,  including  our  investment  in  BetMGM,  decreases  our  ability  to  manage  risk. In  addition  to  acquiring  ordeveloping
 hotels and resorts or acquiring companies that complement our business directly, we have from time to time invested, and expect to continue to invest,in
 properties or businesses as a co-investor. Co-investors often have shared control over the operation of the property or business. Therefore, the operation of suchproperties
 or businesses is subject to inherent risk due to the shared nature of the enterprise and the need to reach agreements on material matters. In addition,investments with other inves
tors may involve risks such as the possibility that the co-investor might become bankrupt or not have the financial resources to meet itsobligations,
 or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, or be in a position to take action contrary toour
 instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives. Consequently, actions by a co-investor might subject the properties or businesses owned bysuch entities
 to additional risk. Further, we may be unable to take action without the approval of our co-investors, or our co-investors could take actions binding onthe property without our consent. Addi
tionally, should a co-investor become bankrupt, we could become liable for its share of liabilities.For
 example, we share control of BetMGM with Entain with all major operating, investing and financial activities requiring the consent of both members.Disagreements
 between us and Entain could arise in the future, including with respect to the amount and timing of capital contributions. If we and Entain areunable
 to support the future funding of BetMGM, then BetMGM may not have the resources to execute on the development or implementation of its strategies,including
 funding efforts to increase its market share, which could result in us not receiving the anticipated benefits from our investment. In addition, if we areawarded
 a concession to develop an integrated casino resort in Japan, we would do so in a consortium with ORIX and other local investors. As a result, we couldbe
 subject to additional risks related to being unable to directly control development activities or the timing of development completion, which may impact ourability to complete 
the project on our anticipated timeline, or at all, or within the agreed upon specifications.Any of
 our future construction, development or expansion projects will be subject to significant development and construction risks, which could have amaterial adverse impact on re
lated project timetables, costs and our ability to complete the projects. Although
 our business model is primarily asset-light, we intend to continue to evaluate opportunities for future construction, development or expansionprojects.
 Any of our future construction, development or expansion projects, such as our proposed integrated resort in Japan, will be subject to a number of risks,including:
•
lack of sufficient, or delays in the availability of, financing;•
changes to plans and specifications;•
engineering problems, including defective plans and specifications;•
shortages of, and price increases in, energy, materials and skilled and unskilled labor;•
pricing inflation, including wage inflation, in key supply markets;•
delays in obtaining or inability to obtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals;•
changes in laws and regulations, or in the interpretation and enforcement of laws and regulations, applicable to gaming, leisure, residential, real estatedevelopment or construct
ion projects;•
labor disputes or work stoppages;•
availability of qualified contractors and subcontractors;•
disputes with and defaults by contractors and subcontractors;•
personal injuries to workers and other persons;•
environmental, health and safety issues, including site accidents and the spread of viruses;•
weather interferences or delays;•
fires, typhoons and other natural disasters;•
geological, construction, excavation, regulatory and equipment problems; and•
other unanticipated circumstances or cost increases.The occurrence
 of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs, delay or prevent the construction, development, expansionor opening or otherwise affe
ct the design and features of any future projects25

which we might undertake. In addition, the regulatory approvals associated with our development projects may require us to open future casino resorts by a certainspecified
 time and to the extent we are unable to meet those deadlines, and any such deadlines are not extended, we may lose our regulatory approval to open acasino
 resort in a proposed jurisdiction, or incur payment penalties in connection with any delays which could have an adverse effect on our business, financialcondition, results of opera
tions and cash flows.We
 also make significant capital expenditures to maintain and upgrade our resorts, which may disrupt operations and displace revenue at the properties,including revenue lost while 
rooms, restaurants and meeting spaces are under renovation and out of service.Our
 insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer. In addition, our insurance costs may increaseand we
 may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future.  Although we have “all risk” property insurance coverage for our operating properties,which
 covers  damage  caused  by  a  casualty  loss  (such  as  fire,  natural  disasters,  or  terrorism  or  other  acts  of  violence),  each  policy  has  certain  exclusions.  Inaddition, our property insurance coverage is in an amount that may be significa
ntly less than the expected replacement cost of rebuilding the facilities if there was atotal loss.
 Our level of insurance coverage also may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty. In addition, certain casualty events, such aslabor
 strikes, nuclear events, acts of war, loss of income due to cancellation of room reservations or conventions due to fear of terrorism or other acts of violence,loss
 of electrical power due to catastrophic events, rolling blackouts or otherwise, deterioration or corrosion, insect or animal damage, and pollution, may not becovered at all under our po
licies. Therefore, certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses.In addition to
 the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss, we may suffer business disruption as a result of these events or be subject to claims bythird
 parties that may be injured or harmed. While we carry business interruption insurance and general liability insurance, this insurance may not be adequate tocover
 all  losses  in  any  such  event.  Furthermore,  the  leases  we  entered  into  in  connection  with  the  MGP  BREIT  Venture  Transaction  and  the  Bellagio  sale-leaseback
 transaction require us to maintain specified insurance coverage. We cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to obtain the types and limits ofinsurance
 coverage required by these leases and, to the extent such required insurance coverage cannot be obtained at commercially reasonable cost or at all, thenwe
 would need to obtain amendments to the leases or face a default by the applicable tenant under the lease, which could have material adverse effect on ourbusiness.
We renew
 our insurance policies on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits, furtherincrease our deductibles 
or self-insured retentions, or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.Any failure to protect our trademarks could have a negat
ive impact on the value of our brand names and adversely affect our business.  The developmentof
 intellectual  property  is  part  of  our  overall  business  strategy,  and  we  regard  our  intellectual  property  to  be  an  important  element  of  our  success.  While  ourbusiness
 as a whole is not substantially dependent on any one trademark or combination of several of our trademarks or other intellectual property, we seek toestablish
 and maintain  our proprietary  rights  in our business operations  through the use of trademarks.  We file applications  for, and obtain trademarks  in, theUnited
 States and in foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, parties mayinfringe
 our trademarks and our rights may be invalidated or unenforceable. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great anextent
 as  the  laws  of  the  United  States.  Monitoring  the  unauthorized  use  of  our  intellectual  property  is  difficult.  Litigation  may  be  necessary  to  enforce  ourintellectual
 property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs anddiversion of resource. We 
cannot assure you that all of the steps we have taken to protect our trademarks in the United States and foreign countries will be adequateto
 prevent imitation of our trademarks by others. The unauthorized use or reproduction of our trademarks could diminish the value of our brand and its marketacceptance, compet
itive advantages or goodwill, which could adversely affect our business.    
A
 significant portion of our labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements. Work  stoppages and other labor problems could negatively affectour
 business and results of operations. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 35,000 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Aprolonged dispute with the covered employees or any labor unrest
, strikes or other business interruptions in connection with labor negotiations or others could havean
 adverse impact on our operations, and adverse publicity in the marketplace related to union messaging could further harm our reputation and reduce customerdemand for our services. Also, wage and/or benefit increa
ses resulting from new labor agreements may be significant and could also have an adverse impact on ourresults
 of  operations.  To  the  extent  that  our  non-union  employees  seek  union  representation  or  elect  union  representation,  we  would  have  exposure  to  risksassociated
 with  representation  proceedings,  labor  negotiations  and/or  economic  impacts  of  newly  negotiated  labor  agreements.  Furthermore,  we  may  have,  oracquire in the future, multi-em
ployer plans that are classified as “endangered,”26

“seriously endangered,” or “critical” status. For instance, Borgata’s most significant plan is the Legacy Plan of the UNITE HERE Retirement Fund, which has beenlisted
 in “critical status” and is subject to a rehabilitation plan. Plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status through a fundingimprovement
 or rehabilitation plan, which may require additional contributions from employers (which may take the form of a surcharge on benefit contributions)and/or
 modifications to retiree benefits. In addition, while Borgata has no current intention to withdraw from these plans, a withdrawal in the future could result inthe incurrence of a contingent liability that would be payable in
 an amount and at such time (or over a period of time) that would vary based on a number of factorsat the time of (and a
fter) withdrawal. Any such additional costs may be significant.Our business is particularly sensitive to energy pr
ices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results.  We are a large consumer of electricityand
 other energy and, therefore, higher energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Accordingly, increases in energy costs may have anegative impact on our operating results. Additionall
y, higher electricity and gasoline prices that affect our customers may result in reduced visitation to our resortsand a reduction in our revenu
es.We
 may seek to expand through investments in other businesses and properties or through alliances or acquisitions, and we may also seek to divestsome
 of our properties and other assets, any of which may be unsuccessful. We intend to consider strategic and complementary acquisitions and investments inother
 businesses, properties or other assets. Furthermore, we may pursue any of these opportunities in alliance with third parties, including MGP. Acquisitions andinvestments in businesses, prope
rties or assets, as well as these alliances, are subject to risks that could affect our business, including risks related to:•
spending cash and incurring debt;•
assuming contingent liabilities;•
unanticipated issues in integrating information, communications and other systems;•
unanticipated incompatibility of purchasing, logistics, marketing and administration methods;•
retaining key employees; and•
consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures.We
 cannot assure you that we will be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, even ifwe
 are able to identify any such opportunities and complete transactions, we cannot assure you that we will realize the anticipated synergies and benefits of ouracquisitions or
 that they will be accretive to our results of operations. Our estimates and assumptions regarding expected synergies and benefits of our acquisitionscould materially change, including as a
 result of factors beyond our control, and could delay, decrease or eliminate the expected accretive effect of the acquisitions.In
 addition, even if we are able to successfully integrate new assets and businesses, the integration of such assets and businesses may result in unanticipated costs,competitive
 responses, loss of customer or other business relationships and the diversion of management attention, and the expansion of our operations in general,whether through acquisition, dev
elopment or internal growth, could also cause us to incur substantial costs, including legal, professional and consulting fees.In
 addition,  we  periodically  review  our  business  to  identify  properties  or  other  assets  that  we  believe  either  are  non-core,  no  longer  complement  ourbusiness,
 are in markets which may not benefit us as much as other markets or could be sold at significant premiums. From time to time, we may attempt to sellthese identified prope
rties and assets. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to complete dispositions on commercially reasonable terms or at all.The
 failure to maintain the integrity of our computer systems and customer information could result in damage to our reputation and/or subject us tofines,
 payment of damages, lawsuits and restrictions on our use of data. We collect and process information relating to our employees, guests, and others forvarious
 business purposes, including marketing and promotional purposes. The collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulationsenacted
 by the various states, the United States and other jurisdictions around the world. Privacy laws and regulations continue to evolve and on occasion may beinconsistent
 (or conflict) between jurisdictions. Various federal, state and foreign legislative or regulatory bodies may enact or adopt new or additional laws andregulations concerning privacy,
 data retention, data transfer, and data protection. For example, the European Union has adopted a data protection regulation knownas
 the General Data Protection Regulation, which became fully enforceable in May 2018, that includes operational and compliance requirements with significantpenalties for
 non-compliance. California has enacted a comprehensive privacy law, known as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which went into effecton
 January 1, 2020 and provides some of the strongest privacy requirements in the United States. In addition, new privacy requirements in California, Colorado,and Virginia generally go in
to effect on January 1, 2023.Compliance
 with  applicable  privacy  laws  and  regulations  may  increase  our  operating  costs  and/or  adversely  impact  our  ability  to  market  our  products,properties and services 
to our guests. In addition, non-compliance with applicable27

privacy laws and regulations by us (or in some circumstances non-compliance by third parties engaged by us), including accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure,unapproved
 dissemination  or  a  breach  of  security  on  systems  storing  our  data  may  result  in  damage  to  our  reputation  and/or  subject  us  to  fines,  payment  ofdamages,
 lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data. We rely on proprietary and commercially available systems, software, and tools to provide securityfor
 processing of customer and employee information, such as payment card and other confidential or proprietary information. Our data security measures arereviewed
 and  evaluated  regularly;  however,  they  might  not  protect  us  against  increasingly  sophisticated  and  aggressive  threats  including,  but  not  limited  to,computer
 malware, viruses, hacking and phishing attacks by third parties. In addition, while we maintain cyber risk insurance to assist in the cost of recovery froma significant cyber ev
ent, such coverage may not be sufficient. We
 also rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, maintain information and manage our businesses. Disruptions in the availability ofour
 computer  systems,  through  cyber-attacks  or  otherwise,  could  impact  our  ability  to  service  our  customers  and  adversely  affect  our  sales  and  the  results  ofoperations.
 For  instance,  there  has  been  an  increase  in  criminal  cyber  security  attacks  against  companies  where  customer  and  company  information  has  beencompromised
 and company data has been destroyed. Our information systems and data, including those we maintain with our third-party service providers, havebeen
 subject to cyber security breaches in the past and may be subject to cyber security breaches in the future. In addition, our third-party information systemservice
 providers  face  risks  relating  to  cyber  security  similar  to  ours,  and  we  do  not  directly  control  any  of  such  parties’  information  security  operations.  Asignificant
 theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer or company data maintained by us or by a third-party service provider could have an adverse effect on ourreputation,
 cause a material disruption to our operations, and result in remediation expenses, regulatory penalties and litigation by customers and other partieswhose information was subject to su
ch attacks, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.We
 are  subject  to  risks  related  to  corporate  social  responsibility  and  reputation. Many  factors  influence  our  reputation  and  the  value  of  our  brandsincluding
 the  perception  held  by  our  customers,  business  partners,  other  key  stakeholders  and  the  communities  in  which  we  do  business.  Our  business  facesincreasing
 scrutiny  related  to  environmental,  social  and  governance  factors  and  risk  of  damage  to  our  reputation  and  the  value  of  our  brands  if  we  fail  to  actresponsibly
 in several areas including diversity and inclusion, community engagement and philanthropy, environmental sustainability, plastic pollution, climatechange,
 responsible gaming, supply chain management, workplace conduct, human rights, and many others, some of which may be unforeseen. Any harm to ourreputation
 could further impact employee engagement and retention and the willingness of customers and our partners to do business with us, which could have amaterial adverse 
effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.We
 are subject to risks and costs related to climate change. Extreme  weather conditions, potentially exacerbated by climate change, may cause propertydamage or interrupt business, which could harm our
 business and results of operations. Certain of our properties are located in areas that may be subject to extremeweather
 conditions, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, floods, tornados, wildfires, and winter storms in the United States and severe typhoons in Macau.Such
 extreme weather conditions may interrupt our operations or the operations of critical suppliers, damage our properties, and reduce the number of customerswho
 visit our facilities in such areas. In addition, our operations or the operations of critical suppliers could be adversely impacted by a drought or other cause ofwater
 stress or shortage. A severe drought of extensive duration experienced in Las Vegas or in the other regions in which we operate or source critical suppliescould adversely affect our business. Although we maintain both pr
operty and business interruption insurance coverage for certain extreme weather conditions, suchcoverage is
 subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits, including limitation on the coverage period for business interruption, and we cannot assure youthat we will be able to ful
ly insure such losses or fully collect, if at all, on claims resulting from such extreme weather conditions.Furthermore,
 such extreme weather conditions may result in reduced availability or increased price volatility of certain critical supplies, may interrupt orimpede
 access  to  our  affected  properties,  and  may  cause  visits  to  our  affected  properties  to  decrease  for  an  indefinite  period.  Additionally,  many  states  andmunicipalities
 have  begun  to  adopt  laws  and  policies  on  climate  change  and  emission  reduction  targets.  Changes  in  federal,  state,  and  local  legislation  andregulation
 based on concerns about climate change could result in increased regulatory costs, which may include capital expenditures on our existing properties toensure
 compliance  with  any  new  or  updated  regulations,  which  may  potentially  adversely  affect  our  operations.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  the  potentialimpacts of climat
e change and severe weather will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations or business.28

Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters and Changes in Public PolicyOur
 businesses  are  subject  to  extensive  regulation  and  the  cost  of  compliance  or  failure  to  comply  with  such  regulations  may  adversely  affect  ourbusiness
 and results of operations. Our ownership and operation of gaming facilities is subject to extensive regulation by the countries, states and provinces inwhich
 we operate. These laws, regulations and ordinances vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally concern the responsibility, financial stability andcharacter
 of  the  owners  and  managers  of  gaming  operations  as  well  as  persons  financially  interested  or  involved  in  gaming  operations.  As  such,  our  gamingregulators
 can require us to disassociate ourselves from suppliers or business partners found unsuitable by the regulators or, alternatively, cease operations in thatjurisdiction.
 In addition, unsuitable activity on our part or on the part of our domestic or foreign unconsolidated affiliates or subsidiaries in any jurisdiction couldhave a
 negative effect on our ability to continue operating in other jurisdictions. The regulatory environment in any particular jurisdiction may change in the futureand
 any such change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Furthermore, our iGaming and online sports betting initiatives may beparticularly
 subject to risks related to potential changes in the regulatory environment as a result of the continued development of regulations in this industry. Forexample,
 in 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) reversed its previously-issued opinion published in 2011, which stated that interstate transmissions ofwire
 communications that do not relate to a “sporting event or contest” fall outside the purview of the Wire Act of 1961 (“Wire Act”). The DOJ’s updated opinionconcluded
 instead that the Wire Act was not uniformly limited to gaming relating to sporting events or contests and that certain of its provisions apply to non-sports-related wagering 
activity. In June 2019, a federal district court in New Hampshire ruled that the DOJ’s new interpretation of the Wire Act was erroneous andvacated
 DOJ’s new opinion. The DOJ appealed the decision of the district court to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. In January 2021, the Court ofAppeals
 essentially affirmed the decision of the district court, and the DOJ did not file a further appeal. For a summary of gaming and other regulations that affectour business, see “Regulation and Li
censing” and Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Further,
 our  directors,  officers,  key  employees  and  investors  in  our  properties  must  meet  approval  standards  of  certain  state  and  foreign  regulatoryauthorities.
 If state regulatory authorities were to find such a person or investor unsuitable, we would be required to sever our relationship with that person or theinvestor
 may be required to dispose of his, her or its interest in the property. State regulatory agencies may conduct investigations into the conduct or associationsof our directors, officers, key employees or investors to ensure compliance with applicable standard
s. Certain public and private issuances of securities, borrowingsunder credit agreements, g
uarantees of indebtedness and other transactions also require the approval of certain regulatory authorities.Macau
 laws and regulations concerning gaming and gaming concessions are complex, and a court or administrative or regulatory body may in the futurerender
 an interpretation of these laws and regulations, or issue new or modified regulations, that differ from MGM China’s interpretation, which could have amaterial
 adverse  effect  on  its  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.  In  addition,  MGM  Grand  Paradise's  activities  in  Macau  are  subject  toadministrative
 review  and  approval  by  various  government  agencies.  We  cannot  assure  you  that  MGM  Grand  Paradise  will  be  able  to  obtain  all  necessaryapprovals,
 and any such failure to do so may materially affect its long-term business strategy and operations. Macau laws permit redress to the courts with respectto administrative a
ctions; however, to date such redress is largely untested in relation to gaming issues.In
 addition to gaming regulations, we are also subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general. Theselaws
 and  regulations  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  restrictions  and  conditions  concerning  alcoholic  beverages,  environmental  matters,  smoking,  employees,currency
 transactions,  taxation,  zoning  and  building  codes,  and  marketing  and  advertising.  For  instance,  we  are  subject  to  certain  federal,  state  and  localenvironmental
 laws, regulations and ordinances, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation Recovery Act, the ComprehensiveEnvironmental
 Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Energy Policy Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, Renewable Portfolio Standards, the Oil PollutionAct
 of 1990, and many others. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may be held liablefor the
 costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property, regardless of whether or not the present owner oroperator
 knows of, or is responsible for, the presence of such substances or wastes. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently inthe
 future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. In addition, effective January 1, 2019, smoking in casinos in Macau, including MGM Macau and MGMCotai, is only permitted inside
 specially ventilated smoking rooms, rather than outside smoking areas or VIP areas. The likelihood or outcome of similar legislationin
 other  jurisdictions  and  referendums  in  the  future  cannot  be  predicted,  though  any  smoking  ban  would  be  expected  to  negatively  impact  our  financialperformance.
We
 also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to recordkeeping and reporting obligations as required by various anti-money laundering
 laws and regulations. For instance, we are subject to regulation under the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970, commonlyknown
 as the “Bank Secrecy Act”, which, among other things, requires us to report to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) any currency transactions in excess of$10,000 that occur within a 24-hour ga
ming day, including identification of the individual(s) involved in the currency29

transaction. We are also required to report certain suspicious activity where we know, suspect or have reason to suspect transactions, among other things, involvefunds from illegal activity or are intended to evade federal regulations or avoid reporting requirements or ha
ve no business or lawful purpose. In addition, under theBank
 Secrecy Act we are subject to various other rules and regulations involving reporting, recordkeeping and retention. Our compliance with the Bank SecrecyAct
 is subject to periodic examinations by the IRS. Any such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws andregulations could be enac
ted. Any violations of the anti-money laundering laws, including the Bank Secrecy Act, or regulations by any of our properties could havean adverse effect on our 
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Furthermore,
 the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in governments, public institutions and other organizations imposing or recommending restrictions onvarious
 activities or other actions to combat its spread. See “—The global COVID-19 pandemic has continued to materially impact our business, financial resultsand liquidity,
 and such impact could worsen and last for an unknown period of time.” In addition to the pandemic-related restrictions that resulted in the temporaryclosures
 of  our  properties  during  2020,  governmental  or  other  COVID-19-related  restrictions  have  been  extended  or  reimposed  from  time-to-time  and  newrestrictions may be i
mposed in the future.Any
 violation  of  the  Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  or  any  other  similar  anti-corruption  laws  could  have  a  negative  impact  on  us. Historically,  asignificant
 portion of our revenue was derived from operations outside the United States, which exposes us to complex foreign and U.S. regulations inherent indoing
 cross-border business and in each of the countries in which we transact business. We are subject to compliance with the United States Foreign CorruptPractices
 Act (“FCPA”) and other similar anti-corruption laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments toforeign government officials
 for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws, we cannotbe
 sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws, despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporateethics.
 Violations of these laws by us or our non-controlled ventures may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties against us, and theSEC
 and U.S. Department of Justice continue to vigorously pursue enforcement of the FCPA. The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adverselyaffect our business, perfo
rmance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.If the jurisdictions in which we operate increase gaming taxes and fees,
 as well as other taxes and fees, our results could be adversely affected.  State andlocal
 authorities raise a significant amount of revenue through taxes and fees, including taxes and fees on gaming activities. From time to time, legislators andgovernment
 officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. Periods of economic downturn oruncertainty
 and budget deficits may intensify such efforts to raise revenues through increases in gaming or other taxes, the imposition of new taxes or changes totax
 laws that result in increased taxes to us. If the jurisdictions in which we operate were to increase taxes, impose new taxes or change existing tax laws, ourfinancial condition and re
sults of operations could be materially adversely affected.The
 future recognition of our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is uncertain, and the amount of valuation allowance we may apply against suchdeferred
 tax asset may change materially in future periods. We currently have significant deferred tax assets resulting from foreign tax credit carryforwards thatare
 available to reduce taxes attributable to potential taxable foreign-sourced income in future periods, including the recapture of overall domestic losses to theextent of 50 percent of U.S. taxab
le income per year. We evaluate our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset for recoverability and record a valuation allowance to theextent
 that we determine it is not more likely than not such asset will be recovered. This evaluation is based on all available evidence, including assumptionsconcerning
 future U.S. operating profits and foreign source income. As a result, significant judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a valuationallowance
 and changes to our assumptions could result in a material change in the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact on the provision for incometaxes in the period includ
ing such change.We
 face risks related to pending claims that have been,  or future claims that may be,  brought against us. Claims have been brought against us and oursubsidiaries in various legal proceedings
, and additional legal and tax claims arise from time to time. We may not be successful in the defense or prosecution of ourcurrent
 or  future  legal  proceedings,  which  could  result  in  settlements  or  damages  that  could  significantly  impact  our  business,  financial  condition,  results  ofoperations and reputation. Pl
ease see the further discussion in “Legal Proceedings” and Note 12 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.Risks Related to Our Macau Operations
We
 have agreed not to have any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in China, Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan, other than through MGMChina
.  As a result of the extension of the Macau gaming subconcession, we entered into a First Renewed Deed of Non-Compete Undertakings with MGM Chinaand Ms. Ho, Pansy Catilina Chiu King (“Ms.
30

Ho”), pursuant to which we are restricted from having any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in the People’s Republic of China, Macau, Hong Kong andTaiwan,
 other than through MGM China. While gaming is currently prohibited in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, if it is legalized in the future our ability tocompete
 in these locations could be limited until the earliest of (i) the date MGM China’s ordinary shares cease to be listed on The Stock Exchange of Hong KongLimited
 or (ii) the last day of MGM Grand Paradise's subconcession for operation of casino games (or any extension thereof); or (iii) the date when our ownershipof MGM China shares is less than 20% of th
e then-issued share capital of MGM China.The
 Macau  government  can  terminate  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  subconcession  under  certain  circumstances  without  compensating  MGM  GrandParadise
,  exercise its redemption right with respect to the subconcession, or refuse to grant MGM Grand Paradise an extension of the subconcession in 2022, or
 MGM Grand Paradise may be unsuccessful in obtaining a gaming concession when a new public tender is held by the Macau government, any of whichwould
 have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows.  The  Macau  government  has  the  right  tounilaterally
 terminate  the  subconcession  in  the  event  of  fundamental  non-compliance  by  MGM  Grand  Paradise  with  applicable  Macau  laws  or  MGM  GrandParadise’s basic
 obligations under the subconcession contract. MGM Grand Paradise has the opportunity to remedy any such non-compliance with its fundamentalobligations
 under the subconcession contract within a period to be stipulated by the Macau government. Upon such termination, all of MGM Grand Paradise’scasino
 area premises and gaming-related equipment would be transferred automatically to the Macau government without compensation to MGM Grand Paradise,and
 we would cease to generate any revenues from these operations. We cannot assure you that MGM Grand Paradise will perform all of its obligations under thesubconcession contract in a way 
that satisfies the requirements of the Macau government.Furthermore,
 under the subconcession contract, MGM Grand Paradise is obligated to comply with any laws and regulations that the Macau governmentmight
 promulgate in the future. We cannot assure you that MGM Grand Paradise will be able to comply with these laws and regulations or that these laws andregulations
 would not adversely affect our ability to construct or operate our Macau businesses. If any disagreement arises between MGM Grand Paradise and theMacau
 government regarding the interpretation of, or MGM Grand Paradise’s compliance with, a provision of the subconcession contract, MGM Grand Paradisewill
 be  relying  on  a  consultation  and  negotiation  process  with  the  Macau  government.  During  any  consultation  or  negotiation,  MGM  Grand  Paradise  will  beobligated
 to comply with the terms of the subconcession contract as interpreted by the Macau government. Currently, there is no precedent concerning how theMacau
 government will treat the termination of a concession or subconcession upon the occurrence of any of the circumstances mentioned above. The loss of thesubconcession would require
 us to cease conducting gaming operations in Macau, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,results of operations and c
ash flows.In
 addition, the subconcession contract expires on June 26, 2022. Pursuant to the current Macau gaming law, upon reaching the maximum duration of 20years,
 the term of the concessions may be extended one or more times by order of the Chief Executive, which period may not exceed, in total, 5 years. On January14, 2022,
 the Macau Government disclosed the content of a bill to amend Macau gaming law, which followed a 45-day public consultation process regarding draftamendment proposals
 that were issued in September 2021. Under the bill, the existing subconcessions will be discontinued and a maximum of six concessions willbe
 awarded  for  a  term  to  be  specified  in  the  concession  contract  that  may  not  exceed  10  years  and  which  may  be  extended  by  three  years,  under  certaincircumstances.
 The bill is subject to debate and approval by the Macau Legislative Assembly. The approval of the new gaming law bill will precede the publictender
 for the awarding of new gaming concessions and to date the Macau Government has provided no indication as to whether the public tender will take placebefore
 expiry of the existing gaming concessions and subconcessions, which is on June 26, 2022, but acknowledged that it could consider the extension of theexisting concessions and
 subconcessions beyond their current term if the public tender is held at a later date. Unless MGM Grand Paradise's gaming subconcessionis extended,
 or legislation with regard to reversion of casino premises is amended, the casino area premises and gaming-related equipment subject to reversion willautomatically
 be  transferred  to  the  Macau  Government  upon  expiration,  and  MGM  Grand  Paradise  will  cease  to  generate  any  revenues  from  such  gamingoperations.
 In addition, certain events relating to the loss, termination, rescission, revocation or modification of MGM Grand Paradise’s gaming subconcession inMacau, where
 such events have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business, properties, or results of operations of MGM China, taken as a whole,may
 result  in  a  special  put  option  triggering  event  under  MGM  China’s  senior  notes  and  an  event  of  default  under  MGM  China’s  revolving  credit  facilities.Beginning
 on April 20, 2017, the Macau government may redeem the subconcession contract by providing us at least 1 year prior notice. In the event the Macaugovernment
 exercises this redemption right, MGM Grand Paradise is entitled to fair compensation or indemnity. The amount of such compensation or indemnitywill
 be  determined  based  on  the  amount  of  gaming  and  non-gaming  revenue  generated  by  MGM  Grand  Paradise,  excluding  the  convention  and  exhibitionfacilities,
 during the taxable year prior to the redemption, before deducting interest, depreciation and amortization, multiplied by the number of remaining yearsbefore
 expiration of the subconcession. We cannot assure you that MGM Grand Paradise will be able to obtain an extension of the subconcession contract or beawarded a new gaming concession on t
erms favorable to MGM Grand Paradise or at all. In31

addition, there is uncertainty on the terms associated with any extension, which could include additional fees or other financial commitments that may have anadverse
 impact on the financial position of MGM Grand Paradise. We also cannot assure you that if the subconcession is redeemed, the compensation paid toMGM Grand Paradise will be adequate 
to compensate for the loss of future revenues.We are
 subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.  Our operations outside of the United States are subject to risks that areinherent in conducting
 business under non-United States laws, regulations and customs. In particular, the risks associated with the operation of MGM China or anyfuture operations in which we m
ay engage in any other foreign territories, include:•
changes in laws and policies that govern operations of companies in Macau or other foreign jurisdictions;•
changes in non-United States government programs;•
possible failure by our employees or agents to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisd
ictions;•
general economic conditions and policies in China, including restrictions on travel and currency movements;•
difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing non-United States operations;•
different labor regulations;•
changes in environmental, health and safety laws;•
outbreaks of diseases or epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic;•
potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;•
political instability and actual or anticipated military and political conflicts;•
economic instability and inflation, recession or interest rate fluctuations; and•
uncertainties regarding judicial systems and procedures.These
 risks, individually or in the aggregate, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We arealso
 exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If the United States dollar strengthens in relation tothe
 currencies of other countries, our United States dollar reported income from sources where revenue is denominated in the currencies of other such countrieswill decrease.
Conflicts
 of interest may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also directors of MGM China,  the holding company for MGM GrandParadise
 which owns and operates MGM Macau and MGM Cotai. As a result of the initial public offering of shares of MGM China common stock in 2011,MGM
 China has stockholders who are not affiliated with us, and we and certain of our officers and directors who also serve as officers and/or directors of MGMChina
 may  have  conflicting  fiduciary  obligations  to  our  stockholders  and  to  the  minority  stockholders  of  MGM  China.  Decisions  that  could  have  differentimplications for
 us and MGM China, including contractual arrangements that we have entered into or may in the future enter into with MGM China, may give riseto the appearance of a p
otential conflict of interest or an actual conflict of interest.ITEM 1B.    UNRESOLVED

Common Stock Information
Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Ex

ly 3,294 record holders of our common stock as of February 23, 2022.Dividend Policy
The
 Company implemented a dividend program in February 2017 pursuant to which it has paid regular quarterly dividends. In the second quarter of 2020the
 Company reduced its annual dividend to $0.01 per share in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its operations at that time. The Company hasmaintained

ITEM 6.    RESERVEDITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION A
ND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThis
 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes discussion as of and for the year ended December 31,2021 compared to December 31, 2020. Discussion of our financial
 condition and results of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared toDecember
 31,  2019  can  be  found  in  our  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K for  the  fiscal  year  ended  December  31,  2020,  filed  with  the  Securities  and  ExchangeCommission (“SEC”) on February 26, 2021.
Description of our business and key performance indicators
Our
 primary business is the operation of casino resorts, which offer gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment, retail and other resort amenities. Weoperate
 several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage. Most of our revenue iscash-based,
 through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. We rely on the ability of our resorts to generateoperating
 cash flow to fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development, repay debt financings, and return capital to our shareholders.We
 make  significant  investments  in our resorts through newly remodeled  hotel rooms, restaurants,  entertainment  and nightlife  offerings,  as well as other newfeatures and amenities.
Our results
 of operations are affected by decisions we make related to our capital allocation, our access to capital and our cost of capital. While we continueto be focused on improving our fin
ancial position and returning capital to shareholders, we are also dedicated to capitalizing on strategic development or initiatives.Our results of operations do not tend to be seaso
nal in nature, though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period, including the timing ofmajor
 conventions, Far East baccarat volumes, the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our high-end gaming customers, and the level of playduring
 major  holidays,  including  New  Year  and  Lunar  New  Year.  While  our  results  do  not  depend  on  key  individual  customers,  a  significant  portion  of  ouroperating
 income  is  generated  from  high-end  gaming  customers,  which  can  cause  variability  in  our  results.  In  addition,  our  success  in  marketing  to  customergroups
 such  as  convention  customers  and  the  financial  health  of  customer  segments  such  as  business  travelers  or  high-end  gaming  customers  from  a  specificcountry or region can aff
ect our results.Financial Impact of COVID-19
The
 spread of COVID-19 and developments surrounding the global pandemic have had a significant impact on our business, financial condition, results ofoperations
 and cash flows in 2020 and 2021 and may continue to impact our business in 2022 and thereafter. In March 2020, all of our domestic properties weretemporarily
 closed pursuant to state and local government restrictions imposed as a result of COVID-19. Throughout the second and third quarters of 2020, all ofour
 properties that were temporarily closed re-opened to the public, with temporary re-closures and re-openings occurring for certain of our properties or portionsthereof
 into the first quarter of 2021. Upon re-opening, the properties continued to operate without certain amenities and subject to certain occupancy limitations,with
 restrictions varying by jurisdiction. Beginning in the latter part of the first quarter of 2021 and continuing into the second quarter of 2021, our domesticjurisdictions eased and r
emoved prior operating restrictions, including capacity and occupancy limits, as well as social distancing policies.Although
 all of our properties have re-opened, in light of the unpredictable  nature of the pandemic, including the emergence  and spread of COVID-19variants,
 the properties may be subject to new operating restrictions and/or temporary, complete, or partial shutdowns in the future. At this time, we cannot predictwhether
 jurisdictions, states or the federal government will adopt similar or more restrictive measures in the future than in the past, including stay-at-home ordersor the temporary closur
e of all or a portion of our properties as a result of the pandemic.In
 Macau,  following  a  temporary  closure  of  our  properties  on  February  5,  2020,  operations  resumed  on  February  20,  2020,  subject  to  certain  healthsafeguards,
 such as limiting the number of seats available at each table game, slot machine spacing, reduced operating hours at a number of restaurants and bars,temperature
 checks,  and  mask  protection.  Although  the  issuance  of  tourist  visas  (including  the  individual  visit  scheme)  for  residents  of  Zhuhai,  GuangdongProvince
 and all  other  provinces in mainland  China to travel  to Macau  resumed  on August 12, 2020, August 26, 2020 and September  23, 2020, respectively,several
 travel and entry restrictions in Macau, Hong Kong and mainland China remain in place (including the temporary suspension of ferry services betweenHong
 Kong and Macau, the negative nucleic acid test result certificate, and mandatory quarantine requirements for returning residents, for visitors from HongKong, Taiwan, and
37

mainland China, and bans on entry on other visitors), which significantly impacted visitation to our Macau properties. In the third and fourth quarters of 2021, localCOVID-19
 cases were identified in Macau. Upon such occurrences, a state of immediate prevention was declared and mass mandatory nucleic acid testing wasimposed
 in Macau, the validity period of negative test results for re-entry into mainland China was shortened and quarantine requirements were imposed, certainevents
 were cancelled or suspended, and in some instances, certain entertainment and leisure facilities were closed throughout Macau. Although gaming and hoteloperations have remained
 open during these states of immediate prevention, such measures have had a negative effect on our operations and it is uncertain whetherfurther closures, includ
ing the closure of our properties, or travel restrictions to Macau will be implemented if additional local COVID-19 cases are identified.The Las Vegas Strip segment results of operations are heavily impacted by visit
or volume and trends. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Las Vegasvisitor
 volume increased 69% compared to the prior year period according to information published by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. The LasVegas
 market has had the addition of new sporting events and venues, the expansion of convention centers, as well as music and entertainment events, which havepositively impacted vis
itation, along with the easing of COVID-19 related restrictions, as discussed above.The
 MGM China segment results of operations also are heavily impacted by visitor volume and trends. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Macauvisitor arrivals increased 31% compared to the prior year period according to statistics publis
hed by the Statistics and Census Service of the Macau Government, asthe prior year period was mo
re negatively affected by travel and entry restrictions in Macau than in the current year period.For
 a discussion of the risks to our business resulting from COVID-19, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business, Industry, andMarket Conditions.”
Other Developments
As
 of  December  31,  2021,  we  lease  the  real  estate  assets  of  The  Mirage,  Luxor,  New  York-New  York,  Park  MGM,  Excalibur,  The  Park,  Gold  StrikeTunica,
 MGM Grand Detroit, Beau Rivage, Borgata, Empire City, MGM National Harbor, MGM Northfield Park, and MGM Springfield pursuant to a masterlease
 agreement with MGP. See Note 1 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding MGP and the Operating Partnership,which
 we consolidate in our financial statements. All intercompany transactions, including transactions under the master lease with MGP, have been eliminated inconsolidation.
As
 further discussed below, we lease the real estate assets of Bellagio pursuant to a lease agreement with Bellagio BREIT Venture, the real estate assets ofMandalay
 Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas pursuant to a lease agreement with MGP BREIT Venture, and the real estate assets of Aria (including Vdara) pursuantto a lease agreemen
t with a fund managed by Blackstone, as further discussed below.In
 April 2019, we acquired the membership interests of Northfield Park Associates, LLC (“Northfield”), an Ohio limited liability company that owned thereal estate assets 
and operations of the Hard Rock Rocksino Northfield Park, from MGP and MGP retained the real estate assets. We then rebranded the property toMGM Northfield
 Park, and added it to the master lease between us and MGP. See Note 18 in the accompanying financial statements for information regarding thisacquisition.
Also,
 in January 2019, we acquired the real property and operations associated with Empire City in Yonkers, New York for consideration of approximately$865
 million.  Subsequently,  MGP  acquired  the  developed  real  property  associated  with  Empire  City  from  us  and  Empire  City  was  added  to  the  master  leasebetween
 us and MGP. In addition, pursuant to the master lease amendment, we agreed to provide MGP a right of first offer with respect to certain undevelopedland
 adjacent to the property to the extent that we develop additional gaming facilities and choose to sell or transfer such property in the future. See Note 4 andNote 18 in the accompanying consol
idated financial statements for information regarding this acquisition.In
 March 2019, we entered into an amendment to the master lease between us and MGP with respect to improvements made by us related to the rebrandingof
 the Park MGM and NoMad Las Vegas. See Note 18 in the accompanying financial statements for information regarding this transaction with MGP, which iseliminated in consolidation.
In
 November 2019, we completed the Bellagio transaction, pursuant to which Bellagio BREIT Venture was formed, which acquired the Bellagio real estateassets
 from us and entered into a lease agreement to lease the real estate assets back to us. The Bellagio lease has an initial term of 30 years with two 10-yearrenewal
 periods, exercisable at our option. The initial term of the lease provides for an initial annual rent of $245 million with a fixed 2% escalator for the first 10years
38

and, thereafter, an escalator equal to the greater of 2% and the CPI increase during the prior year, subject to a cap of 3% during the 11th through 20th years and 4%thereafter. In addi
tion, the lease obligates us to spend a specified percentage of net revenues at the property on capital expenditures and that we comply with certainfinancial
 covenants, which, if not met, would require us to maintain cash security or provide one or more letters of credit in favor of the landlord in an amountequal
 to rent for the succeeding 2-year period. In exchange for the contribution of the real estate assets, we received total consideration of $4.25 billion, whichconsisted
 of  a  5%  equity  interest  in  the  venture  and  cash  of  approximately  $4.2  billion.  We  also  provide  a  shortfall  guarantee  of  the  principal  amount  ofindebtedness
 of Bellagio BREIT Venture (and any interest accrued and unpaid thereon). As a result of the sale, we recorded a gain of approximately $2.7 billion.See
 Note 1, Note 11, and Note 12 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding this transaction, lease agreement, and shortfallguarantee, respectively.
In
 December 2019, we sold Circus Circus Las Vegas and adjacent land for $825 million, which consisted of $663 million paid in cash and a secured notedue
 2024 with a face value of $163 million and fair value of $134 million. In connection with our review of the carrying value of assets to be sold due to the offerfor sale received dur
ing the third quarter of 2019, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $219 million. Upon completion of the sale in the fourth quarter, werecorded a loss of $2 mill
ion. See Note 1 and Note 16 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding this transaction.In
 February 2020, we completed the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction pursuant to which the real estate assets of MGM Grand Las Vegas and MandalayBay
 (including Mandalay Place) were contributed to MGP BREIT Venture, owned 50.1% by the Operating Partnership and 49.9% by a subsidiary of BREIT. Inexchange
 for the contribution of the real estate assets, MGM and MGP received total consideration of $4.6 billion, which was comprised of $2.5 billion of cash,$1.3
 billion of the Operating Partnership’s secured indebtedness assumed by MGP BREIT Venture, and the Operating Partnership’s 50.1% equity interest in MGPBREIT
 Venture. In addition, the Operating Partnership issued approximately 3 million Operating Partnership units to us representing 5% of the equity value ofMGP BREIT Venture. We also provide a
 shortfall guarantee of the principal amount of indebtedness of MGP BREIT Venture (and any interest accrued and unpaidthereon).
 On the closing date, BREIT also purchased approximately 5 million MGP Class A shares for $150 million. See  Note 1, Note 11, and Note 12 in theaccompanying consolidate
d financial statements for information regarding this transaction, lease agreement, and shortfall guarantee, respectively.In
 connection with the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction, MGP BREIT Venture entered into a lease with us for the real estate assets of Mandalay Bay andMGM Grand Las Vegas. The lease has an initial term of 30 years wit
h two 10-year renewal periods, exercisable at our option. The initial term of the lease providesfor an initial
 annual rent of $292 million with a fixed 2% escalator for the first 15 years and, thereafter, an escalator equal to the greater of 2% and the CPI increaseduring
 the  prior  year,  subject  to  a  cap  of  3%.  In  addition,  the  lease  obligates  us  to  spend  a  specified  percentage  of  net  revenues  at  the  properties  on  capitalexpenditures
 and that we comply with certain financial covenants, which, if not met, would require us to maintain cash security or provide one or more letters ofcredit
 in  favor  of  the  landlord  in  an  amount  equal  to  the  rent  for  the  succeeding  1-year  period.  See  Note  11  in  the  accompanying  financial  statements  forinformation regarding 
this lease agreement.In
 connection with the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction, the master lease with MGP was modified to remove the Mandalay Bay property and the annualcash rent under the MGP master 
lease was reduced by $133 million, as further discussed in Note 18.Also,
 in January  2020, we, the Operating Partnership, and MGP entered into an agreement for the Operating Partnership to waive its right following theclosing
 of the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction to issue MGP Class A shares, in lieu of cash, to us in connection with us exercising our right to require theOperating Partnership to
 redeem the Operating Partnership units we hold, at a price per unit equal to a 3% discount to the ten day  average closing price prior to thedate
 of the notice of redemption.  The waiver was effective  upon closing of the transaction on February 14, 2020 and was  scheduled to terminate on the earlier ofFebruary 14, 2022 or upon our receipt of cas
h proceeds of $1.4 billion as consideration for the redemption of our Operating Partnership units. On May 18, 2020 theOperating Partnership redeemed
 approximately 30 million Operating Partnership units that we held for $700 million, or $23.10 per unit, and on December 2, 2020,the
 Operating Partnership redeemed approximately 24 million Operating Partnership units that we held for the remaining $700 million, or $29.78 per unit. As aresult, the waiver ter
minated in accordance with its terms.In
 March  2021,  we  delivered  a  notice  of  redemption  to  MGP  covering  approximately  37  million  Operating  Partnership  units  that  we  held  which  wassatisfied
 with aggregate cash proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion, using cash on hand together with the proceeds from MGP's issuance of Class A shares. SeeNote 13 in the accompanying consol
idated financial statements for information regarding this transaction, which eliminates in consolidation.39

In August 2021, we entered into an agreement with VICI and MGP whereby VICI will acquire MGP. Pursuant to the agreement, MGP Class A shareholderswill
 receive 1.366 shares of newly issued VICI stock in exchange for each MGP Class A share outstanding and we will receive 1.366 units of the new VICI OP inexchange
 for each Operating Partnership unit we hold. The fixed exchange ratio represents an agreed upon price of $43 per share of MGP Class A share to thefive-day
 volume weighted average price of VICI stock as of the close of business on July 30, 2021. In connection with the exchange, VICI OP will redeem themajority of
 our VICI OP units for cash consideration of $4.4 billion, with us retaining an approximate $370 million ownership interest in the VICI OP (based uponthe
 close price of VICI stock as of August 3, 2021). MGP’s Class B share that we hold will be cancelled. As part of the transaction, we will enter into an amendedand restated master 
lease with VICI. The new master lease will have an initial term of 25 years, with three 10-year renewals, and initial annual rent of $860 million,escalating
 annually at a rate of 2% per annum for the first 10 years and thereafter equal to the greater of 2% and the CPI increase during the prior year subject to acap
 of 3%. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2022, subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory approvals, and approval by VICIstockholders
 (which was obtained on October 29, 2021). See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Announced Transactions — The VICI Transaction,The
 Cosmopolitan transaction, and The Mirage transaction each remain subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including the receipt of certainregulatory approvals, and any 
anticipated benefits from such transactions may take longer to realize than expected or may not be realized at all.”In
 September  2021,  we  entered  into  an  agreement  to  acquire  the  operations  of  The  Cosmopolitan  for  cash  consideration  of  $1.625  billion,  subject  tocustomary
 working capital adjustments. Additionally, we will enter into a lease agreement for the real estate assets of The Cosmopolitan. The Cosmopolitan leasewill
 have an initial term of 30 years with three subsequent 10-year renewal periods, exercisable at our option. The initial term of the lease provides for an initialannual cash
 rent of $200 million with a fixed 2% escalator for the first 15 years, and thereafter, an escalator equal to the greater of 2% and the CPI increase duringthe
 prior year, subject to a cap of 3%. Additionally, the lease will require us to spend a specified percentage of net revenues over a rolling 5-year period at theproperty on capital expenditures and for us to
 comply with certain financial covenants, which, if not met, would require us to maintain cash security or one or moreletters
 of credit in favor of the landlord in an amount equal to rent for the succeeding 1-year period. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2022,subject to regulatory app
rovals and other customary closing conditions.In
 September 2021, we completed the acquisition of the 50% ownership interest in CityCenter held by Infinity World for cash consideration of $2.125billion. Upon the
 closing of the transaction, we own 100% of CityCenter and accordingly no longer account for our interest under the equity method of accounting,and
 we now consolidate CityCenter in our financial statements. See Note 4 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding thistransaction.
In September 2021, we sold the real estate assets of Aria (including V
dara) for cash consideration of $3.89 billion and entered into a lease pursuant to whichwe lease
 back the real property. The  lease has an initial term of 30 years with three 10-year renewal periods, exercisable at our option. The initial term of the leaseprovides for an initial 
annual rent of $215 million with a fixed 2% escalator for the first 15 years and, thereafter, an escalator equal to the greater of 2% and the CPIincrease
 during the prior year, subject to a cap of 3%. In addition, the lease obligates us to spend a specified percentage of net revenues at the properties on capitalexpenditures and that we comply with certain financial
 covenants, which, if not met, would require us to maintain cash security or provide a letter of credit in favorof the
 landlord in an amount equal to the rent for the succeeding 1-year period. See Note  11 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for informationregarding this lease.
In
 October 2021, MGP acquired the real estate assets of MGM Springfield from us and MGM Springfield was added to the MGP master lease between usand MGP
 through which we lease back the real property. Transactions with  MGP, including transactions under the MGP master lease, have been eliminated in ourconsolidation of MGP. Refer to Note 18 for 
further discussion of the master lease with MGP.In
 December 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell the operations of The Mirage to an affiliate of Hard Rock for cash consideration of $1.075 billion,subject
 to certain purchase price adjustments. Pursuant to the agreement, Hard Rock is obligated to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite antitrustand
 gaming regulatory approvals. The agreement may be terminated by either party if the closing has not occurred on or before December 13, 2022, which datemay
 be extended by either party to March 13, 2023 under certain circumstances. The agreement contemplates a reverse termination fee of $322.5 million that ispayable by Hard Rock to us in the event 
that the parties are unable to obtain antitrust or gaming regulatory approval. Upon closing, the master lease between us andVICI
 (or MGP in the event that the VICI Transaction  is terminated)  will be amended and restated  to reflect  a $90 million  reduction  in annual cash rent. Thetransaction is expected to close
 during the second half of 2022, subject to certain closing conditions, including, but not limited to, the consummation or terminationof the VICI Transaction and re
ceipt of regulatory approvals.40

Key Performance IndicatorsKey performance indica
tors related to gaming and hotel revenue are:•
Gaming revenue indicators: table games drop and slots handle (volume indicators); “win” or “hold” percentage, which is not fully controllable by us. Ournormal
 table games hold percentage at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts is in the range of 25.0% to 35.0% of table games drop for Baccarat and 19.0% to23.0% for non-Baccarat; howeve
r, reduced gaming volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could cause volatility in our hold percentages; and•
Hotel  revenue  indicators:  hotel  occupancy  (a  volume  indicator);  average  daily  rate  (“ADR,”  a  price  indicator);  and  revenue  per  available  room(“REVPAR,” a
 summary measure of hotel results, combining ADR and occupancy rate). Our calculation of ADR, which is the average price of occupiedrooms
 per day, includes the impact of complimentary rooms. Complimentary room rates are determined based on standalone selling price. Because themix
 of rooms provided on a complimentary  basis, particularly  to casino  customers,  includes  a disproportionate  suite component,  the composite  ADRincluding complimentary rooms is slightly higher than the A
DR for cash rooms, reflecting the higher retail value of suites. Rooms that were out of serviceduring the
 years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 as a result of closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic were excluded from the available room countwhen calculating hotel oc
cupancy and REVPAR.Additional key performanc
e indicators at MGM China are:•
Gaming  revenue  indicators:  MGM  China  utilizes  “turnover,”  which  is  the  sum  of  nonnegotiable  chip  wagers  won  by  MGM  China  calculated  asnonnegotiable
 chips  purchased  plus  nonnegotiable  chips  exchanged  less  nonnegotiable  chips  returned.  Turnover  provides  a  basis  for  measuring  VIPcasino
 win percentage. Win for VIP gaming operations at MGM China is typically in the range of 2.6% to 3.3% of turnover; however, reduced gamingvolumes as a result of the COVID-19 pande
mic could cause volatility in MGM China’s hold percentages.Results of Operations

MGM Grand Detroit re-closed on November 17, 2020 and re-opened on December 23, 2020, with the hotel tower operations resuming February 9, 2021. Consolidated net
 revenues were $9.7 billion in 2021 compared to $5.2 billion in 2020, an increase  of 88%. The current year benefited from the inclusion ofthe net revenues of Aria subsequ
ent to consolidation in September 2021 and the removal of mandated operational and capacity restrictions at our properties, as wellas
 an  increase  in  travel,  while  the  prior  year  was  negatively  affected  by  temporary  property  closures  at  certain  of  our  Las  Vegas  Strip  Resorts  and  RegionalOperations
 for a portion of the year due to the pandemic. At MGM China, the prior year was negatively affected by both property closures in the first quarter andwas also more
 significantly impacted by travel and entry restrictions in Macau than in the current year. These factors resulted in a 111% increase in net revenues atour Las Vegas Strip Resorts, a 72% incr
ease in net revenues at our Regional Operations, and an 84% increase in net revenues at MGM China.Consolidated
 operating income was $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to a loss of $642 million in 2020, due primarily to thetemporary
 property closures in the prior year as well as the inclusion of the operating income of Aria subsequent to consolidation in September 2021, as discussedabove. The
 current year included a gain on consolidation of CityCenter, net of $1.6 billion and the prior year included a $1.5 billion gain on REIT transactions, netand
 $26 million in restructuring costs. In addition, corporate expense decreased $37 million compared to the prior year. Corporate expense in the current yearincluded
 $34 million in transaction costs, while the prior year included $44 million of CEO transition expense and $49 million of October 1 litigation settlementexpense. Included in the CEO transition expe
nse is $20 million of stock compensation expense, of which approximately $13 million related to the modification andaccelerated vesting
 of outstanding stock compensation awards. Property transactions, net in the current year included a gain of $29 million related to a reduction inthe
 estimate  of  contingent  consideration  related  to  the  Empire  City  acquisition,  a  gain  of  $76  million  relating  to  the  sale  of  art,  and  an  other-than-temporaryimpairment
 charge of $22 million related to an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate. Property transactions, net in the prior year included a $64 million other-than-temporary
 non-cash impairment charge on an equity method investment and $17 million related to a loss on production show costs. Depreciation expensedecreased $60 million co

becoming fully depreciated in the current year at MGM China, primarily at MGM Cotai. General and administrative expense increased $385 million compared tothe
 prior year due primarily to the prior year reflecting the temporary property closures, the inclusion of rent expense for the Aria lease, which commenced inSeptember
 2021, and also due to a full period of rent expense for the MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay lease in the current year, partially offset byrealized benefits from our co

 September 2021, we completed the acquisition of the 50% ownership interest in CityCenter held by Infinity World and now own 100% of the equityinterest in CityCenter. Acco
rdingly, we no longer account for our interest in CityCenter under the equity method of accounting, and we now consolidate CityCenterin our financial statements.
In June
 2021, CityCenter closed the sale of its Harmon land for $80 million on which it recorded a $30 million gain. We recorded a $50 million gain, whichincluded $15 million of our 50% sh

 interest expense was $800 million in 2021 compared to $679 million in 2020. The increase in gross interest expense was due primarily to an increasein
 average debt outstanding related to senior notes due to the issuances by us, the  Operating Partnership and MGM China in 2020 and 2021, partially offset by adecrease
 in the weighted average interest rate of the senior notes. See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion onlong-term

 impact of losses in Macau that we could not benefit. The effective rate for 2020 was unfavorably impacted by losses in Macau that we could notbenefit
 and adjustments to valuation allowances for Macau deferred tax assets and foreign tax credits, partially offset by tax benefit resulting from carrying backnet operating losses to tax y
ears with a higher tax rate than is currently in effect.Cash taxes
 paid increased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in federal income taxes paid resulting from increased U.S. taxable incomefollowing the recovery of th

“Adjusted
 Property EBITDAR” is our reportable segment GAAP measure, which we utilize as the primary profit measure for our reportable segments andunderlying
 operating segments. Adjusted Property EBITDAR is a measure defined as earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes,depreciation
 and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, gain on REIT transactions, net, restructuring costs (which represents costs related to severance,accelerated
 stock compensation expense, and consulting fees directly related to the operating model component of the MGM 2020 Plan), rent expense associatedwith triple-net
 operating and ground leases, income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures, property transactions, net, and alsoexcludes
 gain on consolidation of  CityCenter, net, gain related to CityCenter's sale of Harmon land recorded within income from unconsolidated affiliates andcorporate
 expense (which includes CEO transition expense and October 1 litigation settlement) and stock compensation expense, which are not allocated to eachoperating
 segment, and rent expense related  to the master lease with MGP that eliminates  in consolidation. We manage capital  allocation, tax planning, stockcompensation,
 and financing decisions at the corporate level. “Adjusted Property EBITDAR margin” is Adjusted Property EBITDAR divided by related segmentnet revenues.
Non-GAAP Measure
“Adjusted
 EBITDAR” is earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-upexpenses,
 property  transactions,  net,  gain  on  REIT  transactions,  net,  gain  on  consolidation  of  CityCenter,  net,  CEO  transition  expense,  October  1  litigationsettlement,
 restructuring costs (which represents costs related to severance, accelerated  stock compensation expense, and consulting fees directly related to theoperating
 model  component  of  the  MGM 2020  Plan),  rent  expense  associated  with  triple-net  operating  and  ground  leases,  gain  related  to  CityCenter's  sale  ofHarmon land recorded 
within income from unconsolidated affiliates, and income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures.Adjusted
 EBITDAR information is a valuation metric, should not be used as an operating metric, and is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure toreported
 GAAP measures because we believe this measure is widely used by analysts, lenders, financial institutions, and investors as a principal basis for thevaluation
 of gaming companies. We believe that while items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAR may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded inevaluation
 of our earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends. Also, we believe excluded items may notrelate
 specifically to current trends or be indicative of future results. For example, preopening and start-up expenses will be significantly different in periods whenwe
 are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle, as well as the sizeand
 scope of the project(s). Property transactions, net includes normal recurring disposals, gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within ourresorts, but
 also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments inunconsolidated affiliates,
 which may not be comparable period over period. However, as discussed herein, Adjusted EBITDAR should not be viewed as a measureof overall operating pe
rformance, considered in isolation, or as an alternative to net income, because this measure is not48

presented on a GAAP basis and exclude certain expenses, including the rent expense associated with our triple-net operating and ground leases, and are providedfor the limited purposes d
iscussed herein.Adjusted
 EBITDAR should not be construed as an alternative to operating income or net income, as an indicator of our performance; or as an alternative tocash
 flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity; or as any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. We have significant uses of cashflows, including
 capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes, real estate triple-net lease and ground lease payments, and debt principal repayments, which are notreflected
 in  Adjusted  EBITDAR.  Also,  other  companies  in  the  gaming  and  hospitality  industries  that  report  Adjusted  EBITDAR  information  may  calculateAdjusted EBITDAR in a different manner 
and such differences may be material.The following table presents

Cash FlowsOperating
 activities. Trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income, excluding non-cash charges, but can be affected bychanges in working capital,
 the timing of significant interest payments, tax payments or refunds, and distributions from unconsolidated affiliates. Cash provided by operating activiti
es was $1.4 billion in 2021 compared to cash used in operating activities of $1.5 billion in 2020. The change from the prior year was due primarilyto
 the increase in Adjusted Property EBITDAR discussed within the results of operations section above, and due to the prior year being negatively affected by achange
 in working capital related to gaming and non-gaming deposits, gaming taxes and other gaming liabilities, and payroll related liabilities as a result of theCOVID-19 pandemic, partially offs
et by an increase in triple-net lease rent payments and cash paid for interest and taxes.Investing
 activities. Our investing cash flows can fluctuate significantly  from year to year depending on our decisions with respect to strategic capitalinvestments
 in new or existing resorts, business acquisitions or dispositions, and the timing of maintenance capital expenditures to maintain the quality of ourresorts. Capital expenditures related to regular investments in our existi
ng resorts can also vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our publicspaces and hotel rooms
. Cash provided by investing activities
 was $1.5 billion in 2021  compared to $2.2 billion in 2020 . In 2021, we  received $3.9 billion in net cash proceeds fromthe
 sale of the real estate of Aria (including Vdara), received $107 million in net proceeds from the sale of property and equipment, primarily related to the sale ofart,
 which  were  partially  offset  by  our  payments  of  $1.8  billion  to  acquire  CityCenter,  net  of  cash  acquired, $491  million in  capital  expenditures,  as  furtherdiscussed below,
 and contributions of $225 million to BetMGM. In comparison, in the prior year we received $2.5 billion  in net cash proceeds from the MandalayBay
 and MGM Grand Las Vegas real estate transaction, which were partially offset by $271 million in capital expenditures and $80 million in contributions toBetMGM. In the prior year period, d
istributions from unconsolidated affiliates included $51 million related to our share of a distribution paid by CityCenter.Capital Expenditures
In
 2021, we made capital expenditures of $491 million, of which $68 million related to MGM China. Capital expenditures at MGM China included $49million
 primarily related to construction of the Emerald Tower project at MGM Cotai and $19 million related to projects at MGM Macau. Capital expenditures atour
 Las  Vegas Strip  Resorts,  Regional  Operations  and corporate  entities  of  $423  million  primarily  relate  to  expenditures  in  information  technology  and  roomremodels.
In
 2020, we made capital expenditures of $271 million, of which $108 million related to MGM China. Capital expenditures at MGM China included $95million
 primarily related to construction close-out and projects at MGM Cotai and $13 million related to projects at MGM Macau. Capital expenditures at our LasVegas
 Strip  Resorts,  Regional  Operations  and  corporate  entities  of  $162  million  included  expenditures  relating  to  information  technology,  health  and  safetyinitiatives, and various
 room, restaurant, and entertainment venue remodels.Financing activities.
 Cash used in financing activities was $2.8 billion in 2021  compared to cash provided by  financing activities of $2.1 billion in 2020. In2021
, we had net repayments of debt of $1.3 billion, as further discussed below, distributed $324 million to noncontrolling interest owners, and we repurchased$1.8 billion
 of our common stock, partially offset by net proceeds received of $793 million from the issuance of MGP's Class A shares. In comparison, in the prioryear
 period, we received net proceeds from the incurrence of the bridge loan facility in connection with the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction of $1.3 billion, netproceeds
 of $525 million from  MGP’s Class A share issuances, net  debt borrowings of $1.1 billion, as further discussed below, repurchased $354 million of ourcommon stock, distributed $286 m
illion to noncontrolling interest owners, and paid $78 million in dividends to our shareholders. Borrowings and Repayments of Long-term Debt
In
 2021, we had net repayments of debt of $1.3 billion, which consisted of the repayment of the $1.7 billion outstanding on CityCenter's credit facility infull,
 which  was  assumed  in  the  acquisition,  using  cash  on  hand,  and  net  repayments  of  $407  million  on  MGM  China’s  first  revolving  credit  facility.  Theserepayments
 were partially offset by MGM China’s March 2021 issuance of $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.75% senior notes due 2027 at an issueprice
 of 99.97% and net draws of $40 million on the Operating Partnership's revolving credit facility, of which $35 million was used in connection with MGP'sacquisition
 of MGM Springfield with the remainder used to fund the Operating Partnership's and MGP's distribution and dividend payments. The net proceedsfrom
 MGM China’s 4.75% senior notes due 2027 issuance were used to partially repay amounts outstanding under the MGM China first revolving credit facilityand for general corpora
te purposes.51

In 2020, we had net proceeds from the incurrence of the bridge loan facility in connection with the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction of $1.3 billion and netdebt
 borrowings of $1.1 billion, which consisted of net borrowings on MGM China’s credit facility of $103 million, our issuance of $750 million of 4.75% seniornotes
 and $750 million of 6.75% senior notes, the Operating Partnership’s issuance of $750 million of 3.875% senior notes and $800 million of 4.625% seniornotes,
 and MGM China’s issuance of $500 million of 5.25% senior notes, partially offset by the tender of $750 million of our senior notes and the corresponding$97
 million of tender offer costs, and the net repayment of $1.7 billion on the Operating Partnership's senior credit facility consisting of the repayment of $1.3billion of its term loan B facility in full using the proceeds of the $1.3 billion brid
ge loan facility, which was then assumed by MGP BREIT Venture, the repaymentof
 its $399 million term loan A facility in full using the net proceeds from MGP’s settlement of forward equity agreements, partially offset by a net draw of $10million on its revolving c
redit facility.In
 March 2020, with certain of the proceeds from the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction, we completed cash tender offers for an aggregate amount of $750million
 of our senior notes, comprised of $325 million principal amount of our outstanding 5.75% senior notes due 2025, $100 million principal amount of ouroutstanding 4.625% senior notes due 2026, and $325 
million principal amount of our outstanding 5.5% senior notes due 2027.In
 May 2020, we issued $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.750%  senior notes due 2025. The proceeds were used to further increase ourliquidity position.
In
 June 2020, the Operating Partnership issued $800 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior notes due 2025. The proceeds were used torepay borrowings on the Operating Partnership’s senior credit
 facility, which were used to fund the May 2020 redemption of $700 million of Operating Partnershipunits held by us.
In
 June 2020, MGM China issued $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due 2025. The proceeds were used to partially repayamounts outstanding under the MGM China c
redit facility and for general corporate purposes.In
 October 2020, we issued $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.75% senior notes due 2028. The  proceeds were used for general corporatepurposes.
In
 November 2020, the Operating Partnership issued $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.875% senior notes due 2029. The proceeds were usedfor general corporat
e purposes, which included the December 2020 redemption of $700 million of the Operating Partnership units held by us.Dividends, Distributions to Noncontrolling 
Interest Owners and Share RepurchasesIn
 2021,  we  repurchased  and  retired  $1.8  billion  of  our  common  stock  pursuant  to  our  May  2018  $2.0  billion  and  February  2020  $3.0  billion  stockrepurchase programs. As a result of those repurchases, we completed o
ur May 2018 $2.0 billion stock repurchase program, and the remaining availability under theFebruary
 2020 $3.0 billion stock repurchase program was $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2021. In 2020, we repurchased and retired $354 million of our commonstock pursuant to our May 2018 $2.0 billion s
tock repurchase program.In
 March 2021, June 2021, September 2021, and December 2021, we paid dividends of $0.0025 per share, totaling $5 million for 2021. In March 2020, wepaid a dividend of $0.15 per share, 
and in June 2020, September 2020 and December 2020, we paid dividends of $0.0025 per share, totaling $78 million for 2020.In 2020, MGM China paid the final dividend 
for 2019 of $41 million, of which we received $23 million and noncontrolling interests received $18 million.The Operating Partnership paid 
the following distributions to its partnership unit holders during 2021 and 2020:•
$545  million  of  distributions  paid  in  2021,  of  which  we  received  $243  million  and  MGP  received  $302  million,  which  MGP  concurrently  paid  as  adividend to its Class A shareholders
; and•
$602  million  of  distributions  paid  in  2020,  of  which  we  received  $358  million  and  MGP  received  $244  million,  which  MGP  concurrently  paid  as  adividend to its Class A shareholders.
Other
 Factors Affecting Liquidity and An ticipated Uses of CashAs
 previously discussed, the spread of COVID-19 and developments surrounding the global pandemic have had a significant impact on our business,financial
 condition, results of operations, and cash flows in  2020 and 2021 and may continue to impact our business in 2022 and thereafter. We require a certainamount of cash on hand to operat
e our resorts.52

In addition to required cash on hand for operations, we utilize corporate cash management procedures to minimize the amount of cash held on hand or in banks.Funds
 are swept from the accounts at most of our domestic resorts daily into central bank accounts, and excess funds are invested overnight or are used to repayamounts drawn
 under our revolving credit facility. In addition, from time to time we may use excess funds to repurchase our outstanding debt and equity securitiessubject
 to limitations in our revolving credit facility and Delaware law, as applicable. We have significant outstanding debt, interest payments, rent payments, andcontractual
 obligations  in  addition  to  planned  capital  expenditures  and  commitments,  including  acquiring  the  operations  of  The  Cosmopolitan  for  cashconsideration of $1.625 billion, 
as discussed further in Note 1. As of
 December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4.7 billion, of which MGM China held $399 million and the Operating Partnership held $8million. In addition to our 
cash and cash equivalent balance, we have significant holdings: a 41.5% economic interest in MGP (refer to Note 1 for discussion on ouragreement entered 
into in August 2021 regarding the VICI Transaction) and an approximate 56% interest in MGM China.At
 December 31, 2021, we had $12.9 billion in principal amount of indebtedness, including $360 million outstanding under the $1.25 billion MGM Chinafirst
 revolving credit facility and $50 million outstanding under the $1.35 billion Operating Partnership revolving credit facility. No amounts were drawn on our$1.675
 billion revolving credit facility or the $400 million MGM China second revolving credit facility. We  have $1.0 billion of debt maturing in the next twelvemonths, which we expect to repay with 
cash on hand.Due
 to the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, in February 2021, MGM China further amended each of its first revolving credit facility and itssecond
 revolving credit facility to provide for waivers of the maximum leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio through the fourth quarter of 2022. InFebruary
 2022, MGM China further amended each of its first revolving credit facility and its second revolving credit facility to extend the financial covenantwaivers through maturity.
As
 of  December  31,  2021,  our  expected  cash  interest  payments,  excluding  MGP  and  MGM  China,  for  2022,  2023,  and  2024  are  approximately  $300million,
 $225  million,  and  $190  million,  respectively,  and  our  expected  cash  interest  payments  on  a  consolidated  basis,  which  includes  MGP  if  the  VICITransaction
 does not close and MGM China, for 2022, 2023, and 2024, are approximately $715 million, $625 million, and $585 million, respectively. We are alsorequired
 as of December 31, 2021 to make annual cash rent payments of $1.6 billion, in the aggregate, under the triple-net lease agreements, which leases are alsosubject to annual escal
ators and also require us to pay substantially all costs associated with the lease, including real estate taxes, ground lease payments, insurance,utilities and routine 
maintenance, in addition to the annual cash rent.We
 have planned capital expenditures in 2022 of approximately $775 million to $815 million domestically and approximately $110 million to $130 millionat
 MGM  China, which  is  inclusive  of  the  capital  expenditures  required  under  the  triple-net  lease  agreements,  each  of  which  requires  us  to  spend  a  specifiedpercentage of
 net revenues, at the respective properties, on capital expenditures. We additionally have planned contributions  to BetMGM in 2022 of approximately$225 million.
We
 also expect to continue to repurchase shares pursuant to our February 2020 $3.0 billion share repurchase program. Subsequent to December 31, 2021,we
 repurchased  approximately 15  million shares  of  our  common  stock  at  an  average  price  of $43.88  per  share  for  an  aggregate  amount  of $670  million. Repurchased shares were ret
ired.In
 January 2022, the Operating Partnership paid $141 million of distributions to its partnership unit holders, of which we received $59 million and MGPreceived $82 million, which MGP concu
rrently paid as a dividend to its Class A shareholders.On 
February  9, 2022,  our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.0025  per  share.  The  dividend  will  be payable  on March  15, 2022 to holders
 of record on March  10, 2022.  Future determinations regarding the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board ofdirectors
 and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our results of operations, financial condition, and other factors that our Board of Directors maydeem relevant
. As
 previously discussed, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and is continuing to cause, significant economic disruption both globally and in the UnitedStates, and
 impacted our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in  2020 and 2021 and may continue to impact our business in 2022 andthereafter
.  As widespread vaccine distribution continues and operational restrictions have been removed, we have seen economic recovery in some of the marketsegments
 in  which  we  operate,  as  shown  in  our  Summary  Operating  Results.  However,  some  areas  continue  to  experience  renewed  outbreaks  and  surges  ininfection
 rates. As a result, our business segments continue to face many uncertainties and our operations remain vulnerable to reversal of these trends or othercontinuing negative eff
ects caused by53

the pandemic. We cannot predict the degree, or duration, to which our operations will be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the effects could be material.We
 continue to monitor the evolving situation and guidance from international and domestic authorities, including federal, state and local public health authoritiesand
 may take additional actions based on their recommendations. In these circumstances, there may be developments outside our control requiring us to furtheradjust our
 operating plan, including the implementation or extension of new or existing restrictions, which may include the reinstatement of stay-at-home orders inthe
 jurisdictions in which we operate or additional restrictions on travel and/or our business operations. Because the situation is ongoing, and because the durationand severity remain unc
lear, it is difficult to forecast any impacts on our future results.For additional
 information related to our long-term obligations, refer to the maturities of long-term debt table in Note 9 and the lease liability maturity tablein Note 11.
Principal Debt Arrangements
See Note 9 to the accompanying conso
lidated financial statements for information regarding our debt agreements as of December 31, 2021.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management’s discussion and analysis of our
 results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements. Toprepare
 our  consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America,  we  must  makeestimates
 and  assumptions  that  affect  the  amounts  reported  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  We  regularly  evaluate  these  estimates  and  assumptions,particularly
 in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates, where the estimates and assumptions involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty andhave had
 or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to aninherent degree of uncertaint
y and therefore actual results can differ from our estimates.Loss Reserve for Casino Accounts Receivab
leMarker
 play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at certain of our Las Vegas resorts. Our other casinos do not emphasize marker playto
 the same extent, although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well. MGM China extends credit to certain in-house VIP gaming customers and,historically,
 to gaming promoters. We maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from our customers who fail to paytheir marker balances
 timely. These collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts, includingthe
 mailing  of  statements  and  delinquency  notices,  personal  contacts,  the  use  of  outside  collection  agencies  and  civil  litigation.  Markers  are  generally  legallyenforceable
 instruments in the United States and Macau. Markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries, but the United States assets offoreign
 customers  may  be  reached  to  satisfy  judgments  entered  in  the  United  States.  We  consider  the  likelihood  and  difficulty  of  enforceability,  among  otherfactors,
 when  we  issue  credit  to  customers  at  our  domestic  resorts  who  are  not  residents  of  the  United  States.  MGM  China  performs  background  checks  andinvestigates
 credit worthiness prior to issuing credit. Refer to Note 2 for further discussion of our casino receivables and those due from customers residing inforeign countries.
We
 maintain a loss reserve for casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts. The provision for doubtful accounts, an operating expense, increasesthe
 loss reserve. We regularly evaluate the loss reserve for casino accounts. At domestic resorts where marker play is not significant, the loss reserve is generallyestablished by applying
 standard reserve percentages to aged account balances, which is supported by relevant historical analysis and any other known informationsuch
 as the current economic conditions that could drive losses. At domestic resorts where marker play is significant, we apply standard reserve percentages toaged
 account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount,based
 on  the  age  of  the  account,  the  customer’s  current  and  expected  future  financial  condition,  collection  history  and  current  and  expected  future  economicconditions. MGM China specifically analyzes the collectability of
 casino receivables on an individual basis taking into account the age of the account, the financialcondition and the collec
tion history of the customer or, historically, the gaming promoter.In
 addition  to  enforceability  issues,  the  collectability  of  unpaid  markers  given  by  foreign  customers  at  our  domestic  resorts  is  affected  by  a  number  offactors,
 including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers’ home countries. Because individual customer account balancescan
 be significant, the loss reserve and the provision can change significantly between periods, as information about a certain customer becomes known or aschanges in a region’s economy o

million of casino receivables and $31 million and $18 million of the loss reserve for casino accounts receivable relate toMGM
 China at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The loss reserve as a percentage of casino accounts receivable decreased in the current year due to adecrease
 in specific reserves at our domestic resorts, as well as the inclusion  of Aria in the current year, which had a lower loss reserve compared to our otherdomestic
 resorts due to the age of its outstanding receivables, partially offset by an increase in the loss reserve at MGM China primarily due to an increase in itsspecific reserves.
 At  December 31, 2021, a 100 basis-point change in the loss reserve as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change income beforeincome taxes by $4 million.
Fixed Asset Capitalization and Deprec
iation PoliciesProperty
 and  equipment  are  stated  at  cost.  A  significant  amount  of  our  property  and  equipment  was  acquired  through  business  combinations  and  wastherefore
 recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolongits
 life are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Whenwe
 construct assets, we capitalize direct costs of the project, including fees paid to architects and contractors, property taxes, and certain costs of our design andconstruction
 subsidiaries. In addition, interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project.Interest
 is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weighted average cost of our outstanding borrowings. Capitalization of interest startswhen construction activit
ies begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete, or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period.We
 must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures. Whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense, or acapital asset
 is a matter of judgment. When constructing or purchasing assets, we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired,which
 also may be a matter of judgment. In addition, our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets’ estimated usefullives.
 We  determine  the  estimated  useful  lives  based  on  our  experience  with  similar  assets,  engineering  studies,  and  our  estimate  of  the  usage  of  the  asset.Whenever events or cir
cumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset, we account for the change prospectively.Impairment of Long-lived Assets, Goodwill and Inde
finite-lived Intangible AssetsWe
 evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment based on our classification as held for sale or to be held and used.Several
 criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale, including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell theasset
 at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. For assets classified as held for sale, we recognize the asset at the lower ofcarrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable as
set sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. For assetsto
 be held and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. We then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on anundiscounted
 basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscountedcash
 flows  do  not  exceed  the  carrying  value,  then  an  impairment  is  recorded  based  on  the  fair  value  of  the  asset.  For  operating  assets,  fair  value  is  typicallymeasured
 using a discounted cash flow model whereby future cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital, developed using a standardcapital
 asset pricing model, based on guideline companies in our industry. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining constructioncosts. All recognized impa
irment losses, whether for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.There
 are several estimates, assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of long-lived assets. First, management must determine the usage of theasset. To the extent management decides that an
 asset will be sold, it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized. Assets must be tested at the lowest levelfor
 which identifiable cash flows exist. This means that some assets must be grouped, and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets. Future cashflow estimates are, by t
heir nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates.55

On a quarterly basis, we review our major long-lived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment.Potential factors
 which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results, negative industry or economicfactors,
 significant changes to our operating environment, or changes in intended use of the asset group. We estimate future cash flows using our internal budgetsand
 probability weight cash flows in certain circumstances to consider alternative outcomes associated with recoverability of the asset group, including potentialsale.
 Historically, undiscounted cash flows of our significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin. During 2019, werecorded a non-cash impa
irment charge relating to the carrying value of Circus Circus Las Vegas and adjacent land. Refer to Note 16 for further discussion.We
 review indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. We perform our annual impairmenttest
 for  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  each  fiscal  year.  Indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  consist  primarily  of  license  rights  andtrademarks.
 For  our  2021  annual  impairment  tests,  we  utilized  the  option  to  perform  a  qualitative  (“step  zero”)  analysis  for  certain  of  our  indefinite-livedintangibles
 and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such intangibles exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin. We elected toperform
 a quantitative analysis for the MGM Northfield Park gaming license in 2021 primarily using the discounted cash flow approach, for which the fair valueexceeded
 its carrying value by a substantial margin. As discussed below, management makes significant judgments and estimates  as part of these analyses. Ifcertain
 future operating  results  do not meet  current  expectations  it could cause  carrying  values of the intangibles  to exceed  their fair  values  in future  periods,potentially resulting in a
n impairment charge.We
 review goodwill at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. None of our reporting units incurred any goodwill impairmentcharges in 2021. For our 2021 annual impairment tests, we utilized the
 option to perform a step zero analysis for certain of our reporting units and concluded it wasmore
 likely than not that the fair values of such reporting units exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin. As discussed below, management makessignificant
 judgments and estimates as part of these analyses. If future operating results of our reporting units do not meet current expectations it could causecarrying values of our repo
rting units to exceed their fair values in future periods, potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge.There
 are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment. In particular, future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective andactual
 results  may  differ  materially  from  our  estimates.  In  addition,  the  determination  of  multiples,  capitalization  rates  and  the  discount  rates  used  in  theimpairment tests a
re highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions.See Note 2 and Note 7 to the accompany
ing consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets.Impairment of Investments in Unconsolidat
ed AffiliatesSee
 Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of our evaluation of other-than-temporary impairment of investments inunconsolidated
 affiliates. During 2021 and 2020, we recorded $22 million and $64 million, respectively, in other-than-temporary impairment charges on equitymethod investments. Refer 
to Note 6 for further discussion. Our investments in unconsolidated affiliates had no material impairments in 2019.Income Taxes
We are subject to inco
me taxes in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign jurisdictions, although the income taxes paidin foreign jurisdictions 
are not material.We
 recognize  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  related  to  net  operating  losses,  tax  credit  carryforwards  and  temporary  differences  with  future  taxconsequences.
 We  reduce  the  carrying  amount  of  deferred  tax  assets  by  a  valuation  allowance  if  it  is  more  likely  than  not  such  assets  will  not  be  realized.Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowance
s for deferred tax assets is assessed at each reporting period based on such "more-likely-than-not" realizationthreshold. This assessment
 considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, thescheduled reversal of de
ferred tax liabilities, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, and tax planning strategies.We recorded a valuation allowance on the
 net deferred tax assets of our domestic jurisdictions of $2.7 billion as of both December 31, 2021 and 2020, and avaluation
 allowance on certain net deferred tax assets of foreign jurisdictions of $149 million and $156 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.We reassess the real
ization of deferred tax assets each reporting period. In the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to56

realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings or othercomprehensive
 income  in  the  period  in  which  we  make  such  a  determination.  Likewise,  if  we  later  determine  that  we  are  more  likely  than  not  to  realize  thedeferred
 tax assets, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, wemust be able to generat
e sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located.Furthermore,
 we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. We believe that positions taken on our tax returns arefully
 supported, but tax authorities may challenge these positions, which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities. Accordingly,our
 income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges. Determining the income tax provision for thesepotential
 assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates. The amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit couldbe materially different from
 the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our income tax provision,net income and cash flows.

anying consolidated financial statements for further discussion relating to income taxes.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND
 QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKMarket Risk
In
 addition to the inherent risks associated with our normal operations, we are also exposed to additional market risks. Market risk is the risk of loss arisingfrom adverse changes in m
arket rates and prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate riskassociated with
 our variable rate long-term debt. We attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long-term fixed rate borrowingsand
 short-term borrowings under our bank credit facilities and by utilizing interest rate swap agreements that provide for a fixed interest payment on the OperatingPartnership’s credit facility. A change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upo
n our future earnings and cash flow for fixed-rate debt instruments. Asfixed-rate
 debt matures, however, and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment, future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes ininterest
 rates. This effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures. We do not hold or issue financial instruments fortrading purposes and do not enter 
into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions. As of December
 31, 2021, variable rate borrowings represented approximately 3% of our total borrowings after giving effect on the Operating Partnership’sborrowings
 for the currently effective interest rate swap agreements on which the Operating Partnership pays a weighted average of 1.783% on a total notionalamount of $700 million. Additiona
lly, the Operating Partnership has $900 million of notional amount of forward starting swaps that are not currently effective. Thefollowing
 table  provides  additional  information  about  the  maturities  of  our  debt  subject  to  changes  in  interest  rates,  excluding  the  effect  of  the  OperatingPartnership interest r
ate swaps discussed above:

N/A 1.9 %3.0 %N/A N/A N/A 2.8 % In
 addition to the risk associated with our variable interest rate debt, we are also exposed to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates,mainly
 related to MGM China and to our operations at MGM Macau and MGM Cotai. While recent fluctuations in exchange rates have not been significant,potential
 changes in policy by governments or fluctuations in the economies of the United States, China, Macau or Hong Kong could cause variability in theseexchange rates.
 We cannot assure you that the Hong Kong dollar will continue to be pegged to the U.S. dollar or the current peg rate for the Hong Kong dollar willremain
 at the same level. The possible changes to the peg of the Hong Kong dollar may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate thereof. For U.S. dollardenominated
 debt incurred by MGM China, fluctuations in the exchange rates of the Hong Kong dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar could have adverse effects onour
 financial position and results of operations. As of December 31, 2021, a 1% weakening of the Hong Kong dollar (the functional currency of MGM China) tothe U.S. dollar would result in a for
eign currency transaction loss of $28 million. 57

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Stockholders and the Board of Dir
ectors of MGM Resorts InternationalOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We
 have audited the internal control over financial reporting of MGM Resorts International and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021,based
 on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control  —  Integrated  Framework  (2013)  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  TreadwayCommission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maint
ained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021,based on criteria est
ablished in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.We
 have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidatedfinancial
 statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, of the Company and our report dated February 25, 2022,expressed an unqualified opin
ion on those financial statements.Basis for Opinion
The
 Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness ofinternal
 control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  the  accompanying  Management’s  Annual  Report  on  Internal  Control  Over  Financial  Reporting.  Ourresponsibility
 is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registeredwith
 the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules andregulations of the Securi
ties and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We
 conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance
 about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understandingof
 internal  control  over financial  reporting,  assessing  the risk that  a material  weakness exists,  testing  and evaluating  the design and operating  effectiveness  ofinternal
 control based on the assessed  risk, and performing  such other procedures  as we considered  necessary  in the circumstances.  We believe  that our auditprovides a reasonable basis 
for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financia
l ReportingA
 company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reportingand
 the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control overfinancial
 reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions
 and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation offinancial
 statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made  only  inaccordance
 with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, us
e, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because
 of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness
 to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate./s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Stockholders and the Board of Dir
ectors of MGM Resorts InternationalOpinion on the Financial Statements
We
 have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MGM Resorts International and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2021and
 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows and stockholders' equity for each of the three years in theperiod
 ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule of Valuation and Qualifying Accounts included in Item 15(a)(2),(collectively
 referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of theCompany as of December 31, 202
1 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021,in conformity with account
ing principles generally accepted in the United States of America.We
 have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company'sinternal
 control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by theCommittee of Sponsoring Organization
s of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company'sinternal control over 
financial reporting.Basis for Opinion
These
 financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financialstatements
 based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company inaccordance with the U.S. feder
al securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We
 conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance
 about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures toassess
 the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Suchprocedures included
 examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating theaccounting
 principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believethat our audits provide a r
easonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit Matter
The
 critical  audit  matter  communicated  below  is  a  matter  arising  from  the  current-period  audit  of  the  financial  statements  that  was  communicated  orrequired to
 be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved ourespecially
 challenging,  subjective,  or  complex  judgments.  The  communication  of  critical  audit  matters  does  not  alter  in  any  way  our  opinion  on  the  financialstatements,
 taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on theaccounts or disclosures to which 
it relates.Acquisition and Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Valuation of CityCenter — Refer to Notes 1 and 4 to 
the financial statementsOn
 September  27,  2021,  the  Company  completed  the  acquisition  of  the  50%  ownership  interest  in  CityCenter  Holdings,  LLC  (“CityCenter”)  held  byInfinity
 World  Development  Corp for  cash  consideration  of  $2.125  billion.  Prior  to  the  acquisition,  the  Company  held  a  50%  ownership  interest,  which  wasaccounted for
 under the equity method. The Company accounted for the acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, and thefair
 value was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, which included $180.0 million of trademarks and $1.4 billion ofgoodwill. Management
 estimated the fair value of the trademarks using the relief from royalty method, which is a specific discounted cash flow method. Goodwillwas
 recognized as the excess of the cash consideration and the acquisition-date fair value of the Company’s equity method investment over the identifiable assetsacquired and liabili
ties assumed.The
 fair  value  determination  of  the  trademarks  required  management  to  make  significant  estimates  and  assumptions  around  expected  cash  flows  andprojected financial results, i
ncluding forecasted revenues (collectively the “forecast”), as60

well as the selection of discount rates. Changes to these assumptions and estimates could have a significant impact on the fair value of the trademarks and therecognition
 of goodwill. Therefore, auditing the forecast and the selection of discount rates involved a higher degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity, as wellas an increased level o
f audit effort, including the involvement of fair value specialists.How the Critical Audit Matter Was Address
ed in the AuditOur audit
 procedures related to the forecast and selection of discount rates used by management to determine the fair value of the acquired intangible assetsand the reporting unit assign
ed goodwill included the following, among others:•
We tested the effectiveness of controls over determining the fair value of the tradename, including those over management’s forecast and the selection ofdiscount rates.
•
We evaluated the assumptions and estimates included in the forecast by:◦
Comparing  the  forecasts  to  information  included  in  the  Company’s  communications  to  the  Board  of  Directors,  earnings  and  press  releases,gaming industry reports, inves
tor presentations, and analyst reports for the Company and certain of its peer companies;◦
Comparing the forecasts to historical financial results;◦
Conducting inquiries with management; and◦
Evaluating whether the forecast was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.•
With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the discount rates by:◦
Testing the market-based source information underlying the determination of the discount rates and the mathematical accuracy of the discountrate calculations.
◦
Developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management./s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP

t limited to, the consummation or termination of the VICI Transaction and receipt of regulatory approvals.The
 Company has an approximate 56% controlling  interest in MGM China Holdings Limited (together with its subsidiaries, “MGM China”), which ownsMGM
 Grand Paradise, S.A. (“MGM Grand Paradise”). MGM Grand Paradise owns and operates the MGM Macau and MGM Cotai, two integrated casino, hoteland entertainment r
esorts in Macau, as well as the related gaming subconcession and land concessions.Gaming
 in  Macau  is  currently  administered  by  the  Macau  Government  through  concessions  awarded  to  three  different  concessionaires  and  threesubconcessionaires,
 of  which  a  subsidiary  of  MGM  China,  MGM  Grand  Paradise,  is  a  subconcessionaire.  In  2019,  the  expiration  of  MGM  Grand  Paradise’ssubconcession
 term  was  extended  from  March  31,  2020  to  June  26,  2022,  consistent  with  the  expiration  of  the  other  concessionaires  and  subconcessionaires.Pursuant to the
69

Macau gaming law, upon reaching the maximum duration of 20 years, the term of the concessions may be extended one or more times by order of the ChiefExecutive,
 which period may not exceed, in total, 5 years. On January 14, 2022, the Macau Government disclosed the content of a bill to amend Macau gaminglaw,
 which followed a 45-day public consultation process regarding draft amendment proposals that were issued in September 2021. Under the bill the existingsubconcessions
 will be discontinued and a maximum of six concessions will be awarded for a term to be specified in the concession contract that may not exceed10
 years and which may be extended by three years under certain circumstances. The bill is subject to debate and approval by the Macau Legislative Assembly.The
 approval of the new gaming law bill will precede the public tender for the awarding of new gaming concessions and to date the Macau Government hasprovided
 no indication as to whether the public tender will take place before expiry of the existing gaming concessions and subconcessions but acknowledged thatit
 could consider the extension of the existing concessions and subconcessions beyond their current term if the public tender is held at a later date. Unless MGMGrand
 Paradise's gaming subconcession is extended or legislation with regard to reversion of casino premises is amended the casino area premises and gaming-related
 equipment subject to reversion will automatically be transferred to the Macau Government upon expiration, and MGM China will cease to generate anyrevenues
 from  such  gaming  operations.  In  addition,  certain  events  relating  to  the  loss,  termination,  rescission,  revocation  or  modification  of  MGM  GrandParadise’s
 gaming  subconcession  in  Macau,  where  such  events  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  financial  condition,  business,  properties,  or  results  ofoperations
 of MGM China, taken as a whole, may result in a special put option triggering event under MGM China’s senior notes and in an event of default underMGM
 China’s  revolving  credit  facilities.  MGM  China  continues  to  closely  monitor  developments  regarding  the  retendering  process  or  concession  extensionsincluding
 the issuance of guidance by the Macau Government. MGM China intends to respond proactively to all relevant Macau Government requirements whenknown relating to the 
process. Management cannot provide any assurance that the gaming subco ncession will be extended beyond the current term or that it will beable
 to  obtain  a  gaming  concession  in  a  public  tender;  however,  management  believes  that  MGM  Grand  Paradise  will  be  successful  in  obtaining  a  gamingconcession when a public tender 
is held.The
 Company owns 50% of BetMGM, LLC (“BetMGM”), which provides online sports betting and iGaming in certain jurisdictions in the United States.The other 50% of BetMGM is owned by Entain plc.
The
 Company has three reportable segments: Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and MGM China. See Note 17 for additional information aboutthe Company’s segments.

 first  quarter  of  2021.  Upon  re-opening,  the  properties  continued  to  operate  without  certain  amenities  and  subject  to  certain  occupancy  limitations,  withrestrictions varying by
 jurisdiction. Beginning in the latter part of the first quarter of 2021 and continuing into the second quarter of 2021, the Company’s domesticjurisdictions eased and r
emoved prior operating restrictions, including capacity and occupancy limits, as well as social distancing policies.Although
 all of the Company’s properties have re-opened, in light of the unpredictable nature of the pandemic, including the emergence and spread ofCOVID-19
 variants, the properties may be subject to new operating restrictions and/or temporary, complete, or partial shutdowns in the future. At this time, theCompany
 cannot  predict  whether  jurisdictions,  states  or  the  federal  government  will  adopt  similar  or  more  restrictive  measures  in  the  future  than  in  the  past,including stay-at-home o
rders or the temporary closure of all or a portion of the Company’s properties as a result of the pandemic.In
 Macau, following a temporary closure of the Company’s properties on February 5, 2020, operations resumed on February 20, 2020, subject to certainhealth
 safeguards, such as limiting the number of seats available at each table game, slot machine spacing, reduced operating hours at a number of restaurants andbars,
 temperature checks, and mask protection. Although the issuance of tourist visas (including the individual visit scheme) for residents of Zhuhai, GuangdongProvince
 and all  other  provinces in mainland  China to travel  to Macau  resumed  on August 12, 2020, August 26, 2020 and September  23, 2020, respectively,several
 travel and entry restrictions in Macau, Hong Kong and mainland China remain in place (including the temporary suspension of ferry services betweenHong
 Kong and Macau, the negative nucleic acid test result certificate, and mandatory quarantine requirements for returning residents, for visitors from HongKong,
 Taiwan,  and  certain  regions  in  mainland  China,  and  bans  on  entry  on  other  visitors),  which  significantly  impacted  visitation  to  the  Company’s  Macauproperties.
 In the third and fourth quarters of 2021, local COVID-19 cases were identified in Macau. Upon such occurrences, a state of immediate prevention wasdeclared and mass manda
tory nucleic acid testing was imposed in Macau, the validity period of negative test results for re-entry into mainland China was shortenedand quarantine require
ments were imposed, certain events were cancelled or suspended, and in some instances,70

certain  entertainment  and  leisure  facilities  were  closed  throughout  Macau.  Although  gaming  and  hotel  operations  have  remained  open  during  these  states  ofimmediate
 prevention, such measures have had a negative effect on the Company's operations and it is uncertain whether further closures, including the closure ofthe Company’s properties, or t
ravel restrictions to Macau will be implemented if additional local COVID-19 cases are identified.NOTE 2 — BASIS OF
 PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESPrinciples
 of consolidation. The Company  evaluates entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights to determine if it is theprimary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (“VIE”).
 A VIE is an entity in which either (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, lack the power through votingor
 similar rights to direct the activities of such entity that most significantly impact such entity’s economic performance or (ii) the equity investment at risk isinsufficient
 to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support. The Company identifies the primary beneficiary of a VIE as theenterprise
 that  has  both  of  the  following  characteristics:  (i)  the  power  to  direct  the  activities  of  the  VIE  that  most  significantly  impact  the  entity’s  economicperformance;
 and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the entity. The Company consolidates itsinvestment in a VIE when it determines that it is its primary beneficiary. For these VIEs, the Compa
ny records a noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balancesheets.
 The Company may change its original assessment of a VIE upon subsequent events such as the modification of contractual arrangements that affect thecharacteristics
 or adequacy of the entity’s equity investments at risk and the disposition of all or a portion of an interest held by the primary beneficiary. TheCompany performs this analysis on 
an ongoing basis. Management has determined
 that MGP is a VIE because the Class A equity investors as a group lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct theactivities of such entity
 that most significantly impact such entity’s economic performance. The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of MGPand
 consolidates MGP because (i) its ownership of MGP’s single Class B share entitles it to a majority of the total voting power of MGP’s shares, and (ii) theexchangeable
 nature of the Operating Partnership units owned provide the Company the right to receive benefits from MGP that could potentially be significant toMGP.
 The  Company  has  recorded  MGP’s  ownership  interest  in  the  Operating  Partnership  as  noncontrolling  interest  in  the  Company’s  consolidated  financialstatements.
 As of December 31, 2021, on a consolidated basis MGP had total assets of $10.4 billion, primarily related to its real estate investments, and totalliabilities of $5.1 bil
lion, primarily related to its indebtedness.Management
 has determined that Bellagio BREIT Venture is a VIE because the equity holders as a group lack the power through voting or similar rights todirect
 the  activities  of  such entity  that  most  significantly  impact  such entity’s  economic  performance.  The Company  has determined  that  it  is not  the primarybeneficiary
 of Bellagio BREIT Venture and, accordingly, does not consolidate the venture, because the Company does not have power to direct the activities thatcould potentially be significant to the
 venture; BREIT, as the managing member, has such power. The Company has recorded its 5% ownership interest in BellagioBREIT
 Venture as an investment in unconsolidated affiliates in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, for which such amount was $58 million as ofDecember
 31, 2021. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with Bellagio BREIT Venture is equal to the carrying value of itsinvestment,
 assuming no future capital funding requirements, plus the exposure to loss resulting from the Company’s guarantee of the debt of Bellagio BREITVenture, which guarantee is i
mmaterial as of December 31, 2021, as further discussed in Note 12.For
 entities determined not to be a VIE, the Company consolidates such entities in which the Company owns 100% of the equity. For entities in which theCompany
 owns less than 100% of the equity interest, the Company consolidates the entity under the voting interest model if it has a controlling financial interestbased
 upon the terms of the respective entities’ ownership agreements, such as MGM China. For these entities, the Company records a noncontrolling interest inthe
 consolidated balance sheets and all intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. If the entity does not qualify for consolidationunder
 the voting interest model and the Company has significant influence over the operating and financial decisions of the entity, the Company accounts for theentity under the equity method, such as the Company’s inve
stments in MGP BREIT Venture and BetMGM, which do not qualify for consolidation as the Companyhas
 joint control, given the entities are structured with substantive participating rights whereby both owners participate  in the decision making process, whichprevents the Company from exe
rting a controlling financial interest in such entities, as defined in ASC 810.For
 equity interests in entities in which the Company does not have significant influence, the Company records its equity investment under ASC 321 andreflects
 such investments within “Other long-term assets, net” on the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of such equity investments was $66 million as ofDecember 31, 2021
. Reclassifications
. Certain reclassifi cations have been made to conform the prior period presentation.71

Management’s use of estimates. The  consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted inthe
 United States of America. These principles require the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assetsand liabilities and dis
closure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during thereporting period. Actual r
esults could differ from those estimates.Fair
 value measurements. Fair  value measurements affect the Company’s accounting and impairment assessments of its long-lived assets, investments inunconsolidated
 affiliates  or  equity  interests,  assets  acquired,  and  liabilities  assumed  in  an  acquisition,  and  goodwill  and  other  intangible  assets.  Fair  valuemeasurements also affect
 the Company’s accounting for certain of its financial assets and liabilities. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sellan
 asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and is measured according to a hierarchy thatincludes:
 Level 1 inputs, such as quoted prices in an active market; Level 2 inputs, which are observable inputs for similar assets; or Level 3 inputs, which areunobservable inputs.
 The Company used the following inputs in its fair value measurements:•
Level 1 inputs when measuring its equity investments under ASC 321;•
Level 1 and Level 2 inputs for its long-term debt fair value disclosures. See Note 9;•
Level 2 inputs when measuring the Operating Partnership’s fair value of its interest rate swaps. See Note 9;•
Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 inputs when assessing the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the CityCenter acquisition. See Note 4; and•
Level 2 and Level 3 inputs when assessing the fair value of the note receivable relating to the Circus Circus Las Vegas and adjacent land sale. See Note16.
Cash
 and cash equivalents. Cash  and cash equivalents include cash on hand, investments and interest-bearing instruments with maturities of 90 days orless
 at the date of acquisition. Such investments are carried at cost, which approximates market value. Book overdraft balances resulting from the Company’s cashmanagement program a
re recorded as “Accounts payable” or “Construction payable” as applicable.Restricted
 cash. Restricted  cash  reflects  cash  held  in  an  escrow  account  related  to  the  reverse  termination  fee  that  was  contractually  required  to  beprefunded
 for The Cosmopolitan acquisition and  is reflected as "Restricted Cash" on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021. "Restricted Cash"and
 "Cash  and  cash  equivalents"  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  as  of  December  31,  2021  equal  "Cash,  cash  equivalents,  and  restricted  cash"  on  theconsolidated statemen
ts of cash flows.Accounts receivable and credit risk.
 Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of casino accounts
 receivable.  The  Company  issues  credit  following  background  checks  and  investigations  of  creditworthiness.  At  December  31,  2021  and  2020,approximately
 43% and 52%, respectively, of the Company’s gross casino accounts receivable were owed by customers from foreign countries, primarily withinAsia. Business or economic conditions o
r other significant events in these countries could affect the collectability of such receivables.Accounts receivable are typically non-interest bearing and are initially recorded at cost. Account
s are written off when management deems the account to beuncollectible.
 Recoveries  of  accounts  previously  written  off  are  recorded  when  received.  An  estimated  loss  reserve  is  maintained  to  reduce  the  Company’sreceivables to
 their net carrying amount, which approximates fair value. The loss reserve is estimated based on both a specific review of customer accounts as wellas
 historical collection experience and current and expected future economic and business conditions. Management believes that as of December 31, 2021, nosignificant concentr
ations of credit risk existed for which a loss reserve had not already been recorded.Inventories.
 Inventories  consist  primarily  of  food  and  beverage,  retail  merchandise  and  operating  supplies,  and  are  stated  at  the  lower  of  cost  or  netrealizable
 value.  Cost  is  determined  primarily  using  the  average  cost  method  for  food  and  beverage  and  operating  supplies.  Cost  for  retail  merchandise  isdetermined using the cost 
method.Property and equipment. 
Property and equipment are  stated at cost. A significant amount of the Company’s property and equipment was acquired throughbusiness
 combinations and therefore recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Gains or losses on dispositions of property and equipment are included in thedetermination of inco
me or loss. Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.72

Property and equipment are generally depreciated over the following estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis:Buildings and improvements
15 to 40 years Land improvements
10 to 20 years Furniture and fixtures
3 to 20 years Equipment
3 to 15 years The
 Company evaluates its property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment based on its classification as held for sale or to be held andused.
 Several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale, including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sellthe
 asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. For assets held for sale, the Company recognizes the asset at the lower ofcarrying
 value or fair market value less costs to sell, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets tobe
 held and used, the Company reviews for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company then compares the estimated future cash flows ofthe
 asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If theundiscounted
 cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment charge is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using adiscounted
 cash  flow  model.  If  an  asset  is  still  under  development,  future  cash  flows  include  remaining  construction  costs.  All  recognized  impairment  losses,whether
 for assets held for sale or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses. Refer to Note 16 for discussion on the impairment loss recordedon Circus Circus Las Vegas and adjacen
t land in 2019.Capitalized
 interest. The  interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized and included in the cost of the project.When
 no debt is incurred specifically for a project, interest is capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weighted average cost of the Company’soutstanding
 borrowings. Capitalization of interest ceases when the project is substantially complete, or development activity is suspended for more than a briefperiod.
Investments
 in  and  advances  to  unconsolidated  affiliates. The  Company  has  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates  accounted  for  under  the  equitymethod.
 Under  the  equity  method,  carrying  value  is  adjusted  for  the  Company’s  share  of  the  investees’  earnings  and  losses,  amortization  of  certain  basisdifferences, as
 well as capital contributions to and distributions from these companies. Distributions in excess of equity method earnings are recognized as a returnof
 investment and recorded as investing cash inflows in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company classifies operating income andlosses
 as  well  as  gains  and  impairments  related  to  its  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates  as  a  component  of  operating  income  or  loss  and  classifies  non-operating income
 or losses related to its investments in unconsolidated affiliates as a component of non-operating income or loss, as the Company’s investments insuch unconsolidated affil
iates are an extension of the Company’s core business operations.The
 Company evaluates its investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carryingvalue of
 its investment may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value. If such conditions exist, the Company compares the estimated fair value ofthe
 investment to its carrying value to determine if an impairment is indicated and determines whether the impairment is “other-than-temporary” based on itsassessment
 of all relevant factors, including consideration of the Company’s intent and ability to retain its investment. The Company estimates fair value using adiscounted
 cash flow analysis based on estimated future results of the investee and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates, and a market approachthat utilizes business en
terprise value multiples based on a range of multiples from the Company’s peer group.Goodwill
 and  other  intangible  assets. Goodwill  represents  the  excess  of  purchase  price  over  fair  market  value  of  net  assets  acquired  in  businesscombinations.
 Goodwill  and  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  must  be  reviewed  for  impairment  at  least  annually  and  between  annual  test  dates  in  certaincircumstances.
 The Company performs its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. No material impairments were indicated or recorded asa result of the annual i
mpairment review for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2021, 2020, and 2019.Accounting
 guidance provides entities the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (commonly referredto
 as  “step  zero”)  in  order  to  determine  whether  further  impairment  testing  is  necessary.  In  performing  the  step  zero  analysis  the  Company  considersmacroeconomic
 conditions,  industry  and  market  considerations,  current  and  forecasted  financial  performance,  entity-specific  events,  and  changes  in  thecomposition
 or carrying amount of net assets of reporting units for goodwill. In addition, the Company takes into consideration the amount of excess of fair valueover carrying value det
ermined in the last quantitative analysis that was performed, as well as the73

period of time that has passed since the last quantitative analysis. If the step zero analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than itscarrying amount, the ent
ity would proceed to a quantitative analysis.Under
 the quantitative analysis, goodwill for relevant reporting units is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the estimatedfuture
 results of the Company’s reporting units discounted using market discount rates and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates, and a marketapproach that utiliz
es business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples from the Company’s peer group. If the fair value of the reporting unit is lessthan
 its carrying value, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the difference. Under the quantitative analysis, license rights are tested for impairment using adiscounted
 cash flow approach, and trademarks are tested for impairment using the relief-from-royalty method. If the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangibleasset is less than its ca
rrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference.Revenue
 recognition. The  Company’s revenue from contracts with customers consists of casino wagers transactions, hotel room sales, food and beveragetransactions, entert
ainment shows, and retail transactions.The
 transaction  price  for  a  casino  wager  is  the  difference  between  gaming  wins  and  losses  (“net  win”).  In  certain  circumstances,  the  Company  offersdiscounts
 on markers, which is estimated based upon historical business practice, and recorded as a reduction of casino revenue. Commissions rebated to gamingpromoters and VIP players
 at MGM China are also recorded as a reduction of casino revenue. The Company accounts for casino revenue on a portfolio basis giventhe similar chara
cteristics of wagers by recognizing net win per gaming day versus on an individual wager basis.For
 casino wager transactions that include other goods and services provided by the Company to gaming patrons on a discretionary basis to incentivizegaming,
 the  Company  allocates  revenue  from  the  casino  wager  transaction  to  the  good  or  service  delivered  based  upon  standalone  selling  price  (“SSP”).Discretionary goods and servic
es provided by the Company and supplied by third parties are recognized as an operating expense.For
 casino wager transactions that include incentives earned by customers under the Company’s loyalty programs, the Company allocates a portion of netwin
 based  upon  the  SSP  of  such  incentive  (less  estimated  breakage).  This  allocation  is  deferred  and  recognized  as  revenue  when  the  customer  redeems  theincentive.
 When redeemed, revenue is recognized in the department that provides the goods or service. Redemption of loyalty incentives at third-party outlets arededucted
 from the loyalty liability and amounts owed are paid to the third party, with any discount received recorded as other revenue. After  allocating revenue toother goods and services provided 
as part of casino wager transactions, the Company records the residual amount to casino revenue. The
 transaction price of rooms, food and beverage, and retail contracts is the net amount collected from the customer for such goods and services. Thetransaction price for such contracts is recorded as revenue whe
n the good or service is transferred to the customer over their stay at the hotel or when the delivery ismade
 for the food & beverage and retail & other contracts. Sales and usage-based taxes are excluded from revenues. For some arrangements, the Company acts asan
 agent in that it arranges for another party to transfer goods and services and the Company is not the controlling entity, which primarily include certain of theCompany’s entertainment shows and, 
in certain jurisdictions, the Company’s arrangement with BetMGM for online sports betting and iGaming.The
 Company also has other contracts that include multiple goods and services, such as packages that bundle food, beverage, or entertainment offeringswith
 hotel stays and convention services. For such arrangements, the Company allocates revenue to each good or service based on its relative SSP. The Companyprimarily
 determines the SSP of rooms, food and beverage, entertainment, and retail goods and services based on the amount that the Company charges when soldseparately in similar circumstances
 to similar customers.Contract and Contract-Related Liabili
ties. There may  be a difference between the timing of cash receipts from the customer and the recognition of revenue,resulting
 in a contract or contract-related liability. The Company generally has three types of liabilities related to contracts with customers: (1) outstanding chipliability,
 which represents the amounts owed in exchange for gaming chips held by a customer, (2) loyalty program obligations, which represents the deferredallocation of revenue 
relating to loyalty program incentives earned, as discussed above, and (3) customer advances and other, which is primarily funds deposited bycustomers
 before gaming play occurs (“casino front money”) and advance payments on goods and services yet to be provided such as advance ticket sales anddeposits
 on  rooms  and  convention  space  or  for  unpaid  wagers.  These  liabilities  are  generally  expected  to  be  recognized  as  revenue  within  one  year  of  beingpurchased, earned, or deposit
ed and are recorded within “Other accrued liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets.74

The following table summarizes the activity related to contract and contract-related liabilities:

 cost. Costs  reimbursed pursuant to management services are recognized as revenue in the period it incurs the costs as this reflects when theCompany
 performs  its  related  performance  obligation  and  is  entitled  to  reimbursement.  Reimbursed  costs  related  primarily  to  the  Company’s  management  ofCityCenter (such managemen
t agreement was terminated upon the acquisition of CityCenter in September 2021).Revenue by source. 
The  Company presents the revenue earned disaggregated by the type or nature of the good or service (casino, room, food and beverage,and entertainment, retail and 
other) and by relevant geographic region within Note 17. Leases. 
The  Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception or modification of the arrangement. An arrangement is or contains alease
 if there are identified assets and the right to control the use of an identified asset is conveyed for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control overthe use
 of the identified asset means the lessee has both the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset and the right to directthe use of the asset.
The
 Company classifies a lease with terms greater than twelve months as either operating or finance. At commencement date, the right-of-use (“ROU”)assets
 and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The initial measurement of theoperating
 lease ROU assets also includes any prepaid lease payments and are reduced by any previously accrued deferred rent. When available, such as for theCompany’s triple-net oper
ating leases for which the lessor has provided its implicit rate or provided the assumptions required for the Company to readily determinethe
 rate implicit in the lease, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments to present value. However, for most of the Company’sleases,
 such as its equipment leases, the Company cannot readily determine the implicit rate. Accordingly, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate todiscount
 the lease payments for such leases based on the information available at the commencement date. Lease terms include options to extend or terminate thelease
 when it is reasonably certain that such option will be exercised. The Company’s triple-net operating leases each contain renewal periods at the Company’soption, each
 of which are not considered to be reasonably certain of being exercised. Many of the Company’s leases include fixed rental escalation clauses that arefactored
 into the determination of lease payments. For operating leases, lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over theexpected
 lease term. For finance leases, the ROU asset depreciates on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or useful life of the ROU asset and thelease liability accretes interest base
d on the interest method using the discount rate determined at lease commencement.Refer
 to Note 11 for discussion of leases under which the Company is a lessee. The master lease agreement with MGP is eliminated in consolidation; referto Note 18 for further discussion o
f the master lease with MGP.The
 Company is a lessor under certain other lease arrangements. Lease  revenues earned by the Company from third parties are classified within the lineitem
 corresponding to the type or nature of the tenant’s good or service. Lease revenues from third-party tenants include $43 million, $24 million and $53 millionrecorded
 within food and beverage revenue for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $85 million, $60 million and $89 million recorded within entertainment,retail,
 and  other  revenue  for  the  same  such  periods,  respectively.  Lease  revenues  from  the  rental  of  hotel  rooms  are  recorded  as  rooms  revenues  within  theconsolidated statemen
ts of operations.Advertising.
 The  Company  expenses  advertising  costs  as  incurred.  Advertising  expense  that  primarily  relates  to  media  placement  costs  and  which  isgenerally included in gen
eral and administrative expenses, was $121 million, $88 million and $195 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.Corporate expense.
 Corporate  expense represents unallocated payroll, professional fees and various other expenses not directly related to the Company’scasino
 resort operations. In addition, corporate expense includes the costs associated with the Company’s evaluation and pursuit of new business opportunities,which are expensed as incurr
ed.75

Preopening and start-up expenses. Preopening  and start-up costs, including organizational costs, are expensed as incurred. Costs classified as preopeningand start-up expenses includ
e payroll, outside services, advertising, and other expenses related to new or start-up operations.Property
 transactions, net. The  Company classifies transactions such as write-downs and impairments, demolition costs, and normal gains and losses onthe sale of assets as “Prope
rty transactions, net.” See Note 16 for a detailed discussion of these amounts.Redeemable
 noncontrolling interest. Certain  noncontrolling interest parties have non-voting economic interests in MGM National Harbor which providefor
 annual  preferred  distributions  by  MGM  National  Harbor  to  the  noncontrolling  interest  parties  based  on  a  percentage  of  its  annual  net  gaming  revenue  (asdefined
 in the MGM National Harbor operating agreement). Such distributions are accrued each quarter and are paid 90 days after the end of each fiscal year. Thenoncontrolling
 interest parties each have the ability to require MGM National Harbor to purchase all or a portion of their interests for a purchase price based on acontractually agre
ed upon formula.The
 Company  has  recorded  the  interests  as  “Redeemable  noncontrolling  interests”  in  the  mezzanine  section  of  the  accompanying  consolidated  balancesheets
 and not stockholders’ equity because their redemption is not exclusively in the Company’s control. The interests were initially accounted for at fair value.Subsequently,
 the Company recognizes changes in the redemption value as they occur and adjusts the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling intereststo
 equal the maximum redemption value, provided such amount does not fall below the initial carrying value, at the end of each reporting period. The Companyrecords any changes
 caused by such an adjustment in capital in excess of par value. Additionally, the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interests isadjusted
 for  accrued  annual  preferred  distributions,  with  changes  caused  by  such  adjustments  recorded  within  net  income  (loss)  attributable  to  noncontrollinginterests.
Income

 stockholders includes adjustments for redeemable noncontrolling interests. Diluted weighted average common and common equivalent shares includeadjustments for potenti

ated statements of operations.On

 credit facility. At  December 31, 2021, the Company’s senior credit facility consisted of a $1.675 billion revolving facility of which no amountswere drawn.
On
 February 14, 2020, in connection with the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction, the Company used proceeds from the transaction to repay and terminatethe 
$1.5 billion outstanding  on its then existing revolving facility in full and entered into an unsecured credit agreement, comprised of a $1.5  billion unsecured revolving
 facility that would mature in February 2025. As a result, the Company incurred a $4 million  loss  on early retirement of debt recorded in “Other, net” inthe consolidated state
ments of operations.84

In  April  2020  and  then  in  February  2021,  the  Company  amended  its  credit  facility  to  provide  it  with  certain  relief  from  the  effects  of  the  COVID-19pandemic,
 including certain financial maintenance covenant waivers, agreeing to liquidity tests, and pledging the Operating Partnership units held by loan partiesto
 the lenders as collateral. In November 2021, the Company terminated its existing revolving facility and entered into a new $1.675 billion secured revolvingcredit facility
 that matures in November 2026. The revolving credit facility bears interest of SOFR plus 1.50% to 2.25% determined by reference to a rent adjustedtotal net leverage 
ratio pricing grid.The
 Company's senior revolving credit facility is, subject to gaming approval, guaranteed by each of the Company's existing direct and indirect wholly-owned
 material domestic restricted subsidiaries, subject to certain exclusions. The senior revolving credit facility is secured by a pledge of the equity in certain ofthe
 Company's domestic operating properties. Mandatory prepayments will be required upon the occurrence of certain events, including sales of certain assets,subject to certain ex
ceptions. The Company’s  senior revolving credit facility also contains customary representations and warranties, events of default and positiveand negative covenants. 
The Company was in compliance with i ts applicable covenants at December 31, 2021.Operating
 Partnership  senior  credit  facility  and  bridge  facility. At  December  31,  2021,  the  Operating  Partnership’s  senior  secured  credit  facilityconsisted
 of a $1.35 billion revolving credit facility. The revolving facility bears interest of LIBOR plus 1.75% to 2.25% determined by reference to a total netleverage
 ratio pricing grid and will mature in June 2023. At December 31, 2021, $50 million was drawn on the revolving credit facility and the  interest rate on therevolving credit fac
ility was 1.85%. In
 February 2020, in connection with the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction, the Operating  Partnership amended its senior secured credit facility to, amongother
 things, allow for the transaction to occur, permit the incurrence by the Operating Partnership of a nonrecourse guarantee relating to the debt of MGP BREITVenture (refer to Note 12 for
 description of such guarantee), and permit the incurrence of the bridge loan facility. As a result of the transaction and the amendment,the
 Operating Partnership repaid its $1.3 billion  outstanding  term loan B facility in full with the proceeds of a bridge facility, which was then assumed by MGPBREIT Venture as partial consideration for the Operating Partnership’s contribution. Additionall
y, the Operating Partnership used the proceeds from the se ttlementof the
 forward equity issuances to pay off the outstanding balance of $399 million  on  its term loan A facility in full. As a result, the Operating Partnership incurredan 
$18 million loss on early retirem ent of debt recorded in “Other, net” in the consolidated statements of operations.The
 Operating  Partnership  is  party  to  interest  rate  swaps  to  mitigate  the  effects  of  interest  rate  volatility  inherent  in  its  variable  rate  debt  as  well  asforecasted
 debt issuances. As of December 31, 2021, the Operating Partnership has currently effective interest rate swap agreements on which it pays a weightedaverage
 fixed rate of 1.783% on total notional amount of $700 million .  The Operating Partnership has an additional $900 million  total  notional amount of forwardstarting
 interest rate swaps that are not currently effective. The fair value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges was $25 million ,  with $5 million recorded
 as a current liability and $20  million recorded  as a long-term liability as of December 31, 2021, and $41 million, with $1 million  recorded  as a currentliability
 and $40 million  recorded  as a long-term liability, as of December 31, 2020. The fair value of interest rate swaps not designated as cash flow hedges was$27
 million,  with $8  million recorded  as a current  liability  and $19  million recorded  as a long-term  liability  as of December  31, 2021, and $78 million,  with$31

 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was signed into law. The CARES Act contains certain incometax
 provisions that are beneficial to the Company; namely, the relaxation of the interest expense deduction limitation for the 2019 and 2020 tax years and theallowance
 of a 5-year carryback of net operating losses (“NOLs”) incurred during tax years 2018 through 2020. The Company has recorded a federal income taxreceivable
 of $226 million to reflect the carryback of its 2020 NOL. Furthermore, since the NOL was carried back to tax years when the federal income tax ratewas 35%, compared to the 21% rate currently in effect, the Company realized $
90 million more income tax benefit than if it would have only been able to carry theNOL forward.
The
 Company  has  recorded  a  valuation  allowance  of  $2.7  billion  on  its  foreign  tax  credit  (“FTC”)  carryover  of  $3.1  billion  as  of  December  31,  2021,resulting
 in an FTC net deferred tax asset of $332 million. The FTCs are attributable to the Macau Special Gaming Tax, which is 35% of gross gaming revenue inMacau. Because
 MGM Grand Paradise is presently exempt from the Macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits, the Company believes that payment of theMacau
 Special Gaming Tax qualifies as a tax paid in lieu of an income tax that is creditable against U.S. taxes. While the Company generally does not expect togenerate
 new FTC carryovers after the year ended December 31, 2017, it will be able to utilize its existing FTC carryovers to the extent that it has active foreignsource
 income during the 10-year FTC carryforward period. Such foreign source income includes the recapture, to the extent of 50% of U.S. taxable income eachyear, of overall domest
ic losses that totaled $1.3 billion at December 31, 2021. The Company relies on future U.S. source89

operating income in assessing utilization of the overall domestic losses and, by extension, future FTC realization during the 10-year FTC carryover period. TheFTC
 carryovers will expire if not utilized as follows: $297 million in 2022; $976 million in 2023; $780 million in 2024; $674 million in 2025; $134 million in2026; and $200 million in 2027.
The
 Company’s assessment of the realization of its FTC deferred tax asset is based on available evidence, including assumptions concerning future U.S.operating
 profits and foreign source income. As a result, significant judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a valuation allowance and changes tosuch
 assumptions  could  result  in  a  material  change  in  the  valuation  allowance  with  a  corresponding  impact  on  the  provision  for  income  taxes  in  the  periodincluding such change.
On
 March 30, 2020, MGM Grand Paradise was granted an extension of its exemption from the Macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits throughJune
 26, 2022, concurrent with the end of the term of its current gaming subconcession. Absent the exemption from complementary tax on gaming profits, “Netincome
 attributable to MGM Resorts International” would have decreased by $10 million in 2021 and increased by $4 million in 2020 and diluted earnings pershare
 would have decreased by $0.02 in 2021 and increased by $0.01 in 2020. The Company continues to assume that MGM Grand Paradise will pay the Macau12%
 complementary tax on gaming profits for all periods beyond June 26, 2022 and has factored that assumption into the measurement of Macau deferred taxassets and liabilities.
Non-gaming
 operations remain subject to the Macau complementary tax. At December 31, 2021, MGM Grand Paradise had a complementary tax NOLcarryforward of $1.5 billion 
resulting from non-gaming operations that will expire if not utilized in years 2022 through 2024.MGM
 Grand Paradise’s exemption from the 12% complementary tax on gaming profits does not apply to dividend distributions of such profits to MGMChina.
 On July 26, 2021, MGM Grand Paradise extended its agreement with the Macau government to settle the 12% complementary tax that would otherwise bedue by its shareholder, MGM China, on distributions of its
 gaming profits by paying a flat annual payment regardless of the amount of distributable dividends. Theextension
 covers distributions of gaming profits earned for the period April 1, 2020 through June 26, 2022. The agreement requires payments of approximately$1
 million for the period April 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, $2 million for January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021, and $1 million for the periodJanuary 1, 2022 through June 26, 2022. The Company record
ed $3 million of income tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2021 under the extension.The Company has NOLs in certain of the states
 in which it operates that total $536 million as of December 31, 2021, which equates to deferred tax assets of$35 million
 after federal tax effect and before valuation allowance. The majority of these NOL carryforwards will expire if not utilized by 2025 through 2040 withthe
 remaining  being  carried  forward  indefinitely.  The  Company  has  provided  a  valuation  allowance  of  $6  million  on  certain  of  its  state  deferred  tax  assets,including a portion of NOLs described 
above.In
 addition, there is a valuation allowance of $146 million on certain Macau deferred tax assets, and a valuation allowance of $3 million on Hong KongNOLs because the Company believes thes
e assets do not meet the “more likely than not” criteria for recognition.A reconciliation of the b

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign jurisdictions, although the incometaxes
 paid in foreign jurisdictions are not material. As of December 31, 2021, the IRS can generally no longer assess tax with respect to years ended prior to 2016.During
 the  twelve  months  ended  December  31,  2021,  the  Company  reached  a  settlement  with  the  IRS  Appeals  Office  on  the  examination  of  its  2014  U.S.consolidated federal 
income tax return. No cash tax payments were due as a result of the settlement.As
 of December 31, 2021, other than adjustments resulting from the federal and state income tax audits discussed herein, the various state and local taxjurisdictions
 in  which  the  Company  files  tax  returns  can  no  longer  assess  tax  with  respect  to  years  ended  prior  to  2016.  However,  such  state  and  local  taxjurisdictions may adjust NOLs generate
d in such years that are utilized in subsequent years. During 2021, an examination of income tax returns filed in New Jerseyfor tax years 2015 through 2018 closed wi
th no change and an examination of income tax returns filed in Massachusetts for tax years 2017 and 2018 closed with nomaterial adjustments. Additionally, the Company's income tax returns
 filed in New York City for the tax years 2017 through 2019 are currently under examination.The Company does not anticipate 
any material adjustments upon resolution of this audit.The
 Company received a final audit determination with respect to the examination of income tax returns filed in the state of Michigan for tax years 2014through
 2018. The Company had an informal conference with the Michigan Department of Treasury Hearings Division to contest the findings of the audit. TheHearings Division issued its decision and order and now the
 Company is determining its next course of action. Any final adjustments upon resolution of this matterare not expected to be material.
The
 Company  believes  that  it  is  reasonably  possible  that  the  total  amounts  of  unrecognized  tax  benefits  at  December  31,  2021  may  decrease  by  up  to$13 million within the next twe
lve months on the expectation of resolution of a tax accounting method related to its customer loyalty program.NOTE 11 – LEASES

 master lease. The  MGP master lease has an initial lease term of 10 years that began on April 25, 2016 (other than with respect to MGM NationalHarbor,
 as described below) with the potential to extend the term for four additional 5-year terms thereafter at the option of the Company (with additional renewaloptions
 with respect to MGM Springfield, as described below). The MGP master lease provides that any extension of its term must apply to all of the real estateunder
 the master lease at the time of the extension. The MGP master lease provides that the initial term with respect to MGM National Harbor ends on April 31,2024.
 Thereafter, the initial term of the MGP master lease with respect to MGM National Harbor may be renewed at the option of the Company for an initialrenewal
 period lasting until the earlier of the end of the then-current term of the master lease or the next renewal term (depending on whether the Company electsto
 renew the other properties under the master lease in connection with the expiration of the initial 10-year term). If, however, the Company chooses not to renewthe
 lease with respect to MGM National Harbor after the initial MGM National Harbor term under the master lease, the Company would also lose the right torenew
 the MGP master lease with respect to the rest of the properties when the initial 10-year lease term ends related to the rest of the properties in 2026. Inaddition to
 the four 5-year renewal terms, the term of the lease with respect to MGM Springfield may be extended for an additional four 5-year renewal terms. TheMGP master
 lease has a triple-net structure, which requires the Company to pay substantially all costs associated with the lease, including real estate taxes, groundlease
 payments, insurance, utilities and routine maintenance, in addition to the base rent. Additionally, the master lease provides MGP with a right of first offerwith respect to
 any further gaming development by the Company on the undeveloped land adjacent to Empire City, which MGP may exercise should the Companyelect to sell this prop
erty in the future.Rent
 under the MGP master lease consists of a base rent component and a percentage rent component. As of December 31, 2021, the base rent representsapproximately
 91% of the rent payments due and the percentage rent represents approximately 9% of the rent payments due under the MGP master lease. TheMGP
 master lease also provides for fixed annual escalators of 2% on the base rent through the sixth lease year and the possibility for additional 2% increasesthereafter
 subject to the tenant and operating  subsidiary sublessee, collectively,  meeting  an adjusted net revenue to rent ratio,  as well as potential  increases  inpercentage
 rent  in  year  six  and  every  five  years  thereafter  based  on  a  percentage  of  average  actual  annual  net  revenue  during  the  preceding  five  year  periodcalculated
 in accordance with the terms under the master lease. With respect to the additional renewal terms for MGM Springfield, for the first two additionalrenewal terms,
 base rent will include a fixed annual rent escalator of 2.0%, subject to the adjusted net revenue to rent ratio, as discussed above. For each lease yearsubsequent
 to  the  first  two  additional  renewal  terms,  the  base  rent  shall  be  the  Fair  Market  Rent  (as  defined  in  the  MGP  master  lease)  in  respect  of  MGMSpringfield. The MGP master leas
e also contains customary events of default and financial covenants; provided that the tenant will not be in default of the financialcovenants
 in the event there is an unavoidable delay (as such term is defined in the lease). The Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants as ofDecember 31, 2021.
Subsequent
 to the Company completing its acquisition of Empire City in January 2019, MGP acquired the developed real property associated with EmpireCity
 from  the  Company  for  consideration  of  approximately  $634  million,  which  included  the  assumption  of  debt  of  approximately  $246  million,  which  wasimmediately
 repaid, and the remainder in issuance of Operating Partnership units. The real estate assets of Empire City were then leased to the Company pursuantto
 an amendment to the MGP master lease, increasing the annual rent payment to MGP by $50 million, prorated for the remainder of the lease year. Consistentwith the MGP master lease te
rms, 90% of this rent will be fixed and contractually104

grow at 2% per year until 2022. As disclosed above, the master lease provides MGP with a right of first offer with respect to certain undeveloped land adjacent tothe
 property to the extent the Company develops additional gaming facilities,  which MGP may exercise should the Company elect to sell this property in thefuture.
On
 March 7, 2019, the Company entered into an amendment to the existing MGP master lease with respect to the Park MGM Transaction. In connectionwith
 the transaction, the Company received consideration of $638 million ,  of which approximately $606 million  was  paid in cash and the remainder in issuance ofOperating
 Partnership units. Additionally, the annual rent payment to MGP was increased by $50 million ,  prorated for the remainder of the lease year. Consistentwith the master lease terms, 
90%  of this rent will be fixed and contractually grow at 2%  per year until 2022.Additionally,
 on April 1, 2019, the Company acquired the membership interests of Northfield from MGP, which held the operations of Northfield, for fairvalue
 of consideration of approximately $305 million  consisting  primarily of approximately 9 million  Operating  Partnership units that were ultimately redeemedby
 the Operating Partnership, and MGP retained the associated real estate assets. The Company then rebranded the property to MGM Northfield Park, which wasthen
 added to the existing MGP master lease with MGP, increasing the annual rent payment to MGP by $60 million .  Consistent with the master lease terms, 90% of this rent will be fixed 
and contractually grow at 2%  per year until 2022.The
 annual  rent  payments  under  the  MGP  master  lease  for  the  fourth  lease  year,  which  commenced  on  April  1,  2019,  increased  to  $946  million  from$770
 million at the start of the third lease year. The increase was a result of the $50 million in additional rent for each of the Park MGM Transaction and theaddition of Empire City in the beginning of 201
9, the $60 million of additional rent for MGM Northfield Park, which entered the Master Lease on April 1, 2019, aswell as the third 2% fixed 
annual rent escalator that went into effect on April 1, 2019.On
 February 14, 2020, the Company amended the MGP master lease to remove Mandalay Bay from such master lease and the annual rent under the MGPmaster lease was reduc
ed by $133 million to $813 million.The
 annual cash rent payments under the MGP master lease for the fifth lease year, which commenced on April 1, 2020, increased to $828 million from$813 million, as a result of 
the fourth 2% fixed annual rent escalator that went into effect on April 1, 2020.The
 annual cash rent payments under the MGP master lease for the sixth lease year, which commenced on April 1, 2021, increased to $843 million  from $828 million
, as a result of the fif th 2%  fixed annual rent escalator that went into effect on April 1, 2021.In
 October 2021, MGP acquired the real estate assets of MGM Springfield from the Company for $400 million of cash consideration, which was accountedfor
 as a transaction between entities under common control. The Company adjusted the carrying value of noncontrolling interests to adjust for its share of thedifference
 between the carrying value of the net assets transferred and the consideration received, with offsetting adjustments to capital in excess of par value.MGM
 Springfield  was added to the master lease between the Company and MGP. Following the closing of the transaction, the annual rent payment to MGPincreased from 
$843 million  to  $873 million, reflecting the addition of MGM Springfield, which increased the annual rent payment by $30 million, $27 million ofwhich
 will  be  fixed  and  contractually  grow  at  2%  per  year  with  escalators  subject  to  the  adjusted  net  revenue  to  rent  ratio,  as  further  described  above.  Finalregulatory
 approvals, which were not necessary for the transaction to close, are expected to be received within nine to twelve months following the close of thetransaction.
 Until final regulatory approvals are obtained, the parties will be subject to a trust agreement, which provides for the property to go into a trust (or, atthe Company’s option, be returned to the C
ompany) during the interim period in the event that the regulator finds reasonable cause to believe that MGP may not befound suitable. The property wil
l then remain in trust until a final determination regarding MGP’s suitability is made.Additionally, refer to Note 1 
for discussion relating to the waiver agreement with MGP and the Operating Partnership units redeemed in 2020 thereunder.All
 intercompany transactions, including transactions under the MGP master lease, have been eliminated in the Company’s consolidation of MGP. Thepublic ownership of MGP’s Class A shares is recogn
ized as noncontrolling interests in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.As
 further described in Note 1, in August 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with VICI and MGP whereby VICI will acquire MGP in a stock-for-stock
 transaction. As part of the transaction, the Company will enter into an amended and restated master lease with VICI. The transaction is expected to closein
 the first half of 2022, subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory approvals, and approval by VICI stockholders (which was obtained on October 29,2021).

    3.2 Vesting at Termination . Upon termination of employment with the Employer for any reason the unvested portion of the Restricted Stock Units shall be forfeited without any consideration; 
provided , however, that, (i) upon termination of employment by the Employer without Employer’s Good Cause or by the Participant with Participant’s Good Cause, the Restricted Stock Units that
would have become vested (but for such termination) under the schedule determined in Section 3.1 herein during the twelve (12)
months from the date of termination of employment shall remain outstanding and be paid on the same schedule determined in
Section 3.1 herein, (ii) upon termination of employment due to the Participant’s Retirement, so long as the date of termination is at

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if Participant qualifies at the time of termination of employment for both a
termination of employment due to Retirement (determined without regard to the 90-day notice requirement) and a termination by the
Employer without Employer’s Good Cause, Participant shall be permitted to designate whether Participant’s employment is due to
Participant’s Retirement or by the Employer without Employer’s Good Cause.
    3.3 
Committee Discretion . The Committee, in its discretion, may accelerate the vesting of the balance, or some lesser portion, of the Participant’s unvested Restricted Stock Units at any time, subject to the terms of the Plan and this Agreement. If so
accelerated, the Restricted Stock Units will be considered as having vested as of the date specified by the Committee or an
applicable written agreement but the Committee will have no right to accelerate any payment under this Agreement if such
acceleration would cause this Agreement to fail to comply with Section 409A.

        (ii)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Restricted Stock Unit shall accrue dividend equivalents with respect to
dividends that would otherwise be paid on the Stock underlying such Restricted Stock Unit during the period from the date of grant
to the date such Stock is delivered. 
Any such dividend equivalent shall be deemed reinvested in additional full and fractional Restricted Stock Units immediately upon the related dividend’s payment date, based on the then-current Fair Market Value, and
shall be subject to the same vesting, settlement and other conditions applicable to the Restricted Stock Unit on which such dividend
equivalent is paid. 
Any fractional shares shall be paid in cash upon the vesting of such Restricted Share Units.     3.5 
Limits on Transferability . The Restricted Stock Units granted under this Agreement may be transferred solely to a trust in which the Participant or the Participant’s spouse control the management of the assets. With respect to Restricted Stock Units, if
any, that have been transferred to a trust, references in this Agreement to vesting related to such Restricted Stock Units shall be
deemed to include such trust. Any transfer of Restricted Stock Units shall be
21

subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement and the transferee shall be subject to the same terms andconditions as if it were the Participant. No interest of the Participant under this Agreement shall be subject to attachment, execution,
garnishment, sequestration, the laws of bankruptcy or any other legal or equitable process.
    3.6 
Adjustments . If there is any change in the Stock by reason of any stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, combination or exchange of shares of Stock, or any similar change affecting the Stock the
Committee will make appropriate and proportionate adjustments (including relating to the Stock, other securities, cash or other
consideration which may be acquired upon vesting of the Restricted Stock Units) that it deems necessary to the number and class of
securities subject to the Restricted Stock Units and any other terms of this Agreement. Any adjustment so made shall be final and
binding upon the Participant.
    3.7 
No Right to Continued Performance of Services . The grant of the Restricted Stock Units does not confer upon the Participant any right to continue to be employed by the Company or any of its affiliates (including, without limitation, any Parent or
Subsidiary) nor may it interfere in any way with the right of the Company or any of its affiliates (including, without limitation, any
Parent or Subsidiary) for which the Participant performs services to terminate the Participant’s employment at any time.
    3.8 
Compliance With Law and Regulations . The grant and vesting of Restricted Stock Units and the obligation of the Company to issue shares of Stock under this Agreement are subject to all applicable federal and state laws, rules and regulations,
including those related to disclosure of financial and other information to the Participant and to approvals by any government or
regulatory agency as may be required. The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any certificates for shares of Stock
prior to (A) the listing of such shares on any stock exchange on which the Stock may then be listed and (B) the completion of any
registration or qualification of such shares under any federal or state law, or any rule or regulation of any government body which
the Company shall, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable.
    3.9 
Corporate Transaction . Upon the occurrence of a reorganization, merger, consolidation, recapitalization, or similar transaction, unless otherwise specifically prohibited under applicable laws or by the applicable rules and regulations of any
governing governmental agencies or national securities exchanges, the Committee is authorized (but not obligated) to make
adjustments in the terms and conditions of the Restricted Stock Units, including without limitation the following (or any
combination thereof): (i) continuation or assumption of the Restricted Stock Units by the Company (if it is the surviving company or
corporation) or by the surviving company or corporation or its parent; (ii) substitution by the surviving company or corporation or its
parent of an award with substantially the same terms for the Restricted Stock Units; (iii) accelerated vesting with respect to the
Restricted Stock Units immediately prior to the occurrence of such event and payment to the Participant within thirty (30) days
thereafter; and (iv) cancellation of all or any portion of the Restricted Stock Units for fair value (in the form of cash or its equivalent
(e.g., by check), other property or any combination thereof) as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee and which value
may be zero (if the value of the underlying stock is zero), and payment to the Participant within thirty (30) days thereafter.
3.10 
Participant Covenants . The Participant acknowledges that, in the course of performing his or her responsibilities to the Employer, the Participant will form relationships and become acquainted with Confidential Information. The Participant
further acknowledges that such relationships and the Confidential Information are valuable to the Employer, and the restrictions on
his or her future employment contained in this Section 3.10, if any, are reasonably necessary in order for the Employer to remain
competitive in its various businesses. In
22

consideration of the benefits provided under this Agreement (including, but not limited to, the potential vesting continuation oracceleration under Section 3.2 hereof), and in recognition of the Employer’s heightened need for protection from abuse of
relationships formed or Confidential Information garnered during the Participant’s employment with the Employer, Participant
hereby agrees to the following covenants as a condition of receipt of the benefits provided under this Agreement:
(i)     
Non-Competition . During the entire Restrictive Period, the Participant shall not directly or indirectly be employed by, provide consultation or other services to, engage in, participate in or otherwise be connected in any way with any
“Competitor” in any capacity that is the same, substantially the same or similar to the position or capacity (irrespective of title or
department) as that held at any time during Participant’s employment with the Company. During the entire Vesting Period, if the
Participant directly or indirectly becomes employed by, provides consultation or other services to, engages in, participates in or
otherwise becomes connected in any way with any “Competitor”, the continued vesting provided for under Section 3.2 of this
Agreement will immediately terminate and all of such Participant’s then outstanding Restricted Stock Units will immediately
terminate and be forfeited as of the date Participant becomes employed by or otherwise associated in any way with a Competitor.
(ii)    
Non-Solicitation . In addition, during the Restrictive Period under this Section 3.10: (A) the Participantwill not call on, solicit, induce to leave and/or take away, or attempt to call on, solicit, induce to leave and/or take away, any
Business Contacts of Employer, and (B) the Participant will not approach, solicit, contract with or hire any current Business Contacts
of Employer or entice any Business Contact to cease his/her/its relationship with Employer or end his/her employment with
Employer, without the prior written consent of Company, in each and every instance, such consent to be within Company’s sole and
absolute discretion. During the entire Vesting Period, if the Participant (x) calls on, solicits, induces to leave and/or takes away, or
attempts to call on, solicit, induce to leave and/or take away, any Business Contacts of Employer or (y) approaches, solicits,
contracts with or hires any current Business Contacts of Employer or entices any Business Contact to cease his/her/its relationship
with Employer or end his/her employment with Employer, without the prior written consent of Company, the continued vesting
provided for under Section 3.2 of this Agreement will immediately terminate and all of such Participant’s then outstanding
Restricted Stock Units will immediately terminate and be forfeited as of the date of such action.
(iii)    
Non-Disclosure and Confidentiality . The Participant will not make known to any Competitor and/or anymember, manager, officer, director, employee or agent of a Competitor, the Business Contacts of Employer. 
The Participant further covenants and agrees that at all times during Participant’s employment with the Company, and at all times thereafter, Participant
shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer or General Counsel in each and every instance
—such consent to be within the Company’s sole and absolute discretion—use, disclose or make known to any person, entity or other
third party outside of the Employer any Confidential Information belonging to Employer or its individual members. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to Confidential Information: (A) that is required to be disclosed by law
or by any court, arbitrator, mediator or administrative or legislative body (including any committee thereof) in any litigation,
arbitration, mediation or legislative hearing, with jurisdiction to order Participant to disclose or make accessible any information,
provided, however, that Participant provides Company with ten (10) days’ advance written notice of such disclosure to enable
Company to seek a protective order or other relief to protect the confidentiality of such Confidential Information; (B) that becomes
generally known to the public or within the relevant trade or industry other than due to Participant’s or any third party’s violation of
this Section 3.10 or other obligation of confidentiality; or (C) that becomes available to Participant on a non-confidential basis from
a source that is legally entitled to disclose it to Participant.
23

(iv)    Forfeiture . It is a condition to the receipt of any benefits under this Agreement that, in the event of anybreach of the Participant’s obligations under this Section 3.10, the continued vesting provided for under Section 3.2 of this
Agreement will immediately terminate and all of the Participant’s then outstanding Restricted Stock Units will immediately
terminate and be forfeited as of the date the Company determines that such a breach has occurred.
Nothing contained in this Section 3.10 limits or otherwise prohibits the Participant from filing a charge or complaint with the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the
Securities and Exchange Commission or any other federal, state or local governmental agency or commission (“Government
Agencies”). Further, this Section 3.10 does not limit the Participant’s ability to communicate with any Government Agencies or
otherwise participate in any investigation or proceeding that may be conducted by any Government Agency, including providing
documents or other information (subject to the paragraph below), without notice to the Company. This Section 3.10 does not limit
the Participant’s right to receive an award for information provided to any Government Agencies.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.10 or otherwise, pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, the
Company hereby advises the Participant as follows: 
(A) an individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that (i) is made (a) in confidence to a Federal, State, or local government
official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (b) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected
violation of law; or (ii) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under
seal; and 
(B) an individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual (i) files
any document containing the trade secret under seal; and (ii) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.
The Participant agrees to notify the Company immediately of any other persons or entities for whom he or she works or provide
services within the Vesting Period (excluding occasional consulting services for a non-Competitor, and similar activities), and to
provide such information as the Company may reasonably request regarding such work or services during the Vesting Period within
a reasonable time following such request. If the Participant fails to provide such notice or information, which failure is not cured by
you within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof from the Company, any right to continued vesting under Section 3.2 shall
immediately cease. The Participant further agrees to promptly notify the Company, within the Vesting Period, of any contacts made
by any Competitor which concern or relate to an offer to employ the Participant or for the Participant to provide consulting or other
services during the Vesting Period.
4. 
Investment Representation. The Participant must, within five (5) days of demand by the Company furnish the Company an agreement satisfactory to the Company in which the Participant represents that the shares of Stock acquired upon vesting are being

of Stock so being issued with respect to limitations on transferability imposed by federal and/or state laws, and the Company will
have the right to issue “stop transfer” instructions to its transfer agent.

and to take such other action as may be necessary in the opinion of the Company to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such
withholding taxes, which may include, without limitation, reducing the number of shares otherwise distributable to the Participant by

Parent or Subsidiary as a result of the vesting or settlement or otherwise of the Restricted Stock Units.

provisions of this Agreement shall be construed in a manner consistent with the requirements for avoiding taxes or penalties under
Section 409A. If any provision of this Agreement or the Plan contravenes Section 409A or could cause the Participant to incur any
tax, interest or penalties under Section 409A, the Committee may, in its sole discretion and without the Participant’s consent, modify
such provision in order to comply with the requirements of Section 409A or to satisfy the conditions of any exception therefrom, or
otherwise to avoid the imposition of the additional income tax and interest under Section 409A, while maintaining, to the maximum

following a termination of employment unless such termination is also a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section
409A and, for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement, references to a “termination,” “termination of employment” or like
terms shall mean “separation from service.” If the Participant is deemed on the date of termination to be a “specified employee”
within the meaning of that term under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B), then with regard to any payment or the provision of any benefit
that is considered nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A payable on account of a “separation from service,” such
payment or benefit shall be made or provided at the date which is the earlier of (i) the expiration of the six (6)-month period
measured from the date of such “separation from service” of the Participant, and (ii) the date of the Participant’s death (the “
Delay Period
”). Upon the 26

expiration of the Delay Period, all payments and benefits delayed pursuant to this Section 19.2 (whether they would have otherwisebeen payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such delay) shall be paid or reimbursed on the first business day
following the expiration of the Delay Period to the Participant in a lump sum, and any remaining payments and benefits due under
this Agreement shall be paid or provided in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein.
    19.3 For purposes of Section 409A, the Participant’s right to receive any installment payments pursuant to this Agreement
shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate and distinct payments. Whenever a payment under this Agreement specifies a
payment period with reference to a number of days (
e.g. , “payment shall be made within thirty (30) days following the date oftermination”), the actual date of payment within the specified period shall be within the sole discretion of the Company.
20. 
CARES Act. Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Restricted Stock Units are subject to the terms of Section 27(CARES Act) of the Current Employment Agreement, which terms shall be incorporated herein by reference.

EXHIBIT AARBITRATION
This Exhibit A sets forth the methods for resolving disputes should any arise under the Agreement, and accordingly, this
Exhibit A shall be considered a part of the Agreement.
1.    Except for a claim by either Participant or the Company for injunctive relief where such would be otherwise authorized by law,
any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Agreement or the breach hereof including without limitation any claim
involving the interpretation or application of the Agreement or the Plan, shall be submitted to binding arbitration in accordance with
the employment arbitration rules then in effect of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service (“JAMS”), to the extent not
inconsistent with this paragraph. This Exhibit A covers any claim Participant might have against any officer, director, employee, or
agent of the Company, or any of the Company’s subsidiaries, divisions, and affiliates, and all successors and assigns of any of them.
The promises by the Company and Participant to arbitrate differences, rather than litigate them before courts or other bodies, provide
consideration for each other, in addition to other consideration provided under the Agreement.
2.    
Claims Subject to Arbitration. This Exhibit A contemplates mandatory arbitration to the fullest extent permitted by law. Only claims that are justiciable under applicable state or federal law are covered by this Exhibit A. Such claims include any and all alleged
violations of any state or federal law whether common law, statutory, arising under regulation or ordinance, or any other law,
brought by any current or former employees.
3.    
Non-Waiver of Substantive Rights. This Exhibit A does not waive any rights or remedies available under applicable statutes or common law. However, it does waive Participant’s right to pursue those rights and remedies in a judicial forum. By signing the
Agreement and the acknowledgment at the end of this Exhibit A, the undersigned Participant voluntarily agrees to arbitrate his or her
claims covered by this Exhibit A.
4.    
Time Limit to Pursue Arbitration; Initiation:  To ensure timely resolution of disputes, Participant and the Company must initiatearbitration within the statute of limitations (deadline for filing) provided for by applicable law pertaining to the claim. The failure to
initiate arbitration within this time limit will bar any such claim. The parties understand that the Company and Participant are
waiving any longer statutes of limitations that would otherwise apply, and any aggrieved party is encouraged to give written notice
of any claim as soon as possible after the event(s) in dispute so that arbitration of any differences may take place promptly. The
parties agree that the aggrieved party must, within the time frame provided by this Exhibit A, give written notice of a claim pursuant
to Section 7 of the Agreement. In the event such notice is to be provided to the Company, the Participant shall provide a copy of
such notice of a claim to the Company’s Executive Vice President and General Counsel. Written notice shall identify and describe
the nature of the claim, the supporting facts and the relief or remedy sought.
5.    
Selecting an Arbitrator:  This Exhibit A mandates Arbitration under the then current rules of the Judicial Arbitration andMediation Service (JAMS) regarding employment disputes. The arbitrator shall be either a retired judge or an attorney experienced
in employment law and licensed to practice in the state in which arbitration is convened. The parties shall select one arbitrator from
among a list of three qualified neutral arbitrators provided by JAMS. If the parties are unable to agree on the arbitrator, each party
shall strike one name and the remaining named arbitrator shall be selected.
6.    
Representation/Arbitration Rights and Procedures: 
        a.    Participant may be represented by an attorney of his/her choice at his/her own expense.    b.    The arbitrator shall apply the substantive law (and the law of remedies, if applicable) of Nevada (without regard to its
choice of law provisions) and/or federal law when applicable. In all cases, this Exhibit A shall provide for the broadest level of
arbitration of claims between the Company and Participant under Nevada or applicable federal law. The arbitrator is without
jurisdiction to apply any different substantive law or law of remedies.
    c.    The arbitrator shall have no authority to award non-economic damages or punitive damages except where such relief is
specifically authorized by an applicable state or federal statute or common law. In such a situation, the arbitrator shall specify in the
award the specific statute or other basis under which such relief is granted.
    d.    The applicable law with respect to privilege, including attorney-client privilege, work product, and offers to
compromise must be followed.
    e.    The parties shall have the right to conduct reasonable discovery, including written and oral (deposition) discovery and
to subpoena and/or request copies of records, documents and other relevant discoverable information consistent with the procedural
rules of JAMS. The arbitrator shall decide disputes regarding the scope of discovery and shall have authority to regulate the conduct
of any hearing and/or trial proceeding. The arbitrator shall have the right to entertain a motion to dismiss and/or motion for summary
judgment.
    f.    The parties shall exchange witness lists at least 30 days prior to the trial/hearing procedure. The arbitrator shall have
subpoena power so that either Participant or the Company may summon witnesses. The arbitrator shall use the Federal Rules of
Evidence. Both parties have the right to file a post hearing brief. Any party, at its own expense, may arrange for and pay the cost of a
court reporter to provide a stenographic record of the proceedings.
    g.    Any arbitration hearing or proceeding shall take place in private, not open to the public, in Las Vegas, Nevada.
7.    
Arbitrator’s Award: The arbitrator shall issue a written decision containing the specific issues raised by the parties, the specific findings of fact, and the specific conclusions of law. The award shall be rendered promptly, typically within 30 days after conclusion
of the arbitration hearing, or the submission of post-hearing briefs if requested. The arbitrator may not award any relief or remedy in
excess of what a court could grant under applicable law. The arbitrator’s decision is final and binding on both parties. Judgment
upon an award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction.
        a.    Either party may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration under this Exhibit A
and to enforce an arbitration award.
        b.    In the event of any administrative or judicial action by any agency or third party to adjudicate a claim on behalf of
Participant which is subject to arbitration under this Exhibit A, Participant hereby waives the right to participate in any monetary or
other recovery obtained by such agency or third party in any such action, and Participant’s sole remedy with respect to any such
claim shall be any award decreed by an arbitrator pursuant to the provisions of this Exhibit A.
8.    
Fees and Expenses: The Company shall be responsible for paying any filing fee and the fees and costs of the arbitrator; provided, however, that if Participant is the party initiating the claim, Participant will contribute an amount equal to the filing fee to
initiate a claim in the court
30

of general jurisdiction in the state in which Participant is (or was last) employed by the Company. Participant and the Company shalleach pay for their own expenses, attorney’s fees (a party’s responsibility for his/her/its own attorney’s fees is only limited by any
applicable statute specifically providing that attorney’s fees may be awarded as a remedy), and costs and fees regarding witness,
photocopying and other preparation expenses. If any party prevails on a statutory claim that affords the prevailing party attorney’s
fees and costs, or if there is a written agreement providing for attorney’s fees and/or costs, the arbitrator may award reasonable
attorney’s fees and/or costs to the prevailing party, applying the same standards a court would apply under the law applicable to the
claim(s).
9.    The arbitration provisions of this Exhibit A shall survive the termination of Participant’s employment with the Company and the
expiration of the Agreement. These arbitration provisions can only be modified or revoked in a writing signed by both parties and
which expressly states an intent to modify or revoke the provisions of this Exhibit A.

Scope of the Arbitration Agreement: Claims Covered and Not Covered .  
   1.    Except as otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement, Employee and Employer agree to resolve through final andbinding

 that Employee or Employer may have against each other. Claims  covered by the Arbitration Agreement include, but arenot limited to,
 those arising out of or relating to Employee’s obligations under the Employment Agreement, dated as of the EffectiveDate, by and
 between Employee and Employer (“employment Agreement”), as well as those arising out of or relating to Employee’sapplication
 for  employment,  the  employment  relationship,  and  Employee’s  separation  from  employment;  Title  VII  of  the  CivilRights
 Act of 1964 (as amended); the Fair Labor Standards Act; the Equal Pay Act; the Family and Medical Leave Act; the AgeDiscrimination
 in  Employment  Act;  the  Genetic  Information  and  Nondisclosure  Act;  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act;  theEmployee
 Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”); the Fair Credit Reporting Act; Sections 1981 through 1988 of Title42

 common  law;  or  any  claim  for  damages,  costs,  fees,  or  other  expenses  or  legal  or  equitable  relief,  including  attorneys’  fees.Moreover,
 and notwithstanding anything to the contrary below, it is the Parties’ clear and unmistakable intent that all Claims beresolved
 through binding arbitration to the fullest extent permitted by federal law (and state law that is not preempted by federallaw), not an administrative proceeding or court.
 
   2.    Certain claims are not covered by this Arbitration Agreement: (i) claims for workers' compensation benefits; (ii) claims forunemployment
 compensation  benefits;  (iii)  claims  which  by  federal  law  may  not  be  subject  to  mandatory  binding  pre-disputearbitration,

   3.    Notwithstanding the parties’ agreement to be bound by this Arbitration Agreement, Employee understands and agrees thatfailure
 to abide by Employee’s promises under the Employment Agreement would impair Employer’s essential ongoing businessplans
 and  financial  arrangements  and  would  cause  Employer  irreparable  harm. As  such,  Employee  understands  and  agrees  thatEmployer
 may apply to a court  of competent  jurisdiction  for temporary,  preliminary,  or emergency  injunctive  relief in the eventEmployer
 believes  in  good  faith  that  Employee  has  breached  such  promises.  This  Arbitration  Agreement  also  does  not  prohibitEmployee
 or  the  Employer  from  filing  a  motion  in  court  to  compel  arbitration. This  Arbitration  Agreement  does  not  prohibitEmployee
 from  filing  administrative  charges  with  a  federal,  state,  or  local  administrative  agency  such  as  the  National  LaborRelations
 Board  (NLRB),  Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Commission  (EEOC),  or  Securities  Exchange  Commission,  nor  doesanything
 in this Arbitration Agreement preclude, prohibit, or otherwise limit, in any way, Employee’s rights and abilities to contact,communicate with, report matters to, or otherwise participate in any whistleblower program administered by any such agencies.

Class/Collective Action Waiver . Except
 where  prohibited  by  federal  law,  covered  claims  must  be  brought  on  an  individual  basis  only. The  parties  agree  that  bysigning
 this Arbitration Agreement, they waive their right to commence, or be a party to, any class, collective, representative, ormulti-plaintiff
 claims. The  parties agree any claim can be pursued, but only on an individual basis, except the lack of co-plaintiffsshall
 not, in and of itself, be a bar to pursuit of a pattern and practice claim. Any  disputes concerning  the validity of this multi-plaintiff, class, collective,
 and representative action waiver will be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction, not by the arbitrator.In
 the event a court determines that this waiver is unenforceable with respect to any claim or portion of a claim, this waiver shall notapply to that claim or portion of the claim, which may then only proceed in court as the exclusive forum.
C.     
Authority to Determine Arbitrability . Except
 as  expressly  provided  for  above,  the  arbitrator  shall  have  the  exclusive  authority  to  resolve  any  dispute  relating  to  theenforceability
 or  formation  of  this  Arbitration  Agreement  (including  all  defenses  to  contract  enforcement  such  as,  for  example,waiver
 and unconscionability) or the arbitrability of any claim. Enforcement of  this Arbitration Agreement may not be precluded onthe
 grounds that (1) a party to this Arbitration Agreement is also a party to a pending court action or special proceeding with a thirdparty
 arising  out  of  the  same  transaction  or  series  of  related  transactions,  or  (2)  a  party  to  this  Arbitration  Agreement  assertsarbitrable and non-arbitrable claims

 Arbitration Agreement conflict with the JAMS Rules or any other rules of JAMS, this Arbitration Agreement shallprevail. 
The  parties may agree upon an individual arbitrator to hear the case or follow the JAMS Rules relating to selection of anarbitrator. 
The  arbitrator shall have the power to award any type of legal or equitable relief on an individual basis that would beavailable
 in a court of competent jurisdiction including, but not limited to, costs (except as provided for in Section E.3 below) andattorneys’
 fees, to the extent available under applicable law. The  arbitrator must issue a written award and decision. Any  arbitralaward may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction, as permitted by and in accordance with the FAA.

    The party initiating an arbitration must submit a written demand for arbitration to JAMS within the statute of limitationsapplicable
 to the claims asserted in the demand for arbitration. Any  claim for arbitration will be timely only if brought within thestatute
 of limitations applicable to the claim or claims in the demand. Within  the same time frame, the party initiating the arbitrationalso
 should send a copy of the demand for arbitration to the other party. Employer  will send demands for arbitration to Employee atthe address the Employer has on file for Employee.

    Employer agrees to bear JAMS filing fees and administrative costs, as well as the cost of the arbitrator, including thearbitrator’s
 travel  expenses,  if  any,  and  will  reimburse  Employee  for  any  fees  Employee  may  be  required  to  pay  for  filing  thedemand
 for arbitration. The  parties each shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs (if any) relating to any arbitration proceedingitself,
 except as part of any remedy that may be awarded, the arbitrator shall have the authority to award the parties his, her, or itsattorneys’ fees and costs where required or permitted by law or by operation of law pursuant to an offer of judgment.
4.
    The arbitration will take place in the city and state in which Employee is employed or was last employed by Employer.In
 adjudicating the claim(s), the arbitrator shall apply the substantive laws of the state in which Employee is employed or was lastemployed
 by Employer or the state in which the claim(s) arose. Each  party shall have the right to conduct discovery adequate tofully and fairly present the claims and defenses consistent with the streamlined nature of arbitration.
5.
    If for whatever reason JAMS declines to act as the neutral, the parties shall utilize NAM (www.namadr.com) as theneutral for
 the arbitration/appeal and shall utilize its Rules for Resolution of Employment Disputes. Each party agrees that  it has hadan opportunity to review the current JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules.
E.    
Consideration For This Arbitration Agreement . The Parties agree
 that new or continued employment, the Employer’s agreement to pay all fees and costs including JAMS filing feesand
 administrative  costs,  as  well  as  the  cost  of  the  arbitrator,  and  the  mutual  promises  to  arbitrate  the  claims  covered  by  thisArbitration Agreement serve as adequate consideration.

If any provision or portion of a provision is found to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, the provision or portion of the provisionshall
 be interpreted in a manner or modified to make it enforceable. If  that is not possible, it shall be severed, and the remainingportions

G.    
Other Provisions of this Arbitration Agreement . This Arbitration Agreement
 contains the complete agreement between the parties regarding the subjects covered in it and supersedesany
 prior  or  inconsistent  agreements  that  might  exist  between  Employee  and  Employer  as  to  the  subjects  addressed  herein. This Arbitration
 Agreement  can  be  modified  only  by  an  express  written  agreement  signed  by  Employee  and  an  authorized  LegalRepresentative for Employer. This Arbitration Agreement shall survive the termination of Employee’s employment.

Exhibit 99.1DESCRIPTION OF REGULAT
ION AND LICENSINGThe
 gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. Each of our casinos is subjectto
 extensive regulation under the laws and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it is located. These laws and regulations generally concern the responsibility,financial
 stability and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interest in the gaming operations. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction couldresult
 in  disciplinary  action  in  other  jurisdictions. Any  material  changes,  new  laws  or  regulations,  or  material  differences  in  interpretations  by  courts  orgovernmental authorit
ies could adversely affect our business and operating results.In
 addition to gaming regulations, our businesses are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations of the countries and states in which weoperate.
 These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, smoking, environmental matters,employment
 and immigration, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, land use, marketing and advertising, lending, privacy, telemarketing,regulations
 applicable  under  the  Office  of  Foreign  Asset  Control,  the  Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  and  the  various  reporting  and  anti-money  launderingregulations.
 Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Any materialchanges,
 new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our business and operatingresults.
Gaming Regulation Overview
In the jurisdictions in which we op
erate, gaming laws and regulations require, among other things:•
the prevention of unsavory or unsuitable persons from having direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity;•
the establishment and maintenance of responsible accounting practices and procedures;•
the maintenance of effective controls over the financial practices of licensees, including the establishment of minimum internal control procedures forinternal fiscal a
ffairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenues;•
reliable record keeping and the filing of periodic reports with our gaming regulators;•
the prevention of cheating and fraudulent practices;•
the qualification, licensing or registration of certain employees, vendors and other persons with a financial interest in or control or influence overgaming operations;
•
the payment of gaming taxes, licensing fees and other regulatory fees;•
maintenance of responsible gaming programs; and•
compliance with community benefits agreements in our host and surrounding communities, where applicable.Typically,
 regulatory environments in the jurisdictions in which we operate are established by legislation and are administered by a regulatory agency oragencies
 with  the  authority  to  interpret  their  gaming  enabling  legislation  and  regulations  promulgated  thereunder  and  have  broad  discretion  and  authority  toregulate
 the affairs of owners, managers, and persons with financial interests in gaming operations. Gaming regulators in the various jurisdictions in which weoperate, among other things:
•
adopt regulations under their gaming enabling legislation;•
investigate and enforce gaming laws and regulations;•
impose disciplinary sanctions for violations, including fines and penalties;•
review the character and fitness of participants in gaming operations and make determinations regarding their suitability or qualification for licensure;•
grant licenses for participation in gaming operations;•
collect and review reports and information submitted by participants in gaming operations;•
review and approve transactions, such as acquisitions or change-of-control transactions of gaming industry participants, securities offerings and debttransactions engaged in by such p
articipants; and•
establish and collect taxes and fees.
Any changes in the laws, regulations, and supervisory procedures of a gaming jurisdiction in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our businessand operating results.
Licensing, Suitability and Qualif
ication DeterminationsGaming laws and regulations require us,
 each of our subsidiaries engaged in gaming operations, certain of our directors, officers and employees, and in somecases, certain of our shareholders and holders of our debt securities, to obtain licenses or findin
gs of suitability or qualification from gaming regulators. Licenses or findings
 of suitability  or qualification  typically  require  a determination  that  the applicant  satisfies  specific  criteria  set forth in the applicable  gaming  laws andregulations. Gaming
 regulators have broad discretion in determining whether an applicant qualifies for licensing or should be deemed suitable or qualified. Subjectto
 certain administrative proceeding requirements, gaming regulators have the authority to deny any application or limit, condition, restrict, revoke or suspend anylicense,
 registration, finding of suitability, qualification or approval, or fine any person licensed, registered or found suitable or approved, for any cause deemedreasonable
 by  the  gaming  regulator.  The  criteria  used  in  determining  whether  to  grant  or  renew  a  license  or  finding  of  suitability  or  qualification  vary  fromjurisdiction-to-jur
isdiction but generally include such factors as:•
the good character, honesty and integrity of the applicant;•
the  financial  stability,  integrity  and  responsibility  of  the  applicant,  including  whether  the  gaming  operation  in  the  jurisdiction  is  adequatelycapitalized
 to pay winning wagers as and when due, meet ongoing operating expenses, pay all local, state and federal taxes as and when due, makenecessary
 capital and maintenance expenditures in a timely manner, and make all long-term and short-term debt payments and satisfy capital leaseobligations as and when due;
•
the quality of the applicant’s gaming facility and non-gaming amenities;•
the total amount of the investment in the applicant’s gaming facility and non-gaming amenities;•
the effect on competition and the general impact on the host and surrounding communities;•
the amount of revenue to be derived by the applicable jurisdiction through the operation of the applicant’s gaming facility; and•
the applicant’s practices with respect to minority and local hiring and training of its workforce.In evaluating individual 
applicants, gaming regulators consider, among other things, the individual’s good character, honesty and integrity, financial stability,criminal and financ
ial history, and the character of those with whom the individual associates.Many
 jurisdictions  limit  the  number  of  licenses  granted  to  operate  gaming  facilities  within  the  jurisdiction,  and  some  jurisdictions  limit  the  number  oflicenses
 granted to any one gaming operator. For  example, in Maryland, state law allows us to hold an interest in only one video lottery operation. Licenses undergaming
 laws are generally not transferable, although some jurisdictions permit a transfer with the prior approval of the jurisdiction’s gaming regulator(s). Licenses in
 many of the jurisdictions in which we conduct gaming operations are granted for limited durations and require renewal from time to time. There  can be noassurance that any of our l
icenses will be renewed.A
 gaming license is generally a revocable privilege. Many jurisdictions have statutory or regulatory provisions that govern the required action that may betaken
 in the event that a license is revoked or not renewed. For example, under New Jersey gaming laws, a conservator may be appointed by the New JerseyCasino
 Control Commission (“NJCCC”) to assume complete operational  control of the casino and the approved hotel facility  upon the revocation of a casinolicense,
 and the conservator may, at the direction of the NJCCC and after appropriate prior consultation with the former licensee as to the reasonableness of suchterms
 and  conditions,  endeavor  to  and  be  authorized  to  sell,  assign,  convey  or  otherwise  dispose  of  in  bulk,  subject  to  any  and  all  valid  liens,  claims,  andencumbrances, all the p
roperty of a former licensee relating to the casino and the approved hotel.In
 addition to us and our direct and indirect subsidiaries engaged in gaming operations, gaming regulators may investigate any individual or entity having amaterial
 relationship to, or material involvement with, any of these entities to determine whether such individual is suitable or should be licensed as a businessassociate
 of a gaming licensee. Certain jurisdictions require that any change in our directors or officers, including the directors or officers of our subsidiaries, mustbe
 approved by the requisite gaming regulator(s). Our officers, directors and certain key employees must also file applications with gaming regulators and may berequired
 to  be  licensed  or  be  found  suitable  or  qualified  in  many  jurisdictions.  Gaming  regulators  have  broad  discretion  to  deny  an  application  for  licensing.Qualification
 and suitability determinations require submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough background investigation.The
 applicant has the burden of demonstrating suitability or qualification for licensure, and the applicant ordinarily must pay all the costs of the investigation. Inaddition to a gaming regul
ator’s authority to deny an application2

for licensure or a finding of suitability or qualification, gaming regulators also generally have the authority to condition or limit licensure or a finding of suitabilityor qualification, or dis
approve of a change in an individual’s corporate position.If
 a  gaming  regulator  finds  that  an  officer,  director  or  key  employee  fails  to  qualify  or  is  unsuitable  for  licensing  or  unsuitable  to  continue  having  arelationship
 with  us,  we  would  ordinarily  have  to  sever  all  relationships  with  such  person.  In  addition,  gaming  regulators  may  require  us  to  terminate  theemployment of any person who refus
es to file appropriate applications.In many jurisdictions, any of ou
r shareholders or holders of our debt securities may be required to file an application, be investigated, and qualify or have his,her or its suitability
 determined. For example, under Nevada gaming laws, any beneficial holder of our voting securities, regardless of the number of shares owned,may
 be required to file an application, be investigated, and have his or her suitability as a beneficial holder of the voting securities determined if either the NevadaGaming
 Commission (the “NGC”) has reason to believe that such ownership would otherwise be inconsistent with the declared policies of the State of Nevada, orthe
 person  engages  in  certain  statutorily  proscribed  activities  which  influence  or  affect  the  affairs  of  a  holding  company  of  a  Nevada  gaming  licensee.  Theapplicant must pay all 
costs of investigation incurred by the NGC and the Nevada Gaming Control Board (“NGCB”) in conducting any such investigation.Furthermore,
 any person required by a gaming regulator to be found suitable, who is found unsuitable by the gaming regulator, shall not be able to holddirectly
 or indirectly the beneficial ownership of any voting security or the beneficial or record ownership of any nonvoting security or any debt security of anypublic
 corporation which is registered with the gaming regulator (or otherwise subject to a finding of suitability or qualification as holding company of a gaminglicensee),
 such as MGM Resorts International, beyond the time prescribed by the gaming regulator. A finding of unsuitability by a particular gaming regulatorimpacts
 that  person’s  ability  to  associate  or  affiliate  with  gaming  licensees  in  that  particular  jurisdiction  and  could  impact  the  person’s  ability  to  associate  oraffiliate with gaming licensees
 in other jurisdictions.Many
 jurisdictions  also  require  any  person  who  acquires  beneficial  ownership  of  more  than  a  certain  percentage  of  our  voting  securities  and,  in  somejurisdictions,
 our non-voting securities, typically 5%, to report the acquisition to gaming regulators, and gaming regulators may require such holders to apply forqualification
 or a finding of suitability. For example, Nevada gaming laws require any person who acquires more than 5% of any class of our voting securities toreport the acquisition 
to the NGC. Additionally, Nevada gaming laws require that beneficial owner s of more than 10% of any class of our voting securities apply tothe NGC for a finding of suitabili
ty within 30 days after the Chair of the NGCB mails the written notice requiring such filing.However,
 many jurisdictions permit an “institutional investor” to apply for a waiver that allows the “institutional investor” to acquire, in many cases, up to15%
 of our voting securities without applying for qualification or a finding of suitability. The gaming laws and regulations of a particular jurisdiction typicallydefine
 who may be considered an “institutional investor,” and typically provide particular categories of persons who may be considered such an investor, e.g., aretirement
 fund administered by a public agency for the exclusive benefit of federal, state, or local public employees; investment company registered under theInvestment
 Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. § 80a-1 et seq.); licensed life insurance company or property and casualty insurance company; banking and otherchartered or
 licensed lending institution; and investment advisor registered under The Investment Advisors Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. § 80b-1 et seq.). Additionally, aperson satisfying the
 applicable “institutional investor” definition must also generally have acquired and hold the securities in the ordinary course of business as aninstitutional
 investor, and not for the purpose of causing, directly or indirectly, the election of a majority of the members of our board of directors, any change inour
 corporate  charter,  bylaws,  management,  policies  or  operations,  or  those  of  any  of  our  gaming  affiliates,  or  the  taking  of  any  other  action  which  gamingregulators
 find to be inconsistent with holding our voting securities for investment purposes only. An application for a waiver as an institutional investor generallyrequires
 the submission of detailed information about the company and its regulatory filings, the name of each person that beneficially owns more than 5% of theinstitutional
 investor’s securities or other equivalent and a certification made under oath or penalty for perjury, that the securities were acquired and are held forinvestment
 purposes only. Even  if a waiver is granted, an institutional investor generally may not take any action inconsistent with its status when the waiver wasgranted
 without once again becoming subject to the foregoing reporting and application obligations. A  change in the investment intent of an institutional investormust be reported to cer
tain gaming regulators immediately if such investment intent changes.Generally,
 any person who beneficially owns our voting securities and fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or qualification within the timeprescribed
 by applicable law after being ordered to do so, or who refuses or fails to cooperate with any regulatory investigation or fails to pay the investigativecosts
 incurred in connection with investigation of its application, may be found unsuitable or not qualified. The same restrictions apply to a record owner if therecord
 owner,  after  request,  fails  to  identify  the  beneficial  owner.  Any  security  holder  found  unsuitable  and  who  holds,  directly  or  indirectly,  any  beneficialownership of our common stock beyond such period of time
 as may be prescribed by the applicable gaming regulators may be guilty of a criminal offense. We willbe
 subject to disciplinary action if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to be a shareholder or to have any other relationship with us or any of oursubsidiaries, we or any of our subsidi
aries:•
pay that person any dividend or interest upon any of our voting securities;•
allow that person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right conferred through securities held by that person;•
pay remuneration in any form to that person for services rendered or otherwise; or•
fail to pursue all lawful efforts to require such unsuitable person to relinquish his or her voting securities including if necessary, the immediate purchaseof the voting securities
 for cash at fair market value.3

Gaming regulators may, either as required by applicable law or in their discretion, also require the holder of any debt security to file an application, beinvestigated, and
 be found suitable or qualified to hold the debt security. In such cases, some jurisdictions permit the holder to seek an institutional investor waiverin accordance
 with applicable law. If a gaming regulator determines that a person is unsuitable or not qualified to own the debt security, the gaming regulator may,either
 as required by applicable law or in its discretion, limit the ability of the issuer to pay any dividend, interest, or any  other distribution whatsoever to theunsuitable or not qualifi
ed person.Many
 jurisdictions also require that manufacturers and distributors of gaming equipment and suppliers of certain goods and services to gaming industryparticipants
 be  registered  or  licensed  and  require  us  to  purchase  and  lease  gaming  equipment,  supplies  and  services  only  from  properly  registered  or  licensedsuppliers.
Additionally,
 the ability of a lender to foreclose on pledged assets, including gaming equipment, is subject to compliance with applicable gaming laws. Forexample,
 under  New  Jersey  gaming  laws,  generally,  no  person  is  permitted  to  hold  an  ownership  interest  in  or  manage  a  casino  or  own  any  gaming  assets,including
 gaming  devices, without being licensed.  Consequently, any lender  who desires to enforce  a security  interest  must file the necessary  applications  forlicensure,
 be investigated, and either be found qualified by the NJCCC or obtain interim casino authorization (“ICA”) prior to obtaining any ownership interest.Similarly, any prospective
 purchaser of an ownership interest in a casino or of gaming assets must file the necessary applications for licensure, be investigated, andeither found qualified by 
the NJCCC or obtain ICA prior to obtaining any ownership interest or gaming assets.Violations of Gaming Laws
If
 we or our subsidiaries violate applicable gaming laws or regulations, our gaming licenses could be limited, conditioned, suspended or revoked by gamingregulators,
 and we and any other persons involved could be subject to substantial fines. Additionally,  a trustee, conservator or other person can be appointed bygaming
 regulators to operate our gaming properties, or in some jurisdictions, take title to our gaming assets in the jurisdiction, and under certain circumstances,earnings
 generated during such appointment could be forfeited to the applicable jurisdictions, or even sell the gaming assets if the gaming license for that propertyis
 revoked  or  not  renewed.  Violations  of  gaming  laws  or  regulations  in  one  jurisdiction  could  result  in  disciplinary  action  in  other  jurisdictions. As  a result,violations by us of applicabl
e gaming laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, prospects and results of operations.Reporting and Recordkeeping Requiremen
tsWe are required
 periodically to submit detailed financial and operating reports and furnish any other information about us and our subsidiaries which gamingregulators may require. 
In some jurisdictions, regu lators have authority to compel the production of documents or inspect records maintained on the premises of thecasino.
 Under  federal  law,  we  are  required  to  record  and  submit  detailed  reports  of  currency  transactions  involving  greater  than  $10,000  at  our  casinos  andSuspicious
 Activity Reports if the facts presented so warrant. Some jurisdictions also require the maintenance of a log that records aggregate cash transactions inparticular
 amounts. We are required to maintain a current stock ledger which may be examined by gaming regulators at any time. We may also be required todisclose
 to gaming regulators upon request the identities of the holders of our equity, debt or other securities. If any securities are held in trust by an agent or by anominee,
 the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to gaming regulators. Failure to make such disclosure may be groundsfor
 finding the record holder unsuitable. Gaming regulators may also require certificates for our stock or that of one or more of our subsidiaries to bear a legendindicating
 that the securities  are subject to specified  gaming laws or transfer restrictions.  In certain  jurisdictions, gaming regulators have the power to imposeadditional restric
tions on the holders of our securities at any time.Review and Approval of Transactions
Substantially
 all material loans, leases, sales of securities and similar financing transactions by us and our subsidiaries must be reported to, or approved by,gaming
 regulators. Neither we nor any of our subsidiaries may make a public offering of securities without the prior approval of certain gaming regulators if thesecurities or
 the proceeds therefrom are intended to be used to construct, acquire or finance gaming facilities in such jurisdictions, or to retire or extend obligationsincurred
 for such purposes. Such approval, if given, does not constitute a recommendation or approval of the investment merits of the securities subject to theoffering. Changes
 in control through merger, consolidation, stock or asset acquisitions, management or consulting agreements, or otherwise, require prior approvalof
 gaming regulators in certain jurisdictions. Entities seeking to acquire control of us or one of our subsidiaries must satisfy gaming regulators with respect to avariety of stringent standards prior
 to assuming control. Gaming regulators may also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors and other persons having amaterial
 relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control to be investigated and licensed as part of the approval process relating to thetransaction.
Certain
 gaming  laws  and  regulations  in  jurisdictions  we  operate  in  establish  that  certain  corporate  acquisitions  opposed  by  management,  repurchases  ofvoting
 securities and corporate defensive tactics affecting us or our subsidiaries may be injurious to stable and productive corporate gaming, and as a result, priorapproval
 may be required before we may make exceptional repurchases of voting securities (such as repurchases which treat holders differently) above the currentmarket
 price and before a corporate acquisition opposed by management can be consummated. In certain jurisdictions, the gaming regulators also require priorapproval of a plan of rec
apitalization proposed by the board of directors of a publicly traded corporation which is registered with the gaming4

authority in response to a tender offer made directly to the registered corporation’s stockholders for the purpose of acquiring control of the registered corporation.Because
 licenses under gaming laws are generally not transferable, we may not grant a security interest in our gaming licenses, and our ability to grant asecurity interest in any of our gaming assets is limited and may be subject to receipt of prior appro
val from gaming regulators. A pledge of the stock or other equityinterest
 in a subsidiary holding a gaming license and the foreclosure of such a pledge may be ineffective without the prior approval of gaming regulators in certainjurisdictions.
 Moreover, our subsidiaries holding gaming licenses may be unable to guarantee a security issued by an affiliated or parent company pursuant to apublic
 offering, or pledge their assets to secure payment of the obligations evidenced by the security issued by an affiliated or parent company, without the priorapproval of certain ga
ming regulators.Some
 jurisdictions  also  require  us  to  file  a  report  or  notice  with  the  gaming  regulator  within  a  prescribed  period  of  time  following  certain  financialtransactions
 or the transfer or offering of certain securities. Were they to deem it appropriate, certain gaming regulators reserve the right to order such transactionsrescinded.
Certain
 jurisdictions require the establishment of a compliance committee with one or more independent members and the implementation of a compliancereview
 and reporting system or plan created for the purpose of monitoring activities related to our continuing qualification. These plans generally require periodicreports to senior manage
ment of our company and to our gaming regulators.Certain jurisdictions req
uire that an independent audit committee oversee the functions of surveillance and internal audit departments at our casinos.License Fees and Gaming Taxes
We pay substantial license
 fees, contributions to responsible gaming programs, and taxes in many jurisdictions, including the counties, cities, and any relatedagencies,
 boards, commissions, or authorities, in which our operations are conducted, in connection with our casino gaming operations, computed in various waysdepending
 on the type of gaming or activity involved. Depending upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable either daily, monthly,quarterly or annually. Li
cense fees and taxes are based upon such factors as:•    a percentage of the gross 
revenues received;•    the number of gaming devic
es and table games operated; and•    the particular county 
in which the casino is located.A live entertainment tax is also paid in certain jurisdictions by casino operations where entertainment is fur
nished in connection with the selling or serving offood or refreshments or th
e selling of merchandise. The tax rates applicable to our business and operations are subject to change.Operational Requirements
In
 many jurisdictions, we are subject to certain requirements and restrictions on how we must conduct our gaming operations. In some jurisdictions, we arerequired
 to  make  a  good  faith  effort  to procure  goods  and  services  from  local  suppliers  and  minority-owned,  women-owned  and veteran-owned  businesses  inconnection with our construct
ion projects.Some jurisdictions
 also require us to make a good faith effort to meet workforce diversity and local labor participation goals in our operations and to procuregoods and services from loca
l suppliers and minority-owned, women-owned and veteran-owned businesses.Some
 of our gaming operations are subject to hours of operations restrictions. Additionally, some of our operations are subject to restrictions on the numberof gaming positions we may have.
In
 1994, the Mississippi Gaming Commission adopted a regulation requiring as a condition of licensure or license renewal that a gaming establishment’splan
 include a 500-car parking facility in close proximity to the casino complex and infrastructure facilities which will amount to at least 25% of the casino cost.Amendments to
 the Mississippi gaming regulations impose additional non-gaming infrastructure requirements on new casino projects in Mississippi. To the extentapplicable, our Mississippi 
casinos are in compliance with these regulations.Racetracks
We
 operate Yonkers Raceway, a standardbred harness racing track, and Empire City Casino, a video lottery gaming operation, in Yonkers, New York. Theoperations
 are regulated by the New York State Gaming Commission. We also operate Northfield Park, a standardbred harness racing track, and MGM NorthfieldPark,
 a  video  lottery  gaming  operation,  in  Northfield,  Ohio.  The  racing  operations  are  regulated  by  the  Ohio  State  Racing  Commission,  and  the  video  lotterygaming
 operations are regulated by the Ohio Lottery Commission. In addition to laws and regulations affecting the video lottery operations at these tracks, thereexist extensive laws and regu
lations governing the operation of racetracks, the horse races that are run at those tracks, and pari-mutuel wagering5

conducted at the tracks. Regulation of horse racing is typically administered separately from our other gaming operations, with separate licenses and license feestructures. 
Racing regulations may limit  or dictate the number of days on which races may be or must be held. Additionally, in both New York and Ohio, the videolottery operations ar
e contingent upon us holding a valid license to hold live horse racing meets at each racing track.Online Gaming and Sports Betting
In
 2013,  Nevada  legalized  real  money  online  poker  within  the  State.  The  NGC  then  adopted  regulations  and  established  licensing  requirements  for  theoperation
 of real money online poker within the State. In  2013, New Jersey also legalized real money online casino gaming within the State. The New JerseyDivision
 of  Gaming  Enforcement  (“NJDGE”)  then  adopted  regulations  and  established  licensing  requirements  for  the  operation  of  real  money  online  casinogaming
 in the State. Marina District Development Company, LLC (“MDDC”), our New Jersey subsidiary that operates Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa in AtlanticCity, has been issued an Interne
t Gaming Permit for real money online gaming in New Jersey.In
 2017,  Mississippi  legalized  on-premises  sports  betting  at  licensed  casinos  subject  to  the  prior  approval  of  the  Executive  Director  of  the  MississippiGaming
 Commission (“MGC”). In June 2018, the MGC adopted regulations for the operation of sports books at licensed casinos in Mississippi. The regulationsalso
 permit  mobile  betting  if  the  player  is  physically  located  within  a  casino  and  hotel  facility  approved  by  the  Executive  Director.  In  July  2018,  our  twoMississippi
 operating subsidiaries, Beau Rivage Resorts, LLC and MGM Resorts Mississippi, LLC, obtained approval from the Executive Director to offer sportsbetting at their resp
ective casino properties, and their respective sports books began operations on August 1, 2018.In
 2018, New Jersey legalized on-premises and online sports betting conducted by licensed casinos and existing and certain former horse race tracks. Theregulation
 of sports betting in New Jersey is similar to the manner in which the NJDGE regulates online casino gaming and casinos. The NJDGE regulates thetypes
 of wagers that may be placed, but in-play wagering may be permitted. However, wagering on certain events, such as collegiate events in which New Jerseycolleges
 participate, is prohibited. A casino licensed to offer online sports betting currently may offer no more than three individually branded websites. MDDChas been issued a Sports Wagering L
icense for on-premises sports betting at Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa and online sports betting in New Jersey.In
 2019, Michigan legalized real money online casino gaming and online sports betting for commercial and Indian casinos within the State. On-premisessports
 betting commenced on March 11, 2020 under regulations promulgated by the Michigan Gaming Control Board. Online sports betting and casino gamingcommenced on January 22, 2021.
The
 gaming  and  other  laws  and  regulations  to  which  we  are  subject  could  change  or  could  be  interpreted  differently  in  the  future,  or  new  laws  andregulations
 could be enacted. Any such material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authoritiescould
 adversely affect our business and operating results. For  example, in 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) reversed its previously-issued opinionpublished
 in 2011, which stated that interstate transmissions of wire communications that do not relate to a “sporting event or contest” fall outside the purview ofthe
 Wire Act of 1961 (“Wire Act”). The DOJ’s updated opinion concluded instead that the Wire Act was not uniformly limited to gaming relating to sportingevents or contests
 and that certain of its provisions apply to non-sports-related wagering activity. In June 2019, a federal district court in New Hampshire ruled thatthe
 DOJ’s new interpretation of the Wire Act was erroneous and vacated the DOJ’s new opinion. The DOJ appealed the decision of the district court to the U.S.Court
 of Appeals for the First Circuit. In January 2021, the Court of Appeals largely affirmed the district court’s decision finding that the Wire Act applies only tointerstate wire com
munications related to “sporting events or contests”.Macau S.A.R. Laws and Regulations

 is equal to or higher than 5% of the share capital in MGM Grand Paradise. Under the subconcession contract, this approval requirement does not apply tosecurities
 that  are  listed  and  tradable  on  a  stock  market.  Since  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  securities  are  not  listed  and  tradable  on  a  stock  market  this  approvalrequirement

MGM
 Macau and MGM Cotai were constructed and are operated under MGM Grand Paradise’s subconcession contract. This subconcession excludes thefollowing
 gaming activities: mutual bets, gaming activities provided to the public, interactive gaming and games of chance or other gaming, betting or gamblingactivities
 on  ships  or  planes.  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  subconcession  is  exclusively  governed  by  Macau  law.  MGM  Grand  Paradise  is  subject  to  the  exclusivejurisdiction of the cour
ts of Macau in case of any potential dispute or conflict relating to our subconcession.MGM
 Grand Paradise’s subconcession contract expires on June 26, 2022. Unless the subconcession is extended, on that date, the casino area premises andgaming
 related equipment subject to reversion in MGM Macau and MGM Cotai will automatically be transferred to the Macau government without compensationto
 MGM Grand Paradise and MGM Resorts International will cease to generate any revenues from these operations. Beginning on April 20, 2017, the Macaugovernment may redeem 
the subconcession by giving MGM Grand Paradise at least one year prior notice and by paying fair compensation or indemnity.The
 amount of such compensation or indemnity will be determined based on the amount of gaming and non-gaming revenue generated by MGM GrandParadise,
 excluding  the  convention  and  exhibition  facilities,  during  the  taxable  year  prior  to  the  redemption,  before  deducting  interest,  depreciation  andamortization, mult
iplied by the number of remaining years before expiration of the subconcession.The
 Macau government also has the right to unilaterally terminate, without compensation to MGM Grand Paradise, the subconcession at any time upon theoccurrence
 of  fundamental  non-compliance  by  MGM  Grand  Paradise  with  applicable  Macau  laws  or  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  basic  obligations  under  thesubconcession contract. If 
the default is curable, the Macau gaming authorities are required to give MGM Grand Paradise prior notice to cure the default, though nospecific cure period 
for that purpose is provided.Under
 the subconcession, MGM Grand Paradise Limited is obligated to pay to the Macau S.A.R. an annual premium with a fixed portion and a variableportion
 based on the number and type of gaming tables employed and gaming machines operated. The fixed portion of the premium is equal to 30 million patacas(approximately
 $3.7  million,  based  on  exchange  rates  at  December  31,  2021).  The  variable  portion  is  equal  to  300,000  patacas  per  gaming  table  reservedexclusively for cert
ain kinds of games or players, 150,000 patacas per gaming table not so reserved and 1,000 patacas per electrical or mechanical gaming machine,including
 slot machines (approximately $37,364, $18,682 and $125, respectively, based on exchange rates at December 31, 2021), subject to a minimum of forty-five
 million patacas (approximately $5.6 million, based on exchange rates at December 31, 2021). MGM Grand Paradise Limited also has to pay a special gamingtax

ross gaming revenue to a public foundation designated by the Macau S.A.R. government and to the Macau S.A.R, respectively, as speciallevy.
Currently,
 the gaming tax in Macau is calculated as a percentage of gross gaming revenue. However, gross gaming revenue does not include deductions forcredit
 losses. As a result, if MGM Grand Paradise issues markers to its customers in Macau and is unable to collect on the related receivables from them, it has topay taxes on its winnings from thes
e customers even though it was unable to collect the related receivables.MGM
 Grand Paradise has received from the Macau government a concession to use a 10.67 acre parcel of land for MGM Macau (the “MGM Macau LandContract”),
 and a concession to use an approximately 17.75 acre site parcel of land for MGM Cotai (the “MGM Cotai Land Contract”). The land concessions willexpire
 on April 6, 2031 and on January  8, 2038, respectively, and  are renewable. MGM Grand Paradise is obligated to pay rent annually for the term of the MGMMacau
 Land  Contract  and  of  the  MGM  Cotai  Land  Contract.  The  rent  amounts  may  be  revised  every  five  years  by  the  Macau  government,  according  to  theprovisions of the Macau Land law.
MGM
 Grand Paradise received an exemption from Macau’s corporate income tax on profits generated by the operation of casino games of chance for aperiod
 of five-years starting at January 1, 2007. In October 2011, MGM Grand Paradise was granted an extension of this exemption for an additional five years.The
