NOTE 1—OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
OVERVIEW AND ORGANIZATION
PayPal Holdings, Inc. (“PayPal,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) was incorporated in Delaware in January 2015 and is a leading technology platform
that enables digital payments and simplifies commerce experiences on behalf of merchants and consumers worldwide. PayPal is committed to democratizing
financial services to help improve the financial health of individuals and to increase economic opportunity for entrepreneurs and businesses of all sizes around
the world. Our goal is to enable our merchants and consumers to manage and move their money anywhere in the world in the markets we serve, anytime, on
any platform, and using any device when sending payments or getting paid, including person-to-person payments.
We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened focus by regulators globally on all aspects of the payments
industry, including countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. The laws and regulations applicable
to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital payments, continue to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation.
New or changing laws and regulations, including changes to their interpretation and implementation, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions
related to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We monitor these areas closely
and are focused on designing compliant solutions for our customers.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of presentation and principles of consolidation
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of PayPal and our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries.
All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Investments in entities where we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee are accounted for using the equity method
of accounting. For such investments, our share of the investee’s results of operations is included in other income (expense), net on our condensed consolidated
statements of income (loss). Investments in entities where we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee are accounted for at fair
value or cost minus impairment, if any, adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes, which are included in other income (expense), net on our
condensed consolidated statements of income (loss). Our investment balance is included in long-term investments on our condensed consolidated balance
sheets.
We determine at the inception of each investment, and re-evaluate if certain events occur, whether an entity in which we have made an investment is considered
a variable interest entity (“VIE”). If we determine an investment is in a VIE, we then assess if we are the primary beneficiary, which would require
consolidation. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, no VIEs qualified for consolidation as the structures of these entities do not provide us with the
ability to direct activities that would significantly impact their economic performance. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the carrying value of our
investments in nonconsolidated VIEs was $146 million and $128 million, respectively, and is included as non-marketable equity securities applying the equity
method of accounting in long-term investments on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Our maximum exposure to loss related to our nonconsolidated
VIEs, which represents funded commitments and any future funding commitments, was $233 million and $232 million as of June 30, 2023 and December 31,
2022, respectively.
These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements
and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”) filed with the United
States (“U.S.”) Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 10, 2023.
In the opinion of management, these condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments,
which are necessary for a fair statement of the condensed consolidated financial statements for all interim periods presented. Certain amounts for prior periods
have been reclassified to conform to the financial statement presentation as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023.

Reclassifications
Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2022, we reclassified certain cash flows related to our collateral security arrangements for derivative instruments from
cash flows from operating activities to cash flows from investing activities and cash flows from financing activities within the condensed consolidated
statements of cash flows. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
The current period presentation classifies all changes in collateral posted and collateral received related to derivative instruments on our condensed
consolidated statements of cash flows as cash flows from investing activities and cash flows from financing activities, respectively. We believe that the current
period presentation provides a more meaningful representation of the nature of the cash flows and allows for greater transparency as the cash flows related to
the derivatives impact operating cash flows upon settlement exclusive of the offsetting cash flows from collateral.
The following table presents the effects of the changes on the presentation of these cash flows to the previously reported condensed consolidated statements of
cash flows:
Six Months Ended June 30, 2022

 Financial statement line impacted in operating activities was “Other assets and liabilities.”
Financial statement line impacted in investing activities was “Collateral posted related to derivative instruments, net.”
Financial statement line impacted in financing activities was “Collateral received related to derivative instruments, net.”
Use of estimates
The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis,
we evaluate our estimates, including those related to provisions for transaction and credit losses, income taxes, loss contingencies, revenue recognition, the
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, and the valuation of strategic investments. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other
assumptions which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates.
Loans and interest receivable, held for sale
Loans and interest receivable, held for sale, represents a portion of our installment consumer receivables that we intend to sell. This portfolio includes the
substantial majority of the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and other European buy now, pay later loan receivables.
In June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement with a global investment firm to sell up to €40 billion of U.K. and other European buy now, pay later loan
receivables, consisting of eligible loans and interest receivable, held for sale at the closing of the transaction and a forward-flow arrangement for the sale of
future originations of eligible loans over a 24-month commitment period (together, “eligible consumer installment receivables”). Following the closing of this
transaction, which is expected to occur in the second half of 2023, the global investment firm will become the owner of the eligible consumer installment
receivables and we will no longer hold an ownership interest in these receivables. We will maintain the servicing rights and receive a servicing fee for the entire
pool of the eligible consumer installment receivables outstanding.(1)

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
(Unaudited)
Loans and interest receivable, held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, determined on an aggregate basis, with valuation changes and any
associated charge-offs recorded in restructuring and other charges on our condensed consolidated statements of income (loss). Prior to the decision to sell, this
portfolio was reported at outstanding principal balances, net of allowances, including unamortized deferred origination costs and estimated collectible interest
and fees. At the time of reclassification, any previously recorded allowance for credit losses for loans and interest receivable outstanding was reversed,
resulting in a decrease of approximately $33 million in transaction and credit losses in our condensed consolidated statements of income (loss) for the three and
six months ended June 30, 2023. Interest income on interest bearing held-for-sale loans is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest.
Recently adopted accounting guidance
In March 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2022-02, Troubled Debt Restructurings
(“TDRs”) and Vintage Disclosures (Topic 326): Financial Instruments – Credit Losses. This amended guidance eliminated the accounting designation of a loan
modification as a TDR and the measurement guidance for TDRs. The amendments also enhanced existing disclosure requirements and introduced new
requirements related to modifications of receivables due from borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Additionally, this guidance required entities to
disclose gross charge-offs by year of origination for financing receivables, such as loans and interest receivable. The amended guidance was effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2022 and was required to be applied prospectively, except for the recognition and measurement of TDRs, which could be
applied on a modified retrospective basis. We adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2023 on a prospective basis. Our financial statements were not
materially impacted upon adoption. For additional information, see “Note 11—Loans and Interest Receivable.”
There are other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB that we have adopted or will adopt, as applicable. We do not believe any of these
accounting pronouncements have had, or will have, a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements or disclosures.
NOTE 2—REVENUE
We enable our customers to send and receive payments. We earn revenue primarily by completing payment transactions for our customers on our payments
platform and from other value added services. Our revenues are classified into two categories: transaction revenues and revenues from other value added

We determine operating segments based on how our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) manages the business, makes operating decisions around the
allocation of resources, and evaluates operating performance. Our CODM is our Chief Executive Officer, who regularly reviews our operating results on a
consolidated basis. We operate as one segment and have one reportable segment. Based on the information provided to and reviewed by our CODM, we
believe that the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows and how they are affected by economic factors are most appropriately
depicted through our primary geographical markets and types of revenue categories (transaction revenues and revenues from other value added services).
Revenues recorded within these categories are earned from similar products and services for which the nature of associated fees and the related revenue
recognition models are substantially the same.

No single country included in the other countries category generated more than 10% of total net revenues.
Total net revenues include $452 million and $296 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $903 million and $483 million for the six months ended June 30,
2023 and 2022, respectively, which do not represent revenues recognized in the scope of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from contracts with customers. Such revenues relate to
interest and fees earned on loans and interest receivable, including loans and interest receivable held for sale, hedging gains or losses, and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer
balances.
Net revenues are attributed to the country in which the party paying our fee is located.
NOTE 3—NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE
Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of
shares of common stock and potentially dilutive common stock outstanding for the period. The dilutive effect of outstanding equity incentive awards is
reflected in diluted net income (loss) per share by application of the treasury stock method. The calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share excludes all
anti-dilutive common shares. During periods when we report net loss, diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share because the effects of
potentially dilutive items would decrease the net loss per share.
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share for the periods indicated:

NOTE 6—LEASES
PayPal enters into various leases, which are primarily real estate operating leases. We use these properties for executive and administrative offices, data centers,
product development offices, customer services and operations centers, and warehouses.
While a majority of our lease agreements do not contain an explicit interest rate, certain of our lease agreements are subject to changes based on the Consumer
Price Index or another referenced index. In the event of changes to the relevant index, lease liabilities are not remeasured and instead are treated as variable
lease payments and recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.
The short-term lease exemption has been adopted for all leases with a duration of less than 12 months.
PayPal’s lease portfolio includes a small number of subleases. A sublease situation can arise when currently leased real estate space is available and is surplus
to operational requirements.
As of June 30, 2023, we had no finance leases.

other charges on our condensed consolidated statements of income (loss). The impairments in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 included a
reduction to our ROU lease assets in the amount of $4 million and $25 million, respectively, which were attributed to certain leased space we are no longer
utilizing for our business operations, a portion of which is being subleased. In the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, we incurred asset impairment
charges of $19 million and $35 million, respectively, within restructuring and other charges on our condensed consolidated statements of income (loss). The
impairments in the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 included a reduction to our ROU lease assets in the amount of $15 million and $25 million,

NOTE 7—OTHER FINANCIAL STATEMENT DETAILS
CRYPTO ASSET SAFEGUARDING LIABILITY AND CORRESPONDING SAFEGUARDING ASSET
We allow our customers in certain markets to buy, hold, sell, receive, and send certain cryptocurrencies as well as use the proceeds from sales of
cryptocurrencies to pay for purchases at checkout. These cryptocurrencies consist of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin (collectively,“our
customers’ crypto assets”). We engage third parties, which are licensed trust companies, to provide certain custodial services, including holding our customers’
cryptographic key information, securing our customers’ crypto assets, and protecting them from loss or theft, including indemnification against certain types of
losses such as theft. Our third-party custodians hold the crypto assets in a custodial account in PayPal’s name for the benefit of PayPal’s customers. We
maintain the internal recordkeeping of our customers’ crypto assets, including the amount and type of crypto asset owned by each of our customers in that
custodial account. As of June 30, 2023, we utilize two third-party custodians; as such, there is concentration risk in the event these custodians are not able to
perform in accordance with our agreement.
Due to the unique risks associated with cryptocurrencies, including technological, legal, and regulatory risks, we recognize a crypto asset safeguarding liability
to reflect our obligation to safeguard the crypto assets held for the benefit of our customers, which is recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities
on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. We also recognize a corresponding safeguarding asset which is recorded in prepaid expenses and other current
assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The crypto asset safeguarding liability and corresponding safeguarding asset are measured and recorded at
fair value on a recurring basis using prices available in the market we determine to be the principal market at the balance sheet date. The corresponding
safeguarding asset may be adjusted for loss events, as applicable. As of June 30, 2023, the Company has not incurred any safeguarding loss events, and
therefore, the crypto asset safeguarding liability and corresponding safeguarding asset were recorded at the same value.

STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS
Our strategic investments include marketable equity securities, which are publicly traded, and non-marketable equity securities, which are primarily
investments in privately held companies. Our marketable equity securities have readily determinable fair values and are recorded as long-term investments on
our condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net on our condensed consolidated
statements of income (loss). Marketable equity securities totaled $513 million and $323 million as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.
Our non-marketable equity securities are recorded in long-term investments on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value of our non-
marketable equity securities totaled $1.8 billion as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had non-
marketable equity securities of $154 million and $136 million, respectively, where we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the
investee. We account for these equity securities using the equity method of accounting. The remaining non-marketable equity securities do not have a readily
determinable fair value and we measure these equity investments at cost minus impairment, if any, and adjust for changes resulting from observable price
changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer (the “Measurement Alternative”). All gains and losses on these
investments, realized and unrealized, and our share of earnings or losses from investments accounted for using the equity method are recognized in other
income (expense), net on our condensed consolidated statements of income (loss).
Measurement Alternative adjustments
The adjustments to the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the Measurement Alternative in the three and six months

A majority of our derivative instruments are valued using pricing models that take into account the contract terms as well as multiple inputs where applicable,
such as currency rates, interest rate yield curves, option volatility, and equity prices.
As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we did not have any assets or liabilities requiring measurement at fair value on a recurring basis with significant
unobservable inputs that would require a high level of judgment to determine fair value (Level 3).
We elect to account for available-for-sale debt securities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries under the fair value
option. Election of the fair value option allows us to recognize any gains and losses from fair value changes on such investments in other income (expense), net
on the condensed consolidated statements of income (loss) to significantly reduce the accounting asymmetry that would otherwise arise when recognizing the
corresponding foreign exchange gains and losses relating to customer liabilities. The following table summarizes the estimated fair value and amortized cost of

The fair value of loans and interest receivables held for sale is classified within Level 3 as we estimate fair value using significant unobservable inputs. The
significant unobservable input is the price at which the Company expects to sell the loans based upon our agreement with the global investment firm that will
purchase these loans. The price is determined based upon certain loan and risk classifications of the portfolio. The following table presents the valuation
techniques covering the majority of Level 3 non-recurring fair value measurements and the most significant unobservable inputs used in those measurements as
of June 30, 2023:
Fair Value

Loans and interest receivable, held
for sale $ 1,903 Price-based Price $ 0.98 $ 0.99 $ 0.99 
 Prices are measured in relation to $1.00 par.
 Weighted average is calculated based on the fair value of the loans.
We measure the non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the Measurement Alternative at cost minus impairment, if any, adjusted for observable
price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured
during the period based on observable price changes are classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the fair value based on
valuation methods which only include significant inputs that are observable, such as the observable transaction price at the transaction date. The fair value of
non-marketable equity securities are classified within Level 3 when we estimate fair value using significant unobservable inputs such as when we remeasure
due to impairment and use discount rates, forecasted cash flows, and market data of comparable companies, among others.
We evaluate ROU assets related to leases for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
ROU asset may not be recoverable. Impairment losses on ROU lease assets related to office operating leases are calculated initially using estimated rental
income per square foot derived from observable market data, and the impaired asset is classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES NOT MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE
Our financial instruments, including cash, restricted cash, time deposits, loans and interest receivable, net, certain customer accounts, and long-term debt
related to borrowings on our credit facilities, are carried at amortized cost, which approximates their fair value. Our notes receivable had a carrying value of
approximately $461 million and fair value of approximately $389 million as of June 30, 2023. Our notes receivable had a carrying value of approximately $441
million and fair value of approximately $396 million as of December 31, 2022. Our term debt (including current portion) in the form of fixed rate notes had a
carrying value of approximately $10.5 billion and fair value of approximately $9.7 billion as of June 30, 2023. Our term debt (including current portion) in the
form of fixed rate notes had a carrying value of approximately $10.3 billion and fair value of approximately $9.5 billion as of December 31, 2022. If these
financial instruments were measured at fair value in the financial statements, cash would be classified as Level 1; restricted cash, time deposits, certain
customer accounts, and term debt (including current portion) would be classified as Level 2; and the remaining financial instruments would be classified as
Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.(1)

NOTE 10—DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
SUMMARY OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
Our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Our derivatives expose us to credit risk to the extent that our counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the arrangement. We seek to mitigate such risk
by limiting our counterparties to, and by spreading the risk across, major financial institutions and by entering into collateral security arrangements. In addition,
the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. We do not use any derivative
instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Cash flow hedges
We have significant international revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies, which subjects us to foreign currency exchange risk. We have a foreign
currency exposure management program in which we designate certain foreign currency exchange contracts, generally with maturities of 12 months or less, to
reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted revenues and expenses denominated in certain foreign currencies. The objective of these
foreign currency exchange contracts is to help mitigate the risk that the U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows are adversely affected by changes in the applicable
U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate. These derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and accordingly, the derivative’s gain or loss is
initially reported as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassified into revenue or applicable expense line item in the condensed consolidated statements
of income (loss) in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. We evaluate the effectiveness of our foreign currency exchange contracts on a
quarterly basis by comparing the critical terms of the derivative instruments with the critical terms of the forecasted cash flows of the hedged item; if the
critical terms are the same, we conclude the hedge will be perfectly effective. We do not exclude any component of the changes in fair value of the derivative
instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We report cash flows arising from derivative instruments consistent with the classification of cash
flows from the underlying hedged items that these derivatives are hedging. Accordingly, the cash flows associated with derivatives designated as cash flow
hedges are classified in cash flows from operating activities on our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.
As of June 30, 2023, we estimated that $23 million of net derivative losses related to our cash flow hedges included in AOCI are expected to be reclassified
into earnings within the next 12 months. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we did not discontinue any cash flow hedges because
it was probable that the original forecasted transaction would not occur and as such, did not reclassify any gains or losses to earnings prior to the occurrence of
the hedged transaction. If we elect to discontinue our cash flow hedges and it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will occur, we continue to
report the derivative’s gain or loss in AOCI until the forecasted transaction affects earnings, at which point we also reclassify it into earnings. Gains and losses
on derivatives held after we discontinue our cash flow hedges and on derivative instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in the
same financial statement line item to which the derivative relates.
Net investment hedges
We use forward foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the foreign currency exchange risk related to our investment in certain foreign subsidiaries.
These derivatives are designated as net investment hedges and accordingly, the gains and losses on the portion of the derivatives included in the assessment of
hedge effectiveness is recorded in AOCI as part of foreign currency translation. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and
recognize them in other income (expense), net on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. The accumulated gains and losses associated with these
instruments will remain in AOCI until the foreign subsidiaries are sold or substantially liquidated, at which point they will be reclassified into earnings. The
cash flows associated with derivatives designated as a net investment hedge are classified in cash flows from investing activities on our condensed consolidated
statements of cash flows.
We have not reclassified any gains or losses related to net investment hedges from AOCI into earnings during any of the periods presented.

Foreign currency exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments
We have a foreign currency exposure management program in which we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the foreign currency exchange risk
of our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These contracts are not designated as hedging
instruments and reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The gains and
losses due to remeasurement of certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, which are
offset by the gains and losses on these foreign currency exchange contracts. The cash flows associated with our non-designated derivatives used to hedge
foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are classified in cash flows from operating activities on our condensed consolidated statements of
cash flows.
FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS
The fair value of our outstanding derivative instruments as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was as follows:

Total derivative liabilities $ 113 $ 298 
MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS - RIGHTS OF SET-OFF
Under master netting agreements with certain counterparties to our foreign currency exchange contracts, subject to applicable requirements, we are allowed to
net settle transactions of the same type with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. However, we have elected to present the derivative assets
and derivative liabilities on a gross basis on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Rights of set-off associated with our foreign currency exchange
contracts represented a potential offset to both assets and liabilities of $52 million as of June 30, 2023 and $70 million as of December 31, 2022.
We have entered into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments

NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS
Derivative transactions are measured in terms of the notional amount; however, this amount is not recorded on the balance sheet and is not, when viewed in

NOTE 11—LOANS AND INTEREST RECEIVABLE
LOANS AND INTEREST RECEIVABLE, HELD FOR SALE
In June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement with a global investment firm to sell up to €40 billion of our eligible consumer installment receivables
portfolio including those held on our balance sheet at closing of the transaction and a forward-flow arrangement for the sale of future originations. Loans and
interest receivable, held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, determined on an aggregate basis, with valuation changes and any associated
charge-offs recorded in restructuring and other charges on our condensed consolidated statements of income (loss). Prior to the decision to sell, this portfolio
was reported at outstanding principal balances, net of allowances, including unamortized deferred origination costs and estimated collectible interest and fees.
At the time of reclassification, any previously recorded allowance for credit losses for loans and interest receivable outstanding was reversed, resulting in a
decrease of approximately $33 million in transaction and credit losses in our condensed consolidated statements of income (loss). See “Note 1—Overview and
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for additional information.
During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we reclassified approximately $1.2 billion of eligible consumer installment receivables from loans and interest
receivable, net to loans and interest receivable, held for sale. As of June 30, 2023, the total outstanding balance in our held for sale portfolio was $1.9 billion,
including loans reclassified as held for sale and loans originated as held for sale.

Consumer receivables
We offer revolving and installment credit products as a funding option for consumers in certain checkout transactions on our payments platform. Our revolving
credit product consists of PayPal Credit in the U.K., which is made available to consumers as a funding source in their PayPal wallet once they are approved
for credit. Additionally, we offer installment credit products at the time of checkout in various markets, including the U.S., several markets across Europe,
Australia, and Japan. We offer non interest-bearing installment credit products in these markets as well as interest-bearing installment credit products in the
U.S. and Germany. Beginning in June 2022, we have purchased receivables related to interest-bearing installment loans extended to U.S. consumers by an
independent chartered financial institution (“partner institution”) and are responsible for the servicing functions related to that portfolio. During the six months
ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we purchased approximately $514 million and nil in consumer receivables, respectively. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31,
2022, the outstanding balance of consumer receivables, which consisted of revolving and installment loans and interest receivable, was $4.5 billion and
$5.9 billion, respectively, net of the participation interest sold to the partner institution of $26 million and $17 million, respectively.
We closely monitor the credit quality of our consumer receivables to evaluate and manage our related exposure to credit risk. Credit risk management begins
with initial underwriting and continues through the full repayment of a loan. To assess a consumer who requests a loan, we use, among other indicators,
internally developed risk models using detailed information from external sources, such as credit bureaus where available, and internal data, including the
consumer’s prior repayment history with our credit products where available. We use delinquency status and trends to assist in making (or, for interest-bearing
installment loans in the U.S., to assist the partner institution in making) new and ongoing credit decisions, to adjust our models, to plan our collection practices
and strategies, and in determining our allowance for consumer loans and interest receivable.

Includes amounts related to foreign currency remeasurement.
The provision for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to growth in the U.S. installment loans and U.K. revolving loans within our
consumer receivable portfolio. In the second quarter of 2023, we updated our expected credit loss models for the consumer receivables. The expected credit
loss models utilize certain macroeconomic factors such as forecasted trends in household disposable income and retail e-commerce sales, and no longer
consider unemployment. These changes did not have a material impact on our provision recorded in the period. Qualitative adjustments were made to account
for limitations in our current expected credit loss models due to uncertainty with respect to the financial health of our borrowers.
The increase in charge-offs for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year was due to the expansion of our installment
products and growth of revolving credit products.
The provision for current expected credit losses relating to our consumer receivable portfolio is recognized in transaction and credit losses on our condensed
consolidated statements of income (loss). The provision for interest receivable for interest earned on our consumer receivable portfolio is recognized in
revenues from other value added services as a reduction to revenue. Loans receivable continue to accrue interest until they are charged off.(1)

We charge off consumer receivable balances in the month in which a customer’s balance becomes 180 days past the billing date or contractual repayment date,
except for the U.S. consumer interest-bearing installment receivables, which are charged off 120 days past the contractual repayment date. Bankrupt accounts
are charged off within 60 days after receipt of notification of bankruptcy. Charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to our allowance for loans and interest
receivable and subsequent recoveries, if any, are recorded as an increase to the allowance for loans and interest receivable.
Merchant receivables
We offer access to merchant finance products for certain small and medium-sized businesses through our PayPal Working Capital (“PPWC”) and PayPal
Business Loan (“PPBL”) products, which we collectively refer to as our merchant finance offerings. We purchase receivables related to credit extended to U.S.
merchants by a partner institution and are responsible for the servicing functions related to that portfolio. During the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022,
we purchased approximately $975 million and $1.4 billion in merchant receivables, respectively. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the total
outstanding balance in our pool of merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable was $1.7 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, net of the
participation interest sold to the partner institution of $69 million and $97 million, respectively.
Through our PPWC product, merchants can borrow a certain percentage of their annual payment volume processed by PayPal and are charged a fixed fee for
the loan or advance based on the overall credit assessment of the merchant. Loans and advances are repaid through a fixed percentage of the merchant’s future
payment volume that PayPal processes. Through our PPBL product, we provide merchants access to short-term business financing for a fixed fee based on an
evaluation of the applying business as well as the business owner. PPBL repayments are collected through periodic payments until the balance has been
satisfied.
The interest or fee is fixed at the time the loan or advance is extended and is recognized as deferred revenue in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on
our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The fixed interest or fee is amortized into revenues from other value added services based on the amount repaid
over the repayment period. We estimate the repayment period for PPWC based on the merchant’s payment processing history with PayPal. For PPWC, there is
a general requirement that at least 10% of the original amount of the loan or advance plus the fixed fee must be repaid every 90 days. We calculate the
repayment rate of the merchant’s future payment volume so that repayment of the loan or advance and fixed fee is expected to generally occur within 9 to 12
months from the date of the loan or advance. On a monthly basis, we recalculate the repayment period based on the repayment activity on the receivable. As
such, actual repayment periods are dependent on actual merchant payment processing volumes. For PPBL, we receive fixed periodic payments over the
contractual term of the loan, which generally ranges from 3 to 12 months.
We actively monitor receivables with repayment periods greater than the original expected or contractual repayment period, as well as the credit quality of our
merchant loans and advances that we extend or purchase, so that we can evaluate, quantify, and manage our credit risk exposure. To assess a merchant seeking
a loan or advance, we use, among other indicators, risk models developed internally which utilize information obtained from multiple internal and external data
sources to predict the likelihood of timely and satisfactory repayment by the merchant of the loan or advance amount and the related interest or fee. Primary
drivers of the models include the merchant’s annual payment volume, payment processing history with PayPal, prior repayment history with PayPal’s credit
products where available, information sourced from consumer and business credit bureau reports, and other information obtained during the application
process. We use delinquency status and trends to assist in making (or, in the U.S., to assist the partner institution in making) ongoing credit decisions, to adjust
our internal models, to plan our collection strategies, and in determining our allowance for these loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable.

The increase in the charge-offs for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year was due to the expansion of acceptable
risk parameters in 2022, which resulted in a deterioration of the overall credit quality of loans outstanding.
For merchant loans and advances, the determination of delinquency is based on the current expected or contractual repayment period of the loan or advance
and fixed interest or fee payment as compared to the original expected or contractual repayment period. We charge off the receivables outstanding under our
PPBL product when the repayments are 180 days past the contractual repayment date. We charge off the receivables outstanding under our PPWC product
when the repayments are 180 days past our expectation of repayments and the merchant has not made a payment in the last 60 days, or when the repayments
are 360 days past due regardless of whether the merchant has made a payment in the last 60 days. Bankrupt accounts are charged off within 60 days after
receipt of notification of bankruptcy. The provision for credit losses on merchant loans and advances is recognized in transaction and credit losses on our
condensed consolidated statements of income (loss), and the provision for interest and fees receivable is recognized as a reduction of deferred revenue in

NOTE 12—DEBT
FIXED RATE NOTES
In June 2023, we issued fixed rate notes with varying maturity dates for an aggregate principal amount of ¥90 billion (approximately $622 million as of
June 30, 2023). Interest on these notes is payable on June 9 and December 9 of each year, beginning on December 9, 2023.
In May 2022, May 2020, and September 2019, we issued fixed rate notes with varying maturity dates for an aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion,
$4.0 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively.
The notes issued from the June 2023, May 2022, May 2020, and September 2019 debt issuances are senior unsecured obligations and are collectively referred
to as the “Notes.” We may redeem the Notes in whole, at any time, or in part (except for the June 2023 notes), from time to time, prior to maturity, at their
redemption prices. Upon the occurrence of both a change of control of the Company and a downgrade of the Notes below an investment grade rating, we will
be required to offer to repurchase each series of Notes at a price equal to 101% of the then outstanding principal amounts, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The
Notes are subject to covenants, including limitations on our ability to create liens on our assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, and merge or
consolidate with another entity, in each case subject to certain exceptions, limitations, and qualifications. Proceeds from the issuance of these Notes may be
used for general corporate purposes, which may include funding the repayment or redemption of outstanding debt, share repurchases, ongoing operations,
capital expenditures, acquisitions of businesses, assets, or strategic investments.
In May 2022, we repurchased certain notes under the September 2019 and May 2020 debt issuances prior to maturity through tender offers. In addition, in June
2022, we redeemed the outstanding balance of the notes maturing in September 2022 through a make-whole redemption. We repurchased and redeemed
$1.6 billion of outstanding notes, as described above, which resulted in de minimis debt extinguishment net gains that were recorded as interest expense within
other income (expense), net on our condensed consolidated statements of income (loss).

CREDIT FACILITIES
Five-year revolving credit facility
In June 2023, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) that provides for an unsecured $5.0 billion, five-year revolving credit facility and
terminated the facility entered into in September 2019. The Credit Agreement includes a $150 million letter of credit sub-facility and a $600 million swingline
sub-facility, with available borrowings under the revolving credit facility reduced by the amount of any letters of credit and swingline borrowings outstanding
from time to time. Loans borrowed under the Credit Agreement are available in U.S. dollar, Euro, British pound, and Australian dollar, and in each case subject
to the sub-limits and other limitations provided in the Credit Agreement. We may also, subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders and satisfaction of
specified conditions, increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to $2.0 billion. Subject to specific conditions, we may designate one or
more of our subsidiaries as additional borrowers under the Credit Agreement, provided PayPal Holdings, Inc. guarantees the portion of borrowings made
available and other obligations of any such subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement. As of June 30, 2023, certain subsidiaries were designated as additional
borrowers. Funds borrowed under the Credit Agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other purposes not in
contravention of the Credit Agreement.
We are obligated to pay interest on loans under the Credit Agreement and other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including an upfront
fee and an unused commitment fee based on our debt rating. Loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at either (i) the applicable term benchmark
rate plus a margin (based on the Company's public debt ratings) ranging from 0.750% to 1.250%, (ii) the applicable Risk-Free Rate (Sterling Overnight Index
Average for loans denominated in pounds sterling and Euro Short-Term Rate for loans denominated in euros) rate plus a margin (based on the Company's
public debt ratings) ranging from 0.750% to 1.250%, (iii) the applicable overnight rate plus a margin (based on the Company's public debt ratings) ranging
from 0.750% to 1.250% or (iv) a formula based on the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate or the adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus a
margin (based on the Company's public debt ratings) ranging from zero to 0.250%. Subject to certain conditions stated in the Credit Agreement, the Company
and any subsidiaries designated as additional borrowers may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under the revolving credit facility at any time during the
term of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on June 7, 2028, unless (a) the
commitments are terminated earlier, either at the request of the Company or, if an event of default occurs, by the lenders (or automatically in the case of certain
bankruptcy-related events), or (b) the maturity date is extended upon the request of the Company, subject to the agreement of the lenders. The Credit
Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant, events of default, and
indemnification provisions in favor of the lenders. The negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and the incurrence of subsidiary
indebtedness, in each case subject to certain exceptions. The financial covenant requires the Company to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a
maximum consolidated leverage ratio.
As of June 30, 2023, no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Accordingly, at June 30, 2023, $5.0 billion of borrowing
capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the Credit Agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.
Paidy credit agreement
In February 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Paidy Credit Agreement”) with Paidy as co-borrower, which provided for an unsecured revolving
credit facility of ¥60.0 billion, which was modified in September 2022 to increase the borrowing capacity by ¥30.0 billion for a total borrowing capacity of
¥90.0 billion (approximately $622 million as of June 30, 2023). In June 2023, we repaid borrowings on the Paidy Credit Agreement using proceeds from the
June 2023 debt issuance. As of June 30, 2023, no borrowings were outstanding, and as of December 31, 2022, ¥64.3 billion (approximately $491 million) was
outstanding under the Paidy Credit Agreement, which was recorded in long-term debt on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. At June 30, 2023,
¥90.0 billion (approximately $622 million) of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the Paidy Credit Agreement, subject to
customary conditions to borrowing. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the total interest expense and fees we recorded related to
the Paidy Credit Agreement were de minimis.

holders in the U.K. While this amount represents the total unused credit available, we have not experienced, and do not anticipate, that all our PayPal Credit
account holders will access their entire available credit at any given point in time. In addition, the individual lines of credit that make up this unused credit are

LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS
Overview
We are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings on an ongoing basis. Certain of these proceedings are in early stages and may seek an indeterminate
amount of damages or penalties or may require us to change or adopt certain business practices. If we believe that a loss arising from such matters is probable
and can be reasonably estimated, we accrue the estimated liability in our financial statements at that time. If only a range of estimated losses can be determined,
we accrue an amount within the range that, in our judgment, reflects the most likely outcome; if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than
any other amount, we accrue the low end of the range. For those proceedings in which an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible but not probable, we
have disclosed an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses or we have concluded that an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of
losses arising directly from the proceeding (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) are not material. If we cannot estimate the
probable or reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising from a legal proceeding, we have disclosed that fact. In assessing the materiality of a legal
proceeding, we evaluate, among other factors, the amount of monetary damages claimed, as well as the potential impact of non-monetary remedies sought by
plaintiffs (e.g., injunctive relief) that may require us to change our business practices in a manner that could have a material adverse impact on our business.
With respect to the matters disclosed in this Note 13, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the
application of such non-monetary remedies.
Amounts accrued for legal and regulatory proceedings for which we believe a loss is probable and reasonably estimable were not material as of June 30, 2023.
Except as otherwise noted for the proceedings described in this Note 13, we have concluded, based on currently available information, that reasonably possible
losses arising directly from the proceedings (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) in excess of our recorded accruals are also not
material. Determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and
unpredictable outcomes. We may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. If any of our estimates and
assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows.

Regulatory proceedings
PayPal Australia Pty Limited (“PPAU”) self-reported a potential violation to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (“AUSTRAC”) on May
22, 2019. This self-reported matter relates to PPAU incorrectly filing required international funds transfer instructions over a period of time under the Anti-
Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (“AML/CTF Act”). On September 23, 2019, PPAU received a notice from AUSTRAC requiring
that PPAU appoint an external auditor (a partner of a firm which is not our independent auditor) to review certain aspects of PPAU’s compliance with its
obligations under the AML/CTF Act. The external auditor was appointed on November 1, 2019.
AUSTRAC had notified PPAU that its enforcement team was investigating the matters reported upon by the external auditor in its August 31, 2020 final report.
As a resolution of this investigation, on March 17, 2023, AUSTRAC’s Chief Executive Officer accepted an enforceable undertaking from PPAU in relation to
the self-reported issues.
The enforceable undertaking does not include a monetary penalty. The entry into and compliance with the enforceable undertaking will not require a change to
our business practices in a manner that could result in a material loss, require significant management time, result in the diversion of significant operational
resources, or otherwise adversely affect our business.
PPAU is required to deliver an Assurance Action Plan (“AAP”) under the enforceable undertaking to demonstrate that the governance and oversight
arrangements following the remedial work completed by PPAU are sustainable and appropriate. The enforceable undertaking requires PPAU to appoint an
external auditor. The external auditor was appointed on June 22, 2023 and will assess and report on the appropriateness, sustainability and efficacy of the
actions to be taken under the AAP. The external auditor’s final report to PPAU and AUSTRAC is due on or before April 16, 2024. The successful completion of
the enforceable undertaking is subject to AUSTRAC’s ultimate review and decision based on the external auditor’s final report. We cannot predict the outcome
of the external auditor’s final report or AUSTRAC’s decision.
Any failure to comply with the enforceable undertaking could result in penalties or require us to change our business practices.
We have received Civil Investigative Demands (“CIDs”) from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) related to Venmo’s unauthorized funds
transfers and collections processes, and related matters, including treatment of consumers who request payments but accidentally designate an unintended
recipient. The CIDs request the production of documents and answers to written questions. We are cooperating with the CFPB in connection with these CIDs.
We have responded to subpoenas and requests for information from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Enforcement Division relating to
whether the interchange rates paid to the bank that issues debit cards bearing our licensed brands were consistent with Regulation II of the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System, and to the reporting of marketing fees earned from the PayPal-branded card programs (the “SEC Debit Card Program Matter”).
We have been informed by the SEC that this matter has been formally closed without action.
In February 2022, we received a CID from the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) related to PayPal’s practices relating to commercial customers that submit
charges on behalf of other merchants or sellers, and related activities. The CID requests the production of documents and answers to written questions. We are
cooperating with the FTC in connection with this CID.
In January 2023, we received notice of an administrative proceeding and a related request for information from the German Federal Cartel Office (“FCO”)
related to terms in PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. et Cie, S.C.A.’s contractual terms with merchants in Germany prohibiting surcharging and requiring parity
presentation of PayPal relative to other payment methods. We are cooperating with the FCO in connection with this proceeding.

Legal proceedings
On August 20, 2021, a putative securities class action captioned Kang v. PayPal Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 21-cv-06468, was filed in the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of California (the “Kang Securities Action”). The Kang Securities Action asserts claims relating to our disclosure of a CID from
the CFPB related to the marketing and use of PayPal Credit in connection with certain merchants that provide educational services and the SEC Debit Card
Program Matter in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2021. The Kang Securities Action purports to be brought on
behalf of purchasers of the Company’s stock between February 9, 2017 and July 28, 2021 (the “Class Period”), and asserts claims for violations of Sections
10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 against the Company, its Chief Executive Officer, and former Chief Financial Officer. The complaint
alleges that certain public statements made by the Company during the Class Period were rendered materially false and misleading (which, allegedly, caused
the Company’s stock to trade at artificially inflated prices) by the defendants’ failure to disclose that, among other things, PayPal’s business practices with
respect to PayPal Credit and regarding interchange rates paid to its bank partner related to its bank-issued co-branded debit cards were non-compliant with
applicable laws and/or regulations. The Kang Securities Action seeks unspecified compensatory damages on behalf of the putative class members. On
November 2, 2021, the court appointed a Lead Plaintiff, and on January 25, 2022, the Lead Plaintiff filed an amended complaint. The amended complaint
alleges a class period between April 27, 2016 and July 28, 2021 (the “Amended Class Period”), and in addition to the Company, its Chief Executive Officer,
and former Chief Financial Officer, also names other Company executives as defendants. The amended complaint alleges that various statements made by the
defendants during the Amended Class Period were rendered materially false and misleading, in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, by PayPal’s alleged violations of the 2015 consent order with the CFPB, federal consumer financial laws, and Regulation II. On August 8, 2022,
the court granted Defendants’ motion to dismiss the amended complaint in its entirety, and granted Lead Plaintiff’s request for leave to file a further amended
complaint. On September 16, 2022, Lead Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint (the “SAC”), which asserts the same claims against the same Defendants
based on the same alleged conduct as the prior complaint. Defendants moved to dismiss the SAC on November 3, 2022. On April 27, 2023, the Court granted
Defendants’ motion and dismissed the SAC in its entirety with prejudice. Plaintiffs’ deadline to file an appeal has passed and the matter is now closed.
On December 16, 2021 and January 19, 2022, two related putative shareholder derivative actions captioned Pang v. Daniel Schulman, et al., Case No. 21-cv-
09720, and Lalor v. Daniel Schulman, et al., Case No. 22-cv-00370, respectively, were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California
(the “California Derivative Actions”), purportedly on behalf of the Company. On August 2, 2022, a related putative shareholder derivative action captioned
Jefferson v. Daniel Schulman, et al., No. 2022-0684, was filed in the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware (the “Delaware Derivative Action,” and
collectively with the California Derivative Actions, the “Derivative Actions”), purportedly on behalf of the Company. The Derivative Actions are based on the
same alleged facts and circumstances as the Kang Securities Action, and name certain of our officers, including our Chief Executive Officer and former Chief
Financial Officer, and members of our Board of Directors, as defendants. The Derivative Actions allege claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment,
abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, and violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), and seek to
recover damages on behalf of the Company. On February 1, 2022, the court entered an order consolidating the two California Derivative Actions and staying
them until all motions to dismiss in the Kang Securities Action are resolved. On June 29, 2023, following the final dismissal of the Kang Securities Action, the
Court so-ordered a stipulation dismissing the California Derivative Actions, without prejudice.

On October 4, 2022, a putative securities class action captioned Defined Benefit Plan of the Mid-Jersey Trucking Industry and Teamsters Local 701 Pension
and Annuity Fund v. PayPal Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 22-cv-5864, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. On January 11,
2023, the Court appointed Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec as lead plaintiff and renamed the action In re PayPal Holdings, Inc. Securities Litigation
(“PPH Securities Action”). On March 13, 2023, the lead plaintiff filed an amended and consolidated complaint. The PPH Securities Action asserts claims
relating to our public statements with respect to net new active accounts (“NNA”) results and guidance, and the detection of illegitimately created accounts.
The PPH Securities Action purports to be brought on behalf of purchasers of the Company’s stock between February 3, 2021 and February 1, 2022 (the “Class
Period”), and asserts claims for alleged violations of Sections 10(b) of the Exchange Act against the Company, as well as its Chief Executive Officer, Chief
Strategy, Growth and Data Officer, and former Chief Financial Officer (collectively, the “Individual Defendants,” and together with the Company,
“Defendants”), and for alleged violations of Sections 20(a) and 20A of the Exchange Act against the Individual Defendants. The complaint alleges that certain
public statements made by Defendants during the Class Period were rendered materially false and misleading (which, allegedly, caused the Company’s stock to
trade at artificially inflated prices) by the Defendants’ failure to disclose that, among other things, the Company’s incentive campaigns were susceptible to
fraud and led to the creation of illegitimate accounts, which allegedly affected the Company’s NNA results and guidance. The PPH Securities Action seeks
unspecified compensatory damages on behalf of the putative class members.
On November 2, 2022, a putative shareholder derivative action captioned Shah v. Daniel Schulman, et al., Case No. 22-cv-1445, was filed in the U.S. District
Court for the District of Delaware (the “Shah Action”), purportedly on behalf of the Company. On April 4, 2023, a putative shareholder derivative action
captioned Nelson v. Daniel Schulman, et. al., Case No. 23-cv-01913, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey (the “Nelson Action”)
purportedly on behalf of the Company. The Shah and Nelson Actions are based on the same alleged facts and circumstances as the PPH Securities Action, and
name certain of our officers, including our Chief Executive Officer and former Chief Financial Officer, and members of our Board of Directors, as defendants.
The Shah and Nelson Actions allege claims for breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate
assets, gross mismanagement and violations of the Exchange Act, and seek to recover damages on behalf of the Company. The Shah and Nelson Actions have
been stayed pending further developments in the PPH Securities Action.
On December 20, 2022, a civil lawsuit captioned State of Hawai‘i, by its Office of Consumer Protection, v. PayPal, Inc., and PayPal Holdings, Inc., Case No.
1CCV-22-0001610, was filed in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit of the State of Hawai‘i (the “Hawai‘i Action”). The Hawai‘i Action asserts claims for
unfair and deceptive acts and practices under Hawai‘i Revised Statutes Sections 480-2(a) and 481A-3(a). Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief as well as unspecified
penalties and other monetary relief. On July 14, 2023, the court denied Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint.
General matters
Other third parties have from time to time claimed, and others may claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We are subject
to patent disputes and expect that we will increasingly be subject to additional patent infringement claims involving various aspects of our business as our
products and services continue to expand in scope and complexity. Such claims may be brought directly or indirectly against our companies and/or against our
customers (who may be entitled to contractual indemnification under their contracts with us), and we are subject to increased exposure to such claims as a
result of our acquisitions, particularly in cases where we are introducing new products or services in connection with such acquisitions. We have in the past
been forced to litigate such claims, and we believe that additional lawsuits alleging such claims will be filed against us. Intellectual property claims, whether
meritorious or not, are time-consuming and costly to defend and resolve, could require expensive changes in our methods of doing business, or could require us
to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms or make substantial payments to settle claims or to satisfy damages awarded by courts.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
(Unaudited)
From time to time, we are involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business, including suits by our customers
(individually or as class actions) or regulators alleging, among other things, improper disclosure of our prices, rules, or policies, that our practices, prices, rules,
policies, or customer/user agreements violate applicable law, or that we have acted unfairly or not acted in conformity with such prices, rules, policies, or
agreements. In addition to these types of disputes and regulatory inquiries, our operations are also subject to regulatory and legal review and challenges that
may reflect the increasing global regulatory focus to which the payments industry is subject and, when taken as a whole with other regulatory and legislative
action, such actions could result in the imposition of costly new compliance burdens on our business and customers and may lead to increased costs and
decreased transaction volume and revenue. Further, the number and significance of these disputes and inquiries are increasing as our business has grown and
expanded in scale and scope, including the number of active accounts and payments transactions on our platform, the range and increasing complexity of the
products and services that we offer, and our geographical operations. Any claims or regulatory actions against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time
consuming, result in costly litigation, settlement payments, damage awards (including statutory damages for certain causes of action in certain jurisdictions),
fines, penalties, injunctive relief, or increased costs of doing business through adverse judgment or settlement, require us to change our business practices in
expensive ways, require significant amounts of management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources, or otherwise harm our business.
INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS
Our agreements with eBay governing our separation from eBay provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations for both eBay and us. Disputes between
eBay and us have arisen and others may arise in the future, and an adverse outcome in such matters could materially and adversely impact our business, results
of operations, and financial condition. In addition, the indemnity rights we have against eBay under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us, and our
indemnity obligations to eBay may be significant.
In the ordinary course of business, we include indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with whom we have commercial
relationships. Under these contracts, we generally indemnify, hold harmless, and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the
indemnified party in connection with claims by any third party with respect to our domain names, trademarks, logos, and other branding elements to the extent
that such marks are related to the subject agreement. We have provided an indemnity for other types of third-party claims, which may include indemnities
related to intellectual property rights, confidentiality, willful misconduct, data privacy obligations, and certain breach of contract claims, among others. We
have also provided an indemnity to our payments processors in the event of card association fines against the processor arising out of conduct by us or our
customers. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to our limited history of prior indemnification
claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular situation.
PayPal has participated in the U.S. Government’s Paycheck Protection Program administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration. Loans made under
this program are funded by an independent chartered financial institution that we partner with. We receive a fee for providing services in connection with these
loans and retain operational and audit risk related to those activities. We have agreed, under certain circumstances, to indemnify the chartered financial
institution and its assignee of a portion of these loans in connection with the services provided for loans made under this program.
To date, no significant costs have been incurred, either individually or collectively, in connection with our indemnification provisions.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material
effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.

PROTECTION PROGRAMS
We provide merchants and consumers with protection programs for certain transactions completed on our payments platform. These programs are intended to
protect both merchants and consumers from loss primarily due to fraud and counterparty performance. Our Purchase Protection Program provides protection to
consumers for qualifying purchases by reimbursing the consumer for the full amount of the purchase if a purchased item does not arrive or does not match the
seller’s description. Our Seller Protection Programs provide protection to merchants against claims that a transaction was not authorized by the buyer or claims
that an item was not received by covering the seller for the full amount of the payment on eligible sales. These protection programs are considered assurance-
type warranties under applicable accounting standards for which we estimate and record associated costs in transaction and credit losses during the period the
payment transaction is completed.
At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the allowance for transaction losses was $58 million and $66 million, respectively. The allowance for negative
customer balances was $288 million and $212 million at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The following table shows changes in the
allowance for transaction losses and negative customer balances related to our protection programs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022:
Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,
2023 2022 2023 2022

Recoveries 30 52 35 84 
Ending balance $ 346 $ 378 $ 346 $ 378 
NOTE 14—STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMS
During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we repurchased approximately 41 million shares of our common stock for approximately $3.0 billion at an average
price of $72.42, excluding excise tax. These shares were purchased in the open market under our stock repurchase programs authorized in July 2018 and June
2022. As of June 30, 2023, a total of approximately $12.9 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our June 2022 stock
repurchase program.
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 imposed a nondeductible 1% excise tax on the net value of certain stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022.
Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we reflected the applicable excise tax in treasury stock on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. During the six
months ended June 30, 2023, we recorded $24 million in excise tax within treasury stock on our condensed consolidated balance sheet.
NOTE 15—STOCK-BASED PLANS
In May 2023, our stockholders approved an additional authorization of 34.6 million shares to the Amended and Restated PayPal Holdings, Inc. 2015 Equity
Incentive Award Plan (the “Plan”). In June 2023, the Company filed a post-effective amendment to the 2022 Inducement Plan registration statement that
enabled 2.6 million shares previously issuable under the 2022 Inducement Plan to be included in the 34.6 million additional shares issuable under the Plan.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE
Stock-based compensation expense for our equity incentive plans are measured based on their estimated fair value at the time of grant and recognized over the
award’s vesting period.

The impact on our results of operations of recording stock-based compensation expense under our equity incentive plans for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2023 and 2022 was as follows:
Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,

General and administrative 106 88 200 276 
Total stock-based compensation expense $ 376 $ 326 $ 733 $ 768 
Capitalized stock-based compensation expense $ 13 $ 12 $ 24 $ 28 
NOTE 16—INCOME TAXES
Our effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 was 21% and 23%, respectively. Our effective tax rate for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2022 was 796% and 75%, respectively. The difference between our effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% in the current
periods was primarily the result of foreign income taxed at different rates and discrete tax adjustments, including tax expense related to stock-based
compensation. The difference between our effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 was
primarily due to tax expense related to the intra-group transfer of intellectual property.
NOTE 17—RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES
During the first quarter of 2023, management initiated a global workforce reduction intended to focus resources on core strategic priorities, and improve our
cost structure and operating efficiency. The associated restructuring charges during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 were nil and $117 million,
respectively. We primarily incurred employee severance and benefits costs, substantially all of which have been accrued for as of March 31, 2023.
The following table summarizes the restructuring reserve activity during the six months ended June 30, 2023:
 Employee Severance and Benefits
and Other Associated Costs
(In millions)
Accrued liability as of January 1, 2023 $ 24 
Char ges 117 
Payments (121)
Accrued liability as of June 30, 2023 $ 20 
During the first quarter of 2022, management initiated a strategic reduction of the existing global workforce intended to streamline and optimize our global
operations to enhance operating efficiency. This effort focused on reducing redundant operations and simplifying our organizational structure. The associated
restructuring charges during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 were $71 million and $91 million, respectively. We primarily incurred employee
severance and benefits costs, as well as associated consulting costs under this strategic reduction. The strategic actions associated with this plan were
substantially completed by the fourth quarter of 2022.
Additionally, we are continuing to review our real estate and facility capacity requirements due to our new and evolving work models. We incurred asset
impairment charges of $4 million and $43 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, and $19 million and $35 million in the three
and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, due to exiting of certain leased properties, which resulted in a reduction of ROU lease assets and related
leasehold improvements. See “Note 6—Leases” for additional information. We recognized a gain of $14 million due to the sale of an owned property in the
three and six months ended June 30, 2023. We also incurred a loss of $8 million upon designation of another owned property as held for sale in the six months
ended June 30, 2023.

ITEM 2: MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including statements that involve expectations, plans, or intentions (such as those relating to future business, future results
of operations or financial condition, new or planned features or services, mergers or acquisitions, or management strategies). These forward-looking
statements can be identified by words such as “may,” “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “intend,”
“continue,” “strategy,” “future,” “opportunity,” “plan,” “project,” “forecast,” and other similar expressions. These forward-looking statements involve risks
and uncertainties that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking
statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, among others, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended Decem ber 31, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”), as supplemented in the risk factors set forth below in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-
Q, as well as in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, related notes, and the other information appearing in this report and our other
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not intend, and undertake no obligation except as required by law, to update any of our forward-
looking statements after the date of this report to reflect actual results, new information, or future events or circumstances. Given these risks and uncertainties,
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. You should read the following “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes that
appear in this report. Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company,” and “PayPal”

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
THE COMPANY
We are a leading technology platform that enables digital payments and simplifies commerce experiences on behalf of merchants and consumers worldwide.
PayPal is committed to democratizing financial services to help improve the financial health of individuals and to increase economic opportunity for
entrepreneurs and businesses of all sizes around the world. Our goal is to enable our merchants and consumers to manage and move their money anywhere in
the world in the markets we serve, anytime, on any platform, and using any device when sending payments or getting paid, including person-to-person
payments.
Regulatory environment
We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened focus by regulators globally on all aspects of the payments
industry, including countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. The laws and regulations applicable
to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital payments, continue to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation.
New or changing laws and regulations, including changes to their interpretation and implementation, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions
related to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We monitor these areas closely
and are focused on designing compliant solutions for our customers.
Information security
Information security risks for global payments and technology companies like us have increased significantly in recent years. Although we have developed
systems and processes designed to protect the data we manage, prevent data loss and other security incidents, and enable us to effectively respond to known
and potential risks, and expect to continue to expend significant resources to bolster these protections, we remain subject to these risks and there can be no
assurance that our security measures will provide sufficient security or prevent breaches or attacks. For additional information regarding our information
security risks, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our 2022 Form 10-K, as supplemented and, to the extent inconsistent, superseded below (if applicable) in
Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Form 10-Q.

BREXIT
The United Kingdom (“U.K.”) formally exited the European Union (“EU”) and the European Economic Area (“EEA”) on January 31, 2020 (commonly
referred to as “Brexit”) with the expiration of the transition period on December 31, 2020. PayPal operates in the U.K. within the scope of its passport
permissions (as they stood at the end of the transition period) under the Temporary Permissions Regime pending the grant of new authorizations by the U.K.
financial regulators. We are currently unable to determine the longer-term impact that Brexit will have on our business, which will depend, in part, on the
implications of new tariff, trade, and regulatory frameworks that now govern the provision of cross-border goods and services between the U.K. and the EEA,
as well as the financial and operational consequences of the requirement for PayPal to obtain new U.K. authorizations to operate its business longer-term within
the U.K. market. For additional information on how Brexit could affect our business, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our 2022 Form 10-K, as
supplemented and, to the extent inconsistent, superseded below (if applicable) in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Form 10 -Q.
Brexit may contribute to instability in financial, stock, and foreign currency exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British pound and Euro.
We have foreign currency exchange exposure management programs designed to help reduce the impact from foreign currency exchange rate movements. The
tables below provide the percentage of our total net revenues and gross loans and interest receivable from the U.K. and EU for the periods presented:

MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
The broader implications of the macroeconomic environment, including uncertainty around the Russia and Ukraine conflict, supply chain shortages, a recession
globally or in markets in which we operate, higher inflation rates, higher interest rates, and other related global economic conditions, remain unknown. A
deterioration in macroeconomic conditions could continue to increase the risk of lower consumer spending, merchant and consumer bankruptcy, insolvency,
business failure, higher credit losses, foreign currency exchange fluctuations, or other business interruption, which may adversely impact our business. If these
conditions continue or worsen, they could adversely impact our future financial and operating results.(1)

THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2023 AND 2022
Net revenues increased $481 million, or 7%, in the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period of the prior year driven primarily by growth
in total payment volume (“TPV”, as defined below under “Key Metrics”) of 11%.
Total operating expenses increased $112 million, or 2%, in the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period of the prior year due primarily
to an increase in transaction expense, partially offset by reductions in sales and marketing expense, technology and development expense, and restructuring and
other charges.
Operating income increased by $369 million, or 48%, in the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period of the prior year due to net
revenues growing faster than operating expenses. Our operating margin was 16% and 11% in the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively,
reflecting the positive impact of operating efficiencies in our business, partially offset by the negative impact of an increase in transaction expense.
Net income increased $1.4 billion in the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period of the prior year due to the previously discussed
increase in operating income of $369 million, an increase in other income (expense), net of $885 million driven primarily by net gains on strategic investments
in the current period as compared to net losses in the prior period, and a decrease in income tax expense of $116 million driven primarily by higher tax expense
in the prior period related to the intra-group transfer of intellectual property, partially offset by higher tax expense in the current period on higher operating
income and net gains on strategic investments.
SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2023 AND 2022
Net revenues increased $1.0 billion, or 8%, in the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period of the prior year driven primarily by growth in
TPV of 10%.
Total operating expenses increased $381 million, or 3%, in the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period of the prior year due primarily to
an increase in transaction expense, partially offset by reductions in sales and marketing expense, technology and development expense, general and
administrative expense, and customer support and operations expense.(1)

Operating income increased $657 million, or 45%, in the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period of the prior year due to net revenues
growing faster than operating expenses. Our operating margin was 15% and 11% in the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, reflecting the
positive impact of operating efficiencies in our business, partially offset by the negative impact of an increase in transaction expense.
Net income increased $1.7 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period of the prior year due to the previously discussed increase
in operating income of $657 million and an increase of $1.0 billion in other income (expense), net driven primarily by net gains on strategic investments in the
current period as compared to net losses in the prior period.
IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES
We have significant international operations that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound, Euro, Australian dollar, and Canadian
dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency exchange risk which may adversely impact our financial results. The strengthening or weakening of the United States
(“U.S.”) dollar versus the British pound, Euro, Australian dollar, and Canadian dollar, as well as other currencies in which we conduct our international
operations, impacts the translation of our net revenues and expenses generated in these foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. We generated approximately
42% of our net revenues from customers domiciled outside of the U.S. in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to 43% in both the three
and six months ended June 30, 2022. Because we generate substantial net revenues internationally, we are subject to the risks of doing business outside of the
U.S. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our 2022 Form 10-K, as supplemented and, to the extent inconsistent, superseded (if applicable) below in Part II, Item
1A, Risk Factors of this Form 10-Q.
We calculate the year-over-year impact of foreign currency exchange movements on our business using prior period foreign currency exchange rates applied to
current period transactional currency amounts. While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results, we have a foreign currency
exchange exposure management program in which we use foreign currency exchange contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, intended to reduce the impact
on earnings from foreign currency exchange rate movements. Gains and losses from these foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized as a component
of transaction revenues or operating expenses (as applicable) in the same period the forecasted transactions impact earnings.
In the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, year-over-year foreign currency exchange rate movements relative to the U.S. dollar had the following impact
on our reported results:
Three Months Ended June
30, 2023Six Months Ended June 30,
2023
(In millions)
Favorable (unfavorable) impact to net revenues (exclusive of hedging impact) $ 6 $ (133)
Hedging impact 34 110 
Favorable (unfavorable) impact to net revenues 40 (23)
Favorable impact to operating expense 7 85 
Net favorable impact to operating income $ 47 $ 62 
While we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to help reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency exchange rate movements, it is
impossible to predict or eliminate the total effects of this exposure.
We also use foreign currency exchange contracts, designated as net investment hedges, to reduce the foreign currency exchange risk related to our investment
in certain foreign subsidiaries. Gains and losses associated with these instruments will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the
underlying foreign subsidiaries are sold or substantially liquidated.
Given that we also have foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our
subsidiaries, we have an additional foreign currency exchange exposure management program in which we use foreign currency exchange contracts to help
offset the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency exchange gains and losses on our assets and
liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts. These foreign currency
exchange contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities.

Table of Contents
Additionally, in connection with transactions occurring in multiple currencies on our payments platform, we generally set our foreign currency exchange rates
daily and may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign currency exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
between the times that we set our foreign currency exchange rates and when transactions occur.
KEY METRICS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS
KEY METRICS
TPV, number of payment transactions, active accounts, and number of payment transactions per active account are key non-financial performance metrics
(“key metrics”) that management uses to measure the scale of our platform and the relevance of our products and services to our customers, and are defined as
follows:
•TPV is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment
solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.
•Number of payment transactions are the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or
enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.
•An active account is an account registered directly with PayPal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our platform, not
including gateway-exclusive transactions, within the past 12 months. A platform access partner is a third party whose customers are provided access to
PayPal’s platform or services through such third party’s login credentials, including individuals and entities that utilize Hyperwallet’s payout
capabilities. A user may register on our platform to access different products and may register more than one account to access a product. Accordingly,
a user may have more than one active account. The number of active accounts provides management with additional perspective on the overall scale
of our platform, but may not have a direct relationship to our operating results.
•Number of payment transactions per active account reflects the total number of payment transactions within the previous 12-month period, divided by
active accounts at the end of the period. The number of payment transactions per active account provides management with insight into the average
number of times an account engages in payments activity on our payments platform in a given period. The number of times a consumer account or a
merchant account transacts on our platform may vary significantly from the average number of payment transactions per active account.
As our transaction revenue is typically correlated with TPV growth and the number of payment transactions completed on our payments platform, management
uses these metrics to gain insights into the scale and strength of our payments platform, the engagement level of our customers, and underlying activity and
trends which may be indicators of current and future performance. We present these key metrics to enhance investors’ evaluation of the performance of our
business and operating results.
Our key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity we measure on our payments platform and compiled from multiple systems,
including systems that are internally developed or acquired through business combinations. While the measurement of our key metrics is based on what we
believe to be reasonable methodologies and estimates, there are inherent challenges and limitations in measuring our key metrics globally at our scale. The
methodologies used to calculate our key metrics require judgment.
We regularly review our processes for calculating these key metrics, and from time to time we may make adjustments to improve the accuracy or relevance of
our metrics. For example, we continuously apply models, processes, and practices designed to detect and prevent fraudulent account creation on our platforms,
and work to improve and enhance those capabilities. When we detect a significant volume of illegitimate activity, we generally remove the activity identified
from our key metrics. Although such adjustments may impact key metrics reported in prior periods, we generally do not update previously reported key metrics
to reflect these subsequent adjustments unless the retrospective impact of process improvements or enhancements is determined by management to be material.

Table of Contents
NET REVENUES
Our revenues are classified into the following two categories:
•Transaction revenues: Net transaction fees charged to merchants and consumers on a transaction basis based on the TPV completed on our payments
platform. Growth in TPV is directly impacted by the number of payment transactions that we enable on our payments platform. We earn additional
fees from merchants and consumers: on transactions where we perform currency conversion, when we enable cross-border transactions (i.e.,
transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries), to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their PayPal
or Venmo account to their bank account or debit card, to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, as contractual compensation from sellers
that violate our contractual terms (for example, through fraud or counterfeiting), and other miscellaneous fees.
•Revenues from other value added services: Net revenues derived primarily from revenue earned through partnerships, referral fees, subscription fees,
gateway fees, and other services we provide to our merchants and consumers. We also earn revenues from interest and fees earned on our portfolio of
loans receivable and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances.
Net revenue analysis
The components of our net revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions):
Transaction revenues
Transaction revenues grew by $284 million, or 5%, and $650 million, or 5%, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the
same periods of the prior year driven primarily by growth in TPV and the number of payment transactions from our Braintree products and services partially
offset by a decline in revenues from our core PayPal products and services, including declines in contractual compensation for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2023, of $75 million and $105 million, respectively, from sellers that violated our contractual terms predominantly in international markets.

We had active accounts of 431 million and 429 million as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our total number of payment transactions was 6.1 billion
and 5.5 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of 10%. Our total number of payment transactions was 11.9 billion
for the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to 10.7 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2022, an increase of 12%. TPV was $377 billion and

Table of Contents
Transaction revenues grew more slowly than growth in TPV and the number of payment transactions in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023
compared to the same periods in the prior year due primarily to a decline in revenues from core PayPal products and services and foreign currency exchange
fees. Additionally, for the three months ended June 30, 2023, the slower growth of transaction revenues compared to TPV and the number of payment
transactions was due to an unfavorable impact from hedging.
Revenues from other value added services
Revenues from other value added services increased $197 million, or 37%, and $388 million, or 38%, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023,
respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily attributable to increases in interest earned on certain assets underlying customer account
balances resulting from higher interest rates, and to a lesser extent, interest and fee revenue on our loans receivable portfolio driven by consumer interest-
bearing installment loans and consumer revolving loans.

(2) 
56
Table of Contents
Transaction expense increased by $497 million, or 16%, and $963 million, or 16%, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, due primarily
to the increase in TPV of 11% and 10% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, as well as unfavorable changes in product mix. The
increase in the transaction expense rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same periods of the prior year was also attributable to
unfavorable changes in product mix with a higher proportion of TPV from unbranded card processing volume, which generally has higher expense rates than
other products and services, partially offset by favorable changes in regional mix with respect to our core PayPal products and certain third-party pricing
reductions with respect to our Venmo products. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, approximately 37% and 36% of TPV, respectively, was
generated outside of the U.S. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, approximately 35% and 36% of TPV, respectively, was generated outside of
the U.S.
Our transaction expense rate is impacted by changes in product mix, merchant mix, regional mix, funding mix, and fees paid to payment processors and other
financial institutions. The cost of funding a transaction with a credit or debit card is generally higher than the cost of funding a transaction from a bank or
through internal sources such as a PayPal or Venmo account balance or our consumer credit products.
Transaction and credit losses
The components of our transaction and credit losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions):
Transaction and credit losses decreased by $50 million, or 11%, and increased by $23 million, or 3%, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023,
respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year.
Transaction losses were $286 million in the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to $380 million in the three months ended June 30, 2022, a decrease
of $94 million, or 25%. Transaction losses were $586 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to $702 million in the six months ended June
30, 2022, a decrease of $116 million, or 17%. Transaction loss rate (transaction losses divided by TPV) was 0.08% for the three and six months ended June 30,
2023, compared to 0.11% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022. The decrease in transaction losses in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023
was primarily due to a $114 million loss related to an ongoing merchant insolvency proceeding in the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 with no
activity of comparable individual magnitude in the current period.

Credit losses increased by $44 million and $139 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods of the
prior year. The components of credit losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions):

Reserve build (release) (22) 8 10 3 
Credit losses $ 112 $ 68 $ 254 $ 115 
Net charge-offs includes principal charge-offs partially offset by recoveries for consumer and merchant receivables.
Reserve build (release) represents change in allowance for principal receivables excluding foreign currency remeasurement.
Includes the reversal of allowance associated with the reclassification of certain loans to held for sale.
The provision in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 was attributable to loan originations during the period and a deterioration in the credit quality of
loans outstanding, partially offset by reversal of reserve associated with the reclassification of certain receivables to held for sale. The provision in the three and
six months ended June 30, 2022 was attributable to loan originations in that period, partially offset by improvements in the credit quality of loans outstanding.
During the periods presented, allowances for our merchant and consumer portfolios included qualitative adjustments that took into account uncertainty with
respect to macroeconomic conditions and around the financial health of our borrowers, including the effectiveness of loan modification programs made
available to merchants.
As of June 30, 2023, loans and interest receivable, held for sale was $1.9 billion. Loans and interest receivable, held for sale, represents the portion of our
installment consumer receivables that we intend to sell. This portfolio includes the substantial majority of the U.K. and other European buy now, pay later loan
receivables. In June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement with a global investment firm to sell up to €40 billion of U.K. and other European buy now,
pay later loan receivables, consisting of eligible loans and interest receivable, held for sale at the closing of the transaction and a forward-flow arrangement for
the sale of future originations of eligible loans over a 24-month commitment period (together, “eligible consumer installment receivables”). At the time of
reclassification, previously recorded allowance for credit losses for loans and interest receivable outstanding was reversed, resulting in a decrease of
approximately $33 million in transaction and credit losses in our condensed consolidated statement of income (loss). See “Note 1—Overview and Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies” in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional
information.
The consumer loans and interest receivable balance, net of participation interest sold, remained consistent as of June 30, 2023 and 2022 at $4.5 billion. The
increases driven by the expansion of our installment credit products in the U.S. and Japan and our revolving credit product in the U.K. were offset by the
reclassification of eligible consumer installment receivables as held for sale in the U.K and other European countries, as discussed above.
Approximately 36% and 43% of our consumer loans receivable outstanding (including loans held for sale and loans held for investments) as of June 30, 2023
and 2022, respectively, were due from consumers in the U.K. The decrease in the percentage of consumer loans receivable outstanding in the U.K. at June 30,
2023 compared to June 30, 2022 was primarily due to overall growth in other markets related to installment credit products.
The following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our consumer loans and interest receivable balance:
June 30,
2023 2022
Percent of consumer loans and interest receivable current 95.5 % 96.5 %
Percent of consumer loans and interest receivable > 90 days outstanding 2.0 % 1.6 %
Net char ge-of f rate 5.0 % 4.2 %
 Amounts as of June 30, 2023 exclude loans and interest receivable, held for sale.
Represents percentage of balances which are 90 days past the billing date or contractual repayment date, as applicable.
Net charge-off rate is the annual ratio of net credit losses, excluding fraud losses, on consumer loans as a percentage of the average daily amount of consumer loans and interest receivable balance
during the period.
The increase in net charge-off rate for consumer loans and interest receivable at June 30, 2023 as compared to June 30, 2022 was primarily due to the
reclassification of certain receivables to held for sale. The net charge-off rate is expected to increase in the second half of 2023 due to a slowing of new
originations of consumer loans held for investment because all eligible new U.K. and other European installment loans will be classified as held for sale and
consequently excluded from net charge-offs.(1)

We offer access to merchant finance products for certain small and medium-sized businesses, which we refer to as our merchant finance offerings. Total
merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable outstanding, net of participation interest sold, remained consistent as of June 30, 2023 and 2022 at
$1.7 billion. The increase in merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable outstanding related to our PayPal Working Capital (“PPWC”) product in
Europe was offset by a decrease in receivable outstanding related to our PayPal Business Loan (“PPBL”) product in the U.S. Approximately 79% and 7% of
our merchant receivables outstanding as of June 30, 2023 were due from merchants in the U.S. and U.K., respectively, as compared to 84% and 6%,
respectively, as of June 30, 2022.
The following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable balance:
June 30,
2023 2022
Percent of merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable current 86.5 % 93.2 %
Percent of merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable > 90 days outstanding 7.1 % 2.6 %
Net char ge-of f rate 13.3 % 3.4 %
Represents percentage of balances which are 90 days past the original expected or contractual repayment period, as applicable.
Net charge-off rate is the annual ratio of net credit losses, excluding fraud losses, on merchant loans and advances as a percentage of the average daily amount of merchant loans, advances, and
interest and fees receivable balance during the period.
The decrease in the percent of current merchant receivables, increase in percent of merchant receivables greater than 90 days outstanding, and increase in the
net charge-off rate for merchant receivables at June 30, 2023 as compared to June 30, 2022 were primarily due to the expansion of acceptable risk parameters
in 2022, which resulted in a decline in the overall credit quality of loans outstanding related to our PPBL product.
We continue to evaluate and modify our acceptable risk parameters in response to the changing macroeconomic environment. During the first quarter of 2023,
in response to declining performance, a number of risk mitigation strategies were implemented which resulted in reduced PPBL originations in the first half of
2023. Modifications to the acceptable risk parameters for our consumer credit products did not have a material impact on our consumer loans in the periods
presented.

Customer support and operations expenses decreased by $44 million, or 8%, and $90 million, or 8%, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023,
respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year due primarily to a decline in employee-related costs, and contractors and consulting costs. The
decline in customer support and operations expense for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was also driven by a decline in customer onboarding and

Technology and development expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions):
Technology and development expenses decreased by $72 million, or 9%, and $166 million, or 10%, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023,
respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year due primarily to lower intangible amortization in the current period and a decline in costs related to
contractors and consultants. The decline in technology and development expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was also attributable to a decline in

General and administrative
General and administrative expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions):
General and administrative expenses decreased by $23 million, or 4%, and $123 million, or 11%, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023,
respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year. The decline in general and administrative expenses in the three months ended June 30, 2023 was
due primarily to a decrease in professional services expenses. The decline in general and administrative expenses in the six months ended June 30, 2023 was
primarily attributable to a decline in employee-related expenses driven by lower stock-based compensation expense, and to a lesser extent, a decrease in
professional services expenses.
Restructuring and other charges
Restructuring and other charges for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions):
Restructuring and other charges decreased by $66 million and increased by $62 million, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively,
compared to the same periods of the prior year.
During the first quarter of 2023, management initiated a global workforce reduction intended to focus resources on core strategic priorities, and improve our
cost structure and operating efficiency. The associated restructuring charges during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 were nil and $117 million,
respectively. We primarily incurred employee severance and benefits costs, substantially all of which have been accrued for as of March 31, 2023. The
estimated reduction in annualized employee-related costs associated with the impacted workforce was approximately $280 million, including approximately
$85 million in stock-based compensation. We expect to reinvest a portion of the reduction in annual costs associated with the impacted workforce to drive
business priorities.
During the first quarter of 2022, management initiated a strategic reduction of the existing global workforce intended to streamline and optimize our global
operations to enhance operating efficiency. This effort focused on reducing redundant operations and simplifying our organizational structure. The associated
restructuring charges during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 was $71 million and $91 million, respectively. We primarily incurred employee
severance and benefits costs, as well as associated consulting costs. The strategic actions associated with this plan were substantially completed by the fourth
quarter of 2022.
For information on the associated restructuring liability, see “Note 17—Restructuring and Other Charges” in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial
statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.

Additionally, we are continuing to review our real estate and facility capacity requirements due to our new and evolving work models. We incurred asset
impairment charges of $4 million and $43 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, and $19 million and $35 million in the three
and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, due to exiting certain leased properties, which resulted in a reduction of right-of-use lease assets and related
leasehold improvements. We recognized a gain of $14 million due to the sale of an owned property in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. We also
incurred a loss of $8 million upon designation of another owned property as held for sale in the six months ended June 30, 2023.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, approximately $34 million of losses were recorded in restructuring and other charges in order to measure
loans and interest receivable, held for sale, at the lower of cost or fair value.
Other income (expense), net
Other income (expense), net increased $885 million and $1.0 billion in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same
periods of the prior year due primarily to net gains on strategic investments in the current periods as compared to net losses in the prior periods, and to a lesser
extent, higher interest income resulting from an increase in interest rates, partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to incremental expense from our
May 2022 fixed rate debt. Other income (expense), net in the six months ended June 30, 2023 was also positively impacted by foreign exchange gains in the
current period compared to losses in the prior period primarily from actions taken in connection with our decision to suspend transactional services in Russia.
Income tax expense
Our effective income tax rate was 21% and 796% for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and 23% and 75% for the six months ended
June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in our effective income tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same
periods of the prior year was due primarily to higher tax expense in the prior year related to the intra-group transfer of intellectual property.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We require liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations, including our customer protection programs, credit products, capital expenditures,
investments in our business, potential acquisitions and strategic investments, working capital, and other cash needs. We believe that our existing cash, cash
equivalents, and investments, cash expected to be generated from operations, and our expected access to capital markets, together with potential external
funding through third-party sources, will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements within the next 12 months and beyond.
SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY
Cash, cash equivalents, and investments
The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022:

Excludes total restricted cash of $11 million and $17 million at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and strategic investments of $2.4 billion and $2.1 billion as of June 30, 2023 and
December 31, 2022, respectively.
Cash, cash equivalents, and investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were $7.1 billion at June 30, 2023 and $8.6 billion at December 31, 2022, or 59% and
62% of our total cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of those respective dates. At December 31, 2022, all of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments
held by foreign subsidiaries were subject to U.S. taxation under Subpart F, Global Intangible Low Taxed Income or the one-time transition tax under the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Subsequent repatriations to the U.S. will not be taxable from a U.S. federal tax perspective, but may be subject to state income or
foreign withholding tax.(1),(2)

A significant aspect of our global cash management activities involves meeting our customers’ requirements to access their cash while simultaneously meeting
our regulatory financial ratio commitments in various jurisdictions. Our global cash balances are required not only to provide operational liquidity to our
businesses, but also to support our global regulatory requirements across our regulated subsidiaries. Accordingly, not all of our cash is available for general
corporate purposes.

financial statements included in this Form 10-Q for additional information.
Operating activities
The net cash generated from operating activities of $1.0 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2023 was due primarily to operating income of $2.1 billion, as
well as adjustments for non-cash expenses including provision for transaction and credit losses of $840 million, stock-based compensation of $708 million, and
depreciation and amortization of $539 million. Cash flows from operating activities was also impacted by originations of loans receivable, held for sale of $1.5
billion, changes in other assets and liabilities of $851 million, primarily related to actual cash transaction losses incurred during the period and a decline in
other liabilities, changes in income taxes payable of $326 million, and net gains from our strategic investments of $181 million, partially offset by proceeds
from repayments of loans receivable, originally classified as held for sale of $302 million.
The net cash generated from operating activities of $2.5 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2022 was due primarily to operating income of $1.5 billion, as
well as adjustments for non-cash expenses including provision for transaction and credit losses of $817 million, stock-based compensation of $741 million, and
depreciation and amortization of $661 million. Cash flows from operating activities was also impacted by net losses incurred on our strategic investments of
$658 million, changes in deferred income taxes of $457 million, and changes in other assets and liabilities of $408 million, primarily related to actual cash
transaction losses during the period partially offset by an increase in other liabilities.
In the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, cash paid for income taxes, net was $906 million and $444 million, respectively.
Investing activities
The net cash provided by investing activities of $1.6 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2023 was due primarily to proceeds from repayments of loans
receivable, originally classified as held for investment, of $16.0 billion, maturities and sales of investments of $10.7 billion, and changes in funds receivable
from customers of $759 million, partially offset by purchases and originations of loans receivable of $15.2 billion, purchases of investments of $10.5 billion,
and purchases of property and equipment of $320 million.
The net cash used in investing activities of $4.7 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2022 was due primarily to purchases of investments of $13.2 billion,
purchases and originations of loans receivable of $12.3 billion, changes in funds receivable from customers of $882 million, and purchases of property and
equipment of $366 million. These cash outflows were partially offset by maturities and sales of investments of $11.1 billion and principal repayment of loans
receivable of $10.9 billion.(1)

Table of Contents
Financing activities
The net cash used in financing activities of $6.1 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2023 was due primarily to the repurchase of $3.0 billion of our
common stock under our stock repurchase programs, changes in funds payable and amounts due to customers of $2.6 billion, repayments of borrowings under
financing arrangements of $942 million (including principal repayment of fixed rate debt under our May 2020 debt issuance and repayment of borrowings
under our Paidy credit agreement), tax withholdings related to net share settlement of equity awards of $200 million, and changes in collateral received related
to derivative instruments, net of $175 million. These cash outflows were partially offset by borrowings under financing arrangements of $720 million
(including proceeds from the issuance of fixed rate debt in June 2023 and borrowings under our Paidy credit agreement).
The net cash provided by financing activities of $986 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 was due primarily to borrowings under financing
arrangements of $3.3 billion (including proceeds from the issuance of fixed rate debt in May 2022 and borrowing under our Paidy credit agreements), changes
in funds payable and amounts due to customers of $1.6 billion, and changes in collateral received related to derivative instruments, net of $236 million. These
cash inflows were partially offset by the repurchase of $2.3 billion of our common stock under our July 2018 stock repurchase program, repayment of
borrowings under financing arrangements of $1.7 billion (including the repurchase and redemption of certain fixed rate notes and repayment of borrowings
under a prior credit agreement), and tax withholdings related to net share settlement of equity awards of $275 million.
Effect of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash
Foreign currency exchange rates for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 had a negative impact of $50 million and $136 million, respectively, on
cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. The negative impact on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the six months ended June 30, 2023 was due
primarily to the unfavorable impact of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the Australian dollar. The negative impact on cash, cash
equivalents and restricted cash in the six months ended June 30, 2022 was due primarily to the unfavorable impact of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the
U.S. dollar to the Australian dollar, and to a lesser extent, the Euro, Japanese yen, and Swedish krona.
Available credit and debt
In June 2023, we issued fixed rate notes with varying maturity dates for an aggregate principal amount of ¥90 billion (approximately $622 million as of
June 30, 2023). Proceeds from the issuance of these notes may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include funding the repayment or
redemption of outstanding debt, share repurchases, ongoing operations, capital expenditures, and possible acquisitions of businesses, assets, or strategic
investments. As of June 30, 2023, we had $10.6 billion in fixed rate debt outstanding with varying maturity dates.
In June 2023, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) that provides for an unsecured $5.0 billion, five-year revolving credit facility and
terminated the facility entered into in September 2019. The Credit Agreement includes a $150 million letter of credit sub-facility and a $600 million swingline
sub-facility, with available borrowings under the revolving credit facility reduced by the amount of any letters of credit and swingline borrowings outstanding
from time to time. As of June 30, 2023, no borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Agreement and as such, $5.0 billion of borrowing capacity was
available for the purposes permitted by the Credit Agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.
In February 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Paidy Credit Agreement”) with Paidy as co-borrower, which provided for an unsecured revolving
credit facility of ¥60.0 billion, which was modified in September 2022 to increase the borrowing capacity by ¥30.0 billion for a total borrowing capacity of
¥90.0 billion (approximately $622 million as of June 30, 2023.) In June 2023, we repaid borrowings on the Paidy Credit Agreement using proceeds from the
June 2023 debt issuance. As of June 30, 2023, no borrowings were outstanding, and as of December 31, 2022, ¥64.3 billion (approximately $491 million) was
outstanding under the Paidy Credit Agreement. At June 30, 2023, ¥90.0 billion (approximately $622 million) of borrowing capacity was available for the
purposes permitted by the Paidy Credit Agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.
Other than as described above, there were no significant changes to the available credit and debt disclosed in our 2022 Form 10 ‑ K. For additional information,
see “Note 12—Debt” in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.

Table of Contents
Depending on market conditions, we may from time to time issue debt, including in private or public offerings, to fund our operating activities, finance
acquisitions, make strategic investments, repurchase shares under our stock repurchase programs, or reduce our cost of capital.
We have a cash pooling arrangement with a financial institution for cash management purposes. The arrangement allows for cash withdrawals from the
financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the financial institution (“Aggregate Cash Deposits”). The arrangement also
allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the Aggregate Cash Deposits up to an agreed-upon limit. The net balance of the withdrawals and the Aggregate Cash
Deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expense or income under the arrangement. As of June 30, 2023, we had a
total of $3.0 billion in cash withdrawals offsetting our $3.0 billion in Aggregate Cash Deposits held within the financial institution under the cash pooling
arrangement.
Credit ratings
As of June 30, 2023, we continue to be rated investment grade by Standard and Poor’s Financial Services, LLC, Fitch Ratings, Inc., and Moody’s Investors
Services, Inc. We expect that these credit rating agencies will continue to monitor our performance, including our capital structure and results of operations.
Our goal is to be rated investment grade, but as circumstances change, there are factors that could result in our credit ratings being downgraded or put on a
watch list for possible downgrading. If that were to occur, it could increase our borrowing rates, including the interest rate on borrowings under our credit
agreements.
CURRENT AND FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS
Our material cash requirements include funds to support current and potential: operating activities, credit products, customer protection programs, stock
repurchases, strategic investments, acquisitions, other commitments, and capital expenditures and other future obligations.
Credit products
Growth in our portfolio of loan receivables increases our liquidity needs and any inability to meet those liquidity needs could adversely affect our business. We
continue to evaluate partnerships and third-party sources of funding for our credit products.
In June 2018, the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the “CSSF”) agreed that PayPal’s management may designate up to 35% of
European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to fund European and U.S. credit activities. In August 2022, the CSSF approved
PayPal’s management designating up to 50% of such balances to fund our credit activities through the end of February 2023. In February 2023, the CSSF
agreed that PayPal’s management may continue to designate up to 50% of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to fund
European, U.K., and U.S. credit activities. As of June 30, 2023, the cumulative amount approved by management to be designated to fund credit activities
aggregated to $3.8 billion and represented approximately 40% of European customer balances made available for our corporate use at that date, as determined
by applying financial regulations maintained by the CSSF. We may periodically seek to designate additional amounts of European customer balances for our
credit activities, as we deem necessary, based on utilization of the approved funds and anticipated credit funding requirements. Under certain exceptional
circumstances, corporate liquidity could be called upon to meet our obligations related to our European customer balances.
While our objective is to expand the availability of our credit products with capital from external sources, there can be no assurance that we will be successful
in achieving that goal.
In June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement with a global investment firm to sell up to €40 billion of our eligible consumer installment receivables
portfolio including those held on our balance sheet at closing of the transaction and a forward-flow arrangement for the sale of future originations. Following
the closing of this transaction, which is expected to occur in the second half of 2023, the global investment firm will become the owner of the eligible
consumer installment receivables and future eligible installment receivables originated over a 24-month commitment period, and we will no longer hold an
ownership interest in these receivables. See “Note 1—Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the notes to the condensed consolidated
financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information.

Customer protection programs
The risk of losses from our customer protection programs are specific to individual consumers, merchants, and transactions, and may also be impacted by
regional variations in, and changes or modifications to, the programs, including as a result of changes in regulatory requirements. For the periods presented in
these condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report, our transaction loss rate ranged between 0.08% and 0.11% of TPV. Historical loss
rates may not be indicative of future results.
Stock repurchases
During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we repurchased approximately $3.0 billion of our common stock in the open market under our stock repurchase
programs authorized in July 2018 and June 2022. As of June 30, 2023, a total of approximately $12.9 billion remained available for future repurchases of our
common stock under our June 2022 stock repurchase program.
Other considerations
Our liquidity, access to capital, and borrowing costs could be adversely impacted by declines in our credit rating, our financial performance, and global credit
market conditions, as well as a broad range of other factors. In addition, our liquidity, access to capital, and borrowing costs could also be negatively impacted
by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our 2022 Form 10-K, as
supplemented and, to the extent inconsistent, superseded below in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Form 10-Q, as well as “Note 13—Commitments and
Contingencies” in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional discussion of these
and other risks that our business faces.

Table of Contents
ITEM 3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as
interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity investment risk. Management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies governing our
investing, funding, and foreign currency derivative activities intended to mitigate market risks. We monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis.
INTEREST RATE RISK
We are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investment portfolio and from interest-rate sensitive assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our
condensed consolidated balance sheets as customer accounts.
As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, approximately 46% and 57%, respectively, of our total cash, cash equivalents, and investment portfolio
(excluding restricted cash and strategic investments) was held in cash and cash equivalents. The remaining portfolio and assets underlying the customer
balances that we hold on our condensed consolidated balance sheets as customer accounts are maintained in interest and non-interest bearing bank deposits,
time deposits, and available-for-sale debt securities. We seek to preserve principal while holding eligible liquid assets, as defined by applicable regulatory
requirements and commercial law in certain jurisdictions where we operate, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of all customer balances. We do not
pay interest on amounts due to customers.
Interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash and cash equivalents, time deposits, and available-for-sale debt securities and the fair value
of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis points increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in fair value of our cash equivalents and
available-for-sale debt securities investment by approximately $150 million and $161 million at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Changes
in the fair value of our available-for-sale debt securities resulting from such interest rate changes are reported as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income (“AOCI”) and are realized only if we sell the securities prior to their scheduled maturities or the declines in fair values are due to
expected credit losses.
As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had $10.6 billion and $10.4 billion, respectively, in fixed rate debt with varying maturity dates. Since these
notes bear interest at fixed rates, they do not result in any financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of these
notes fluctuates when interest rates change, increasing in periods of declining interest rates and declining in periods of increasing interest rates.
As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we also had revolving credit facilities of approximately $5.6 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively, available to us.
We are obligated to pay interest on borrowings under these facilities as well as other customary fees, including an upfront fee and an unused commitment fee
based on our debt rating. Borrowings under these facilities, if any, bear interest at floating rates. As a result, we are exposed to the risk related to fluctuations in
interest rates to the extent of our borrowings. As of June 30, 2023, we had no borrowings under these facilities, and as of December 31, 2022, ¥64.3 billion
(approximately $491 million) was outstanding under these facilities. A 100 basis points hypothetical adverse change in applicable market interest rates would
not have resulted in a material impact to interest expense recorded in the period. For additional information, see “Note 12—Debt” in the notes to the condensed
consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.
Interest rates may also adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us. Higher interest
rates often lead to larger payment obligations by customers of our credit products to us, or to lenders under mortgage, credit card, and other consumer and
merchant loans, which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies, charge-offs,
and allowances for loans and interest receivable, which could have an adverse effect on our net income (loss).

Table of Contents
FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK
We have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound, Euro, Australian dollar, and Canadian
dollar, which subject us to foreign currency exchange rate risk and may adversely impact our financial results. We transact in various foreign currencies and
have significant international revenues and costs. In addition, we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and
for certain corporate services. Our cash flows, results of operations, and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign currency exchange
rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related
hedging activities. We are generally a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the United States (“U.S.”) dollar, and are
adversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, relative to foreign currencies. We considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates
and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term.
We have a foreign currency exchange exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposures, manage these exposures, and
reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated cash flows and results of operations through the execution of foreign currency
exchange contracts. These foreign currency exchange contracts are accounted for as derivative instruments; for additional details related to our foreign currency
exchange contracts, please see “Note 10—Derivative Instruments” in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form
10-Q.
We use foreign currency exchange forward contracts to protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings and our investment in foreign subsidiaries from
adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse foreign currency
exchange rate movements. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted revenues and expenses denominated in certain foreign currencies and
net investment hedges for accounting purposes. The derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of AOCI. Cash flow hedges are subsequently
reclassified into revenue or expense (as applicable) in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The accumulated gains and losses associated
with net investment hedges will remain in AOCI until the foreign subsidiaries are sold or substantially liquidated, at which point they will be reclassified into
earnings.
If the U.S. dollar weakened by a hypothetical 10% at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign currency
exchange forward contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $574 million and $710 million lower, respectively, before considering the offsetting
impact of the underlying hedged item.
We have an additional foreign currency exchange management program in which we use foreign currency exchange contracts to help offset the foreign
currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These contracts are not
designated as hedging instruments and reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The
foreign currency exchange gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, and are offset by the gains and losses on
the foreign currency exchange contracts.
Adverse changes in exchange rates of a hypothetical 10% for all foreign currencies would have resulted in a negative impact on income before income taxes of
approximately $217 million and $173 million at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, without considering the offsetting effect of foreign
currency exchange contracts. Foreign currency exchange contracts in place as of June 30, 2023 would have positively impacted income before income taxes by
approximately $203 million, resulting in a net negative impact of approximately $14 million. Foreign currency exchange contracts in place as of December 31,
2022 would have positively impacted income before income taxes by approximately $144 million, resulting in a net negative impact of approximately
$29 million. These reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% were applied to monetary assets, monetary liabilities, and available-for-sale
debt securities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these
changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term.

Table of Contents
EQUITY INVESTMENT RISK
Our strategic investments are subject to a variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the carrying value of the portfolio. As of
June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our strategic investments totaled $2.4 billion and $2.1 billion, which represented approximately 16% and 14% of our
total cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investment portfolio at each of those respective dates. Our strategic investments include marketable
equity securities, which are publicly traded, and non-marketable equity securities, which are primarily investments in privately held companies. We are
required to record all adjustments to the value of these strategic investments through our condensed consolidated statements of income (loss). As such, we
expect volatility to our net income (loss) in future periods due to changes in fair value related to our investments in marketable equity securities and changes in
observable prices and impairment related to our non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the Measurement Alternative. These changes could be
material based on market conditions. Additionally, the financial success of our investments in privately held companies is typically dependent on a liquidity
event, such as a public offering, acquisition, private sale, or other favorable market event providing the ability to realize appreciation in the value of the
investment. A hypothetical adverse change of 10% in the carrying value of our strategic investments as of June 30, 2023, which could be experienced in the
near term, would have resulted in a decrease of approximately $236 million to the carrying value of the portfolio. We review our non-marketable equity
securities accounted for under the Measurement Alternative for impairment when events and circumstances indicate a decline in fair value of such assets below
carrying value. Our analysis includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent purchases and sales of securities, and other publicly available data,
for which we assess factors such as the investees’ financial condition and business outlook, industry performance, regulatory, economic, or technological
environment, and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee.
ITEM 4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer have
concluded that as of June 30, 2023, the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
(b) Changes in internal controls over financial reporting. There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as defined in the Exchange
Act Rule 13a-15(f) that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.

The information set forth under “Note 13—Commitments and Contingencies—Litigation and Regulatory Matters” in the notes to the condensed consolidated
financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q is incorporated herein by reference.
ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS
We are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, future results, and the
trading price of our common stock. You should read carefully the following information together with the information appearing in Part I, Item 1A, Risk
Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 as filed with the United States (“U.S.”) Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”) on February 10, 2023 (“2022 Form 10-K”), as updated by subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q as filed with the SEC (“Forms
10-Q”). The following information supplements and, to the extent inconsistent, supersedes some of the information appearing in the Risk Factors section of
our 2022 Form 10 ‑ K and Forms 10-Q. These risk factors, as well as our condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other
information appearing in this report, should be reviewed carefully for important information regarding risks that affect us.
LEGAL, REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE RISKS
Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Our failure to comply with extensive, complex, overlapping, and frequently
changing rules, regulations, and legal interpretations could materially harm our business.
Our business is subject to complex and changing laws, rules, regulations, policies, and legal interpretations in the markets in which we offer services directly or
through partners, including, but not limited to, those governing: banking, credit, deposit taking, cross-border and domestic money transmission, prepaid access,
foreign currency exchange, privacy, data protection, data governance, cybersecurity, banking secrecy, digital payments, cryptocurrency, payment services
(including payment processing and settlement services), lending, fraud detection, consumer protection, antitrust and competition, economic and trade sanctions,
anti-money laundering, and counter-terrorist financing.
Regulators and legislators globally have been establishing, evolving, and increasing their regulatory authority, oversight, and enforcement in a manner that
impacts our business. As we introduce new products and services and expand into new markets, including through acquisitions, we expect to become subject to
additional regulations, restrictions, and licensing requirements. As we expand and localize our international activities, we expect that our obligations in the
markets in which we operate will continue to increase. In addition, because we facilitate sales of goods and provide services to customers worldwide, one or
more jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws, which may impose different, more specific, or conflicting
obligations on us, as well as broader liability.
Any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws, regulations, or orders of any government authority (including changes to or expansion of
their interpretation) may subject us to significant fines, penalties, criminal and civil lawsuits, forfeiture of significant assets, and enforcement actions in one or
more jurisdictions; result in additional compliance and licensure requirements; cause us to lose existing licenses or prevent or delay us from obtaining
additional licenses that may be required for our business; increase regulatory scrutiny of our business; divert management’s time and attention from our
business; restrict our operations; lead to increased friction for customers; force us to make changes to our business practices, products, or operations; require us
to engage in remediation activities; or delay planned transactions, product launches, or improvements. Any of the foregoing could, individually or in the
aggregate, harm our reputation, damage our brands and business, and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The complexity of U.S.
federal and state and international regulatory and enforcement regimes, coupled with the global scope of our operations and the evolving global regulatory
environment, could result in a single event prompting a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple
government authorities in different jurisdictions. While we have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws
and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, and agents will not violate such laws and regulations.

Payments Regulation
In the U.S., PayPal, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary) holds licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the states where such licenses are
required, as well as in the District of Columbia and certain territories. If we fail to comply with applicable laws or regulations required to maintain our licenses,
we could be subject to liability and/or additional restrictions, forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states or territories, forced to change our
business practices, or required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals, which could impose substantial costs and harm our business.
While we currently allow our customers to send payments from approximately 200 markets, we allow customers in only approximately half of those markets
(including the U.S.) to also receive payments, in some cases with significant restrictions on the manner in which customers can hold balances or withdraw
funds. These restrictions may limit our ability to grow our business.
Outside of the U.S., we principally provide our services to customers in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) through
PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. et Cie, S.C.A. (“PayPal (Europe)”), our wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a credit institution in
Luxembourg. PayPal (Europe) may be subject to enforcement actions and significant fines if it violates applicable requirements. Additionally, compliance with
applicable laws and regulations could become more costly and operationally difficult to manage due to potentially inconsistent interpretations and domestic
regulations by various countries in the region. Applicable regulation relating to payments, anti-money laundering and digital services, which are key focus
areas of regulators and subject to extensive new regulation, could subject us to additional and complex obligations, risks and associated costs. If the business
activities of PayPal (Europe) exceed certain thresholds, or if the European Central Bank (“ECB”) so determines, PayPal (Europe) may be deemed a significant
supervised entity and certain activities of PayPal (Europe) would become directly supervised by the ECB, rather than by the Luxembourg Commission de
Surveillance du Secteur Financier, which could subject us to additional requirements and would likely increase compliance costs. PayPal (Europe) is also
subject to regulation by the ECB under the oversight framework for electronic payment instruments, schemes and arrangements (PISA), which may also lead to
increased compliance obligations and costs.
In many of the other markets outside the U.S. in which we do business, we serve our customers through PayPal Pte. Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary based in
Singapore. PayPal Pte. Ltd. is supervised by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”). The Payment Services Act came into effect in Singapore in
January 2020. As of July 1, 2023, PayPal Pte. Ltd. has been issued a Major Payment Institution license by the MAS to continue to provide payments services.
In order to maintain this license, we are required to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, which will result in increased operational complexity and
costs for our Singapore and international operations.
In many of the markets outside the U.S. (other than Singapore) served by PayPal Pte. Ltd. or by local branches or subsidiaries subject to local regulatory
supervision or oversight, as the case may be, there may be uncertainty whether our Singapore-based service is subject only to Singapore law or also to other
local laws, and whether such local laws might require a payment processor like us to be licensed as a payments service, bank, financial institution, or otherwise.
There are substantial costs and potential product and operational changes involved in maintaining and renewing licenses, certifications, and approvals, and we
could be subject to enforcement actions, fines, and litigation if we are found to violate any of these requirements. There can be no assurance that we will be
able to (or decide to) continue to apply for or obtain any licenses, renewals, certifications, and approvals in any jurisdiction. In certain markets, we may need to
rely on local banks or other partners to process payments and conduct foreign currency exchange transactions in local currency, and local regulators may use
their authority over such local partners to prohibit, restrict, or limit us from doing business. Any of the foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, result
in substantial additional costs, delay or preclude planned transactions, product launches or improvements, require significant and costly operational changes,
impose restrictions, limitations, or additional requirements on our business, products and services, or prevent or limit us from providing our products or
services in a given market.

Cryptocurrency Regulation and Related Risks
Our customer cryptocurrency offerings could subject us to additional regulations, licensing requirements, or other obligations or liabilities. Within the U.S., we
are regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services as a virtual currency business, which does not qualify us to engage in securities brokerage or
dealing activities. The regulatory status of particular cryptocurrencies is unclear under existing law. For example, if the SEC were to assert that any of the
cryptocurrencies we support are securities, the SEC could assert that our activities involving that cryptocurrency require securities broker-dealer registration or
other obligations under the federal securities laws. The rapidly evolving regulatory landscape with respect to cryptocurrency may subject us to additional
licensing and regulatory obligations or to inquiries or investigations from the SEC, other regulators and governmental authorities, and require us to make
product changes, restrict or discontinue product offerings, implement additional and potentially costly controls, or take other actions. If we fail to comply with
regulations, requirements, prohibitions or other obligations applicable to us, we could face regulatory or other enforcement actions, potential fines, and other
consequences.
We hold our customers’ cryptocurrency assets through one or more third-party custodians. Financial and third-party risks related to our customer
cryptocurrency offerings, such as inappropriate access to, theft, or destruction of cryptocurrency assets held by our custodians, insufficient insurance coverage
by a custodian to reimburse us for all such losses, a custodian’s failure to maintain effective controls over the custody and settlement services provided to us, a
custodian’s inability to purchase or liquidate cryptocurrency holdings, and defaults on financial or performance obligations by a custodian, or counterparty
financial institutions, could expose our customers and us to loss, and therefore significantly harm our business, financial performance, and reputation.
We have selected custodian partners, and may in the future select additional custodian partners, that are subject to regulatory oversight, capital requirements,
maintenance of audit and compliance industry certifications, and cybersecurity procedures and policies. Nevertheless, operational disruptions at any such
custodian, or such custodian’s failure to safeguard cryptocurrency holdings could result in losses of customer assets, expose us to customer claims, reduce
consumer confidence and materially impact our operating results and our cryptocurrency product offerings.
Custodial arrangements to safeguard cryptocurrency assets involve unique risks and uncertainties in the event of a custodian’s bankruptcy. While other types of
assets and some custodied cryptocurrencies have been deemed not to be part of the custodian’s bankruptcy estate under various regulatory regimes, bankruptcy
courts have not yet definitively determined the appropriate treatment of custodial holdings of digital assets in a bankruptcy proceeding. In the event of a
custodian’s bankruptcy, the lack of precedent and the highly fact-dependent nature of the determination could delay or preclude the return of custodied
cryptocurrency assets to us or to our customers. Although we contractually require our custodians to segregate our customer assets and not commingle them
with proprietary or other assets, we cannot be certain that these contractual obligations, even if duly observed by a custodian, will be effective in preventing
such assets from being treated as part of the custodian’s estate under bankruptcy or other insolvency law. In that event, our claim on behalf of such customers
against a custodian’s estate for our customers’ cryptocurrency assets could be treated as a general unsecured claim against the custodian, in which case our
customers could seek to hold us liable for any resulting losses.
In addition, our cryptocurrency product offerings could have the effect of heightening or exacerbating many of the risk factors described in this “Risk Factors”
section.
Lending Regulation
We hold a number of U.S. state lending licenses for our U.S. consumer short-term installment loan product, which is subject to federal and state laws governing
consumer credit and debt collection. While the consumer short-term installment loan products that we offer outside the U.S. are generally exempt from primary
consumer credit legislation, certain consumer lending laws, consumer protection or banking transparency regulations continue to apply to these products.
Increased global regulatory focus on short-term installment products and consumer credit more broadly could result in laws or regulations requiring changes to
our policies, procedures, operations, and product offerings, and restrict or limit our ability to offer credit products, and we could be subject to additional
compliance and licensure requirements, enforcement action, fines, and litigation if we are found to violate any aspects of applicable law or regulations.
72
Table of Contents
We are regularly subject to general litigation, regulatory scrutiny, and government inquiries.
We are regularly subject to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government and regulatory investigations, inquiries, actions or
requests, and other proceedings alleging violations of laws, rules, and regulations with respect to competition, antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, data
protection, information security, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, consumer protection (including
unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices), the terms of our customer agreements, fraud, accessibility, securities, tax, labor and employment, commercial
disputes, services, charitable fundraising, contract disputes, escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property, product liability, use of our services for illegal
purposes, the matters described in “Note 13—Commitments and Contingencies—Litigation and Regulatory Matters—General Matters” to our consolidated
financial statements, and other matters. The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries is expected to continue to increase as our products,
services, and business expand in complexity, scale, scope, and geographic reach, including through acquisitions of businesses and technology. Investigations
and legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, expensive and disruptive to our operations, and could result in substantial judgments, fines, penalties or
settlements, negative publicity, substantial diversion of management’s time and effort, reputational harm, criminal sanctions, or orders that prevent or limit us
from offering certain products or services; require us to change our business practices in costly ways, develop non-infringing or otherwise altered products or
technologies, or pay substantial royalty or licensing fees; or delay or preclude planned transactions or product launches or improvements. Determining legal
reserves or possible losses from such matters involves significant estimates and judgments and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable
outcomes. We may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. If any of our estimates and assumptions change
or prove to have been incorrect, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS RISKS
Changes to payment card networks or bank fees, rules, or practices could harm our business.
To process certain transactions, we must comply with applicable payment card, bank or other network (collectively, “network”) rules. The rules govern all
aspects of a transaction on the networks, including fees and other practices. From time to time, the networks have increased the fees and assessments that they
charge for transactions that access their networks. Certain networks have also imposed special fees or assessments for transactions that are executed through a
digital wallet such as the one that PayPal offers. Our payment processors may have the right to pass any increases in fees and assessments on to us and to
increase their own fees for processing. Any increase in interchange fees, special fees, or assessments for transactions that we pay to the networks or our
payment processors could make our pricing less competitive, increase our operating costs, and reduce our operating income, which could materially harm our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.
In some jurisdictions, government regulations have required payment card networks to reduce or cap interchange fees. Any changes in interchange fee rates or
limitations, or their applicability to PayPal, could adversely affect our competitive position against payment card service providers and the revenue we earn
from our branded card programs, require us to change our business practices, and harm our business.
We may also be subject to fines and other penalties assessed by networks resulting from any rule violations by us or our merchants. The networks set and
interpret their rules and have alleged from time to time that various aspects of our business model violate these rules or our agreements with the networks. Such
allegations may result in significant fines, penalties, damages, or other liabilities, adversely impact benefits to us under the agreements, or require changes in
our business practices that may be costly and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The network rules may also increase
the cost of, impose restrictions on, or otherwise impact the development of, our products which may negatively affect product deployment and adoption. The
networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules that we or our payment processors might find difficult or impractical to
follow, or costly to implement, which could require us to make significant changes to our products, increase our operational costs, and negatively impact our
business. If we become unable or limited in our ability to accept certain payment types such as debit or credit cards, our business would be materially and
adversely affected.

Table of Contents
Our credit products expose us to additional risks.
We offer credit products to a wide range of consumers and merchants in the U.S. and various international markets. The financial success of these products
depends largely on the effective management of related risk. The credit decision-making process for our consumer credit products uses proprietary
methodologies and credit algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of specific consumers based on, among other factors,
their past purchase and transaction history with PayPal or Venmo and their credit scores. Similarly, proprietary risk models and other indicators are applied to
assess merchants who desire to use our merchant financing offerings to help predict their ability to repay. These risk models may not accurately predict the
creditworthiness of a consumer or merchant due to inaccurate assumptions, including those related to the particular consumer or merchant, market conditions,
economic environment, or limited transaction history or other data. The accuracy of these risk models and the ability to manage credit risk related to our credit
products may also be affected by legal or regulatory requirements, changes in consumer behavior, changes in the economic environment, issuing bank policies,
and other factors.
We generally rely on the activities and charters of unaffiliated financial institutions to provide PayPal and Venmo branded consumer credit and merchant
financing offerings to our U.S. customers. As a service provider to these unaffiliated financial institutions, which are federally supervised U.S. financial
institutions, we are subject from time to time to examination by their federal banking regulators. In the event of any termination or interruption in a partner
bank’s ability or willingness to lend, our ability to offer consumer credit and merchant financing products could be interrupted or limited, which could
materially and adversely affect our business. We may be unable to reach a similar arrangement with another unaffiliated financial institution on favorable terms
or at all. Obtaining and maintaining the lending licenses required for us to originate such loans ourselves would be a costly, time-consuming and uncertain
process, and would subject us to additional laws and regulatory requirements, which could significantly increase our costs and compliance obligations and
require us to change our business practices.
We are subject to the risk that account holders who use our credit products will default on their payment obligations. The non-payment rate among account
holders may increase due to, among other factors, changes to underwriting standards, risk models not accurately predicting the creditworthiness of a user,
worsening economic conditions, such as a recession or government austerity programs, increases in prevailing interest rates, and high unemployment rates.
Account holders who miss payments often fail to repay their loans, and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not
repay their loans. Any deterioration in the performance of loans facilitated through our platform or unexpected losses on such loans may increase the risk of
potential charge-offs, increase our allowance for loans and interest receivable, negatively impact our revenue share arrangement with an independent chartered
financial institution with respect to our U.S. consumer credit product, and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
We currently purchase receivables related to our U.S. PayPal-branded merchant financing offerings and certain U.S. consumer installment loan products and
extend credit for our consumer and merchant products outside the U.S. through our international subsidiaries. In June 2023, we entered into a multi-year
agreement to sell up to €40 billion of U.K. and European buy now, pay later (“BNPL”) loan receivables originated by PayPal (Europe), consisting of the sale of
a substantial majority of the U.K. and European BNPL loan portfolio held on PayPal (Europe)’s balance sheet at the closing of the transaction and a forward-
flow arrangement for the sale of future originations of eligible loans. The closing of the transaction and the sale of future receivables are subject to certain
conditions. If these conditions are not satisfied or waived or if the parties are unable to fulfill their obligations under these arrangements, the sale of these
receivables could be delayed or not take place at all and we may not realize the expected benefits of this arrangement.
From time to time, we may consider other third-party sources of funding (including asset sales, warehouse facilities, forward-flow arrangements,
securitizations, partnerships or other funding structures) for our credit portfolio or other receivables. The availability of such third-party funding is subject to a
number of factors, including economic conditions and interest rates, and there can be no assurance that any such funding arrangements can be obtained on
favorable terms or at all. If we are unable to fund our credit products or the purchase of the receivables related to our credit products and offerings adequately
or in a cost-effective manner, the growth of our credit products and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely
impacted.

Global and regional economic conditions could harm our business.
Adverse global and regional economic conditions such as turmoil affecting the banking system or financial markets, including, but not limited to, tightening in
the credit markets, extreme volatility or distress in the financial markets (including the fixed income, credit, currency, equity, and commodity markets), higher
unemployment, high consumer debt levels, recessionary or inflationary pressures, supply chain issues, reduced consumer confidence or economic activity,
government fiscal, monetary and tax policies, U.S. and international trade relationships, agreements, treaties, tariffs and restrictive actions, the inability of a
government to enact a budget in a fiscal year, government shutdowns, government austerity programs, and other negative financial news or macroeconomic
developments could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products and services, including a reduction in the volume and size of transactions
on our payments platform. Additionally, any inability to access the capital markets when needed due to volatility or illiquidity in the markets or increased
regulatory liquidity and capital requirements may strain our liquidity position. Such conditions may also expose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates or interest rates that could materially and adversely affect our financial results.
Brexit: The U.K.’s departure from the EU could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Following the departure of the U.K. from the EU and the EEA on January 31, 2020 (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) and the expiration of the transition
period on December 31, 2020, there continues to be uncertainty over the practical consequences of Brexit, including the potential for greater restrictions on the
supply and availability of goods and services between the U.K. and EEA region, and a general deterioration in consumer sentiment and credit conditions
leading to overall negative economic growth and increased risk of merchant default.
The consequences of Brexit have brought legal uncertainty and increased complexity for financial services firms, which could continue as national laws and
regulations in the U.K. differ from EU laws and regulations and additional authorization requirements come into effect. These developments have led and could
lead in the future to additional regulatory costs and challenges for us. Specifically, PayPal currently operates in the U.K. within the scope of its passport
permissions (as they existed at the end of the transition period) pursuant to the Temporary Permissions Regime pending the grant of new authorizations by the
U.K. financial regulators. If we are unable to obtain the required authorizations before the expiry of the longstop dates set by the U.K. regulators under the
Temporary Permissions Regime, our European operations could lose their ability to offer services within the U.K. market, or into the U.K. market on a cross-
border basis. Our European operations may also be required to comply with legal and regulatory requirements in the U.K. that may be in addition to, or
inconsistent with, those of the EEA, in each case, leading to increased complexity and costs.
If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their financial or performance obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses.
We have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents, receivables outstanding, and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial
institutions in the U.S. and international jurisdictions. As part of our foreign currency hedging activities, we regularly enter into transactions involving
derivative financial instruments with various financial institutions. Certain banks and other financial institutions are also lenders under our credit facilities. We
regularly monitor our concentration of, and exposure to, counterparty risk, and actively manage this exposure to mitigate the associated risk. Despite these
efforts, we may be exposed to the risk of default on obligations by, or deteriorating operating results or financial condition or failure of, these counterparty
financial institutions. If one of our counterparty financial institutions were to become insolvent, placed into receivership, or file for bankruptcy, our ability to
recover losses incurred as a result of default or to access or recover our assets that are deposited, held in accounts with, or otherwise due from, such
counterparty may be limited due to the insufficiency of the failed institutions’ estate to satisfy all claims in full or the applicable laws or regulations governing
the insolvency, bankruptcy, or resolution proceedings. In the event of default on obligations by, or the failure of, one or more of these counterparties, we could
incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
If we are unable, or perceived as unable, to effectively manage customer funds, our business could be harmed.
We hold a substantial amount of funds belonging to our customers, including balances in customer accounts and funds being remitted to sellers of goods and
services or recipients of peer-to-peer transactions. In certain jurisdictions where we operate, we are required to comply with applicable regulatory requirements
with respect to customer balances. Our success is reliant on public confidence in our ability to effectively manage our customers’ balances and handle
substantial transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to manage customer funds in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements,
or any public loss of confidence in us or our ability to effectively manage customer balances, could lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of our
products or reduce customer balances held with us, which could significantly harm our business.

ITEM 2: UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
REPURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
In June 2022, our Board of Directors authorized an additional stock repurchase program that provides for the repurchase of up to $15 billion of our common
stock, with no expiration from the date of authorization. Our stock repurchase program is intended to offset the impact of dilution from our equity
compensation programs and, subject to market conditions and other factors, may also be used to make opportunistic repurchases of our common stock to
reduce outstanding share count. Any share repurchases under our stock repurchase program may be made through open market transactions, block trades,
privately negotiated transactions including accelerated share repurchase agreements or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems
appropriate, and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives. Moreover, any stock repurchases are subject to market conditions and
other uncertainties and we cannot predict if or when any stock repurchases will be made. We may terminate our stock repurchase program at any time without
prior notice.
The stock repurchase activity under our stock repurchase program during the three months ended June 30, 2023 is summarized below:
