ITEM 1 - Business  
 
COMPANY OVERVIEW  
 
For more than 150 years, General Mills has been making food the world loves. We are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of 
branded consumer foods with more than 100 brands in 100 countries  across six continents . In addition to our consolidated operations, 
we have 50 percent interests in two strategic joint ventures that manufacture  and market food products sold in approximately 130 
countries worldwide.  
 
We manage and review the financial results of our business under four operating segments: North America Retail; International ; Pet; 
and North America  Foodservice. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
(MD &A) in Item 7 of this report for a description of our segments.  
 
We offer a variety of  human and pet food products that provide great taste, nutrition, convenience, and value for consumers around the 
world. Our business is focused on the following large, global categories:  
 
• snacks, including grain, fruit and savory snacks, nutrition bars, and frozen hot snacks;  
• ready -to-eat cereal;  
• convenient meals, including meal kits, ethnic meals, pizza, soup, side dish mixes, frozen breakfast, and frozen entrees;  
• wholesome natural pet food;  
• refrigerated and frozen dough; 
• baking mixes and ingredients;  
• yogurt; and 
• super- premium ice cream . 
 
Our Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW) joint venture with Nestlé S.A. (Nestlé) competes in the ready -to-eat cereal category in markets 
outside North America, and our Häagen- Dazs Japan, Inc. (HDJ) joint venture competes in the super -premium ice cream category in 
Japan. For net sales contributed by each class of similar products, please see Note 17 to the Consolidated Fi nancial Statements in Item 
8 of this report.  
 
The terms “General Mills,” “Company,” “registrant,” “we,” “us,” and “our” mean General Mills, Inc. and all subsidiaries inclu ded in 
the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report unless the context indicates otherwise.  
  
Certain terms used throughout this report are defined in a glossary in Item 8 of this report.  
 
Customers  
Our primary customers are grocery stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, natural food chains, drug, dollar and d iscount 
chains, e- commerce retailers, commercial and noncommercial foodservice distributors and operators, restaurants, convenience stores, 
and pet specialty stores. We generally sell to these customers through our direct sales force. We use broker and dis tribution 
arrangements for certain products and to serve certain types of customers and certain markets. For further information on our  customer 
credit and product return practices, please refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. During 
fiscal 2023 , Walmart Inc. and its affiliates (Walmart) accounted for 21 percent of our consolidated net sales and 28 percent of net sales 
of our North America Retail segment. No other customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our consolidated net sales. For further 
information on significant customers, please refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this repor t. 
 
Competition  
The human and pet food categories are highly competitive, with numerous manufacturers of varying sizes in the United States and 
throughout the world. The categories in which we participate also are very competitive. Our principal competitors in these ca tegories 
are manufacturers, as well as retailers with their own branded products. Competitors market and sell their products through brick -and-
mortar stores and e -commerce. All our principal competitors have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. Compe tition 
in our product categories is based on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectivenes s of 
marketing, promotional activity, convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer, and the ability to identify and sati sfy consumer 
preferences. Our principal strategies for competing in each of our segments include unique consumer insights, effective custo mer 
relationships, superior product quality, innovative advertising, product promotion, product innovation aligned wit h consumers’ needs, 
an efficient supply chain, and price. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised, branded p roducts, 
but also with regional brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. Internationally, we 
compete with both multi -national and local manufacturers, and each country includes a unique group of competitors.  
 
 
5 Raw materials, ingredients, and packaging  
The principal raw materials that we use are grains (wheat, oats, and corn), dairy products, meat, vegetable oils, sugar, vegetable s, 
fruits, nuts, and other agricultural products. We also use substantial quantities of carton board, corrugated, plastic , and metal 
packaging materials, operating supplies, and energy. Most of these inputs for our domestic and Canadian operations are purchased 
from suppliers in the United States. In our other international operations, inputs that are not locally available in adequate  supply may 
be imported from other countries. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to external conditions such as weather, climate 
change, product scarcity, limited sources of supply, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, trade tariffs, pan demics , 
war, and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations. We believe that we will be able to obtain an 
adequate supply of needed inputs. Occasionally and where possible, we make advance purchases of items  significant to our business 
in order to ensure  continuity of operations. Our objective is to procure materials meeting both our quality standards and our production 
needs at price levels that allow a targeted profit margin. Since these inputs generally represent the largest variable cost i n 
manufactur ing our products, to the extent possible, we often manage the risk associated with adverse price movements for some inputs 
using a variety of risk management strategies. We also have a grain merchandising operation that provides us efficient access  to, and  
more informed knowledge of, various commodity markets, principally wheat and oats. This operation holds physical inventories that 
are carried at net realizable value and uses derivatives to manage its net inventory position and minimize its market exposur es. 
 
TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS  
 
Our products are marketed under a variety of valuable trademarks. Some of the more important trademarks used in our global 
operations (set forth in italics in this report) include Annie’s , Betty Crocker , Bisquick , Blue Buffalo , Blue Basics, Blue Freedom , 
Bugles , Cascadian  Farm , Cheerios , Chex , Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Cocoa Puffs , Cookie Crisp , EPIC , Fiber One, Fruit by the Foot , 
Fruit Gushers , Fruit Roll- Ups, Gardetto's , Gold Medal , Golden Grahams , Häagen -Dazs , Kitano , Kix, Lärab ar, Latina , Lucky 
Charms , Muir Glen , Nature Valley , Nudges, Oatmeal Crisp , Old El Paso , Pillsbury , Progresso , Raisin Nut Bran, Total , Top Chews 
Naturals, Totino’s , Trix, True Chews, Wanchai Ferry, Wheaties , Wilderness , and Yoki. We protect these trade marks as appropriate 
through registrations in the United States and other jurisdictions. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long 
as they are in use or their registrations are properly maintained and the y have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of 
trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely for as long as the trademarks are in use.  
 
Some of our products are marketed under or in combination with trademarks that have been licens ed from others for both long-
standing products (e.g., Reese’s Puffs for cereal, Green Giant for vegetables in certain countries, and Yoplait and related brands for 
fresh dairy in the United States and Canada ), and shorter term promotional products (e.g., f ruit snacks sold under various third party 
equities).  
 
Our cereal trademarks are licensed to CPW and may be used in association with the Nestlé trademark. Nestlé licenses certain of its 
trademarks to CPW, including the Nestlé  and Uncle Toby’s  trademarks. T he Häagen -Dazs  trademark is licensed royalty -free and 
exclusively to Nestlé  and authorized sublicensees  for ice cream and other frozen dessert products in the United States and Canada.  
The Häagen -Dazs  trademark is also licensed to HDJ  in Japan . The Pillsb ury brand and the Pillsbury Doughboy  character are subject 
to an exclusive, royalty -free license that was granted to a third party and its successors in the dessert mix and baking mix categories in 
the United States and under limited circumstances in Canad a and Mexico.     
 
We continue our focus on developing and marketing innovative, proprietary products, many of which use proprietary expertise, 
recipes and formulations. We consider the collective rights under our various patents, which expire from time to time, a valuable asset, 
but we do not believe that our businesses are materially dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents.  
 
SEASONALITY  
 
In general, demand for our products is evenly balanced throughout the year. However, within our North America Retail segment 
demand for refrigerated dough, frozen baked goods, and baking products is stronger in the fourth calendar quarter. Demand for  
Progresso soup is higher during the fall and winter months. Within  our International segment , demand for Häagen -Dazs ice cream is 
higher during the summer months and demand for baking mix increases during winter months. Due to the offsetting impact of the se 
demand trends, as well as the different seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres, our International segment ’s net sales are 
generally evenly balanced throughout the year.  
 
QUALITY AND SAFETY REGULATION  
 
The manufacture and sale of human and pet food products is highly regulated. In the United States, our activities are subject to 
regulation by various federal government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, Department of Agriculture, Fed eral 
Trade Commission, Department of Commerce,  Occupational Safety and Health Administration,  and Environmental Protection 
Agency, as well as various  federal,  state, and local agencies  relating to the production, packaging, labelling, marketing, storage, 
distribution, quality, and safety of food and pet p roducts and the health and safety of our employees. Our business is also regulated by 
similar agencies outside of the United States.  
 
6  
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS  
 
As of May 28, 2023, we were involved with two response actions associated with the alleged or threa tened release of hazardous 
substances or wastes located in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Moonachie, New Jersey.  
 
Our operations are subject to the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, C ompensation, and Liability Act, and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, and all 
similar state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations applicable to the jurisdictions in which we operate.  
 
Based on current facts and circumstances, we believe that neither the results of our environmental proceedings nor our compliance in 
general with environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings, or 
competitive position.  
 
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT  
 
Recruiting, developing, engaging, and protecting our workforce is critical to executing our strategy and achieving business s uccess. As 
of May 28, 2023 , we had approximately 34,000 employees around the globe, with approximately 16, 000 in the U.S. and 
approximately 18,000 located in our markets outside of the U.S. Our workforce is divided between approximately 13,000 employees 
dedicated to the production of our products and approximately 21, 000 non- production employe es.  
 
The efficient production of high- quality products and successful execution of our strategy requires a talented, skilled, and engaged 
team of employees. We work to equip our employees with critical skills and expand their contributions over time by providing a range 
of training and career development opportunities, including hands -on experiences via challenging work assignments and job rotations, 
coaching and mentoring opportunities, and training programs. To foster employee engagement and commitment, we follow a robust 
process to listen to employees, take action, and measure our progress with on -going employee conversations, transparent 
communications, and employee engagement surveys.  
 
We believe that fostering a culture of inclusion and belonging strengthens our ability to recruit talent and allows all of our employees 
to thrive and succeed. We actively cultivate a culture that acknowledges, respects, and values all dimensions of diversity – including 
gender, race, sexual orientation, ability, backgrounds, and beliefs. Ensuring diversity of input and perspectives is core to our business 
strategy, and we are committed to recruiting, retaining, developing, and advancing a workforce that reflects the diversity of  the 
consumers we serve . This commitment starts with our company leadership where women represent approximately 47 percent of our 
officer and director population, and approximately 22 percent of our officers and directors are racially or ethnically diverse.  We 
embed our culture of incl usion and belonging into our day- to-day ways of working through a number of programs to foster discussion, 
build empathy, and increase understanding.  
 
We are committed to maintaining a safe and secure workplace for our employees. We set specific safety standards to identify and 
manage critical risks. We use global safety management systems and employee training to ensure consistent implementation of s afety 
protocols and accurate measurement and tracking of incidents. To provide a safe and secure working environment for our employees, 
we prohibit workplace discrimination, and we do not tolerate abusive conduct or harassment. Our attention to the health and s afety of 
our workforce extends to the workers and communities in our supply chain. We believe that respect for human rights is fundamental to 
our strategy  and to our commitment to ethical business conduct.

ITEM 1A - Risk Factors  
  
Our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Any of the risks described below could materially, adversely affect our 
business, financial condition, and results of operations.  
 
Business and Industry Risks  
   
The categories in which we participate are very competitive, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our results of 
operations could be adversely  affected.  
  
The human and pet food categories in which we participate are very competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories are 
manufacturers, as well as retailers with their own branded and private label products. Competitors market and sell their products 
through brick- and-mortar stores and e -commerce. All of our principal competitors have substantial financial, marketing, and other 
resources. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with regional 
brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. Competition in our product catego ries is 
based on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognit ion and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity, 
convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. If our large 
competitors were to seek an advantage through pricing or promotional changes, we could choose to do the same, which could 
adversely affect our margins and profitability. If we did not do the same, our revenues and market share could be adversely a ffected. 
Our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in 
response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our competitors. If we are unable to build and sustain 
brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality, we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and 
private label products.  
  
We may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment.  
  
There has been significant consolidation in the grocery industry, resulting in customers with increased purchasing power. In addition, 
large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower prici ng, 
increased reliance on their own brand name products, increased emphasis on generic and other economy brands, and increased 
promotional programs. If we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovation, knowledge of consumers’ nee ds, 
and category leadership positions to respond to these demands, our profitability and volume growth could be negatively impacted. In 
addition, the loss of any large customer could adversely affect our sales and profits. In fiscal 2023, Walmart accounted for 21 percent 
of our consolidated net sales and 28 percent of  net sales of our North America Retail segment. For more information on significant 
customers, please see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.  
  
Price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials, packagin g, and energy may adversely affect our 
profitability.  
  
The principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such a s 
weather, climate change, product scarcity, limited sources of supply, com modity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, trade 
tariffs, pandemics, war (including international sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine), and changes in governmental 
agricultural and energy policies and regulations. Commodity prices have become, and may continue to be, more volatile. Commodity 
price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material, packaging, energy, and transportation costs. If we are unab le to 
increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices, we may experience reduced margins and profitability. We 
do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and the risk management procedures that we do use may not always work as 
we intend.  
 
 
9 Concerns with the safety and quality of our products could cause consumers to  avoid certain products or ingredients.  
  
We could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain of our 
products or ingredients. Adverse publicity about  these types of concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from 
buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.  
 
We may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends,  which may result in decreased demand for our 
products.  
  
Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes, eating habits, and purchasing behaviors of consumers and to offer 
products that appeal to their preferences in channels where they shop. Consumer pref erences and category -level consumption may 
change from time to time and can be affected by a number of different trends and other factors. If we fail to anticipate, ide ntify or 
react to these changes and trends, such as adapting to emerging e -commerce chan nels, or to introduce new and improved products on a 
timely basis, we may experience reduced demand for our products, which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to suffer. 
Similarly, demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium, 
trans fats, genetically modified organisms, sugar, processed wheat, grain- free or legume -rich pet food, or other product ingredients or 
attributes.  
  
We may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster  growing and more profitable categories.  
  
The food industry’s growth potential is constrained by population growth. Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our 
business faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve. One way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio 
by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories. Our future results will also depend on our ability 
to increase market share in our existing product categories. If we do not succeed in developing innovative products for new and 
existing categories, our growth and profitability could be adversely affected.  
 
Our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable p erception of our brands.  
  
Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our many iconic brands is critical to the success of our business. The value of our 
brands is based in large part on the degree to which consumers react and respond positively to these brands. Brand value could 
diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manne r, 
adverse publicity about our products, our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver 
consistently positive consumer experiences, concerns about food safety, or our products becoming unavailable to consumers. 
Consumer demand for our products may also be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or promotional support. The use of 
social and digital media by consumers, us, and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and 
opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands, or our products on social or digital media could seriously 
damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our business results could be  
negatively impacted.  
 
Operating Risks  
 
If we are not efficient in our production, our profitability could suffer as a  result of the highly competitive environment in 
which we operate.  
  
Our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and manufacture of our  products 
in hi ghly competitive markets. Gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time. Our failure to reduce costs 
through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions or divestitures could adversely affe ct our 
profitability and weaken our competitive position. Many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of manufacturi ng 
facilities and production lines. Such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production, which may negat ively 
impact product volume and margins. We periodically engage in restructuring and cost savings initiatives designed to increase our 
efficiency and reduce expenses. If we are unable to execute those initiatives as planned, we may not realize all or any of t he 
anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  
 
Disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business.  
  
Our ability to make, move, and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our 
manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, climate change, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, cyber -attack, pandemics, 
war, governmental restrictions or mandates, labor shortages, strikes, import/export re strictions, or other factors could impair our 
ability to manufacture or sell our products. Many of our product lines are manufactured at a single location or sourced from a single 
supplier. The failure of third parties on which we rely, including those third parties who supply our ingredients, packaging, capital 
equipment and other necessary operating materials, contract manufacturers, commercial transport, distributors, contractors, and 
 
10 external business partners, to meet their obligations to us, or signif icant disruptions in their ability to do so, may negatively impact our 
operations. Our suppliers’ policies and practices can damage our reputation and the quality and safety of our products. Disputes with 
significant suppliers, including disputes regarding  pricing or performance, could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our 
customers and could materially and adversely affect our sales, financial condition, and results of operations. Failure to take adequate 
steps to mitigate the likelihood o r potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly 
when a product is sourced from a single location or supplier, could adversely affect our business and results of operations, as well as 
require additional r esources to restore our supply chain.  
  
Short term or sustained increases in consumer demand at our retail customers may exceed our production capacity or otherwise strain 
our supply chain. Our failure to meet the demand for our products could adversely af fect our business and results of operations.  
  
Our international operations are subject to political and economic risks.  
  
In fiscal 202 3, 19 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the United States. We are accordingly subject to a 
number of risks relating to doing business internationally, any of which could significantly harm our business. These risks i nclude:  
  
• political and economic instability;  
• exchange controls and currency exchange rates;  
• tariffs on products and ingredients that we import and export;  
• nationalization or government control of operations;  
• compliance with anti -corruption regulations;  
• foreign tax treaties and policies; and  
• restriction on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentially negative tax consequences.  
  
Our financial performance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These fluctuations 
could cause material variations in our results of operations. Our principal exposures are to the Australian dollar, Brazilian  real, British 
pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen, Mexican pe so, and Swiss franc. From time to time, we enter 
into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations, but these agreements may not be 
effective in significantly reducing our exposure.  
  
A strengthening in the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in the countries in which we operate would negatively affect our 
reported results of operations and financial results due to currency translation losses and currency transaction losses.  
 
Our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or are breached.  
  
Information technology serves an important role in the efficient and effective operation of our business. We rely on information 
technology ne tworks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic information to manage a variety of 
business processes and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements. Our information technology systems and infrast ructure 
are critical to effectively manage our key business processes including digital marketing, order entry and fulfillment, supply chain 
management, finance, administration, and other business processes. These technologies enable internal and external communication 
among our locations, employees, suppliers, customers, and others and include the receipt and storage of personal information about 
our employees, consumers, and proprietary business information. Our information technology systems, some of which are dependent 
on services provided by third parties, may be vulnerable to damage, interruption, or shutdown due to any number of causes suc h as 
catastrophic events, natural disasters, fires, power outages, systems failures, telecommunications failures, security breaches, computer 
viruses, hackers, employee error or malfeasance, and other causes. Increased cyber -security threats pose a potential risk to the security 
and viability of our information technology systems, as well as the confidentiality, integrity, and  availability of the data stored on 
those systems. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and r esult in 
transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, data loss, legal claims or proceedings,  regulatory penalties, and the loss of sales and 
customers. Any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational, reputational, legal, and financial impacts 
that may have a material adverse effect on our business.  
 
Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results.  
  
From time to time, we evaluate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives. Our succ ess 
depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate acquired and existing operations. If we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions, 
our financial results could suffer. Additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include additional debt leverage,  the lo ss of 
key employees and customers of the acquired business, the assumption of unknown liabilities, the inherent risk associated wit h 
entering a geographic area or line of business in which we have no or limited prior experience, failure to achieve anticipated synergies, 
and the impairment of goodwill or other acquisition -related intangible assets.  
 
 
11 Legal and Regulatory Risks  
 
If our products become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled, we might  need to recall those items and may experience 
product liability claims if  consumers or their pets are injured.  
  
We may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled. A widespread product recall  could 
result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of 
product for a period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. A signifi cant product 
recall or product liability case could a lso result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in 
our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands.  
 
New regulations or regulatory- based claims could adversely affect our business.  
  
Our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Agricult ure, the 
Federal Food and Drug Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign 
governmental agencies relating to the production, packaging, labelling, storage, distribution, quality, and safety of food pr oducts and 
the health and safety of our employees. Our failure to comply with such law s and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, 
administrative penalties, and civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, and recalls of our products. We advertise our products and 
could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations. 
We may also be subject to new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise our products, including restrictions on the audience 
to whom products are marketed. Changes in laws or regu lations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase 
our cost of doing business or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected.  
   
We are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign envi ronmental laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with 
environmental laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies. We are current ly party to 
a variety of environmental remediation obligations. Due to r egulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation, and the risk of 
unidentified contaminants on current and former properties of ours, the potential exists for remediation, liability, indemnif ication, and 
compliance costs to differ from our esti mates. We cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these matters, or compliance with 
environmental laws in general, will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and 
results of operations.  
 
Climate change and other sustainability matters could adversely affect our business.  
 
There is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the earth’s atmosphere may have an adverse impact on 
global temperatures, weather patterns, and  the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters.  If such climate change 
has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may experience decreased availability and higher pricing for certain commodities 
that are necessary for our  products. Increased frequency or severity of extreme weather could also impair our production capabilities, 
disrupt our supply chain, impact demand for our products, and increase our insurance and other operating costs.  Increasing c oncern 
over climate ch ange or other sustainability issues also may adversely impact demand for our products due to changes in consumer 
preferences or negative consumer reaction to our commitments and actions to address these issues.  We may also become subject  to 
additional leg al and regulatory requirements relating to climate change or other sustainability issues, including greenhouse gas 
emission regulations (e.g., carbon taxes), energy policies, sustainability initiatives (e.g., single -use plastic limits), and disclosure 
obligations.  If additional legal and regulatory requirements are enacted and are more aggressive than the sustainability measures that 
we are currently undertaking to reduce our emissions and improve our energy efficiency and other sustainability goals, or if  we chose 
to take actions to achieve more aggressive goals, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operations.  
 
We have announced goals and commitments to reduce our carbon footprint. If we fail to achieve or improperly report on our progr ess 
toward achieving our carbon emissions reduction goals and commitments, then the resulting negative publicity could harm our 
reputation and adversely affect demand for our products.  
 
Financial and Economic Risks  
 
Volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices may  cause 
volatility in our gross margins and net earnings.  
  
We utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat, and 
corn), oils (principally soybean), dairy products, natural gas, and diesel fuel. Changes in the values of these derivatives a re recorded in 
earnings currently,  which may  result in volatility i n both gross margin and net earnings. These gains and losses are reported in cost of 
sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and in unallocated corporate items outside our segment operating results unt il we 
utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process, at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating 
 
12 profit. We also record our grain inventories at net realizable value. We may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting 
treatments.  
 
Economic down turns could limit consumer demand for our products.  
  
The willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on local economic conditions. In periods of economic 
uncertainty, consumers may purchase more generic, private label, and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases 
altogether. In those circumstances, we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to 
lower margin offerings. In addition, as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions, we may be unable to raise our prices 
sufficiently to protect margins. Consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at customers that 
purchase products from our North America  Foodservice segment. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of 
operations.  
  
We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could limit financing and other options and in some cases adversely 
affect our ability to pay dividends.  
  
As of May 28 , 202 3, we h ad total debt and noncontrolling interests of $ 12.0 billion. The agreements under which we have issued 
indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future. Our level of indebtedness may limit 
our: 
  
• ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, or general corporate purposes, particularly if 
the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; and  
• flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general 
economic conditions. 
  
There are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and noncontrolling interests. If we fail to comply 
with any of these requirements, the related indebtedness, and other unrelated indebtedness, could become due and payable prior to its 
stated maturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing may also be adversely affected.  
  
Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and financial 
performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, and other factors beyond our 
control.  
 
We depend on stable, liquid and well -functioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations. Our financial performance, our 
credit ratings, interest rates, the stability of financial institutions with which we partner, and the liquidity of the overa ll global capital 
markets could affect our access to, and the availability, terms and conditions, and cost of capital.  
   
Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit  pension, 
other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit costs.  
  
We sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the United States, Canada, and various foreign locations, including 
defined benefit pension, retiree health and welfare , severance, and other postemployment plans. Our major defined benefit pension 
plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in interest 
rates, mortality rates, health care costs, early retirement rates, investment returns, and the market value of plan assets can affect the 
funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requireme nts of the 
plans. A significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of 
operations and cash flows from operations.  
    
A change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-a verage cost of 
capital used to value our reporting units or our indefinite -lived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated 
results of operations and net worth.  
  
As of May 28, 2023, we had $21. 2 billion of goodwill and indefinite -lived int angible assets. Goodwill for each of our reporting units 
is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred.  We 
compare the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the 
reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fair 
value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our 
long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and othe r 
factors. If current expectations for growth rates for sales and profits are not met, or other market factors and macroeconomic 
conditions were to change, then our reporting units could become significantly impaired.  While we currently believe that our goodwill 
is not impaired, different assumptions r egarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses.  
 
13   
We evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets, primarily intangible assets associated with the  Blue Buffalo , 
Pillsbury , Totino’s , Old El Paso , Progresso , Annie’s , Nudges , and Häagen -Dazs  brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite -
lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of  
obsolescence, demand, competitio n, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, 
legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the 
level of required mainte nance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.  
  
Our indefinite -lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that impairment may have occurred. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model 
using inputs including projected revenues from our long- range plan, assumed royalty rates which could be payable if we did not own 
the brands, and a discount rate. If current expectations for growth rates for sales and margins are not met, or other market factors and 
macroeconomic conditions  were to change, then our indefinite -lived intangible assets could become significantly impaired. 
Our Progresso , EPIC , and Uncle Toby’s  brands had risk of decreasing coverage  and we continue to monitor these businesses.

this report.

15 ITEM 7  - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  
 
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  
 
We are a global packaged foods company. We develop distinctive value -added food products and market them under unique brand 
names. We work continuously to improve our core products and to create new products that meet consumers’ evolving needs and 
preferences. In addition , we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumer -directed marketing, innovative new 
products, and effective merchandising. We believe our brand -building approach is the key to winning and sustaining leading share 
positions in markets arou nd the globe. 
 
Our fundamental financial goal is to generate competitively differentiated returns for our shareholders over the long term. W e believe 
achieving that goal requires us to generate a consistent balance of net sales growth, margin expansion, cash conversion, and cash 
return to shareholders over time.  
 
Our long -term growth objectives are to deliver the following performance on average over time:  
 
• 2 to 3 percent annual growth in organic net sales;  
• mid-single -digit annual growth in adj usted operating profit;  
• mid- to high -single -digit annual growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS);  
• free cash flow conversion of at least 95 percent of adjusted net earnings after tax; and  
• cash return to shareholders of 80 to 90 percent of free c ash flow, including an attractive dividend yield.  
 
We are executing our Accelerate strategy to drive sustainable, profitable growth and top -tier shareholder returns over the long term.  
The strategy focuses on four pillars to create competitive advantages and win: boldly building brands, relentlessly innovating, 
unleashing our scale, and being a force for good. We are prioritizing our core markets, global platforms, and local gem brand s that 
have the best prospects for profitable growth,  and we are committe d to reshaping our portfolio with strategic acquisitions and 
divestitures to further enhance our growth profile.  
 
In fiscal 202 3, we continued to successfully adapt to the dynamic  operating environment  and deliver strong performance. This  
included  growth i n organic net sales, adjusted operating profit, and adjusted diluted EPS that was ahead of  our initial targets. We 
achieved each of the three priorities we established at the beginning of the year:   
 
We continued to compete effectively, including holding or growing market share in more than 50 percent of our global 
priority businesses  for the fifth consecutive year, when adjusting for an unusual competitive dynamic in cereal in fiscal 2022 
and assessing that platform on a 2 -year basis . We generated  organic net sales growth across each of our four operating 
segments, fueled by compelling brand building and innovation across our leading brands, and supported with strong levels of 
net price realization in response to 13 percent input cost inflation.  
 
We continued to invest for the future, including a 17 percent increase in media and advertising expense, a double -digit 
increase in investment in our digital and technology capability, and a strong increase in capital investment related to new 
growth capaci ty. 
 
We continued to reshape our portfolio, including closing on one acquisition and two divestitures that further improved our 
portfolio’s ability to generate profitable growth over the long term.  
 
Our consolidated net sales for fiscal 202 3 rose 6 percent  to $20 ,094 million. On an organic basis, net sales increased 10 percent 
compared to year -ago levels. Operating profit of $3 ,434 million was down 1 percent . Adjusted operating profit of $3,457  million 
increased 8 percent on a constant -currency basis.   Diluted EPS of $4. 31 was down  2 percent compared to fiscal 202 2 results. Adjusted 
diluted EPS of $ 4.30 increased 10 percent on a constant -currency basis ( See the “Non -GAAP Measures” section below for a 
description of  our use of measures not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)).  
 
Net cash provided by operations totaled $2,779 million in fiscal 2023 , representing a conversion rate of 106 percent of net earnings, 
including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. This cash generation supported capital investment s totaling 
$690 million, and our resulting free cash flow was $ 2,089  million at a conversion rate of 80 percent of adjusted net earnings, including 
earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. We returned cash to shareholders through dividends totaling $1,288

A detailed review of our fiscal 202 3 performance compared to fiscal 202 2 appears below in the section titled “Fiscal 202 3 
Consolidated Results of Operations.” A detailed review of our fiscal 2022  performance compared to our fiscal 202 1 performance is set 
forth in Part II, Item 7 of our Form 10 -K for the fiscal year ended May 30, 2022  under the caption “Management’s Discussion and  
 
16 Analysis of Financial Condition and Results  of Operations – Fiscal 2022  Results of Consolidated Operations,” which is incorporated 
herein by reference.  
 
In fiscal 2024 , we expect to build on our positive momentum and continue to advance our Accelerate strategy.  Our key priorities are 
to continue t o compete effectively, to improve our supply chain efficiency, and to maintain our disciplined approach to capital 
allocation. We expect the largest factors impacting our performance in fiscal 202 4 will be the economic health of consumers, the 
moderating rate of input cost inflation , and the increasing stability of the supply chain environment. We expect to drive organic net 
sales growth in fiscal 2024 through strong marketing, innovation, in- store support, and  net price realization generated th rough our 
Strategic Revenue Management (SRM) capability, most of which will be carried over from SRM actions taken in fiscal 2023.  For the 
full year, input cost inflation is expected to be approximately 5  percent of total cost of goods sold, driven primari ly by labor inflation 
that continues to impact sour cing, manufacturing, and logistics costs. We expect to generate  higher levels of  Holistic Margin 
Management (HMM) cost savings compared to fiscal 2023.  
 
Based on these assumptions, our key full-year fiscal 202 4 targets are summarized below: 
 
• Organic net sales are expected to increase 3 to 4 percent.  
• Adjusted operating profit is expected to increase 4 to 6 percent in constant -currency from the base of $3 ,457 million reported 
in fiscal 2023 . 
• Adjusted diluted EPS are expected to range between 4 to 6 percent in constant -currency from the base of $4.30 earned in 
fiscal 2023. 
• Free cash flow conversion is expected to be at least 9 5 percent of adjusted after -tax earnings.

FISCAL 2023 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
 
In fiscal 2023, net sales increased 6  percent  compared to fiscal 202 2 and organic net sales increased 10 percent  compared to last year. 
Operating profit decreased  1 percent to $3 ,434 million primarily driven by higher input costs, a decrease in contributions from volume 
growth, an unfavorable change to the mark- to-market valuation of certain commodities positions and grain inventories,  and an 
increase in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses, including increased media and advertising expenses , partially offset 
by favorable net price realization and mix. Operating profit ma rgin of 17.1 percent decreased  120 basis points . Adjusted operating 
profit of $3, 457 million increased  8 percent  on a constant -currency basis , primarily driven by favorable net price realization and mix, 
partially offset by higher input costs, a decrease in contributions from volume growth and an increase  in SG&A expenses , including 
increased media and advertising expenses . Adjusted operating p rofit margin increased  30 basis points to 17.2 percent. Diluted earnings 
per share of $4. 31 decreased  2 percent compared to fiscal 20 22. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.30 increased 10 percent on a 
constant -currency basis  (see the “Non -GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by 
GAAP).

Organic net sales in fiscal 2023 increased 10 percent compared to fiscal 2022 , driven by favorable organic net price realization and 
mix, partially offset by a decrease in contributions from  organic  volume growth.  
 
Cost of sales increased $958 million  in fiscal 2023 to $13,548 million.  The increase  was primarily  driven by a $1, 454 million increase 
attributable to product rate and mix, partially offset by a  $950 million decrease due to lower volume. We recorded a $292  million  net 
increase in cost of sales related to mark -to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories in fiscal 2023 , 
compared to a net decrease of $133 million in fiscal 202 2 (please see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this 
report  for additional information) . In fiscal 2023, we recorded a $25 million charge related to a voluntary recall on certain 
international Häagen- Dazs  ice cream products . We also recorded $5 million of restructuring charges and $2 million of restructuring 
initiative project- related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2023 compared to $3 million of restructuring charges in cost of sales in fiscal 
2022 (please see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information).  
 
Gross margin increased  2 percent  in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. Gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased 1 10 basis 
points to 32.6 percent compared to fiscal 2022.   
 
SG&A expenses  increased $353  million to $3,500 million  in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022  primarily driven by increased media 
and advertising expenses, unfavorable valuation adjustments and the loss on sale of certain corporate investments, an increase in 
certain compensation and benefits expenses , and an increase in charitable contributions in fiscal 2023.  SG&A expenses as a percent of 
net sales in fiscal 2023  increased 80 basis points  compared to fiscal 2022.  
 
Divestiture s gain, net  totaled  $445 million  in fiscal 2023  primarily related  to the sale of our Helper main meals and Suddenly Salad 
side dishes business. In fiscal 2022, we recorded a  $194 million divestitures gain related to  the sale of our interest in Yoplait SAS, 
Yoplait marques SNC and Liberté Marques Sàrl and our European dough businesses  (please refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report).  
 
Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs  (recoveries)  totaled $ 56 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $ 26 million  of net 
recoveries in fiscal 202 2. In fiscal 2023 , we a pproved  restructuring actions  to enhance the efficiency of our global supply chain  
structure and to optimize our Häagen -Dazs shops network,  and as a result, we recorded $ 41 million  of charges in fiscal 2023. In fiscal 
2022 , we approved restructuring actions  in the International segment to drive efficiencies in manufacturing and logistics operations  
and recorded $12 million of charges . Please see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in  Item 8 of this report for additional 
information.  
 
 
18 Benefit  plan  non-service income  totaled $89 million  in fiscal 2023 compared to $113 million  in fiscal 2022, primarily reflecting an 
increase in interest costs, partially offset by lower amortization of losses and higher expected return on plan assets  (please see Note 14 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information ). 
 
Interest, net for fiscal 2023 totaled $382 million, $ 2 million higher than fiscal 2022 . 
 
Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2023  was 19.5  percent compared to 18.3 percent in fiscal 2022.  The 1.2 percentage point increase was 
primarily d riven by a  change in  the valuation allowance on our capital loss carryforward s in fiscal 2022 , partially offset by certain 
favorable discrete tax items in fi scal 2023 . Our adjusted effective tax rate was 20.4 percent in fiscal 2023 compared to 20.9 percent in 
fiscal 2022 (see the “Non -GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP).  The 0.5 
percentage point decrease w as primarily due to certain favorable discrete tax items in fiscal 2023.  
 
After -tax earnings from joint ventures decreased  to $81  million  in fiscal 2023  compared  to $112 million in fiscal 2022, primarily 
driven by higher input costs at CPW and HDJ and lower net sales at HDJ , partially offset by  favorable net price realization and mix at 
CPW.  On a constant -currency basis, after -tax earnings from joint ventures de creased 18 percent (see the “Non -GAAP Measures” 
section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). The components of our joint ventures’ net sales growth

Net earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests  decreased  to $16 million  in fiscal 2023 compared to $28 
million in  fiscal 20 22, primarily driven  by the sale of our interests in Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, and Liberté Marques Sàrl in 
fiscal 2022 . 
 
Average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 11  million  in fiscal 2023 from fiscal 2022 primarily due to share repurchase s, 
partially offset by option exercises .  
 
RESULTS OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS 
 
Our businesses are organized into four operating segments: North America Retail, International, Pet, and North America Foodservice . 
 
In fiscal 2022, we completed a new organization structure  to streamline our global operations. We restated our net sales by segment 
and segment operating profit to reflect our new operating segments. These segment changes had no effect on previously reporte d 
consolidated net sales, operating profit, net earnings attributable to General Mills, or earnings per share.

UNALLOCATED CORPORATE ITEMS  
 
Unallocated corporate items include corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentiv es, 
certain charitable contributions, restructuring initiative project- related costs, gains and losses on corporate investments, an d other 
items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance. Th ese include gains and losses arising from the  
revaluation of certain grain inventories and gains and losses from  mark -to-market valuation of certain commodity positions until 
passed back to our operating segments. These items affecting operating profit are centrally managed at the corporate level and are 
excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by executive management. Under our supply chain organization, our 
manufacturing, warehouse, and distribution activities are substantially integrated across our operations in order to maximize  efficiency 
and productivity. As a result, fixed assets and depreciation and amortization expenses are neither maintained nor available by 
operating segment.  
 
Unallocated corporate expense totaled $1,033 million in fiscal 2023, compared to $403 million last year. We recorded a $292  million 
net increase in expense related to the mark -to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories in fiscal 2023,

and the sale of corporate investments in fiscal 2023, compared to $15 million of net losses in fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2023, we recorded a 
$22 million net charge related to a voluntary recall on certain international Häagen -Dazs  ice cream products. In addition, we recorded 
$6 million of integration costs primarily related to our acquisition of TNT Crust in fiscal 2023, compared to $22 million of integration 
costs related to our acquisition of Tyson Foods’ pet treats business  in fiscal 2022 . In fiscal 2022, we recorded $73 million of 
transaction costs primarily related to the sale of our interests in Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, Liberté Marques Sàrl and the sale 
of our European dough businesses. In addition, we recorded a $22 million recovery related to a Brazil indirect tax item and a $13 
million insurance recovery in fiscal 2022. In addition, certain compensation and benefits expenses and charitable contributions 
increased in fiscal 2023  compared to fiscal 2022 . 
 
IMPACT OF INFLATION  
 
We experienced broad based global input cost inflation of 13 percent in fiscal 202 3 and 8 percent in fiscal 202 2. We expect 
approximately 5 percent input cost inflation  in fiscal 202 4. We attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through HMM, SRM, 
planning , and operating practices. Our  market risk management practices are discussed in Item 7A of this report.  
 
LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  
 
The primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from operations. Over the most recent two -year period, our operations have generated 
$6.1 billion  in cash. A substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned to shareholders through dividends and share 
repurchases. We also use cash from operations to fund our capital expenditures, acquisitions, and debt service. We typically use a 
 
24 combination of cash, notes payable, and long -term debt, and occasionally issue shares of common stock, to finance significant 
acquisitions.   
 
As of May 28, 2023, we had $ 381 million  of cash and cash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions. In anticipation of repatriating 
funds from foreign jurisdictions, we record local country withholding taxes on our international earnings, as applicable. We may 
repatriate our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries without such funds being subject to further U.S. income tax 
liability. Earnings prior to fiscal 2018 from our foreign subsidiaries remain permanently reinvested in those jurisdictions.

During fiscal 2023 , cash provided by operations was $ 2,779 million  compared to $3,316  million  in the same period last year. The 
$538 million  decrease was primarily driven by a $326  million  change in current assets and liabilities  and a $ 250 million change in  net 
divestitures gain . The $326 million  change in current assets and liabilities was primarily driven by a $233 million change  in 
inventories  and a $257 million change  in accounts payable , partially offset by a $1 25 million change in the timing of accounts  
receivable. 
 
We strive to grow core working capital at or below the rate of growth in our net sales. For fiscal 2023, core working capital  net 
liability decreased  20 percent , compared to a net sales increase of 6 percent. The core working capital net liability decrease d $84 
million from a net liability of $423 million in fiscal 2022 to a net liability of $339 million in fiscal 2023. The $84 million net liability 
decrease  was primarily due to a n increase  in inventories, partially offset by a n increase in accounts payable in fiscal 2023.

Uncommitted credit facilities   0.6   - 
Total committed and uncommitted credit facilities  $ 3.3  $ - 
 
To ensure availability of funds, we maintain bank credit lines and have commercial paper programs available to us in the Unit ed States 
and Europe.  
 
We have material contractual obligations that arise in the normal course of business and we believe that cash flows from operations 
will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months . 
 
 
26 Certain of our long -term debt agreements, our cred it facilities, and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. As of 
May 28, 2023, we were in compliance  with all of these covenants.    
 
We have $1,709 million of long -term debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current, including $500 million of 3.65 
percent fixed -rate notes due February 15, 2024, $400 million of floating -rate notes due October 17, 2023, €500 million of floating -rate 
notes due July 27, 2023,  and €250 million of floating- rate notes due November 10,  2023 . We believe that cash flows from operations, 
together with available short - and long -term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the 
next 12 months . 
 
As of May 28, 2023, our total debt, including the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges, was 80 percent in fixed -rate 
and 20 percent in floating -rate instruments, compared to 77 percent in fixed -rate and 23 percent in floating -rate instrume nts on May 
29, 2022.   
 
The third -party holder of the General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) Class A Interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from 
available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate to the holder’s capita l account balance established in 
the most recent mark -to-market valuation (currently $252  million ). The  floating preferred return rate on GMC’s Class A Interests is 
the sum of three -month Term SOFR plus 1 86 basis points. The preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated 
agreement with the Class A Interest holder or through a remarketing auction.  
 
We have an option to purchase the Class  A Interests for consideration equal to the the n current capital account value, plus any unpaid 
preferred return and the prescribed make -whole amount. If we purchase these interests, any change in the third -party holder’s capital 
account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to 
calculate EPS in that period.  
 
CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  
 
For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, please see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements  in Item 8  
of this report. Our critical  accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financ ial condition and 
results of operations. These estimates include our accounting for revenue recognition, valuation of long- lived assets, intangible assets,  
stock -based compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, a nd postemployment benefit plans.  
 
Revenue Recognition  
Our revenues are reported net of variable consideration and consideration payable to our customers, including trade promotion , 
consumer coupon redemption,  and other reductions to the transaction price, including estimated allowances for returns, unsalable 
product, and prompt pay discounts. Trade promotions are recorded using significant judgment of estimated participation and 
performance levels for offered programs at the time of sale. Differences betwee n the estimated and actual reduction to the transaction 
price are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period. Our accrued trade and coupon promotion liabilities were 
$394 million  as of May 28, 2023, and $420  million  as of May 29, 2022. Because these amounts are significant, if our estimates are 
inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a significant effect on our results of ope rations.  
 
Valuation of Long -Lived Assets  
We estim ate the useful lives of long -lived assets and make estimates concerning undiscounted cash flows to review for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recover able. 
Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals, as appropriate.  
 
Intangible Assets  
Goodwill and other indefinite -lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and 
whenever events o r changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Our estimates of fair value for goodwill 
impairment testing are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. We use inputs from our long- range planning process to 
determine growth rates for sales and profits. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market 
comparables, and other factors.  
 
We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite -lived. Reaching a 
determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, 
competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results 
in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required mai ntenance 
expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Intangible assets that are deemed to have finite lives are 
amortized on a straight- line basis over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years. Our estimate of the fair value of our 
brand assets is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which include projected revenues from our long- range plan, 
assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate.  
 
 
27 As of May 28, 2023, we had $21  billion  of goodwill and indefinite -lived intangible assets. While we curre ntly believe that the fair 
value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value , and that those intangibles will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, materially 
different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weight ed-average cost of capital could result in 
material impairment losses and amortization expense. We performed our fiscal 202 3 assessment of our intangible assets as of the first 
day of the second quarter of fiscal 2023 , and we determined there was no impairment of our intangible assets as their related fair 
values were substantially in excess of the carrying value , except for Uncle Toby’s band intangible asset. In addition, while having 
significant coverage as of our fiscal 2023 assessment date, the Pr ogresso and EPIC  brand intangible assets had risk of decreasing 
coverage. We will continue to monitor these businesses for potential impairment.  
 
Stock -based Compensation  
The valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that ar e likely to 
have a material impact on our financial statements. Annually, we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock pri ce volatility, 
employee exercise behavior, dividend yield, and the forfeiture rate. For more information on these assumptions, please see Note 12 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.  
 
The estimated fair values of stock options  granted and the assumptions used for the Black- Scholes option -pricing model were as 
follows:  
 
 Fiscal Year  
 2023   2022   2021  
Estimated fair values of stock options granted  $ 14.16    $ 8.77   $ 8.03  
Assumptions:             
Risk-free interest rate   3.3 %   1.5 %   0.7 % 
Expected term   8.5 years    8.5 years    8.5 years  
Expected volatility   20.9 %   20.2 %   19.5 % 
Dividend yield   3.1 %   3.4 %   3.3 % 
 
The risk -free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury zero- coupon yield curve in 
effect at the time of grant. An increase in the expected term by 1 year, leaving all other assumptions constant, would decrease the grant 
date fair value by less than 1 percent . If all other assumptions are held constant, a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2023 
volatility assumption would increase the grant date fair value of our fiscal 2023 option awards by 5 percent.  
 
To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions, we are not required to true up grant -date fair value -based expense to 
final intrinsic values. Historical data has a significant bearing on our forward- looking assumptions. Significant  variances between 
actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions, which could then significantly impact  the year -
over-year comparability of stock -based compensation expense.  
 
Any corporate income tax benefit realize d upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings 
(referred to as a windfall tax benefit) is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating cash flow. The actual 
impact on future years’ cash flows will depend, in part, on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and 
the relationship between the exercise -date market value of the underlying stock and the original grant -date fair value previously 
determined for financial reporting purposes.  
 
Realized windfall tax benefits and shortfall tax deficiencies related to the exercise or vesting of stock -based awards are recognized in 
the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Because employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control, it is possible that 
significantly different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail.  
 
Income Taxes  
We apply a more -likely -than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertai n tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize 
the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in 
judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positio ns will affect earnings in the period of such change. For 
more information on income taxes, please see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.  
 
Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement Benefit, and Postemployment Ben efit Plans  
We have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. 
We also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. Under certain 
circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits, primarily severance, to former and inactive employees in the United States , 
Canada, and Mexico. Please see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for a description of our 
defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans.  
 
28  
We recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants’ active working lives. 
Accordingly, we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of o ur 
obligations. Assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our ne t 
periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the long -term rates of return on plan assets, the 
interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans, and health care cost trend rates.  
 
Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets  
 
Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long- term investment performance, our 
estimate of future long -term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries, investment se rvices, and investment managers), and 
long-term inflation assumptions. We review this assumption annually for each plan; however, our annual investment performance for 
one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation.  
 
Our hi storical investment returns (compound annual growth rates) for our United States defined benefit pension and other 
postretirement benefit plan assets were a 5.7 percent loss in the 1- year period ended May 28, 2023 and returns of 3.4 percent, 5.9 
percent, 5.5 percent, and 7.7 percent for the 5, 10, 15, and 20 -year periods ended May 28, 2023.  
 
On a weighted -average basis, the expected rate of return for all defined b enefit plans was 6.70 percent  for fiscal 2023 , 5.85 percent for 
fiscal 2022, and 5.72 percent for fiscal 2021 . For fiscal 2024, we increased our weighted -average expected rate of return on plan assets 
for our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the United States to 7.20 percent due  to higher prospective 
long-term asset returns primarily on fixed income investments.  
 
Lowering the expected long -term rate of return on assets by 100 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement 
expense by $6 2 million  for fiscal 2024.  A market -related valuation bas is is used to reduce year- to-year expense volatility. The market -
related valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a five- year period from the year in which they occur. Investment 
gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market -related value of assets and 
the actual return based on the market- related value of assets. Our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our 
determination of annual expense or income.  
 
Discou nt Rates  
 
We estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense for our United States and most of ou r 
international defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans utilizing a full yield curve 
approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected 
cash flows. Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of May  31 for our defined benefit pension, other postretirement 
benefit, and postemployment benefit plan obligations. We work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of 
expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using the Aa Above Median corporate bond yi eld, to develop a forward interest 
rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future 
cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions.  
 
Our weighted -average discount rates were as follows:  
 
 Defined Benefit 
Pension Plans   Other 
Postretirement 
Benefit Plans   Postemployment 
Benefit Plans  
Effective rate for fiscal 2024 service costs  5.27 %  5.15 %  5.00 % 
Effective rate for fiscal 2024 interest costs  5.06 %  4.96 %  4.61 % 
Obligations as of May 31, 2023  5.18 %  5.19 %  4.55 % 
Effective rate for fiscal 2023 service costs  4.57 %  4.41 %  3.69 % 
Effective rate for fiscal 2023 interest costs  4.03 %  3.80 %  3.35 % 
Obligations as of May 31, 2022  4.39 %  4.36 %  3.62 % 
Effective rate for fiscal 2022 service costs  3.53 %  3.34 %  2.46 % 
Effective rate for fiscal 2022 interest costs  2.42 %  2.08 %  1.48 % 
 
Lowering the discount rates by 100 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and 
postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2024 by approximately $30  million . All obligation -related experience gains and losses 
are amortized using a straight- line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or over the average 
remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan is vi ewed as “all or almost  all” inactive participants.  
 
 
29 Health Care Cost Trend Rates  
 
We review our health care cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims expe rience 
and information provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience 
and projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to 
remain consistent with t his review, recent experiences, and short -term expectations. Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption 
is 6.6 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 6.6 percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2023. Rates are gr aded down 
annually until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5 percent is reached in 20 32 for all retirees. The  trend rates are applicable for calculations 
only if the retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, a s necessary, to 
approximate the current economic view on the rate of long -term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed 
trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans.  
 
Any arising health care claims cost- related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims. Once 
recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight- line method over the average remaining  service period of active 
plan participants or over the average remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan is viewed as “all or almost all” 
inactive participants.  
 
Financial Statement Impact  
 
In fiscal 2023, we recorded net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income of 
$6 million  compared to $26 million  of income in fiscal 2022 and $4 million  of expense in fiscal 2021. As of May 28, 2023, we had 
cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of $2 billion  on our defined benefit pension plans and cumulative unrecognized actuarial 
net gains of $ 189 million  on our postretirement and postemployment benefit plans, mainly as the result of liability increases from 
lower historical interest rates. These unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in increases in our future pension and postretirement 
benefit expenses because they currently exceed the corridors defined by GAAP.  
 
Actual future net defined benefit pension, other post retirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will 
depend on investment performance, changes in future discount rates, changes in health care cost trend rates, and other factor s related 
to the populations participating in these plan s. 
 
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  
 
In December 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued optional accounting guidance for a limited period of 
time to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The new standard provides expedients and exceptions to 
existing accounting requirements for contract modifications and hedge accounting related to transitioning from discontinued reference 
rates, such as LIBOR, to alternative reference rates, if certain criteria are met. The new accounting requirements can be app lied 
through December 31, 2024. We have reviewed and modified c ertain contracts, where necessary, to apply a new reference rate, 
primarily the SOFR. The guidance has not had and is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial 
position. We will continue to review our contracts and a rrangements that will be affected by a discontinued reference rate during the 
transition period.  
 
In September 2022, the FASB  issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022- 04 requiring enhanced disclosures related to supplier 
financing programs. The ASU requires disclosure of the key terms of the program and a rollforward of the related obligation during 
the annual period, including the amount of obligations confirmed and obligations subsequently paid. The new disclosure requir ements 
are effective for  fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with the exception of the rollforward requirement, which is effective 
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2024 for the primary requirem ent and the 
first quarter of fiscal 2025 for the rollforward requirement. Early adoption is permitted. We have historically presented the  key terms 
of these programs and the associated obligation outstanding. We do not expect this ASU to have a material impact on our financial 
statements and related disclosures.  
 
NON -GAAP MEASURES  
 
We have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by GAAP. We believe that these measures 
provide useful information to investors and include these measures in other communications to investors.   
 
For each of these non- GAAP financial measures, we are providing below a reconciliatio n of the differences between the non -GAAP 
measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure, an explanation of why we believe the non -GAAP measure provides useful 
information to investors, and any additional material purposes for which our management or Board of Directors uses the non -GAAP 
measure. These non -GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the comparable GAAP measure.  
 
 
30 Significant Items Impacting Comparability  
 
Several measures below are presented on an adjusted basis. The adjustments are either items resulting from infrequently occurring 
events or items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the year -to-year assessment of operating results.

Organic Net Sales Growth Rates  
 
We provide organic net sales growth rates for our consolidated net sales and segment net sales. This measure is used in repor ting to 
our Board of Directors and executive management and as a component of the measurement of our performance for incentive 
compensation purposes. We believe that organic net sales growth rates provide useful information to investors because they pr ovide 
transparency to underlying performance in our net sales by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as 
well as acquisitions, divestitures, and a 53rd week, when applicable, have on year- to-year comparability. A reconciliation of these 
measures to reported net sales growth rates, the relevant GAAP measures, are included in o ur Consolidated Results of Operations and 
Results of Segment Operations discussions in the MD&A above.  
 
 
31 Adjusted Operating Profit and Related  Constant- currency Growth Rate  
 
This measure is used in reporting to our Board of Directors and executive management and as a component of the measurement of our 
performance for incentive compensation purposes. We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is 
the operating profit measure we use to evaluate operating profit performance  on a comparable year -to-year basis. Additionally, the 
measure is evaluated on a constant- currency basis by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on 
year-to-year comparability given the volatility in foreign currency ex change rates.    
 
Our adjusted operating profit growth on a constant -currency basis is calculated as follows:

Forward -Looking Financial Measures  
 
Our fiscal 2024  outlook for organic net sales growth, constant -currency adjusted operating profit, adjusted diluted EPS, and free cash 
flow conversion are non- GAAP financial measures that exclude, or have otherwise been adjusted for, items impacting comparability, 
includ ing the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, restructuring charges and project -related costs, acquisition 
transaction and integration costs, acquisitions, divestitures, and mark -to-market effects. We are not able to reconcile these forwar d-
looking non -GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable forward -looking GAAP financial measures without 
unreasonable efforts because we are unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact of changes in f oreign 
 
37 currency exchange rates and commodity prices or the timing or impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and restructuring actions 
throughout fiscal 202 4. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on our fiscal 2024  GAAP financial results.  
 
For f iscal 2024 , we currently expect: foreign currency exchange rates (based on a blend of forward and forecasted rates and hedge 
positions) and acquisitions  and divestitures  completed prior to fiscal 2024 to reduce net sales growth by approximately one half of one 
percent; and restructuring charges to total approximately $15 million to $20 million.   
 
ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  
 
We are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices. 
Changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows. In the normal course of business, we actively 
manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions, authorized under established policies that 
place controls on these activities. The counterparties in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions. We esta blish credit 
limits for each counterparty. Our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of derivative financial instruments. For 
information on interest rate, foreign exchange, commodity price, and equity instrument risk, please see Note 8 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.  
 
VALUE AT RISK  
 
The estimates in the table below are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adver se 
changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, and equity prices under normal market conditio ns. A 
Monte Carlo value -at-risk (VAR) methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures. The models assumed normal 
market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level.  
 
The VAR calculation used historical interest and foreign exchange  rates, and commodity and equity prices from the past year to 
estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future. The market data were drawn from the RiskMetri cs™ data 
set. The calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur. Further, since the hedging 
instrument (the derivative) inversely correlates with the underlying exposure, we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of 
our derivatives would be generally offset by a n increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposure. The positions 
included in the calculations were: debt; investments; interest rate swaps; foreign exchange forwards; commodity swaps, future s, and 
options; and equity instruments. The calc ulations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities or equity- related 
positions that are offset by these market -risk-sensitive instruments.  
 
The table below presents the estimated maximum potential VAR arising from a one -day loss in fa ir value for our interest rate, foreign 
currency, commodity, and equity market -risk-sensitive instruments outstanding as of May 28, 2023.

40 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors  
General Mills, Inc.:  
 
Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of General Mills, Inc.  and subsidiaries (the Company) as of 
May 28, 2023 , and May 29, 2022 , the related consolidat ed statements of earnings, comprehensive income, total equity and redeemable 
interest, and cash flows for each of the years in the three- year period ended May 28, 2023 , and the related notes and financial 
statement schedule II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over 
financial reporting as of May 28, 2023 , based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organ izations of the Treadway Commission.  
 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financi al position of 
the Company as of May  28, 2023 , and May 29 , 202 2, and the results of its opera tions and its cash flows for each of the years in the 
three -year period ended May  28, 2023 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the 
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 28, 2023 , based on criteria 
established in Internal Control –  Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 
Treadway Commission.  
 
Basis for Opinions  
 
The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over 
financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in th e 
accompanyi ng Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based o n our 
audit s. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) 
and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the ap plicable 
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.  
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the a udits 
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether t he consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to 
error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  
 
Our audits of the consolidated financial statem ents included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the 
consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such 
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well 
as evaluating the overall presentation o f the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting 
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness  exists, and 
testing and evaluating  the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included 
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable 
basis for our  opinions.  
 
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  
 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the rel iability of 
financial reporting and the prepar ation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records tha t, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial stat ements in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in 
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect 
on the financial statements.  
 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or dete ct misstatements. Also, projections 
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of c hanges in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  
 
41  
Critical Audit Matter  
 
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements 
that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are 
material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgmen ts. The 
communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way ou r opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a 
whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit m atter or 
on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.  
 
Valuation of goodwill and brand intangible assets  
 
As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the goodwill and brands and other indefinite -lived intangibles 
balances as of May 2 8, 2023 , were $14, 511.2 million and $6,712.4 million,  respectively. The impairment tests for these 
assets, which are performed annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have 
occurred, require the Company to estimate the fair value of the reporting units to which goodwi ll is assigned as well as the 
brands and other indefinite -lived intangible assets. The fair value estimates are derived from discounted cash flow analyses 
that require the Company to make judgments about highly subjective matters, including future operatin g results, including 
revenue growth rates and operating margins, and an estimate of the discount rates and royalty rates.  
 
We identified the assessment of the valuation of certain goodwill and brand intangible assets as a critical audit matter. The re 
was a significant degree of judgment required in evaluating audit evidence, which consists primarily of forward -looking 
assumptions about future operating results, specifically the revenue growth rates and operating margins, royalty rates and 
subjective in puts used to estimate the discount rates.  
 
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and 
tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls related to the valuation of goodwill  and brand intangible assets. This 
included controls related to the assumptions about future operating results and the discount and royalty rates used to measur e 
the fair value of the  reporting units and brands intangible  assets . We performed sensitivity a nalyses over the revenue growth 
rates, operating margins, brand royalty rates and discount rates to assess the impact of other points within a range of potential 
assumptions. We evaluated the revenue growth rates and operating margin assumptions by compari ng them to recent 
financial performance and external market and industry data. We evaluated whether these assumptions were consistent with 
evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. We involved professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who a ssisted 
in the evaluation of the Company’s discount rates by comparing them against rate ranges that were independently developed 
using publicly available market data for comparable entities and the royalty rates by evaluating the methods, assumptions and 
market data used to estimate the royalty rate s.

47 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  
GENERAL MILLS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  
 
NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND RECLASSIFICATIONS 
 
Basis of Presentation  
Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of General Mills, Inc. and all subsidiaries in which we have a controlling 
financial interest. Intercompany transactions and accounts, including any noncontrolling and redeemable interests’ share of t hose 
transactions, are eliminated in consolidation.  
 
Our fi scal year ends on the last Sunday in May.  Our India business is on an April fiscal year end.  
 
Certain reclassifications to our previously reported financial information have been made to conform to the current period 
presentation.   
 
NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents  
We consider all investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  
 
Inventories  
All inventories in the United States other than grain are valued at th e lower of cost, using the last- in, first -out (LIFO) method, or 
market. Grain inventories are valued at net realizable value, and all related cash contracts and derivatives are valued at fair value, with 
all net changes in value recorded in earnings currently.  
 
Inventories outside of the United States are generally valued at the lower of cost, using the first -in, first -out (FIFO) method, or net 
realizable value.  
 
Shipping costs associated with the distribution of finished product to our customers are recorded as cost of sales and are recognized 
when the related finished product is shipped to and accepted by the customer.  
 
Land, Buildings, Equipment, and Depreciation  
Land is recorded at historical cost. Buildings and equipment, including capitalized in terest and internal engineering costs, are recorded 
at cost and depreciated over estimated useful lives, primarily using the straight -line method. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are 
charged to cost of sales. Buildings are usually depreciated over 40 years, and equipment, furniture, and software are usually 
depreciated over 3 to 10 years. Fully depreciated assets are retained in buildings and equipment until disposal. When an item  is sold or 
retired, the accounts are relieved of its cost and related accumu lated depreciation and the resulting gains and losses, if any, are 
recognized in earnings.  
 
Long- lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an 
asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash 
flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group. Asset groups have 
identifiable cash flows and are largely independent of other asset groups. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the 
excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using a discounted cash flow model or 
independent appraisals, a s appropriate.  
 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  
Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that impairment may have occurred. We perform our annual goodwill a nd indefinite -lived intangible assets impairment test as 
of the first day of the second quarter of the fiscal year. Impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units. W e compare 
the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to t he fair value of the unit. Carrying value is based on the assets and 
liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate ite ms among 
reporting units. If the carrying amount of a reportin g unit exceeds its fair value, impairment has occurred. We recognize an 
impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value up to the total am ount of 
goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Our estim ates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth 
rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our long -range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, 
perpetuity growth assumptions, market co mparables, and other factors.  
 
We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite- lived. Reaching a 
determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, 
competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results 
 
48 in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes  in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance 
expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Intangible assets that are deemed to have finite live s are 
amortized on a straight- line basis, over their useful lives, ge nerally ranging from 4 to 30 years.  
 
Our indefinite -lived intangible assets, mainly intangible assets primarily associated with the Blue Buffalo,  Pillsbury , Totino’s , Old El 
Paso , Progresso , Annie’s , Nudges , and  Häagen- Dazs  brands, are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands is b ased on a 
discounted cash flow model using inputs which included projected revenues from our long- range plan, assumed royalty rates that 
could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate.  
 
Our finite -lived intangible assets, primarily acquired  customer relationships, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized  when 
estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset. 
Assets generally have identifiable cash flows and are largely independent of other assets. Measurement of an impairment loss would 
be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. Fair value is measured using a discounted cash flow 
model or other similar valuation model, as appropriate.  
 
Leases  
We determine whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. When our lease arrangements incl ude lease and non -lease components, 
we account for lease and non -lease components (e.g. common area maintenance) separately based on their relative standalone prices.  
 
Any lease arrangements with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, and we 
recognize lease costs for these lease arrangements on a straight- line basis over the lease term. Many of our lease arrangements provide 
us with options to exercise one or more renewal terms or to terminate the lease arr angement. We include these options when we are 
reasonably certain to exercise them in the lease term used to establish our right of use assets and lease liabilities. Genera lly, our lease 
agreements do not include an option to purchase the leased asset, res idual value guarantees, or material restrictive covenants.  
 
We have certain lease arrangements with variable rental payments. Our lease arrangements for our Häagen -Dazs retail shops often 
include rental payments that are based on a percentage of retail sal es. We have other lease arrangements that are adjusted periodically 
based on an inflation index or rate. The future variability of these payments and adjustments are unknown, and therefore they are not 
included as minimum lease payments used to determine o ur right of use assets and lease liabilities. Variable rental payments are 
recognized in the period in which the obligation is incurred.  
 
As most of our lease arrangements do not provide an implicit interest rate, we apply an incremental borrowing rate ba sed on the 
information available at the commencement date of the lease arrangement to determine the present value of lease payments.  
 
Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures  
Our investments in companies over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence are stated at cost plus our share of 
undistributed earnings or losses. We receive royalty income from certain joint ventures, incur various expenses (primarily re search 
and development), and record the tax impact of certain joint venture operations that are structured as partnerships. In addition, we 
make advances to our joint ventures in the form of loans or capital investments. We also sell certain raw materials, semi -finished 
goods, and finished goods to the joint ventures, generally at  market prices.  
 
In addition, we assess our investments in our joint ventures if we have reason to believe an impairment may have occurred inc luding, 
but not limited to, as a result of ongoing operating losses, projected decreases in earnings, increases in the weighted -average cost of 
capital, or significant business disruptions.  The significant assumptions used to estimate fair value include revenue growth and 
profitability, royalty rates, capital spending, depreciation and taxes, foreign curre ncy exchange rates, and a discount rate. By their 
nature, these projections and assumptions are uncertain. If we were to determine the current fair value of our investment was  less than 
the carrying value of the investment, then we would assess if the shor tfall was of a temporary or permanent nature and write down the 
investment to its fair value if we concluded the impairment is other than temporary.  
 
Revenue Recognition  
Our revenues primarily result from contracts with customers, which are generally short -term and have a single performance obligation 
– the delivery of product. We recognize revenue for the sale of packaged foods at the point in time when our performance obliga tion 
has been satisfied and control of the product has transferred to our custome r, which generally occurs when the shipment is accepted by 
our customer. Sales include shipping and handling charges billed to the customer and are reported net of variable consideration and 
consideration payable to our customers, including trade promotion , consumer coupon redemption and other reductions to the 
transaction price, including estimated allowances for returns, unsalable product, and prompt pay discounts. Sales, use, value -added, 
and other excise taxes are not included in revenue. Trade promotions are recorded using significant judgment of estimated 
participation and performance levels for offered programs at the time of sale. Differences between estimated and actual reductions to 
the transaction price are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period. We generally do not allow a right of return. 
 
49 However, on a limited case -by-case basis with prior approval, we may allow customers to return product. In limited circumstances, 
product returned in saleable condition is resold to other cust omers or outlets. Receivables from customers generally do not bear 
interest. Payment terms and collection patterns vary around the world and by channel, and are short- term, and as such, we do not have 
any significant financing components. Our allowance for  doubtful accounts represents our estimate of expected credit losses related to 
our trade receivables. We pool our trade receivables based on similar risk characteristics, such as geographic location, busi ness 
channel, and other account data. To estimate o ur allowance for doubtful accounts, we leverage information on historical losses, asset -
specific risk characteristics, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions. Account bal ances are 
written off against the allowance  when we deem the amount is uncollectible. Please see Note 17 for a disaggregation of our revenue 
into categories that depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economi c 
factors. We do not have materia l contract assets or liabilities arising from our contracts with customers.  
 
Environmental Costs  
Environmental costs relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are 
expensed. Liabilities f or anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably 
estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or our commitment to a plan of action.  
 
Advertising Production Costs  
We e xpense the production costs of advertising the first time that the advertising takes place.  
 
Research and Development  
All expenditures for research and development (R&D) are charged against earnings in the period incurred. R&D includes expendi tures 
for ne w product and manufacturing process innovation, and the annual expenditures are comprised primarily of internal salaries, 
wages, consulting, and supplies attributable to R&D activities. Other costs include depreciation and maintenance of research facilitie s, 
including assets at facilities that are engaged in pilot plant activities.  
 
Foreign Currency Translation  
For all significant foreign operations, the functional currency is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these operat ions are 
translated at the period -end exchange rates. Income statement accounts are translated using the average exchange rates prevailing 
during the period. Translation adjustments are reflected within accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCI) in stockholders’ e quity. 
Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net earnings for the period, except for gains and losses on 
investments in subsidiaries for which settlement is not planned for the foreseeable future and foreign exchange gains and losses on 
instruments designated as net investment hedges. These gains and losses are recorded in AOCI.  
 
Derivative Instruments  
All derivatives are recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value based on quoted market prices or our estimate of their 
fair value, and are recorded in either current or noncurrent assets or liabilities based on their maturity. Changes in the fa ir values of 
derivatives are recorded in net earnings or other comprehensive income, based on whether the instrument is de signated and effective 
as a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction. Gains or losses on derivative instruments reported in AOCI are 
reclassified to earnings in the period the hedged item affects earnings. If the underlying hedged transa ction ceases to exist, any 
associated amounts reported in AOCI are reclassified to earnings at that time.  
 
Stock -based Compensation  
We generally measure compensation expense for grants of restricted stock units and performance share units using the value  of a share 
of our stock on the date of grant. We estimate the value of stock option grants using a Black- Scholes valuation model. Generally, 
stock -based compensation is recognized straight line over the vesting period. Our stock- based compensation expense  is recorded in 
selling, general,  and administrative (SG&A) expenses and cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and allocated to 
each reportable segment in our segment results.  
 
Certain equity -based compensation plans contain provisions t hat accelerate vesting of awards upon retirement, termination, or death of 
eligible employees and directors. We consider a stock- based award to be vested when the employee’s or director’s retention of the 
award is no longer contingent on providing subseque nt service. Accordingly, the related compensation cost is generally recognized 
immediately for awards granted to retirement -eligible individuals or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement 
eligibility is achieved, if less than the stated vesting period.  
 
We report the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost as an operating cash flow.  
 
Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement Benefit, and Postemployment Benefit Plans  
We sponsor several domestic and foreign  defined benefit plans to provide pension, health care, and other welfare benefits to retired 
employees. Under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits, primarily severance, to former or inactive employ ees in 
the United States, Canada, and Mexico. We recognize an obligation for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service. 
 
50 Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service (such as severance based solely on annual pay rather than years 
of service) are charged to expense when incurred. Our postemployment benefit plans are unfunded.  
 
We recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension plan as an asset or liability and recognize changes in 
the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through AOCI.  
 
Use of Estimates  
Preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Sta tes 
requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets 
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
These estimates include our accounting for revenue r ecognition, valuation of long -lived assets, intangible assets , stock -based 
compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans. Actua l 
results could differ from our estimates.  
 
New Accounti ng Standards  
In the first quarter of fiscal 2021,  we adopted new accounting requirements related to the measurement of credit losses on financial 
instruments, including trade receivables. The new standard and subsequent amendments replace the incurred los s impairment model 
with a forward -looking expected credit loss model, which will generally result in earlier recognition of credit losses. Our allowance 
for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of expected credit losses related to our trade receivable s. We pool our trade receivables 
based on similar risk characteristics, such as geographic location, business channel, and other account data. To estimate our allowance 
for doubtful accounts, we leverage information on historical losses, asset -specific ris k characteristics, current conditions, and 
reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions. Account balances are written off against the allowance when we deem the 
amount is uncollectible. We adopted the requirements of the new standard and subsequent amendments using the modified 
retrospective transition approach, and recorded a decrease to retained earnings of $5.7 million after -tax.   
 
NOTE 3. ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURES  
 
During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we acquired TNT Crust, a manufacturer of high- quality frozen pizza crusts for regional and 
national pizza chains, foodservice distributors, and retail outlets, for a purchase price of $253.0 million. We financed the transaction 
with U.S. commercial paper. We consolidated the TNT Crust business into our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recorded goodwill of 
$156.8 million. The goodwill is included in the North America Foodservice segment and is not deductible for tax  purposes. The pro 
forma effects of this acquisition were not materia l. We have conducted a preliminary assessment of the fair value of the acquired 
assets and liabilities of the TNT Crust business and will continue to review these items during the measurement period. If ne w 
information is obtained about facts and circumsta nces that existed at the acquisition date, the acquisition accounting will be revised to 
reflect the resulting adjustments to current estimates of these items. The consolidated results of the TNT Crust business are  reported in 
our North America Foodservice  segment on a one -month lag.  
 
During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we completed the sale of our Helper main meals and Suddenly Salad side dishes business to 
Eagle Family Foods Group for $606.8  million and recorded a pre -tax gain of $442.2 million .  
 
In fiscal 2022, we sold our European dough businesses  and recorded a net pre- tax gain on sale of $30.4 million.   
 
During the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we sold our interests in Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, and Liberté Marques Sàrl to 
Sodiaal International (Sodiaal) in exchange for Sodiaal’s interest in our Canadian yogurt business, a modified agreement for the  use of 
Yoplait  and Liberté brands in the United States and Canada, and cash. We recorded a net pre -tax gain of $1 63.7 million on the sale of 
these businesses.  
 
During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we acquired Tyson Foods’ pet treats business for $1.2 billion in cash. We financed the 
transaction with a combination of cash on hand and short -term debt. We consolidated Tyson Foods’ pet treats business into our 
Consolidated Balance Sheets and recorded goodwill of $7 62.3 million, indefinite -lived intangi ble assets for the Nudges , Top 
Chews , and True Chews  brands totaling $330.0 million in aggregate, and a finite -lived customer relationship asset of $40.0 million. 
The goodwill is included in the Pet reporting unit and is deductible for tax purposes. The pro forma effects of this acquisition were not 
material.  
 
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we recorded a pre -tax loss of $53.5 million related to the sale of our Laticínios Carolina 
business in Brazil.  
 
 
 
51 NOTE 4. RESTRUCTURING, IMPAIRMENT, AND OTHER EXIT COSTS  
 
We view our restructuring activities as actions that help us meet our long -term growth targets  and are evaluated against internal rate of 
return and net present value targets.  Each restructuring action normally takes one to two years to complete. At completion (or as each 
major stage is completed in the case of multi -year programs), the project begins to deliver cash savings and/or reduced depreciation. 
These activities result in various restructuring costs, including asset write -offs, exit charges including severance, contract termination 
fees, and decommissioning and other costs. Accelerated depreciation associated with restructured assets, as used in the conte xt of our 
disclosures regarding restructuring activity, refers to the increase in depreciation expense caused by shortening the useful life or 
updating the salvage value of depreciable fixed assets to coincide with the end of production under an approved restructuring plan. 
Any impairment of th e asset is recognized immediately in the period the plan is approved . 
 
Restructuring c harges recorded in fiscal 2023 were as follows:  
 
Expense, in Millions    
Global supply chain actions  $ 36.2 
Network optimization actions   6.4 
Charges associated with restructuring actions previously announced   18.4 
Total restructuring charges  $ 61.0 
 
In fiscal 2023, we approved restructuring actions to enhance the efficiency of our global supply chain structure. We expect to incur 
approximately $ 52 million  of restructuring charges and project -related costs related to these actions, of which approximately $35 
million  will be cash. These charges are expected to consist of approximately $2 6 million of severance and $2 6 million of other costs, 
primarily $ 8 million of asset impairment and $11 million of other asset write -offs. We recognized $25.8 million of severance and 
$10.4 million  of other costs in fiscal 2023. We expect these actions to be completed by the end of fiscal 2025.  
 
In fiscal 2023, we approved res tructuring action s in our International segment to optimize our Häagen -Dazs shops network. We expect 
to incur approximately $10 million of restructuring charges and project -related costs related to these actions, of which approximately 
$9 million will be c ash. These charges are expected to consist of approximately $ 6 million of severance and $4 million of other costs. 
We recognized $5.6 million of severance and $0. 8 million of other costs in fiscal 2023. We expect th ese action s to be completed by 
the end of  fiscal 2024.   
 
Certain actions are subject to union negotiations and works counsel consultations, where required.  
 
We paid net $ 36.6 million  of cash related to restructuring actions in fiscal 2023. We paid net $93.9 million of cash in fiscal 2022.

Classification of marketable securities as current or noncurrent is dependent upon our intended holding period and the securi ty’s 
maturity date. The aggregate unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt securities, net of tax effects, are classified in AOCI 
within stockholders’ equity.   
 
Scheduled maturities of our marketable securities are as follows:  
 
  Marketable Securities  
In Millions   Cost   Fair Value  
Under 1 year (current)  $ 2.3 $ 2.3 
Equity securities   117.5   122.7  
Total  $ 119.8  $ 125.0  
 
As of May 28, 2023, we had $ 2.2 million  of marketable debt securities pledged as collateral for derivative contracts.  
 
RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES  
 
As a part of our ongoing operations, we are exposed to market risks su ch as changes in interest and  foreign currency exchange rates 
and commodity and equity prices . To manage these risks, we may enter into various derivative transactions (e.g., futures, options, and 
swaps) pursuant to our established policies.  
 
COMMODITY PRICE RISK 
 
Many commodities we use in the production and distribution of our products are exposed to market price risks. We utilize deri vatives 
to manage price risk for our principal ingredients and energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat,  and corn), oils (principally soybean), 
dairy products, natural gas, and diesel fuel. Our primary objective when entering into these derivative contracts is to achie ve certainty 
with regard to the future price of commodities purchased for use in our supply  chain. We manage our exposures through a 
combination of purchase orders, long- term contracts with suppliers, exchange -traded futures and options, and over -the-counter options 
and swaps. We offset our exposures based on current and projected market conditi ons and generally seek to acquire the inputs at as 
close as possible to or below our planned cost.  
 
We use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in commodity prices. We do not perform the assessments required to achie ve 
hedge accounting for commodi ty derivative positions. Accordingly, the changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded 
currently in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  
 
Although we do not meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting, we believe that these instruments are effective in achieving our 
objective of providing certainty in the future price of commodities purchased for use in our supply chain. Accordingly, for p urposes of 
measuring segment operating performance these gains and losses are repo rted in unallocated corporate items outside of segment 
operating results until such time that the exposure we are managing affects earnings. At that time we reclassify the gain or loss from 
unallocated corporate items to segment operating profit, allowing our operating segments to realize the economic effects of the 
derivative without experiencing any resulting mark- to-market volatility, which remains in unallocated corporate items.   
 
Unallocated corporate items for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 included:  
 
 Fiscal Year

Net mark -to-market valuation of certain commodity positions recognized in  
   unallocated corporate items  $ (291.9)   $ 133.1   $ 138.8  
 
As of May 28, 2023, the net no tional value of commodity derivatives was $406.8 million , of which $257.9 million  related to 
agricultural inputs and $148.9 million  related to energy inputs. These contracts relate to inputs that generally will be utilized within the 
next 12 months.   
 
57  
INTEREST RATE RISK  
 
We are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed -rate debt, and existing and future issuances of 
floating -rate debt. Primary exposures include U.S. Treasury rates, SOFR, Euribor, and commercial paper rates in the United States and 
Europe. We use interest rate swaps, forward -starting in terest rate swaps, and treasury locks to hedge our exposure to interest rate 
changes, to reduce the volatility of our financing costs, and to achieve a desired proportion of fixed -rate versus floating -rate debt, 
based on current and projected market condit ions. Generally under these swaps, we agree with a counterparty to exchange the 
difference between fixed -rate and floating -rate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount.  
 
Floating Interest Rate Exposures — Floating -to-fixed intere st rate swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges, as are all hedges of 
forecasted issuances of debt. Effectiveness is assessed based on either the perfectly effective hypothetical derivative metho d or 
changes in the present value of interest payments on the underlying debt. Effective gains and losses deferred to AOCI are reclassified 
into earnings over the life of the associated debt.  
 
Fixed Interest Rate Exposures — Fixed -to-floating interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges with effectiveness 
assessed based on changes in the fair value of the underlying debt and derivatives, using incremental borrowing rates currently 
available on loans with similar terms and maturities.  
 
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, in advance of planned debt financing, we entered into €750.0 million of forward -starting 
swaps. The forward -starting swap agreements were terminated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, in conjunction with the 
Company’s issuance of a €750.0 million 6- year fixed -rate note. Upon termination , a loss of $5.0 million was recognized in AOCI and 
will be amortized through interest expense over the respective term of the debt.   
 
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, in advance of planned debt financing, we entered into $500.0 million of treasury locks. The 
treasury locks were terminated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, in conjunction with the Company’s issuance of a $1,0 00.0 
million 10 -year fixed -rate note. Upon termination, a loss of $1.4 million was recognized in AOCI and will be amortized through 
interest expense over the respective term of the debt.  
 
During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we entered into a $500.0 million notional amount interest swap to convert our $500. 0 million 
fixed rate notes due Novem ber 18, 2025, to a floating rate.  
 
As of May 28, 2023, the pre -tax amount of cash -settled interest rate hedge gain or loss remaining in AOCI, which will be reclassified 
to earnings over the remaining term of the related underlying debt, follows:

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK  
 
Foreign currency fluctuations affect our net investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign currency cash flows related to third party 
purchases, intercomp any loans, product shipments, and foreign -denominated debt. We are also exposed to the translation of foreign 
currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. Our principal exposures are to the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound ste rling, 
Canadian dolla r, Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, and  Swiss franc. We primarily use foreign currency forward 
contracts to selectively hedge our foreign currency cash flow exposures. We also generally swap our foreign -denominated commercial 
paper borro wings and nonfunctional currency intercompany loans back to U.S. dollars or the functional currency of the entity with 
foreign exchange exposure. The gains or losses on these derivatives offset the foreign currency revaluation gains or losses r ecorded in 
earnings on the associated borrowings. We generally do not hedge more than 18 months in advance.  
 
As of May 28, 2023, the net notional value of foreign exchange derivatives was $933 .0 million . 
 
We also have net investments in foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in euros. We hedged a portion of these net investments by 
issuing euro -denominated commercial paper and foreign exchange forward contracts. As of May 28, 2023, we hedged a portion of 
these net i nvest ments with € 2,949.9 million  of euro denominated bonds.  As of May 28, 2023, we had deferred net foreign currency 
transaction gains of $71.9 million  in AOCI  associated with net investment hedging activity.  
 
 
EQUITY INSTRUMENTS  
 
Equity price movements affect our compensation expense as certain investments made by our employees in our deferred 
compensation plan are revalued. We use equity  swaps to manage this risk . As of May 28, 2023, the net notional amount of our equity 
swaps was $ 177.5  million . In fiscal 2024, $165.4 million of swap contracts will mature , and $12.1  million of swap contracts mature in 
fiscal 2025.

CREDIT -RISK -RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES 
 
Certain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to maintain an investment grade credit rating on our debt from 
each of the major credit rating agencies. If our debt were to fall below investment grade, the counterparties to the derivative 
instruments could request full collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all 
derivative instruments with credit- risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position on May 28, 2023, was $100.1 
million. We have posted $ 60.5 million of collateral under these contracts.

We enter into interest rate, foreign exchange, and certain commodity and equity derivatives, primarily with a diversified group of 
highly rated counterparties. We continually monitor our positions and the credit ratings of the counterparties involved and, by policy, 
limit the amount of credit exposure to any one party. These transacti ons may expose us to potential losses due to the risk of 
nonperformance by these counterparties; however, we have not incurred a material loss. We also enter into commodity futures 
transactions through various regulated exchanges.  
 
 
63 The amount of loss due t o the credit risk of the counterparties, should the counterparties fail to perform according to the terms of the 
contracts, is $4.5 million . We have no collateral held against these contracts . Under the terms of our swap agreements, some of our 
transaction s require  collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to threshold levels of exposure and 
counterparty credit risk. Collateral assets are either cash or U.S. Treasury instruments and are held in a trust account that  we may 
access if the counterparty defaults . 
 
We offer certain suppliers access to third -party services that allow them to view our scheduled payments online. The third- party 
services also allow suppliers to finance advances on our scheduled payments at the sole discretion of the supplier and the third party. 
We have no economic interest in these financing arrangements and no direct relationship with the suppliers, the third parties , or any 
financial institutions concerning this service. All of our accounts payable rem ain as obligations to our suppliers as stated in our 
supplier agreements. As of May 28, 2023 , $1,430.1 million  of our accounts  payable was payable to suppliers who utilize these third-
party services. As of May 29, 2022, $1,429.6 million of our accounts payable was payable to suppliers who utilize these third -party 
services.

66 NOTE 10. REDEEMABLE AND NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS  
 
Our principal noncontrolling interest relate s to our General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) subsidiar y. 
 
The holder of the GMC Class  A Interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application 
of a floating preferred return rate to the holder’s capital account balance established in the most recent mark -to-market valuation 
(currently $ 251.5  million ). The floating preferred return rate on GMC’s Class A interests is the sum of  the three -month Term SOFR  
plus 186 basis points.  The preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with t he Class  A Interest 
holder or through a remarketing auction.  
 
During the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we completed the sale of our interests in Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC and Liberté 
Marques Sàrl to Sodiaal in exchange for Sodiaal’s interest in our Canadian yogurt business, a modified agreement for the use of 
Yoplait  and Liberté brands in the United States and Canada, and cash. Please see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  
 
Up to the date of the divestiture, Sodiaal held the remaining interests in each of the entities. On the acquisition date, we recorded the 
fair value of Sodiaal’s  49 percent euro -denominated interest in Yoplait SAS as a redeemable interest on our Consolidated Balance 
Sheets.  Sodiaal had the right to put all or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value until the divestiture closed in the third 
quarter of fiscal 2022. In connection with the divestiture, cumulative adjustments made to the redeemable interest related to  the fair 
value put feature w ere reversed against additional paid -in capital, where changes in the redemption amount were historically recorded, 
and the resulting carrying value of the noncontrolling interests were included in the calculation of the gain on divestiture.  
 
We paid divid ends of $105.1 million  in fiscal 2022 and $40.3 million in fiscal 2021 to Sodiaal under the terms of the Yoplait SAS, 
Yoplait Marques SNC, and Liberté Marques Sàrl shareholder agreements.  
 
A subsidiary of Yoplait SAS ha d an exclusive milk supply agreement for its European operations with Sodiaal through November 28, 
2021 . Net purchases totaled $99.5 million for the six -month period ended November 28, 2021.  
 
For financial reporting purposes, the assets, liabilities, results of operations, and cash flows of our non- wholly owned consolidated 
subsidiaries are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The third -party investor’s share of the net earnings of these 
subsidiaries is reflected in net earnings attributable to  redeemable and noncontrolling interests in our Consolidated Statements of 
Earnings.  
 
Our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. As of May 28, 2023, we were in compliance with all of these covenants.

NOTE 12. STOCK PLANS  
 
We use broad -based stock plans to help ensure that management’s interests are aligned with those of our s hareholders . As of May 28, 
2023, a total of 35.1  million  shares  were available for grant in the form of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and 
shares of unrestricted stock under the 2022 Stock Compensation Plan (2022 Plan). The 2022 Plan also provides for the issuance of 
cash-settled share -based units, stock appreciation rights, and performance -based stock awards. Stock- based awards now outstanding  
include some granted under the 2017 Stock Compensation P lan, under which no further awards may be granted. The stock plans 
provide for potential accelerated vesting of awards upon retirement, termination, or death of eligible employees and director s.  
 
 
69 Stock Options  
The estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used  for the Black -Scholes option -pricing model were as 
follows:  
 
 Fiscal Year  
 2023   2022   2021  
Estimated fair values of stock options granted  $ 14.16    $ 8.77   $ 8.03  
Assumptions:             
Risk-free interest rate   3.3 %   1.5 %   0.7 % 
Expected term   8.5 years    8.5 years    8.5 years  
Expected volatility   20.9 %   20.2 %   19.5 % 
Dividend yield   3.1 %   3.4 %   3.3 % 
 
We estimate the fair value of each option on the grant date using a Black -Scholes option -pricing model, which requires us to make 
predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, dividend yield, and the forfeiture rate. We 
estimate our future stock price volatility using the historical volatility over the expected term of the option, excluding ti me periods of 
volatility we believe a marketplace participant would exclude i n estimating our stock price volatility. We also have considered, but did 
not use, implied volatility in our estimate, because trading activity in options on our stock, especially those with tenors o f greater than 
6 months, is insufficient to provide a rel iable measure of expected volatility.  
 
Our expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical data to 
estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model. Separate groups of employees have similar historical 
exercise behavior and therefore were aggregated into a single pool for valuation purposes. The weighted -average expected term for all 
employee groups is presented in the table above. The risk- free interest rate f or periods during the expected term of the options is based 
on the U.S. Treasury zero- coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant.  
 
Any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings 
(referred to as a windfall tax benefit) is presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating cash flow. Realized 
windfall tax benefits and shortfall tax deficiencies related to the exercise or vesting of stock -based awards  are recognized in the 
Consolidated Statement s of Earnings.  
 
Windfall tax benefits from stock -based payments in income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings were as follows:  
 
  Fiscal Year  
In Millions   2023   2022   2021  
Windfall tax benefits from stock -based payments  $ 32.3 $ 18.4 $ 12.4 
 
As of May 28, 2023, there were no  options granted under the 2022 Plan. Under the 2017 Stock Compensation Plan, options may be 
priced at 100 percent or more of the fair market value on the date of grant, and generally vest four years after the date of grant. 
Options generally expire within  10 years and one month after the date of grant.

stock-based awards granted under the 2022 Plan. Under the 2017 Stock Compensation Plan, restricted stock and restricted stock units  
generally vest and become unrestricted four years after the date of grant. Performance share units are earned primarily based  on our 
future achievement of three -year goals for average organic net sales growth and cumulative operating cash flow and a relative total 
shareholder return modifier. Performance share units are settled in common stock and are generally subject to a three -year 
performance and vesting period. The sale or transfer of these awards is restricted during the vesting period. Participants holding 
restricted stock, but not restricted stock units or performance share units, are entitled to vote on matters submitted t o holders of 
common stock for a vote. These awards accumulate dividends from the date of grant, but participants only receive payment if t he 
awards vest.

NOTE 14. RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS  
 
Defined Benefit Pension Plans  
 
We have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. 
Benefits for salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation. Benefits for hourly employees include 
various monthly amounts for each year of credited service. Our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws. 
We made no voluntary contributions to our principal U.S. plans in fiscal 2023 or fis cal 2022. We do not expect to be required to make 
any contributions to our principal U.S. plans in fiscal 2024.  Our principal U.S. retirement plan covering salaried employees has a 
provision that any excess pension assets would be allocated to active parti cipants if the plan is terminated within five years of a change 
in control. All  salaried employees hired on or after June  1, 2013, are  eligible for  a retirement program that does not include  a defined 
benefit pension plan.  
 
Other Postretirement Benefit Plans  
 
We also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many  of our retirees in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. The U .S. 
salaried health care benefit plan is contributory, with retiree contributions based on years of service. We make decisions to  fund 
related trusts for certain employees and retirees on an annual basis. We made no voluntary contributions to these plans in fi scal 2023 
or fiscal 2022 . We do not expect to be required to make any contributions to these plans in fiscal 202 4. 
 
In fiscal 2021, we approved amendments to reorganize certain U.S. retiree health and welfare benefit plans. The General Mills  Retiree 
Health Plan for Union Employees was divided into two plans, with participants under age 65 remaining within its coverage, and 
participants age 65 and over covered by The General Mills Retiree Health Plan for Union Employees (65+). Effective January 1, 2022, 
the General Mills Retiree Health Plan for Union Employees (65+) allow s certain participants to purchase individual healt h insurance 
policies on a private health care exchange. Additionally, the Employees’ Benefit Plan of General Mills was merged into the General 
Mills Retiree Health Plan for Union Employees. Separate benefit structures and plan provisions continue to apply to eligible 
participants of these merged plans. A portion of the General Mills Retiree Health Plan for Union Employees overfunded plan as sets 
were segregated to offset the cost of the Employees’ Benefit Plan of General Mills health and welfare benefits. Th e segregation of 
assets is reported as a negative employer contribution in the change in other postretirement benefit plan assets. The amendme nts 
facilitate targeted investment strategies that reflect each plan’s unique liability characteristics.  
 
 
72 In fisca l 2021, we announced changes to the design of our health care coverage for certain eligible retirees to allow participants to  
purchase individual health insurance policies on a private health care exchange effective January 1, 2022. These changes prov ide 
certain eligible retirees with greater flexibility in choosing health care coverage that best fits their needs.  
 
Health Care Cost Trend Rates  
 
Assumed health care cost trends are as follows:  
 
 Fiscal Year   
 2023   2022  
Health care cost trend rate for next year  6.6% and 6.6  %  5.9% and 6.0  % 
Rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (ultimate rate)  4.5 %  4.5 % 
Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate  2032    2031   
 
We review our health care cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims expe rience 
and information provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry e xperience 
and projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to 
remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, and short -term expectations. Our initial health care  cost trend rate assumption 
is 6.6 percent for retirees age 65 and over and for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2023. Rates are graded down annually until 
the ultimate trend rate of 4.5 percent is reached in 203 2 for all retirees. T he trend rate s are applicable for calculations only if the 
retirees’ benefits increase as a  result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate 
the current economic view on the rate of long- term inflation  plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for 
health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans.  
 
Postemployment Benefit Plans  
 
Under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits, primarily severance, to former or inactive employees in the United 
States, Canada, and Mexico. We recognize an obligation for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service. 
Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service (such as severance based solely on annual pay rather than years 
of service) are charged to expense when incurred. Our postemployment benefit plans are unfunded.

Discount Rates  
 
We estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense for our United States and most of our 
international defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans  utilizing a full yield curve 
approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected 
cash flows. Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of May  31 for our defined benefit pension, other post retirement 
benefit, and postemployment benefit plan obligations. We also use discount rates as of May  31 to determine defined benefit pension, 
other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income and expense for the following  fiscal year. W e work with our 
outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using the Aa Above 
Median corporate bond yield, to develop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This 
forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions.

(a) Primarily publicly traded common stock for purposes of total return and to maintain equity exposure consistent with policy 
allocations. Investments include: United States and internat ional public equity securities, mutual funds, and equity futures valued 
at closing prices from national exchanges, commingled funds valued at fair value using the unit values provided by the investment 
managers, and certain private equity securities valued  using a matrix of pricing inputs reflecting assumptions based on the best 
information available.  
(b) Primarily government and corporate debt securities and futures for purposes of total return, managing fixed income exposure t o 
policy allocations, and dur ation targets. Investments include: fixed income securities and bond futures generally valued at closing 
prices from national exchanges, fixed income pricing models, and independent financial analysts;  and fixed income commingled 
funds valued at unit value s provided by the investment managers, which are based on the fair value of the underlying investments.  
(c) Publicly traded common stocks in energy, real estate, and infrastructure for the purpose of total return. Investments include: 
energy, real estate, and infrastructure securities generally valued at closing prices from national exchanges, and commingled 
funds valued at unit values provided by the investment managers, which are based on the fair value of the underlying investme nts.   
(d) Insurance and a nnuity contracts to provide a stable stream of income for pension retirees. Fair values are based on the fair value 
of the underlying investments and contract fair values established by the providers . 
(e) Primarily limited partnerships, trust-owned life insurance, common collective trusts, and certain private equity securities that are 
measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient and have not been classi fied in the 
fair value hierarchy.  
 
There were no transfers into or out of level 3 investments in fiscal 2023. During  fiscal 2022 , the inclusion of non -observable inputs 
into the pricing of certain private equity securities resulted in the transfer of $ 66.3 million into level 3 investments.  
 
Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets  
 
Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long- term investment performance, our 
estimate of future long -term returns by a sset class (using input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and 
long-term inflation assumptions. We review this assumption annually for each plan; however, our annual investment performance for 
one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation.

The investment objective for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the benefit obli gations to 
participants at a reasonable cost to us. Our goal is to optimize the long -term return on plan assets at a moderate level of risk. The 
defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan portfolios are broadly diversified across asset classes. W ithin asset 
classes, the portfolios are further diversified across investment styles and investment organization s. For the U.S. defined benefit 
pension plans, the long- term investment policy allocation is: 9 percent to equities in the United States; 6 percent to international 
equities; 7 percent to private equities; 68 percent to fixed income; and 1 0 percent to real  assets (real estate, energy, and infrastructure). 
For other U.S. postretirement benefit plans, the long- term investment policy allocations are: 28 percent to equities in the United States; 
14 percent to international equities; 14 percent to total private equities; and 44 percent to fixed income .  The actual allocations to these 
asset classes may vary tactically around the long -term policy allocations based on relative market valuations.  
 
Contributions and Future Benefit Payments  
 
We do not expect to be required to make contributions to our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and 
postemployment benefit plans in fiscal 2024. Actual fiscal 2024 contributions could exceed our current projections, as influe nced by 
our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts and future changes in regulatory requirements. Estimated benefit 
payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2033 as follows:

Defined Contribution Plans  
 
The General Mills Savings Plan is a defined contribution plan that covers domestic salaried, hourly, nonunion, and certain union 
employees. This plan is a 401(k) savings plan that includes a number of investment funds, includin g a Company stock fund and an 
Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). We sponsor another money purchase plan for certain domestic hourly employees with net 
assets of $19.2 million  as of May 28, 2023, and $20.6  million  as of May 29, 2022. We also sponsor defi ned contribution plans in many 
of our foreign locations. Our total recognized expense related to defined contribution plans was $ 97.2 million  in fiscal 2023, 
$90.1 million  in fiscal 2022, and $ 76.1 million  in fiscal 2021. 
 
We match a percentage of employee  contributions to the General Mills Savings Plan. The Company match is directed to investment 
options of the participant’s choosing. The number of shares of our common stock allocated to participants in the ESOP was 3.7 
million  as of May 28, 2023, and 4.0 million  as of May 29, 2022. The ESOP’s only assets are our common stock and temporary cash 
balances.  
 
The Company stock fund and the ESOP collectively held $498.7  million  and $443.8  million  of Company common stock as of May 28, 
2023 , and May 29, 2022, respectively.

We have established a valuation allowance against certain of the categories of deferred tax assets described above as current evidence 
does not suggest we will realize sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (e.g., ordinary income versus capital  gain 
income) within the carryforward period to allow us to realize these deferred tax benefits .

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law. The IRA introduces a Corporate Alternative Minimum  
Tax beginning in our fiscal 2024 and an excise tax on the repurchase of corporate stock starting after January 1, 2023. We do not  
currently expect the IRA to have a material impact on our financial results, including our annual estimated effective tax rate, or  on our 
liquidity. The amount of excise tax on the repurchase of corporate stock was immaterial in fiscal 2023. We will continue to m onitor 
and assess the impact the IRA may have on our business and financial results.  
 
On March 11, 2021, the American Rescu e Plan Act (ARPA) was signed into law. The ARPA includes a provision expanding the 
limitations on the deductibility of certain executive employee compensation beginning in our fiscal 2028. We do not currently  expect 
the ARPA to have a material impact on ou r financial results, including our annual estimated effective tax rate, or on our liquidity.  
  
As of May 28, 2023, we have not recognized a deferred tax liability for unremitted earnings of approximately $2.3 billion from  our 
foreign operations because we currently believe our subsidiaries have invested the undistributed earnings indefinitely or the  earnings 
will be remitted in a tax -neutral transaction. It is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized tax expense on these 
reinvested earnings. Deferred taxes are recorded for earnings of our foreign operations when we determine that such earnings are no 
longer indefinitely reinvested. All earnings prior to fiscal 2018 remain permanently reinvested. Earnin gs from fiscal 2018 and later are 
not permanently reinvested and local country withholding taxes are recorded on earnings each year.   
  
We are subject to federal income taxes in the United States as well as various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions.  A number of years 
may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final  outcome or the 
timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our liabilities f or income taxes reflect the most likely 
outcome. We adjust these liabilities, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settleme nt of any 
particular position would usually require the use of cash.  
  
The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdiction is the United States 
(federal and state). Various tax examinations by United States state taxing authorities could be conducted for any open tax y ear, which 
vary b y jurisdiction, but are generally from  3 to 5 years. 
  
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is currently auditing our federal tax returns for fiscal 2018 and 2019. Several state and foreign 
examinations are currently in progress. We do not expect these exami nations to result in a material impact on our results of operations 
or financial position. We have effectively settled all issues with the IRS for fiscal years 2015 and prior.  
  
The Brazilian tax authority, Secretaria da Receita Federal do Brasil (RFB), ha s concluded audits of  our 2012 through 2018 tax return 
years. These audits included a review of our determinations of amortization of certain goodwill  arising from the acquisition of Yoki 
Alimentos S.A. The RFB has proposed adjustments that effectively eliminate the goodwill  amortization benefits related to this 
transaction. We believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to continue to contest the  disallowance for all years.  
  
We apply a more -likely -than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize 
the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Futur e changes in 
judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the period of such ch ange. 
 
 
81 The following table sets forth changes in our total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, excluding accrued interest, for fiscal 2023 
and fiscal 2022. Approximately $90 million  of this total in fiscal 2023 represents the amount that, if recognized, would affect our 
effective incom e tax rate in future periods. This  amount differs from the gross unrecognized tax benefits presented in the table because 
certain  portions  of the liabilities below would impact deferred taxes if recognized. We also would record a decrease in  U.S. federal 
income taxes upon recognition of the state tax benefits included therein.

As of May 28, 2023, we do not expect to pay unrecognized tax benefit liabilities and accrued interest within the next 12 months.  We 
are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit 
outcomes. Our unrecognized tax benefit liability was classified in other liabilities.  
 
We report accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefit liabilities in income tax expense. For fiscal 20 23, we 
recognized $4.7 million  of tax -related net interest and penalties, and had $ 32.4 million  of accrued interest and penalties as of May 28, 
2023. For fiscal 2022, we recognized $2.0  million  of tax- related net interest and penalties, and had $26.6  million  of accrued interest 
and penalties as of May 29, 2022.

During fiscal 2020, we received notice from the tax authorities of the State of São Paulo, Brazil regarding our compliance wi th its 
state sales tax requirements. As a result, we have been assessed additional state sales taxes, interest, and penalties. We b elieve that we 
have meritorious defenses against this claim and will vigorously defend our position. As of  May 28, 2023 , we are unable to estimate 
any possible loss and have not recorded a loss contingency for this matter.  
 
NOTE 17. BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION  
 
We operate in the packaged foods industry. In fiscal 2022, we completed a new organization structure to streamline our global 
operations. This global reorganization required us to reevaluate our operating segments. Under our new organization structure, our 
chief operating decision maker assesses performance and makes decisions about resources to be allocated to our operating segm ents as 
follows:  North America Retail, International, Pet, and North America Foodservice.  
 
Our North America Retail operating segment reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores, mass merchandisers, membership 
stores, natural food chains, drug, dollar and discount chains, convenience stores, and e -commerce groc ery providers. Our product 
categories in this business segment include ready -to-eat cereals, refrigerated yogurt, soup, meal kits, refrigerated and frozen dough 
products, dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza and pizza snacks, snack bars, fruit snacks, sa vory snacks, and a wide variety of 
organic products including ready -to-eat cereal, frozen and shelf -stable vegetables, meal kits, fruit snacks and snack bars.  
 
Our International operating segment consists of retail and foodservice businesses outside of the  United States and Canada. Our 
product categories include super -premium ice cream and frozen desserts, meal kits, salty snacks, snack bars, dessert and baking mixes, 
and shelf stable vegetables. We also sell super- premium ice cream and frozen desserts directly to consumers through owned retail 
shops. Our International segment also includes products manufactured in the United States for export, mainly to Caribbean and Latin 
American markets, as well as products we manufacture for sale to our international jo int ventures. Revenues from export activities are 
reported in the region or country where the end customer is located.  
 
Our Pet operating segment includes pet food products sold primarily in the United States and Canada in national pet superstor e chains, 
e-commerce retailers, grocery stores, regional pet store chains, mass merchandisers, and veterinary clinics and hospitals. Our product 
 
82 categories include dog and cat food (dry foods, wet foods, and treats) made with whole meats, fruits, vegetables and other  high-quality 
natural ingredients. Our tailored pet product offerings address specific dietary, lifestyle, and life -stage needs and span different 
product types, diet types, breed sizes for dogs, lifestages, flavors, product functions, and textures and cut s for wet foods.  
 
Our North America Foodservice segment consists of foodservice businesses in the United States and Canada. Our major product 
categories in our North America Foodservice operating segment are ready -to-eat cereals, snacks, refrigerated yogur t, frozen meals, 
unbaked and fully baked frozen dough products, baking mixes, and bakery flour. Many products we sell are branded to the consumer 
and nearly all are branded to our customers. We sell to distributors and operators in many customer channels i ncluding foodservice, 
vending, and supermarket bakeries.  
 
Operating profit for these segments excludes unallocated corporate items, gain or loss on divestitures, and restructuring, im pairment, 
and other exit costs. Unallocated corporate items include corpo rate overhead expenses, variances to planned North American 
employee benefits and incentives, certain charitable contributions, restructuring initiative project -related costs, gains and losses on 
corporate investments, and other items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance. These include gains 
and losses arising from the revaluation of certain grain inventories and gains and losses from mark -to-market valuation of certain 
commodity positions until passed back to our operating segments. These items affecting operating profit are centrally managed at the 
corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by executive management. Under our supply  
chain organization, our manufacturing, warehouse, and distribution activities are substantially integrated across our operations in order 
to maximize efficiency and productivity. As a result, fixed assets and depreciation and amortization expenses are neither mai ntained 
nor available by operating segment.
