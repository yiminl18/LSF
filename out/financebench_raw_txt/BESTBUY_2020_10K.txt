Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "we," "us" and "our" in this Annual Report on Form  10-K refer to Best Buy Co., Inc. 
and, as applicable, its consolidated subsidiaries. Any references to our website addresses do not constitute incorporation by reference 
of the information contained on the websites.  
 
Description of Business  
 
We were incorporated in the state of Minnesota in 1966. We are driven by our purpose to enrich lives through technology. We d o that 
by leveraging our combination of tech and a human touch to meet our customers’ everyday needs, whether they come to us online, visit 
our stores or invite us into their homes. We have operations in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.  
 
Segments and Geographic Areas  
 
We have two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of the operations in all states, 
districts and territories of the U.S. under various brand names including Best  Buy, Best Buy Business, Best Buy Express, Best Buy 
Health, CST, Geek Squad, GreatCall, Lively, Magnolia and Pacific Kitchen and Home  and the domain names bestbuy.com and 
greatcall.com . The International segment is comprised of all operations in Canada and Mexico under the brand names Best  Buy, Best 
Buy Express, Best  Buy Mobile and Geek Squad and the domain names bestbuy.ca and bestbuy.com.mx.  
 
On May 9, 2019, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Critical Signal Technologies, Inc. (“CST”), a health services co mpany , and 
on August 7, 2019, we acquired the predictive healthcare technology business of BioSensics, LLC (“BioSensics”). Additional 
information on these acquisitions  is included in Note 2,  Acquisition s, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in 
Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form  10-K. 
 
Operations  
 
Our Domestic and International segments are managed by leadership teams responsible for all areas of the business. Both segme nts 
operate a multi -channel pla tform that allows customers to come to us online, visit our stores or invite us into their homes.  
 
Domestic Segment  
 
Development of merchandise and service offerings, pricing and promotions, procurement and supply chain, online and mobile 
application opera tions, marketing and advertising and labor deployment across all channels are centrally managed. In addition, support 
capabilities (for example, human resources, finance and real estate management) are generally performed at our corporate 
headquarters. We also have field operations that support retail, services and in -home teams from our corporate headquarters and 
regional locations. Our retail stores have procedures for inventory management, asset protection, transaction processing, cus tomer 
relations, sto re administration, product sales and services, staff training and merchandise display that are largely standardized. All 
stores generally operate under standard procedures with a degree of flexibility for store management to address certain local  market 
characteristics.  
 
International Segment  
 
Our Canada and Mexico operations are similar to those in our Domestic segment.  
 
Merchandise and Services  
 
Our Domestic and International segments have offerings in six revenue categories. The key components of each re venue category are 
as follows:  
 
• Computing and Mobile Phones  - computing and peripherals, e -readers, mobile phones (including related mobile network 
carrier commissions), networking, tablets and wearables (including smartwatches);  
• Consumer Electronics  - digital imaging, health and fitness, home theater, portable audio (including headphones and portable 
speakers) and smart home;  
• Appliances  - large appliances (including dishwashers, laundry, ovens and refrigerators) and small appliances (including 
blenders, coffee makers and vacuums);  
• Entertainment  - drones, gaming hardware and software, peripherals, movies, music, toys, virtual reality and other software;  
• Services  - consultation, delivery, design, installation, memberships, protection plans, repair, set -up, technical support and 
health -related services; and  
• Other  - beverages, snacks, sundry items and other product offerings within our Internationa l segment (including baby, luggage 
and sporting goods).

5 Distribution  
 
Domestic Segment  
 
Customers who purchase products online have the choice to pick up product at a Best Buy store (including curbside pick -up in select 
stores), at an alternative pick -up location or take delivery direct to their homes. Our ship -from-store capability allows us to improve 
product availability and delivery times for customers. Most merchandise is shipped directly from manufacturers to our distrib ution 
centers located througho ut the U.S. In order to meet release dates for certain products, merchandise may be shipped directly to our 
stores from suppliers.  
 
International Segment  
 
Our Canada and Mexico distribution models are similar to that of our Domestic segment.  
 
Suppliers and  Inventory  
 
Our Domestic and International segments purchase merchandise from a variety of suppliers. In fiscal 2020, our 20 largest supp liers 
accounted for approximately 7 9% of the merchandise we purchased, with five suppliers  – Apple, Samsung, Hewlett -Packard, Sony and 
LG – representing approximately 5 6% of total merchandise purchased.  We generally do not have long -term written contracts with our 
vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise or that secure any of the key terms of our arrangements.  
 
We carefully monitor and manage our inventory levels in an effort to match quantities on hand with consumer demand as closely  as 
possible. Key elements to our inventory management process include the following: continuous mo nitoring of historical and projected 
consumer demand, continuous monitoring and adjustment of inventory receipt levels and pricing, agreements with vendors relati ng to 
reimbursement for the cost of markdowns or sales incentives and agreements with vendors relating to return privileges for certain 
products.  
 
We also have a global sourcing operation to design, develop, test and contract -manufacture our exclusive brand products.  
 
Store Development  
 
We had 1,175 large -format and 56 small -format stores at the end of fiscal 2020 throughout our Domestic and International segments. 
Our stores are a vital component of our multi -channel strategy and we believe they are an important competitive advantage. We also 
have vendor store -within -a-store concepts to allow clo ser vendor partnerships and a higher quality customer experience. We 
continuously look for opportunities to optimize our store space, renegotiate leases and selectively open or close locations t o support our 
operations.  
 
Refer to Item 7,  Management's Discu ssion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  for tables reconciling our 
Domestic and International segment stores open at the end of each of the last three fiscal years.  
 
Intellectual Property  
 
We own or have the right to use valuab le intellectual property such as trademarks, service marks and tradenames, including, but not 
limited to,  Best Buy, Best Buy Express, Best Buy Health, Best Buy Mobile, CST, Dynex, Geek Squad, GreatCall, Insignia, Jitterbug, 
Lively, Magnolia, Modal, My Best  Buy, Pacific Kitchen and Home , Pacific Sales, Platinum, Rocketfish , 5Star  and our  Yellow Tag  logo.  
 
We have  secured domestic and international trademark and service mark registrations for many of our brands. We have also secured 
patents for many of our inventions. We believe our intellectual property has significant value and is an important factor in the marke ting 
of our company, our stores, our products and our websites.  
 
Seasonality  
 
Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal. A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fi scal fourth 
quarter, which includes the majority of t he holiday shopping season in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.  
 
Working Capital  
 
We fund our business operations through a combination of available cash and cash equivalents and cash flows generated from 
operations. In addition, our revolving credit facilities  are available for additional working capital needs, for general corporate purposes 
and investment and growth opportunities. Our working capital needs typically increase in the months leading up to the holiday  shopping 
season as we purchase inventory in ad vance of expected sales.  
 
Competition  
 
Our competitors are primarily multi -channel retailers, e -commerce businesses, technology service providers, traditional store -based 
retailers, vendors and mobile network carriers who offer their products and services directly to customers. We believe our ability to help 
customers online, in stores and in their homes and to connect technology product and solutions with customer needs provides u s key 
competitive advantages. Some of our competitors have lower cost operati ng structures and seek to compete for sales primarily on 
Table of Contents  
 
6 price. We carefully monitor pricing offered by other retailers and service providers, as maintaining price competitiveness is  one of our 
ongoing priorities. In addition, we have price -matching polici es that allow customers to request that we match a price offered by certain 
retail stores and online operators. In order to allow this, we are focused on maintaining efficient operations and leveraging  the 
economies of scale available to us through our glo bal vendor partnerships. We believe our dedicated and knowledgeable people, our 
integrated online, retail and in -home assets, our broad and curated product assortment, our strong vendor partnerships, our service and 
support offerings designed to solve real  customer needs, our unique ability to showcase technology in distinct store formats and our 
supply chain are important ways in which we maintain our competitive advantage.  
 
Environmental and Social Matters  
 
Best Buy is an organization built on values -driven leadership and a clear purpose to enrich lives through technology. We strive to be a 
good corporate citizen in all our interactions with stakeholders, including customers, employees, vendor partners, shareholde rs, the 
environment and communit ies in which we operate.  
 
For our business to succeed, we need to hire and retain the best employees. To accomplish this, we must maintain a supportive  and 
inclusive culture that values everyone’s talents, life experiences and backgrounds  and offer compens ation and benefits that maintain 
our competitiveness and reflect our values . We recently a dded two new benefit offerings: surrogacy assistance and increased adoption 
expense reimbursement. They were the latest in a suite of expanded benefits, based on empl oyee feedback, that included paid 
caregiver leave, paid time off for part -time employees and expanded mental health resources.  
 
Best Buy has also continued to publicly show commitment to equality and non -discrimination. We joined the Human Rights Campaign 
and 160 leading U.S. companies to support the Equality Act, federal legislation that would add protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender and queer (LGBTQ) people to U.S. civil rights laws. We also signed an amicus brief with the U.S. Sup reme Court to show 
support for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients.  
 
We are committed to supporting teens from underserved communities as they build brighter futures through technology, training  and 
mentorship. The primary way we do th is is through our network of Best Buy Teen Tech Centers. The centers are safe, after -school 
learning spaces equipped with cutting -edge tech nology  where youth learn new tech skills, stay on track with school, gain exposure to 
new career possibilities and be nefit from positive adult and peer relationships. We had 33 Teen Tech Centers operating at the end of 
fiscal 2020 and plan to have at least 60 ope rating  over the next few years.  
 
Minimizing carbon emissions in our operations is a priority at Best Buy. We h ave achieved significant progress toward our carbon -
reduction goal of 75 percent by 2030 (over a 2009 baseline), from both operational reductions and renewable sourcing. In fiscal 2020, 
we made an investment in partnership with U.S. Bank and X -Elio to buil d a solar field that is expected to produce 174,000 MWh of 
clean electricity per year.   
 
We also set a new goal to help our customers cut carbon emissions by 20 percent by 2030 through purchasing ENERGY STAR® 
certified products, which will save them $5 bil lion on utility bills. In addition, we collected more than 204 million pounds of consumer 
electronics and appliances for recycling last year, bringing our total to more than 2.1 billion pounds. We continue to earn r ecognition 
from prestigious organizations , including being named to CDP’s Climate A List and ranking among Barron’s  Most Sustainable 
Companies.  
 
Please refer to  the Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability section  on our website for further information on environmental and 
social performance.   
 
Number of Employees  
 
At the end of fiscal 2020, we employed nearly  125,000 full -time, part -time and seasonal employees in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. 
We offer our employees a wide array of company -paid benefits that vary within our company due to customary local practices and  
statutory requirements , which we believe are competitive locally and in the aggregate relative to others in our industry.

7 Item 1A. Risk Factors.  
 
Described below are certain risks that we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate. Each of the fol lowing risk 
factors should carefully be considered in conjunction with other information provided in this Annual Report on Form  10-K and in our 
other public disclosures. The risks described below highlight potential events, trends or other circumstances that could adve rsely affect 
our business, financial condition, results of opera tions, cash flows, liquidity or access to sources of financing and, consequently, the 
market value of our common stock and debt instruments. These risks could cause our future results to differ materially from h istorical 
results and from guidance we may pr ovide regarding our expectations of future financial performance. The risks described below are 
not an exhaustive list of all the risks we face. There may be others that we have not identified or that we have deemed to be  immaterial. 
All forward -looking st atements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below.  
 
We face strong competition from multi -channel retailers, e -commerce businesses, technology service providers, traditional 
store -based retailers, vendors and mobile network carriers, which directly affects our revenue and profitability.  
 
While we constantly strive to offer consumers the best value, the retail sector is highly competitive. Price is of great impo rtance to most 
customers, and price transparency and compa rability continues to increase, particularly as a result of digital technology. The ability of 
consumers to compare prices on a real -time basis puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices. We compete with 
many other local, regional, natio nal and international retailers and technology service providers, as well as some of our vendors and 
mobile network carriers that market their products directly to consumers. Competition may also result from new entrants into the 
markets we serve, offering  products and/or services that compete with us.  
 
The retail sector continues to experience a trend towards an increase in sales initiated online and using mobile applications , and some 
online -only businesses have lower operating costs. Online and multi -channel retailers continue to focus on delivery services, with 
customers increasingly seeking faster, guaranteed delivery times and low -price or free shipping. Our ability to be competitive on 
delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors, and our  failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive 
delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins. Because our business strategy is  based 
on offering superior levels of customer service and a fu ll range of services to complement the products we offer, our cost structure might 
be higher than some of our competitors, and this, in conjunction with price transparency, could put pressure on our margins.  As these 
and related competitive factors evolve,  we may experience material adverse pressure on our revenue and profitability.  
 
Our strategy to expand into new products, services and technologies brings new business, financial and regulatory risks.  
 
As we introduce new products and services, using new t echnologies and applications, we may have limited experience in these newer 
market s and regulatory environments  and our customers may not like our new value propositions. These offerings may present new 
and difficult technology challenges, and we may be su bject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions, 
failures or other issues. For example, as our value proposition evolves to support the healthcare industry with technology, w e may be 
subject to privacy and information securit y rules, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and/or subject to 
increased potential liability risk.  
 
This expanded risk increases the complexity of our business and places significant responsibility on our management, employee s, 
operations, systems, technical expertise, financial resources, and internal financial and regulatory control and reporting fu nctions. In 
addition, new initiatives we test through trials and pilots may not scale or grow effectively or as we expected, which  could limit our 
growth and negatively affect our operating results. They may also involve significant laws or regulations that are beyond our  current 
expertise.  
 
In fiscal 2020, we continued to invest in our health strategy and our underlying purpose to e nrich lives through technology. The new 
health -related services offered might expose us to liability risk resulting from failures in the fulfillment of these  services. In addition, the 
services and systems used could expose us to customer data privacy and information security risks, as well as business or system 
interruption risks. These and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.  
 
Our focus on services as a strategic priority exposes us to certain risks that coul d have a material adverse impact on our 
revenue and profitability as well as our reputation.  
 
We offer a full range of services that complement our product offerings, including consultation, delivery, design, installati on, 
memberships, protection plans, re pair, set -up, technical support, and health, safety and caregiving monitoring and support. Designing, 
marketing and executing these services is subject to incremental risks. These risks include, for example:  
 
•  increased labor expense to fulfill our customer  promises ; 
•  pressure on traditional labor models to meet the evolving landscape of offerings and customer needs ; 
•  increased risk of errors or omissions in the fulfillment of services;  
•  unpredictable extended warranty failure rates and related expenses;  
•  employ ees in transit using company vehicles to visit customer locations and employees being present in customer homes, 
which may increase our scope of liability;  
•  the potential for increased scope of liability relating to managed services offerings;  
•  employees hav ing access to customer devices, including the information held on those devices, which may increase our 
responsibility for the security of those devices and privacy of the data they hold;  
•  the engagement of third parties to assist with some aspects of cons truction and installation, and the potential responsibility for 
the actions they undertake;  
Table of Contents  
 
8 •  the risk that in -home services could be more adversely impacted by inclement weather, health and safety concerns, and 
catastrophic events; and  
•  increased risk of non-compliance with new laws and regulations applicable to these services.  
 
We are subject to risks associated with company transformation.  
 
Our transformational activities within the organization are necessary to fully support our strategic vision for future customer and income 
growth , including our Building the New Blue strategy, and any decreased capability to undertake those activities  may have a material 
impact on achieving that strategy . 
 
Any l imitations in organizational, financial or operational infrastructure could decrease  our ability to realize transformational objectives 
supporting our key strategic initiatives  relating to our develo pment of competitive advantages, creating solutions for customers and 
providing  differentiated value.  If we do not have access to, or fail to dedicate, the appropriate people, management focus and resources 
to implementing these transformational objectives , our long -term growth and profitability could be adversely affected.  
 
Our reliance on key vendors and mobile network carriers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our  
revenue and profitability.  
 
We source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and internationa l vendors. In fiscal 2020, our 20 largest suppliers 
accounted for approximately 7 9% of the merchandise we purchased, with five suppliers - Apple, Samsung, Hewlett -Packard, Sony and 
LG - representing approxima tely 5 6% of total merchandise purchased. We  generally do not have long -term written contracts with our 
vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise. Our profitability depends on our securing acceptable terms 
with our vendors fo r, among other things, the price of merchandise we purchase from them, funding for various forms of promotional 
programs, payment terms, allocations of merchandise, development of compelling assortments of products, operation of vendor -
focused shopping exp eriences within our stores and terms covering returns and factory warranties. While we believe we offer 
capabilities that these vendors value and depend upon to varying degrees, our vendors may be able to leverage their competiti ve 
advantages - for example , their financial strength, the strength of their brands with customers, their own stores or online channels or 
their relationships with other retailers - to our commercial disadvantage. The potential adverse impact of these factors can be amplified 
by pri ce transparency (which can limit our flexibility to modify selling prices) and a highly competitive retail environment. Gener ally, our 
ability to negotiate favorable terms with our vendors is more difficult with vendors where our purchases represent a smal ler proportion 
of their total revenues and/or when there is less competition. In addition, vendors may decide to limit or cease allowing us to offer 
certain categories, focus their marketing efforts on alternative channels or make unfavorable changes to ou r financial or other terms.  
 
We are also dependent on a relatively small number of mobile carriers to allow us to offer mobile devices with carrier connec tions. The 
competitive strategies utilized by mobile network carriers can have a material impact on ou r business, especially with ongoing 
consolidation in the mobile industry. For example, if carriers change the structure of contracts, upgrade terms, qualificatio n 
requirements, monthly fee plans, cancellation fees or service levels, the volume of upgrades and new contracts we sign with customers 
may be reduced, adversely affecting our revenue and profitability. In addition, our carriers also may serve customers through  their own 
stores, websites, mobile applications and call centers or through other competi ng retail channels.  
 
If we fail to attract, retain and engage appropriately qualified employees, including employees in key positions, our operati ons 
and profitability may be harmed. Changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our profitabili ty. 
 
Our performance is highly dependent on attracting, retaining and engaging appropriately qualified employees in our stores, se rvice 
centers, distribution centers, field and corporate offices. Our strategy of offering high -quality services and assistance for  our customers 
requires a highly trained and engaged workforce. The turnover rate in the retail sector is relatively high, and there is an o ngoing need to 
recruit and train new employees. Factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qu alified employees include employee 
engagement, our reputation, unemployment rates, competition from other employers, availability of qualified personnel and our  ability to 
offer appropriate compensation and benefit packages. Failure to recruit or retain qu alified employees in the future may impair our 
efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities. In addition, a significant amount of turnover of  our executive 
team or other employees in key positions with specific knowledge rela ting to us, our operations and our industry may negatively impact 
our operations.  
 
We operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk that market increases in compensation and employer -provided benefits 
could have a material adverse effect on our  profitability. Market increases to employee hourly wage rates, increased cost pressure on 
employer -provided benefits, and our ability to implement corresponding adjustments within our labor model and compensation and 
benefit packages could have a material  impact to the profitability of our business.  
 
We are subject to statutory, regulatory and legal developments which could have a material adverse impact on our business.  
 
Our statutory, regulatory and legal environments expose us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could have a material 
adverse effect on our operations. Some of the most significant compliance and litigation risks we face include , but are not limited to:  
 
•  the difficulty of complying with sometimes conflicting statutes and regulat ions in local, national or international jurisdictions;  
•  the potential for unexpected costs related to compliance with new or existing environmental legislation or international 
agreements affecting energy, carbon emissions, electronics recycling and water or product materials;  
•  the challenges of ensuring compliance with applicable product compliance laws and regulations with respect to both the 
products we sell and contract to manufacture, including laws and regulations related to product safety and pr oduct transport;  
Table of Contents  
 
9 •  the financial, operational and business impact of new regulations governing data privacy and security, such as the California  
Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA");   
•  the impact of other new or changing statutes and regulations, including, but not  limited to, financial reform; National Labor 
Relations Board rule changes; healthcare reform; contracted worker labor laws; corporate governance matters; escheatment 
rules; rules governing pricing, content, distribution, copyright, mobile communications, electronic device certification or 
payment services; and/or other as yet unknown legislation that could affect how we operate and execute our strategies as well  
as alter our expense structure;  
•  the impact of litigation trends, including class action lawsuit s involving consumers and shareholders, and labor and 
employment matters; and  
•  the impact of the general election on the development, or changes in, laws, regulations and policies.  
 
With respect to the CCPA, which came into effect on January 1, 2020, the st atute provides new privacy rights for California residents 
and requires companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, allowing them to opt out of certain uses of their personal 
information. In addition, the California Attorney General has i ssued proposed rules under the CCPA. We cannot predict the impact of 
this first -of-its-kind statute and these rules that have not yet been finalized, in addition to potential privacy and security legislation in 
other states and the U.S. federal level, on o ur business or operations, but these legislative initiatives may require us to modify our data 
processing practices and policies, interfere with intended business operations or lead us to incur incremental expenses in an  effort to 
comply.  
 
The impact of th e potential implementation of more restrictive trade policies, higher tariffs or the renegotiation of existing trade 
agreements in the U.S. or countries where we sell our products and services or procure products could have a material adverse  effect 
on our  business. In particular, future trade disputes or future phases of trade negotiations with China could lead to the imposition of 
tariffs that could adversely affect our supply chain and our business and could require us to take action to mitigate those e ffects, as we 
did in fiscal 2020.  
 
Further, the impact of potential changes in U.S. or other countries' tax laws and regulations or evolving interpretations of existing laws, 
including additional guidance and legislation related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act , could adversely affect our financial condition and 
results of operations.  
 
Regulatory activity  that affects the retail sector has grown in recent years, increasing the risk of fines and additional operating costs 
associated with compliance. Additionally, defending against lawsuits and other proceedings may involve significant expense and divert 
management's attention and resources from other matters . 
 
Macroeconomic pressures in the markets in which we operate , including, but not limited to, t he effects of novel coronavirus 
disease (“COVID 19”) may adversely affect consumer spending and our financial results.  
 
To varying degrees, our products and services are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spend ing. 
As a r esult, consumers may be affected in many different ways, including, for example:  
 
•  whether or not they make a purchase;  
•  their choice of brand, model or price -point;  
•  how frequently they  upgrade or replace their devices; and  
•  their appetite for complementary s ervices (for example, protection plans).  
 
Real GDP growth, consumer confidence, the COVID -19 pandemic discussed in the following risk factor, inflation, employment levels, oil 
prices, interest rates, tax rates, availability of consumer financing, housing m arket conditions, foreign currency exchange rate 
fluctuations, costs for items such as fuel and food and other macroeconomic trends can adversely affect consumer demand for t he 
products and services that we offer. Geopolitical issues around the world and h ow our markets are positioned can also impact the 
macroeconomic conditions and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.  
 
The impact of COVID -19 is expected to adversely affect our business and our financial results.  
 
Concerns have rapidly grown regarding the outbreak of COVID -19. As the pandemic continues to grow, consumer fear about becoming 
ill with the virus and recommendations and/or mandates from federal, state and local authorities to avoid large gatherings of  people or 
self-quarantine have increased, which will adversely affect traffic to our stores. In particular, we recently announced a shift to enhanced 
curbside service only for all of our stores on an interim basis. Further, all in -home installation and repai r has been temporarily 
suspended and all in -home consultations are being conducted virtually. The significant reduction in customer visits to, and spending at, 
our stores caused by COVID -19 will likely result in a loss of sales and profits and other materi al adverse effects. We may further restrict 
the operations of our stores and distribution facilities if we deem this necessary or if recommended or mandated by authoriti es and 
these measures could have a further material impact on our sales and profits. Al so, if we do not respond appropriately to the pandemic, 
or if customers do not perceive our response to be adequate for a particular region or our company as a whole, we could suffe r damage 
to our reputation and our brand, which could adversely affect our business in the future.  
 
COVID -19 also impacted our supply chain for products we sell, particularly as a result of mandatory shutdowns in locations where ou r 
products are manufactured. We could also see significant disruptions to our supply chain in the U. S. as well as significant deterioration 
in macroeconomic factors that typically affect us, such as consumer spending.  
 
In addition, we expect to incur significant costs in our response to the pandemic, including, but not limited to, costs incur red to 
Table of Contents  
 
10 imple ment the operational changes described above and certain payments to or other costs relating to employees who are not working  
during the pandemic.  
 
The extent of the impact of COVID -19 on our business and financial results will also depend on future developments, including the 
duration and spread of the outbreak within the markets in which we operate and the related impact on consumer confidence and 
spending, all of which are highly uncertain.  
 
Failure to effectively manage our costs could have a mate rial adverse effect on our profitability.  
 
As discussed above, our revenues are susceptible to volatility from various sources, which can lead to periods of flat or dec lining 
revenues. However, some of our operating costs are fixed and/or are subject to mu lti-year contracts. Some elements of our costs may 
be higher than our competitors' because of, for example, our  extended  retail footprint and structure, our differential service offerings or 
our levels of customer service. Accordingly, our ongoing drive to  reduce costs and increase efficiency represents a strategic imperative. 
Failure to successfully manage our costs could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and curtail our ability to  fund our 
growth or other critical initiatives.  
 
We rely h eavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes. Any failure or interruption in these 
systems could have a material adverse impact on our business.  
 
The effective and efficient operation of our business is dependent on our infor mation technology systems and those of our information 
technology vendors. We rely heavily on these information technology systems to manage all key aspects of our business, includ ing 
demand forecasting, purchasing, supply chain management, point -of-sale p rocessing, services fulfillment, staff planning and 
deployment, financial management, reporting and forecasting and safeguarding critical and sensitive information.  
 
Our information technology systems and those of our partners are subject to damage or inte rruption from power outages, computer and 
telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial -of-service attacks, security breaches 
(through cyber -attacks and other malicious actions), catastrophic events (such a s fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes) and 
usage errors by our employees. The failure or interruption of these information systems, data centers or their backup systems  could 
significantly disrupt our business and cause higher costs and lost reven ues and could threaten our ability to remain in operation.  
 
Our information technology systems could also be adversely affected by changes that result from COVID -19, including for example, a 
significant increase in remote working of our employees and an in crease in online orders due to restrictions on our retail operations.    
 
We also utilize complex information technology platforms to operate our websites and mobile applications. If we fail to secur e these 
systems against attacks or fail to effectively up grade and maintain our hardware, software, network and system infrastructure and 
improve the efficiency and resiliency of our systems, it could cause system interruptions and delays. Disruptions to these se rvices, such 
as those caused by unforeseen traffic  levels, malicious attacks, other technical difficulties or events outside of our control, such as 
natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures or loss of critical data, could prevent us from accepting and fulfill ing customer 
orders for products  or services, which could cause us to forgo material revenues, incur material costs and adversely affect our 
reputation.  
 
Failure to prevent or effectively respond to a breach of the privacy or security of our customer, employee, vendor or company  
informat ion could expose us to substantial costs and reputational damage, as well as litigation and enforcement actions.  
 
Our business involves the collection, use and storage of personal information, including payment card information, as well as  
confidential information regarding our employees, vendors and other company information. We also share personal and confident ial 
information with suppliers and other third parties, as well as use third -party technology and systems which transmit information for a 
variety of activities. We have been the target of attempted cyber -attacks and other security threats, and we may be subjec t to breaches 
of our information technology systems. While we engage in significant data -protection efforts, criminal activity, such as cyber -attacks, 
lapses in our controls or the intentional or negligent actions of employees, business associates or third  parties, may undermine our 
privacy and security measures , and, as a result, unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate 
employee, customer and other confidential data , or authorized parties may use or share personal infor mation in an inappropriate 
manner. Furthermore, because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately 
detected, we may be unable to anticipate such attacks or promptly and effectively respond to them. Any compr omise of our customer 
information or other confidential information could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or our relationships wit h our 
customers and partners, which may in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and may expose us to ma terial costs, penalties and 
claims.  
 
Sensitive customer data may also be present on customer -owned devices entrusted to us for service and repair. Vulnerable code on 
products sold or serviced, including our exclusive brands, may also result in a compromise  of customer privacy or security. Our efforts 
to protect against such compromises and ensure appropriate handling of customer data on devices we manufacture, sell and serv ice 
may not be effective, resulting in potential liability and damage to our customer  relationships.  
 
Increasing costs associated with information security and privacy, such as increased investment in technology and qualified s taff, costs 
of compliance, costs resulting from fraud, and costs of cyber and privacy insurance, could cause our b usiness and results of operations 
to suffer materially. Additionally, new laws, such as the CCPA , are expand ing our  obligations to protect the privacy and security of 
customer data, requiring additional resources and creating incremental risk arising from a potential breach. In addition, any compromise 
of our data security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to addi tional legal 
risk.

11 Failure to effectively manage strategic ventures, alliances or acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business.  
 
We may decide to enter into new  joint ventures, partnerships, alliances or acquisitions with third parties (collectively, "new ventures"). 
Assessing the viability of new ventures is typically subj ect to significant uncertainty and the success of such new ventures can be 
adversely affected by many factors, including, for example:  
 
•  different and incremental business risks of the new venture  not identified in our diligence assessment s; 
•  failure to motivate and retain key employees of the new venture;  
•  uncertainty of forecasting financial performance;  
•  failure to integrate aspects of the new venture into our existing business, such as new product or service offerings or 
information technology systems;  
•  failure to maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting;  
•  failure to generate expected synergies, such as cost reductions;  
•  unforeseen changes in the business environment of the new venture;  
•  disputes or st rategic differences with other third -party participants in the new venture; and  
•  adverse impacts on relationships with vendors and other key partners of our existing business or the new venture.  
 
If new ventures are unsuccessful, our liquidity and profitabi lity could be materially adversely affected, and we may be required to 
recognize material impairments to goodwill and other assets acquired. New ventures may also divert our financial resources an d 
management's attention from other important areas of our b usiness.  
 
We are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the 
majority of the holiday shopping season.  
 
A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth  quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday 
shopping season in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. In addition, the holiday shopping season also incorporates many other unpredi ctable 
factors, such as the level of competitive promotional activity, new pro duct release activity and customer buying patterns, which makes it 
difficult to forecast and react to these factors quickly. Unexpected events or developments, such as natural or man -made disasters, 
changes in consumer demand, economic factors, product sou rcing issues, cyber -attacks, failure or interruption of management 
information systems or disruptions in services or systems provided or managed by third -party vendors could significantly disrupt our 
operations. As a result of these factors, there is a ris k that our fiscal fourth quarter and annual results could be adversely affected.  
 
Many of the products we sell are highly susceptible to technological advancement, product life cycle fluctuations and 
changes in consumer preferences.  
 
We operate in a highly and increasingly dynamic industry sector fueled by constant technology innovation and disruption. This  
manifests itself in a variety of ways: the emergence of new products and categories, rapid maturation of categories, cannibalizati on of 
categories, declining price points and product replacement and upgrade cycles.  
 
This rapid pace of change can be hard to predict and manage, and there is no guarantee we can effectively do this all the time . If we fail 
to interpret, predict and react  to these changes in a timely and effective manner, the consequences can include: failure to offer the 
products and services that our customers want; having excess inventory, which may require heavy discounting or liquidation; i nability to 
secure adequate access to brands or products for which consumer demand exceeds supply; delays in adapting our merchandising, 
marketing or supply chain capabilities to accommodate changes in product trends; and damage to our brand and reputation.  These and 
other similar fa ctors could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.  
 
Economic, regulatory and other developments could adversely affect our ability to offer attractive promotional financing to 
our customers and adversely affect the profits we gene rate from these programs.  
 
We offer promotional financing and credit cards issued by third -party banks that manage and directly extend credit to our customers. 
Customers choosing promotional financing can receive extended payment terms and low - or no -interest financing on qualifying 
purchases. We believe our financing programs generate incremental revenue from customers who prefer the financing terms to ot her 
available forms of payment or otherwise need access to financing in order to make purchases . Approx imately 2 5% of our fiscal 2020 
revenue was transacted using one of the company's branded cards.  In addition, we earn profit -share income and share in any losses 
from certain of our banking partners based on the performance of the programs. The income or lo ss we earn in this regard is subject to 
numerous factors, including the volume and value of transactions, the terms of promotional financing offers, bad debt rates, interest 
rates, the regulatory and competitive environment and expenses of operating the pr ogram. Adverse changes to any of these factors 
could impair our ability to offer these programs to customers and reduce customer purchases and our ability to earn income fr om 
sharing in the profits of the programs.  
 
Interruptions and other factors affectin g our supply chain, including in -bound deliveries from our vendors, may adversely 
affect our business.  
 
Our supply chain is a critical part of our operations, particularly in light of industry trends and initiatives, such as ship -from-store and the 
emphasi s on fast delivery when purchasing online . We depend on our vendors' abilities to deliver products to us at the right location, 
right time and in the right quantities. We also depend on third parties for the operation of certain aspects of our supply ch ain network. 
The factors that can adversely affect these aspects of our operations include, but are not limited to:  
 
Table of Contents  
 
12 •  interruptions to our delivery capabilities;  
•  failure of third parties to meet our standards or commitments;  
•  disruptions to our systems and the need to implement new systems;  
•  limitations in capacity;  
•  consolidation or business failures in the transportation and distribution sectors;  
•  labor strikes or slow -downs impacting ports or any other aspect of our supply chain;  
•  diseases, pandemics (including C OVID -19), outbreaks and other health -related concerns, which have resulted in and could 
continue to result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods 
produced in infected areas;  
•  damages or other loss to products; and  
•  increasing transportation costs.  
 
It is important that we maintain optimal levels of inventory in each store and distribution center and respond rapidly to shi fting demands. 
Any disruption to, or inefficiency in, our supply chain network could damage our revenue and profitability. The risks associated with our 
dependence on third parties are greater for small parcel home deliveries because of the relatively small number of carriers w ith the 
scope and capacity required by our business. The continuing growth of online purchases for delivery increases our exposure to these 
risks. If we fail to manage these risks effectively, we could experience a material adverse impact on our reputation, revenue  and 
profitability.  
 
Catast rophic events could adversely affect our operating results.  
 
The risk or actual occurrence of various catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our financial performanc e. Such 
events may be caused by, for example:  
 
•  natural disasters or ex treme weather events;  
•  diseases or pandemics (including COVID -19) that have affected and may continue to affect our employees, customers or 
partners;  
•  floods, fires or other catastrophes affecting our properties , employees or customers ; or 
•  terrorism, civil u nrest, mass violence or violent acts, or other conflicts.  
 
In recent years, we have observed an increase in the number and severity of certain events in many of our markets. Such event s can 
adversely affect our work force and prevent employees and customer s from reaching our stores and properties and can disrupt or 
disable portions of our supply chain and distribution network. They can also affect our information technology systems, resul ting in 
disruption to various aspects of our operations, including our  ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders. As a consequence of 
these or other catastrophic events, we may endure interruption to our operations or losses of property, equipment or inventor y, which 
could adversely affect our revenue and profita bility.  
 
Demand for the products and services we sell could decline if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition 
through a focused co nsumer  experience approach.  
 
We operate a portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation. We believe that recognition and the reputation 
of our company and our  brands are key to our success. Operational factors , such as  failure to deliver high quality services, 
uncompetitive pricing, failure to meet delivery promises or business interruptions , could damage our reputation. External factors, such 
as negative public remarks or accusations, could also be damaging. The ubiquity of social media means that customer feedback and 
other information about our company are shared with  a broad audience in a manner that is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated. 
Damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in, among other things, declines in revenues and customer l oyalty, 
decreases in gift card and service plan s ales, lower employee retention and productivity and vendor relationship issues, all of which 
could materially adversely affect our revenue and profitability.  
 
Product safety and quality concerns could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profi tability.  
 
If the products we sell fail to meet applicable safety standards or our customers' expectations regarding safety and quality,  we could be 
exposed to increased legal risk and our reputation may be damaged. Failure to take appropriate actions in r elation to product recalls 
could lead to breaches of laws and regulations and leave us susceptible to government enforcement actions or private litigati on. Recalls 
of products, particularly when combined with lack of available alternatives or our difficult y in sourcing sufficient volumes of replacement 
products, could also have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.  
 
Changes to labor or employment laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our costs and impair the viability of 
our operating model.  
 
As an employer of nearly 125,000 people in a large  number of different jurisdictions, we are subject to risks related to employment laws 
and regulations including, for example:  
 
•  the organization of unions and related regulations that affect the nature of labor relations, changes to which the National Labor 
Relations Board continually considers;  
•  laws that impact the relationship between the company and independent contractors; and  
•  laws that impact minimum wage, sick tim e, paid leave and scheduling requirements could directly or indirectly increase our 
payroll costs and/or impact the level of service we are able to provide.  
Table of Contents  
 
13  
Changes to laws and regulations such as these could adversely impact our reputation, our ability t o continue operations and our 
profitability.  
 
Failure to effectively manage our real estate portfolio may negatively impact our operating results.  
 
Effective management of our real estate portfolio is critical to our multi -channel strategy. Failure to iden tify and secure suitable locations 
for our stores and other facilities could impair our ability to compete successfully and our profitability. Most of our prope rties are leased, 
of which some are subject to long -term leases. As such, it is essential that w e effectively evaluate a range of factors that may influence 
the success of our long -term real estate strategy. Such factors include, for example:  
 
•  changing patterns of customer consumption and behavior, particularly in light of an evolving multi -channel e nvironment;  
•  the location and appropriate number of stores in our portfolio;  
•  the interior layout, format and size of our stores;  
•  the products and services we offer at each store;  
•  the local competitive positioning, trade area demographics and economic factor s for each of our stores;  
•  the primary term lease commitment and long -term lease option coverage for each store;  
•  the occupancy cost of our stores relative to market rents; and  
•  our supply chain service location network strategy.  
 
If we fail to effectively ev aluate these factors or negotiate appropriate terms or if unforeseen changes arise, the consequences could 
include, for example:  
 
•  closing stores and abandoning the related assets, while retaining the financial commitments of the leases;  
•  incurring significa nt costs to remodel or transform our stores;  
•  operating stores, supply chain or service locations that no longer meet the needs of our business; and  
•  bearing excessive lease expenses.  
 
These consequences could have a material adverse impact on our profitability, cash flows and liquidity.  
 
For leased property, the financial impact of exiting a location can vary greatly depending on, among other factors, the terms  of the 
lease, the condition of the local real estate market, demand for the specific pro perty, our relationship with the landlord and the 
availability of potential sub -lease tenants. It is difficult for us to influence some of these factors and the costs of exiting a property can 
be significant. In addition to rent, we are still responsible f or taxes, insurance and common area maintenance charges for vacant 
properties until the lease commitment expires or is terminated. Similarly, when we enter into a contract with a tenant to sub -lease 
property, we usually retain our obligations as the master  lessee. This leaves us at risk for any remaining liability in the event of default 
by the sub -lease tenant.  
 
Constraints in the capital markets or our vendor credit terms may have a material adverse impact on our liquidity.  
 
We need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements, service our outstanding indebtedness and finance 
business opportunities. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations or we may not be able to p ursue 
business opportunities. The principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities, available cash and liquid 
investments, credit facilities , other debt arrangements  and trade payables . Our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted if our 
vendors reduce payment terms and/or impose tighter credit limits. If our sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements, we may  
need to seek additional financing. The future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as economic  and market 
conditions, the regulatory environment for banks and other financial institutions, the availability of credit, our credit rat ings and our 
reputation with potential lenders. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our costs of borrowing , our ability to pursue 
business opportunities and threaten our ability to meet our obligations as they become due.  
 
Changes in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase our borrowing costs.  
 
Any future downgrades to our cr edit ratings and outlook could negatively impact the perception of our credit risk and thus our access to 
capital markets, borrowing costs, vendor terms and lease terms. Our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us  or 
obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies 
at any time. Rating agencies may change the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control, including  the 
introduction of new rating practices and methodologies.  
 
We utilize third -party vendors for certain aspects of our operations, and any material disruption in our relationship or their 
services might have an impact to our business.  
 
We engage key third -party business partners to support various functions of our business, including , but not limited to, information 
technology, web hosting and cloud -based services, human resource operations, customer loyalty programs, promotional financing and 
customer loyalty cr edit cards, gift cards, customer warranty, delivery and installation, technical support, transportation and insurance 
programs. Any material disruption in our relationship with key third -party business partners or any disruption in the services or systems 
provided or managed by third parties could impact our revenues and cost structure and hinder our operations, particularly if a disruption 
occurs during peak revenue periods.

14 Our exclusive brands products are subject to several additional product, supply c hain and legal risks that could affect our 
operating results.  
 
Sales of our exclusive brands products, which include Dynex, Insignia, Modal, Platinum and Rocketfish branded products,  as well as 
other products such as Jitterbug, Lively Mobile and Lively Mob ile Plus,  represent an important component of our product offerings and 
our revenue and profitability. Most of these products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeast Asia. Thi s 
arrangement exposes us to the following additional potent ial risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results:  
 
•  we have greater exposure and responsibility to consumers for warranty replacements and repairs as a result of exclusive 
brand product defects, and our recourse to contract man ufacturers for such warranty liabilities may be limited in foreign 
jurisdictions;  
•  we may be subject to regulatory compliance and/or product liability claims relating to personal injury, death or property 
damage caused by exclusive brand products, some of w hich may require us to take significant actions, such as product 
recalls;  
•  we have experienced and are likely to continue to experience disruptions in manufacturing and logistics due to COVID -19, and 
we may experience disruptions in manufacturing or logisti cs in the future due to inconsistent and unanticipated order patterns, 
our inability to develop long -term relationships with key manufacturers , other diseases or pandemics or unforeseen natural 
disasters;  
•  we may not be able to locate manufacturers that meet our internal standards, whether for new exclusive brand products or for 
migration of the manufacturing of products from an existing manufacturer;  
•  we may be subject to a greater risk of inventory obsolescence as we do not generally h ave return to vendor rights;  
•  we are subject to developing and often -changing labor and environmental laws for the manufacture of products in foreign 
countries, and we may be unable to conform to new rules or interpretations in a timely manner;  
•  we may be su bject to claims by technology or other intellectual property owners if we inadvertently infringe upon their patents 
or other intellectual property rights, or if we fail to pay royalties owed on our exclusive brand products;  
•  our operations may be disrupted by trade disputes or excessive tariffs , including any future trade disputes or future phases of 
trade negotiations with China, and we may not be able to source alternatives quickly enough to avoid interruptions in product 
supply;  
•  we may be unable to obtain  or adequately protect patents and other intellectual property rights on our exclusive brand 
products or manufacturing processes; and  
•  regulations regarding disclosure of efforts to identify the country of origin of “conflict minerals” in certain portions o f our supply 
chain could increase the cost of doing business and, depending on the findings of our country of origin inquiry, could have a n 
adverse effect on our reputation.  
 
Maintaining consistent quality, availability and competitive pricing of our exclu sive brand products helps us build and maintain customer 
loyalty, generate revenue and achieve acceptable margins. Failure to maintain these factors could have a significant adverse impact on 
the demand for exclusive brand products and the profits we are a ble to generate from them.  
 
We are subject to risks associated with vendors that source products outside of the U.S.  
 
Our ability to find qualified vendors who can supply products in a timely and efficient manner that meet our internal standar ds of quality  
and safety can be difficult, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the U.S. Risks such as political or econom ic instability, 
cross -border trade restrictions or tariffs, merchandise quality issues, product safety concerns, work stoppages, p ort delays, foreign 
currency exchange rate fluctuations, transportation capacity and costs, inflation, civil unrest, natural disasters, outbreaks  of pandemics 
(including COVID -19) and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. Vendors may also fail to invest adequately in 
design, production or distribution facilities, and may reduce their customer incentives, advertising and promotional activiti es or change 
their pricing policies.  These and other related issues could have a material adv erse impact on our financial results.  
 
Our international activities are subject to many of the same risks as described above, as well as to risks associated with th e 
legislative, judicial, regulatory, political, economic and cultural factors specific to th e countries or regions in which we 
operate.  
 
We operate retail locations in Canada and Mexico. In addition, most of our exclusive brand products are manufactured by contr act 
manufacturers based in southeast Asia. We also have wholly owned legal entities re gistered in various other foreign countries, including 
Barbados, Bermuda, China, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, the Republic of Mauritius  and the U.K. During fiscal 2020, our International 
segment's operations generated 8% of our revenue. In general, the risk fact ors identified above also have relevance to our International 
operations. In addition, our International operations also expose us to other risks, including those related to, for example:  
 
•  political conditions and geopolitical events, including war and ter rorism;  
•  economic conditions, including monetary and fiscal policies and tax rules, as well as foreign exchange rate risk;  
•  rules governing international trade and potential changes to trade policies or trade agreements and ownership of foreign 
entities;  
•  government -imposed travel restrictions or warnings, whether in response to the COVID -19 pandemic or otherwise, and 
differing responses of governmental authorities to pandemics and other global events;  
•  cultural differences that we may be unable to anticipate o r respond to appropriately;  
•  different rules or practices regarding employee relations, including the existence of works councils or unions;  
•  difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights; and  
•  difficulties encountered in exerting appropriate managem ent oversight to operations in remote locations.

These factors could significantly disrupt our International operations and have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 
and could lead us to incur material impairments and other exit costs.  
 
Failure to meet the financial performance guidance or other forward -looking statements we have provided to the public could 
result in a decline in our stock price.  
 
We may provide public guidance on our expected financial results or other forward -looking information for future periods. Although we 
believe that this guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of management's expectations for the f uture and 
is useful to our existing and potential shareholders, such guidance is  comprised of forward -looking statements subject to the risks and 
uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements. Our actual results may not be i n line with 
guidance we have provided. We may not be able to accu rately forecast our growth rate and profit margins. We base our expense levels 
and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments are fixed , and we may not be able to 
adjust our spending quickly enough if our sal es are less than expected. Our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our 
percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depend on the continued growth of demand for th e 
products and services offered by us, and our busines s is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide. If our 
financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of market participants, or if we reduc e our guidance 
for future periods, the market price of our common stock may decline.

(1) In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we adopted new lease accounting guidance that resulted in the recognition of operating l ease assets and operating lease liabilities on 
the balance sheet. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , and Note  10, Leases , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in 
Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form  10-K, for additional information regarding this adoption.  
(2) Fiscal 2018 included 53 weeks. All other periods presented included 52 weeks.  
(3) Our comparable sales calculation compares revenue from stores, websites and call centers operating for at least 14 full month s, as well as revenue related to certain 
other comparable sales channels for a parti cular period to the corresponding period in the prior year. Relocated stores, as well as remodeled, expanded and downsized 
stores closed more than 14 days, are excluded from the comparable sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reope ning. Ac quisitions are included in the 
comparable sales calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisi tion. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we refined 
our methodology for calculating comparable sal es. It now reflects certain revenue streams previously excluded from the comparable sales calculation, such as credit 
card revenue, gift card breakage, commercial sales and sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers, as applicable. The im pact of adopt ing these changes  is 
immaterial to all periods presented, and therefore prior -period comparable sales disclosures have not been restated. Refer to Item 7, Management’s Discussion and 
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , of this Annual Report on Form 10 -K, for additional information regarding our comparable sales calculation.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  
  
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") is intended to provide a reade r of 
our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, 
liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Unless otherwise noted, transactions and other factor s significant ly 
impacting our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity are discussed in order of magnitude. Our MD&A is prese nted in the 
following sections:  
  
•  Overview  
•  Business Strategy  
•  Results of Operations  
•  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
•  Critical Accounting Estimates  
•  New Accounting Pronouncements

23 Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item  8, Financial 
Statements and Supplementary Data,  of this Annual Report on Form  10-K.  
 
In March 2019, the SEC adopted the final rule under SEC Release No. 33 -10618, FAST Act Modernization and Simplification of 
Regulation S -K (“FAST Act”) . The amendment aims to modernize and simplify certain reporting requirements and improve readabil ity 
and navigability between disclosures. On adoption of this amendment, we omitted analysis of the results of operations  and cash flows  
for the year ended February 2, 2019, in comparison to the year ended February 3, 2018. For such omitted disclosures, re fer to Item 7, 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , of our Annual Report on Form  10-K for the 
fiscal year ended February  2, 2019 , filed with the SEC on March 28, 2019, which Item 7 is incorporated by reference herein.  
 
Overview  
 
Our purpose is to enrich the lives of consumers through technology. We have two reportable segments: Domestic and Internation al. 
The Domestic segment is comprised of the operations in all states, districts and territories of the U.S. under vario us brand names 
including Best  Buy, Best Buy Business, Best Buy Express, Best Buy Health, CST, Geek Squad, GreatCall, Lively, Magnolia and Pacific 
Kitchen and Home  and the domain names bestbuy.com and greatcall.com . The International segment is comprised of  all operations in 
Canada and Mexico under the brand names Best  Buy, Best Buy Express, Best  Buy Mobile  and Geek Squad and the domain names 
bestbuy.ca and bestbuy.com.mx.  
 
Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of January. Fiscal 2020 and fisc al 2019 included 52 weeks, while fiscal 2018 
included 53 weeks with the additional week occurring in the fiscal fourth quarter. Our business, like that of many retailers,  is seasonal. A 
large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fisca l fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday 
shopping season in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.  
 
Comparable Sales  
 
Throughout this MD&A, we refer to comparable sales. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we refined our methodology for calculating 
comparable sales. It now reflects certain revenue streams previously excluded from the comparable sales calculation, such as credit 
card revenue, gift card breakage, commercial sales and sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers, as appli cable. The impact of 
adopting these changes is immaterial to all periods presented, and therefore prior -period comparable sales disclosures have not been 
restated. Our comparable sales calculation compares revenue from stores, websites and call centers ope rating for at least 14 full 
months, as well as revenue related to certain other comparable sales channels for a particular period to the corresponding pe riod in the 
prior year. Relocated stores, as well as remodeled, expanded and downsized stores closed mo re than 14 days, are excluded from the 
comparable sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. Acquisitions are included in the comparable sales  calculation 
beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the da te of the acquisition. The calculation of comparable sales 
excludes the impact of revenue from discontinued operations and the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  
(applicable to our International segment only). The method of calculati ng comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, 
our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers' methods.  
 
On March 1, 2018, we announced our intent to close all of our 257 remaining Best Buy Mobile sta nd-alone stores in the U.S. As a 
result, all revenue related to these stores has been excluded from the comparable sales calculation beginning in March 2018. On 
October 1, 2018, we acquired all outstanding shares of GreatCall, Inc. (“GreatCall”) and on May  9, 2019, we acquired all outstanding 
shares of Critical Signal Technologies, Inc. (“CST”) . Consistent with our comparable sales policy, the results of GreatCall are included in 
our comparable sales calculation beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 202 0, and the results of CST are excluded from our 
comparable sales calculation for the periods presented.  
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures  
 
This MD&A includes financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States 
("GAAP"), as well as certain adjusted or non -GAAP financial measures, such as constant currency, non -GAAP operating income, non -
GAAP effective tax rate and non -GAAP diluted earnings per share ("EPS") from continuing operations. We believe tha t non -GAAP 
financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, can provide more information to assist investo rs in 
evaluating current period performance and in assessing future performance. For these reasons, our internal managem ent reporting also 
includes non -GAAP financial measures. Generally, our non -GAAP financial measures include adjustments for items such as 
restructuring charges, goodwill impairments, gains and losses on investments, intangible asset amortization, certain a cquisition -related 
costs and the tax effect of all such items. In addition, certain other items may be excluded from non -GAAP financial measures when we 
believe doing so provides greater clarity to management and our investors. These non -GAAP financial mea sures should be considered 
in addition to, and not superior to or as a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. We strongly encourage investors and shar eholders 
to review our financial statements and publicly -filed reports in their entirety and not to rely  on any single financial measure. Non -GAAP 
financial measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.  
 
In our discussions of the operating results of our Consolidated business and our International se gment, we sometimes refer to the 
impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are 
references to the differences between the foreign currency exchange rates we use to convert the In ternational segment’s operating 
results from local currencies into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. We also may use the term "constant currency," which r epresents 
results adjusted to exclude foreign currency impacts. We calculate those impacts as the d ifference between the current period results 
translated using the current period currency exchange rates and using the comparable prior period currency exchange rates. We  
Table of Contents  
 
24 believe the disclosure of revenue changes in constant currency provides useful supple mentary information to investors in light of 
significant fluctuations in currency rates.  
 
Refer to the  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  section below for the detailed reconciliation of items that impacted non -GAAP operating 
income, non -GAAP effective tax rate a nd non -GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations in the presented periods.  
 
Business Strategy  
 
In fiscal 2020, we grew our Enterprise comparable sales by 2.1% on top of 4.8% in fiscal 2019, which represents our sixth con secutive 
year of positive Enterprise comparable sales. We also increased GAAP diluted EPS by 10.6% to $5.75 and increased our non -GAAP 
diluted EPS by 14.1% to $6.07. In addition, we recorded annual revenue of $43.6 billion, GAAP operating income of $2.0 billio n and 
non-GAAP operati ng income of $2.1 billion in fiscal 2020. Compared to fiscal 2019, our fiscal 2020 GAAP and non -GAAP operating 
income as a percentage of revenue increased approximately 20 basis points and approximately 30 basis points, respectively. Fr om a 
capital allocat ion standpoint, we returned $1.5 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.  
 
We continue to make progress on our Building the New Blue strategy and our purpose to enrich lives through technology. Our st rategy 
is to leverage our un ique combination of tech and touch to meet every day human needs and build more and deeper relationships with 
customers. We believe our strategy will translate to an economic model that delivers results by better serving existing custo mers, 
capturing new d emand, entering new spaces and building capabilities while maintaining profitability over time.  
 
During fiscal 2020 we continued to expand our Total Tech Support program, ending fiscal 2020 with almost 2.3 million members.  
Having a service that provides m embers unlimited Geek Squad support for all their technology no matter where or when they bought it, 
is a compelling value proposition for our members. We also expanded our In -Home Advisor program from 530 advisors to 
approximately 720 advisors and provide d more than 250,000 free, in -home consultations to customers across the nation. In Health, we 
continued to advance our initiatives designed to help seniors live longer in their homes with the help of technology. We succ essfully 
integrated acquisitions that  have given us the capabilities, infrastructure, talent and a base of customer relationships to build from. We 
continued to elevate the customer experience around product fulfillment, enabled by the advancement of our supply chain 
transformation. In parall el to the customer experience work, we continued to drive efficiencies and reduce costs in order to fund 
investments and offset pressures.  
 
In addition to these accomplishments, we are proud of our progress in advancing our Corporate Social Responsibility  and Sustainability 
efforts. In fact, we were named to the top 5 on Barron’s annual “100 Most Sustainable Companies” list for the third consecuti ve year.  
 
In September 2019, we set three fiscal 2025 targets focused on employees, customers and financials, w hich are:  
 
• to be one of the best companies to work for in the U.S., exemplified by being named to Fortune’s “100 Best Companies” to 
work for list;  
• to double the number of significant customer relationship events to 50 million, which includes Total Tech Sup port 
memberships, homes visited, active digital engagement, customers using our financial services offerings and senior lives 
supported; and  
• to deliver continued top - and bottom -line growth over time, specifically to get to $50 billion in revenue and a 5.0 % non -GAAP 
operating income rate in fiscal 2025.  
 
Looking to the future, our priorities will look to build upon our momentum and remain focused on achieving our fiscal 2025 ta rgets. We 
will continue to bring our deep consumer electronics expertise and abil ity to partner with vendors to commercialize their new 
technology, offering customers great products and solutions. Our priorities will also include increasing our Total Tech Suppo rt member 
base, growing our Health business and continuing to expand our In -Home Advisor program. We will also continue to innovate and 
design multi -channel experiences that solve customer needs across our website, app and other channels in ways that enhance the 
experience across online and physical shopping and continue with our supply chain transformation, including using automation and 
process improvements to expand fulfillment options, increase delivery speed and improve delivery and installation. In additio n, as has 
been our brand over the last several years, we will strive to  keep driving cost reductions and efficiencies throughout the business.  
 
Impact of COVID -19 
 
We are closely monitoring the impact of COVID -19 on all aspects of our business and in all of our locations. We are making the best 
decisions we can with two goals in mind: protecting employees, customers and their respective families, while trying our bes t to serve 
our customers who rely on us for increasingly vital technology. We have seen increased demand for products that people need to work 
or learn from home, as well as those products that allow people to refrigerate or freeze food. As we meet the dem and for these 
necessities, we are adjusting how we operate in many ways to improve safety. For example, e xcept where otherwise directed by state 
and local authorities, o n March 22, 2020, we shifted to enhanced curbside service only for all of ou r U.S.  stores on an interim basis. 
Customer s can also still order online or via the Best Buy app and have their products shipped directly to their homes. Large products , 
such as appliances , will be delivered where permitted and under strict safety guidelines wit h doorstep drop -off deliveries only . All in -
home installation and repair has been temporarily suspended and all in -home consultations are being conducted virtually. We may 
further restrict the operations of our stores and distribution facilities and these measures could have a material impact on our revenues 
and profits. COVID -19 could also lead to significant disruption to our supply chain for products we sell and could trigger a significant 
deterioration in macroeconomic factors that typically affect us, such as consumer spending.  
 
Table of Contents  
 
25 All Best Buy employees have been told they do not have to work if they do not feel comfortable and to stay home if they are f eeling 
sick, knowing they will be paid. All field employees whose hours have been eliminated will be p aid for two weeks at their normal wage 
rate based on their average hours worked over the last 10 weeks.  
 
It is not possible to predict  the likelihood, timing or severity of the aforementioned direct and indirect impacts of COVID -19 on our 
business. In ligh t of the uncertainty in this fluid environment, on March 19, 2020, we drew the full amount of our $1.25 billion revolving 
credit facility and temporarily suspended all share repurchases.  
 
Tariffs  
 
During fiscal 2020, we worked to actively address the risks related to increases to tariff rates and proposed new tariffs on Chinese 
imports. In May 2019, the U.S. Trade Representative (“USTR”) increased the tariff on List 3 products imported from China from  10% to 
25%, effective June 15, 2019. The USTR also implemented a List 4 tariff of 15% on additional products imported from China. The List 4 
tariffs had two effective dates. The first effective date (List 4A) was September 1, 2019, and the most notable affected categories 
relative to Best Buy on this list are televisions, smart watches and headphones. The second effective date (List 4B) was December 15, 
2019, and the most notable affected categories relative to Best Buy on this list are computing, mobile phones and gaming cons oles. On 
January 15, 2020, the U.S. and China completed a “phase one” trade agreement.  Under the agreement , List 4A tariffs were reduced 
from 15 % to 7.5 %, effective 30 days later. List 4B tariffs were suspended indefinitely and List 1 -3 tariffs of 25% were maintained. There 
was no timel ine given for additional phases (or tariff actions) to begin or to be concluded. Throughout fiscal 2020, we were able to 
minimize the impact of tariffs on our business by accelerating purchases and working with our vendors, some of which are in t he 
process  of migrating their manufacturing out of China, factoring tariffs into our product assortment decisions, promotional and prici ng 
strategies, sourcing changes and other strategies in partnership with our vendors. However, future trade disputes with China or future 
phases of trade negotiations between the U.S. and China could lead to the imposition of new tariffs or other adverse conseque nces for 
our business.   
 
Results of Operations  
 
In order to align our fiscal reporting periods and comply with statutory fi ling requirements, we consolidate the financial results of our 
Mexico operations on a one -month  lag. Consistent with such consolidation, the financial and non -financial information presented in our 
MD&A relative to these operations is also presented on a l ag. Our policy is to accelerate the recording of events occurring in the lag 
period that significantly affect our consolidated financial statements. No such events were identified for the periods presen ted.

(1) Comparable sales exclude the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2018. On March 1, 2018, we announced our intent to close all of our 257 remaining Best Buy Mobile 
stand -alone stores in the U.S. As a result, all revenue related to these stores has been exclu ded from the comparable sales calculation beginning in March 2018. On 
October 1, 2018, we acquired all outstanding shares of GreatCall and on May 9, 2019, we acquired all outstanding shares of CST. Consistent with our comparable sales 
policy, the results o f GreatCall are included in our comparable sales calculation beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, and the results of CST are excluded from 
our comparable sales calculation for the periods presented.  
(2) Because retailers vary in how they  record cost s of operating their supply chain between cost of sales  and SG&A, our gross profit rate and SG&A rate may not be 
comparable to other retailers' corresponding rates. For additional information regarding costs classified in cost of sales  and SG&A, refer to N ote 1, Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item  8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual 
Report on Form  10-K. 
(3) Includes both gain from discontinued operations and net earnings from discontinued operations.  
 
Revenue, gross profit rate, SG&A rate and operating income rate changes in fiscal 2020 were primarily driven by our Domestic 
segment. For further discussion of each segment's rate changes, see  Segment Performance Summary,  below.

(1) Comparable online sales are included in the comparable sales calculation. Comparable sales also exclude the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2018.  On March 1, 
2018, we announced our intent to close all of our 257 remaining Best Buy Mobile stand -alone stores in the U.S. As a result, all revenue related to these stores has been 
excluded from the comparable sales calculation beginning in March 2018. On October 1, 2018, we acquired all outstanding shares of GreatCall and on May 9, 2019, we 
acquired all outstanding shares of CST. Consistent with our comparable sales policy, the results of GreatCall are included in our comparable sales calculation begi nning  
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, and the results of CST are excluded from our comparable sales calculation for the perio ds presented.  
 
The increas e in revenue in fiscal 2020 w as primarily driven by the comparable sales growth of 2. 3% and revenue from  GreatCall  prior 
to its inclusion in comparable sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 . These increases were partially offset by the loss of revenue from 
store closures. Online revenue increased in fiscal 2020 due to higher average order values , higher  conversion rates  and increased 
traffic.

Our gross profit rate increased in fiscal 2020, primarily due to increased revenue in the higher margin services category, pr imarily 
related to our Canadian operations.  
 
Our S G&A rate increased in fiscal 2020, primarily due to sales de -leverage, as SG&A dollars decreased due to the favorable impact of 
foreign currency exchange rates primarily related to Canada.  
 
Our operating income rate remained flat in fiscal 2020, primarily driven by the increase in gross profit rate, partially offset by the 
increase in SG&A rate described above.  
 
Additional Consolidated Results  
  
Other Income (Expense)  
  
Our gain on sale of investments decreased in fiscal 2020, due to the sale of fewer equity investments.  
  
Our investment income and other remained relatively flat in fiscal 2020.  
  
Interest expense decreased in fiscal 2020, primarily due to the derecognition of financing obligations as a result of our ado ption of new 
lease accounting guidance . Refer to Note 1,  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,  and Note 10, Leases , of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form 
10-K for additional information.  
 
Income Tax Expense  
  
Income tax expense increased in fiscal 2020 primarily as a res ult of an increase in pre -tax earnings. Our effective tax rate remained

including amounts associated with a deemed repatriation tax and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as tax reform -related items announced in 
response to future tax savings created by tax reform, including a one -time bonus for certain employees  and a one -time contribution to the Best Buy Foundation . Refer to

(4) Represents (gain) loss on sale of investments and investment impairments includ ed in Investment income and other on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  
(5) Represents the summation of the calculated income tax charge related to each non -GAAP non -income tax adjustment. The non -GAAP adjustments relate primarily to 
adjustments in the U .S. and Canada. As such, the income tax charge is calculated using the statutory tax rates for the U.S. (ranging from 24.5% t o 36.7% for the periods 
presented) and Canada (ranging from 26.6% to 26.9% for the periods presented), applied to the non -GAAP adju stments of each country.  
 
Our n on-GAAP operating income increased $137 million in fiscal 2020, primarily driven by strong revenue performance in our Domestic 
segment in  nearly a ll product categories and a decrease in SG&A, primarily due to lower incentive compensation. The increase in non -
GAAP operating income resulted in a year -over-year increase in non -GAAP diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2020, which also 
benefited from a lower weighted -average diluted share count from share repurchases. Our n on-GAAP effective tax rate  decreased in 
fiscal 2020, primarily due to increased tax benefits related to stock -based compensation and the resolution of discrete tax matters.  
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources  
 
Summary  
 
We closely manage our liquidity and capital resources. Our liquidity requirements depend on key variables, including the leve l of 
investment required to support our business strategies, the performance of our business, capit al expenditures, credit facilities, short -
term borrowing arrangements and working capital management. Capital expenditures and share repurchases are a component of our  
Table of Contents  
 
30 cash flow and capital management strategy which, to a large extent, we can adjust in res ponse to economic and other changes in our 
business environment. We have a disciplined approach to capital allocation, which focuses on investing in key priorities that  support our 
strategy.  
 
Cash  and cash equivalents were as follows  ($ in millions):  
        
         February 1, 2020   February 2, 2019  
Cash and cash equivalents  $  2,229     $  1,980    
 
The increase in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to cash generated from operations , partially offset by share 
repurchases, investments in capital expenditures and dividends.  
 
Cash Flows  
 
Cash  flows from  total operations were as follows  ($ in millions):

Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash  $  171    $  884    $  (1,133)   
 
Operating Activities  
 
The increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to changes in working capital, primarily due to the 
timing of receipts and payments on inventory, the timing of deliveries of inventory to customers, increased earnings and lowe r incentive 
compensation payments due to a special one -time i ncentive payment in fiscal 2019. This was partially offset by the timing of collections 
on receivables and the timing of tax payments.  
 
Investing Activities  
 
The increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to decreases in sales and increases in purchases of 
investments , partially offset by a decrease in cash used in the acquisitions of CST and BioSensics  in fiscal 2020 compared to the 
acquisition of GreatCall in fiscal 2019.  
 
Financing Activities  
 
The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in shares repurchased during fiscal 2020 and the 
repayment in fiscal 2019 of our $500 million principal amount of notes due August 1, 2018. This was partially offset by the i ssuance in 
fiscal 2019 of our $500 million principal amount of notes due October 1, 2028.  
 
Sources of Liquidity  
 
Funds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, our credit facilities and other debt arrangemen ts are our 
most significant sou rces of liquidity. We believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund operations and anticipated capital 
expenditures, share repurchases, dividends and strategic initiatives, including business combinations. However, in the event our 
liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to limit our spending. There can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash 
flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our existing credit faciliti es or o btain 
additional financing, if necessary, on favorable terms.  
 
We have a $1.25 billion five -year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the " Facility”) with a syndicate of banks that expires in April 
2023.  There were no borrowings under the Facility during fiscal 2020. On March 19, 2020, we drew down the full amount of the Facility 
to increase our cash position and maximize flexibility in light of the uncertainty surrounding the impact of COVID -19. Refer to Note 
6, Debt , of the Notes to Consol idated Financial Statements, included in Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this 
Annual Report on Form 10 -K for additional information.  
 
Our ability to continue to access the Facility is subject to our compliance with its terms and conditions, including financial covenants. 
The financial covenants require us to maintain certain financial ratios. At  February  1, 2020, we were in compliance with all financial 
covenants. If an event of default were to occur with respect to any of our oth er debt, it would likely constitute an event of default under 
our Facility as well.  
 
Our credit ratings and outlook at  March  18, 2020, are summarized below. On  October 30, 2019, Fitch affirmed its BBB rating and 
withdrew all future ratings for commercial r easons. On March 9, 2020, Moody’s concluded their review for upgrade that was initiated on 
November 20, 2019, and confirmed its current rating of Baa1 and changed its outlook to Stable from Rating Under Review. Stand ard & 
Poor’s rating and outlook remained  unchanged from the prior year.

Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically, and, therefore, the credit rating assigned to us by each agency may  be subject 
to review at any time. Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic 
environment, conditions in the retail and consumer electronics industries, our financial position and changes in our bus iness strategy. If 
further changes in our credit ratings were to occur, they could impact, among other things, interest costs for certain of our  credit 
facilities, our future borrowing costs, access to capital markets, vendor financing terms and future new -store leasing costs.  
 
Restricted Cash  
 
Our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral or restricted to use for workers' c ompensation 
and general liability insurance claims. Restricted cash, which is included in O ther current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, 
was $126 million  and $204 million  at February  1, 2020, and  February  2, 201 9, respectively. The decrease was due to a dividend of 
excess cash from our wholly -owned insurance captive that manages a port ion of our self -insured claims . 
 
Capital Expenditures  
 
Our capital expenditures typically include investments in our stores, distribution capabilities and information technology en hancements 
(including e -commerce).  Capital expenditures were as follows ( $ in millions):  
 
           
            2020   2019   2018  
New stores  $  9    $  5    $  5  
Store -related projects(1)   229      259      192  
E-commerce and information technology    431      448      425  
Supply chain    74      107      66  
Total capital expenditures(2) $  743    $  819    $  688  
(1) Includes store remodels and various merchandising projects.  
(2) Total capital expenditures exclude non -cash capital expenditures of $10 million, $53 million and $123 million for fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. 
Non-cash capital expenditures are comprised of capitalized leases, as well as additions to property and equipment included in acc ounts payable.  
 
Debt and Capital  
 
As of February 1, 2020, we had $650 million principal amount of notes due March 15, 2021 (“2021 Notes”), and $500 million principal  
amount  of notes due October 1, 2028  (“2028 Notes”),  outstanding. Refer to Note 6,  Debt , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements, included in Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form 10 -K for further 
information.  
 
Share Repurchases and Dividends  
 
We repurchase our common stock and pay dividends pursuant to programs approved by our Bo ard of Directors ("Board"). The payment 
of cash dividends is also subject to customary legal and contractual restrictions. Our long -term capital allocation strategy is to first fund 
operations and investments in growth and then return excess cash over time  to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases 
while maintaining investment -grade credit metrics.  
 
On February 23, 2019, our Board authorized a $3.0 billion  share repurchase program. As of February 1, 2020, $2.0 billion of the 
$3.0 billion share repurchase authorization was available. Between the end of fiscal 2020 on February 1, 2020, and March  18, 2020, we 
repurchased an incremental  0.6 million  shares of our common stock at a cost of  $56 million.  We have since temporarily suspended all 
share repurchases.   
 
Share repurchase and dividend activity w ere as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):  
 
 
            
             2020   2019   2018  
Total cost of shares repurchased  $  1,009     $  1,493     $  2,009    
Average price per share  $  72.34     $  70.28     $  57.16    
Total number of shares repurchased    14.0      21.2      35.1   
Regular quarterly cash dividends per share  $  2.00      1.80    $  1.36   
Cash dividends declared and paid  $  527      497    $  409   
 
Dividends declared and paid in creased in  fiscal 2020 due to an increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend s per share, partially 
offset by fewer shares  outstanding  due to the return of capital to shareholders through share repurchases.  
 
On February 27, 2020 , our Board authorized a 10% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.55 per share, effective imm ediately.

32 Other Financial Measures  
 
Our current ratio, calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities, was  1.1 as of February 1, 2020, compared to  1.2 as 
of February  2, 2019. Our debt to earnings ratio, calculated as total debt (including current portion) divided by net earnings from 
continuing operations, was 0.8 as of  February  1, 2020, compared to 0.9 as of  February  2, 2019 . The decline in both ratios was primarily 
due to the adoption of new lease accountin g guidance in the fir st quarter of fiscal 2020 that resulted in the recognition of operating 
lease assets and operating lease liabilities on the balance sheet . Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , and 
Note  10, Leases , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item  8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , 
of this Annual Report on Form  10-K, for additional information regarding this adoption.  
 
Off-Balance -Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations  
 
We do n ot have outstanding off-balance -sheet arrangements. Contractual obligations as of February 1, 2020, were as follows ($ in 
millions):

Note: For additional information refer t o Note 5, Derivative Instruments ; Note  6, Debt ; Note  10, Leases ; Note  11, Income Taxes ; and Note  13, Contingencies and 
Commitments , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item  8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form  10-K. 
(1) Represents principal amounts only and excludes interest rate swap valuation adjustments . 
(2) Interest payments related to our 2021 Notes and 2028 Notes include the variable interest rate payments included in our interest rate s wap.  
(3) Lease obligations exclude $158 million of legally binding fixed costs for leases signed but not yet commenced . 
(4) Operating lease obligations exclude payments to landlords covering real estate taxes and common area maintenance. These charg es, if included , would increase total 
operating lease obligations by $0.7 billion at February 1, 2020.  
(5) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, are legally binding and specify a ll significant terms, including fixed or 
minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.  Purchase obligations do not include 
agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Additionally, although they do not contain leg ally binding purchase commitments, we included open purchase orders in 
the table above. Substantially all open purchase orders are fulfilled within 30 days.  
(6) Unrecognized tax benefits relate to uncertain tax positions. As we are not able to reasonably estim ate the timing of the payments or the amount by which the liability will 
increase or decrease over time, the related balances have not been reflected in the "Payments Due by Period" section of the t able.  
(7) Included in Long -term liabilities on our Consolidate d Balance Sheets at February 1, 2020, was a $2 2 million obligation for deferred compensation. As the specific 
payment dates for deferred compensation are unknown, the related balances have not been reflected in the "Payments Due by Per iod" section of the t able.  
 
Additionally, we ha d $1.25 billion  in undrawn capacity on our credit facility at  February  1, 2020 . On March 19, 2020, we drew down the 
full amount of the facility to increase our cash position and maximize flexibility in light of the uncertainty surrounding the impact of 
COVID -19. The proceeds and resulting liability from the facility will be included in Cash and cash equivalents and Short -term debt, 
respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
 
Critical Accounting Estimates  
 
The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgm ents 
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, re venue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, 
estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time our co nsolidated 
financial statements are prepared. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could 
differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.  
 
Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note  1, Summary of Significant Accou nting Policies , of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements, included in Item  8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form  10-K. Other 
than our adoption of ASU 2016 -02, Leases , in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and our adoption of ASU 2014 -09, Revenue from 
Contracts with Customers , in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we have not made any material changes to our accounting policies or 
methodologies during the past three fisc al years. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully 
understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These estimates require our most difficult, subjective or comple x judgments 
and generally incorp orate significant uncertainty.

33 Vendor Allowances  
 
Description  
We receive funds from our merchandise vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, primarily in the form of purcha ses-
based or sales -based volumes and for product advertising and placement in our stores. We recognize these funds as a reduction of 
cost of sales when the associated inventory is sold. If the funds are not specifically related to purchase or sales volumes, the funds are 
recognized ratably over the perfo rmance period as the product promotion or placement is completed. Funds that are determined to be a 
reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell a vendor's products are recorded as an offset to the related 
expense when inc urred.  
 
Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate  
Due to the quantity and diverse nature of our vendor agreements, estimates are made to determine the amount of funding to be 
recognized in earnings or deferred as an offset to inventory. These es timates require a detailed analysis of complex factors, including 
(1) proper classification of the type of funding received; and (2) the methodology to estimate the portion of purchases -based funding 
that should be recognized in cost of sales, which consid ers factors such as inventory turn by product category and actual sell -through of 
inventory.  
 
Effect if actual results differ from assumptions  
A 10% change in our vendor funding deferral at  February  1, 2020, would have affected net earnings by approximatel y $32 million in 
fiscal  2020.  
 
Goodwill  
 
Description  
Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or circums tances 
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The impairment test  involves a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit 
with its carrying value. Fair value reflects the price a potential market participant would be willing to pay for the reporti ng unit in an 
arms -length transaction.  
 
Judgments and uncertainties  involved in the estimate  
Determining fair value of a reporting unit is complex and typically requires analysis of discounted cash flows and other mark et 
information, such as trading multiples when applicable. Cash flow analysis requires judgment regarding  many factors, such as revenue 
growth rates, expenses and capital expenditures. Market information requires judgmental selection of relevant market comparab les. We 
have goodwill in two reporting units – Best Buy Domestic and Best Buy Health – with carrying  values of $443 million and $541 million, 
respectively, as of February 1, 2020. There is greater uncertainty surrounding the key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of 
the Best Buy Health reporting unit and therefore a greater degree of complexity and judgment involved in our impairment analysis. In 
particular, our analysis of the Best Buy Health reporting unit fair value includes estimation of revenue growth rates, capita l expenditure 
requirements and weighted -average cost of capital rates that inc orporate significant judgment.  
 
Effect if actual results differ from assumptions  
A 10% change in the fair value of the Best Buy Health reporting unit at February 1, 2020, would not have a material effect on our net 
earnings.  
 
Inventory Markdown  
 
Descriptio n 
Our merchandise inventories were $5.2 billion at  February  1, 2020. We value our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
through the establishment of inventory markdown adjustments. Markdown adjustments reflect the excess of cost over the n et recovery 
we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other disposal of inventory and establish a new cost basis. No adjustment is r ecorded for 
inventory that we are able to return to our vendors for full credit.  
 
Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate  
Markdown adjustments involve uncertainty because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgmen t 
about the expected recovery rates. The determination of the expected recovery rates includ es the evaluation of historical recovery rates 
as well as factors such as product type and condition, forecasted consumer demand, product lifecycles, the promotional enviro nment, 
vendor return rights and the expected sales channel of ultimate disposition. We also apply judgment in the assumptions about other 
components of net realizable value, such as vendor allowances and selling costs.  
 
Effect if actual results differ from assumptions  
A 10% change in our markdown adjustment at  February  1, 2020, would have affected net earnings by approximately $11 million in 
fiscal  2020.  
 
Tax Contingencies  
 
Description  
Our income tax returns are periodically audited by U.S. federal, state and local and foreign tax authorities. Tax authorities  audit our tax 
filing posit ions, including the timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. 
At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures associat ed wit h our 
Table of Contents  
 
34 various tax filing positions, we may record a liability for such exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for 
which we have established a liability, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our liability for un recognized tax benefits and 
income tax provisions in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations exp ires for the 
relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes ava ilable. Our effective income tax rate is also 
affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the result s of tax audits.  
 
Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate  
Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply 
judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. Such assumptions can include complex and  
uncertain extern al factors, such as changes in tax law, interpretations of tax law and the timing of such changes, and uncertain internal 
factors such as taxable earnings by jurisdiction, the magnitude and timing of certain transactions and capital spending.  
 
Effect if ac tual results differ from assumptions  
Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may  be 
exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for  which a liability has been established or are 
required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could 
be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement generally would r equire use of our cash and may result in an increase in our 
effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement may reduce our effective income tax rate in  the period of 
resolution.  
 
Service Revenue  
 
Description  
We sell custom ers support plans as part of a bundled service offer which may include items such as technical support, extended 
warranty, price discounts on future purchases, anti -virus software and one -time service repairs. We allocate the transaction price to all 
perfo rmance obligations identified in the contract based on their relative fair value. For technical support membership contracts,  we 
typically recognize revenue over time on a usage basis, an input method of measuring progress over the related contract term.  This 
method involves the use of expected usage patterns, derived from historic information.  
 
Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate  
There is judgment in (1) determining the level at which we apply a portfolio approach to these contracts; (2) m easuring the relative 
standalone selling price for performance obligations within these contracts to the extent that they are only bundled and sold  to 
customers with other performance obligations, or alternatively, using a cost -plus margin approach; and (3 ) assessing the pattern of 
delivery across multiple portfolios of customers, including estimating current and future usage patterns. When insufficient h istory of 
usage is available, we generally recognize revenue ratably over the life of the contract.  
 
Effect if actual results differ from assumptions  
A 10% change in the amount of services membership deferred revenue as of  February  1, 2020, would have affected net earnings by 
approximately $12 million in fiscal  2020.  
 
New Accounting Pronouncements  
 
For a description of new applicable accounting pronouncements, see Note 1,  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , of the Notes 
to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of th is Annual Report on 
Form 10 -K. 
  
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  
 
In addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks.  
 
Interest Rate Risk  
 
We are exposed to changes in short -term market interest rates and these changes in rates will impact our net interest expense. Our 
cash and cash equivalents generate interest income that will vary based on changes in short -term interest rates. In addition, we have 
swapped our fixed -rate debt to floating -rate such that the interest expense on this debt will vary with short -term interest rates. Refer to 
Note 5,  Derivative Instruments , and Note 6,  Debt , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8,  Financial 
State ments and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form 10 -K for further information regarding our interest rate swaps.  
 
As of February 1, 2020, we had  $2.2 billion  of cash and cash equivalents and $1.2 billion  of debt that has been swapped to floating  
rate, and therefore the net balance exposed to interest rate changes was $1.0 billion. As of February 1, 2020, a 50 -basis point increase 
in short -term interest rates would have led to an estimated  $5 million  reduction in net interest expense, and converse ly a 50 -basis point 
decrease in short -term interest rates would have led to an estimated  $5 million  increase in net interest expense.  
 
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk  
 
We have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our International segment operations. On a 
limited basis, we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign currency exposure to certain forecasted invent ory 
purchases, recognized receivable and payable balances and our investment in our C anadian operations. Our primary objective in 
Table of Contents  
 
35 holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of net earnings and cash flows, as well as net asset value associated with ch anges in 
foreign currency exchange rates. Our foreign currency risk management strateg y includes both hedging instruments and derivatives 
that are not designated as hedging instruments, which generally have terms of up to 12 months. Refer to Note 5,  Derivative 
Instruments , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of 
this Annual Report on Form 10 -K for further information regarding these instruments.  
 
Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations were primarily driven by the strength of the U.S. dollar compared to the Ca nadian dollar 
compared to the prior -year period, which had a negative overall impact on our revenue as our Canadian dollar revenue translated into 
fewer U.S. dollars. We estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had a net unfavorable impact  on our revenue of 
approximately  $29 million  and a net favorable impact on earnings of approximately  $1 million in fiscal 2020.

Management's Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements  
 
Our management is responsible for the preparation, integrity and objectivity of the accompanying consolidated financial statement s and 
the related financial information. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and neces sarily 
include certain amounts that are based on estimates and informed judgments. Our management also prepared the related financia l 
information included in this Annual Report on Form  10-K and is responsible for its accuracy and consistency with the conso lidated 
financial statements.  
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been audited by Deloitte  & Touche LLP, an independent registered public 
accounting firm, which conducted its audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Compan y Accounting Oversight Board 
(United States). The independent registered public accounting firm's responsibility is to express an opinion as to whether su ch 
consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position,  results of operations and cash flows in 
accordance with GAAP.  
 
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  
 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined  in 
Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed under the supervision of our princip al 
executive officer and principal financial officer, and effected by our Board, management and other personnel, to pro vide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance 
with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that:  
 
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records th at in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the 
dispositions of our assets;  
 
(2) provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in  
accordance with GAAP a nd that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our 
management and Board; and  
 
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our 
asset s that could have a material effect on our financial statements.  
 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. There fore, even 
those systems determined to be effective can provide o nly reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and 
presentation.  
 
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal f inancial 
officer, we assessed the effec tiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of  February  1, 2020, using the criteria set forth 
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in  Internal Control  — Integrated Framework 
(2013).  Based on our as sessment, we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as 
of February  1, 2020. During our assessment, we did not identify any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. 
Deloitte  & Touche LLP,  the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements for the year 
ended  February  1, 2020, included in Item  8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,  of this Annual Report on Form  10-K, has 
issued an un qualified attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of  February  1, 2020.

37 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  
 
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of  
Best Buy Co., Inc.  
Richfield, Minnesota  
 
Opinion on the Financial Statements  
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Best Buy Co., Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of 
February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, cash flows, and 
changes in shareholders' equity for each of the three years in the period ended February 1, 2020, and the related notes (coll ectively 
referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects , the financial 
position of the Company as of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash  flows for each of 
the three years in the period ended February 1, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the Unit ed States 
of America.  
 
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting O versight Board (United States) (PCAOB), 
the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — 
Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of t he Treadway Commission and our report dated 
March 2 3, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.  
 
Change in Accounting Principle  
 
As discussed in Note 1 to the Company’s financial statements, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016 -02 
Leases (Topic 842)  as of February 3, 2019. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.  
 
Basis for Opinion  
 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are require d to 
be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regula tions 
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.  
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PC AOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit 
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error  or fraud. 
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to 
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, e vidence 
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the fin ancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used 
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe 
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  
 
Critical Audit Matters  
 
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current -period audit of the financial statements that were 
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and tha t (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to 
the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical 
audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the fi nancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating 
the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures  to which they 
relate.  
 
Vendor Allowances — Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements  
 
Critical Audit Matter Description  
 
The Company receives vendor allowances from certain merchandise vendors through a variety of programs intended to offset the 
invoice cost of inventory and for promoting and selling merchandise inventory. Purchases -based vendor allowances are initially 
deferred and recorded as a reduction of merchandise inventory and are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales when the associa ted 
inventory is sold. Sales -based vendor allowances are based on merchandise sold and are calculated using an agreed upon amount f or 
each unit sold and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales when the associated inventory is sold. Other promotional allowa nces not 
specifically related to volume of purchases or sales, such as advertising and in -store product placement are recognized  ratably as a 
reduction to cost of sales over the performance period as the product promotion or placement is completed. Funds that are det ermined 
to be a reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to sell a vendor’s products a re recorded as an offset to 
the related expense when incurred.  
 
Given the significance of vendor allowances to the financial statements and volume and diversity of the individual vendor agr eements, 
auditing vendor allowances was complex and subjective due  to the extent of effort required to evaluate whether the vendor allowances 
were recorded in accordance with the terms of the vendor agreements and that the allowances deferred as an offset to inventor y were 
complete and accurate.

How the Critical Audit M atter Was Addressed in the Audit  
 
Our audit procedures related to evaluating whether the vendor allowances were recorded in accordance with the terms of the ve ndor 
agreements and the completeness and accuracy of deferred vendor allowances included the foll owing, among others:  
 
• We tested the effectiveness of controls over the recording of vendor allowances, including management's controls over the 
establishment of vendor arrangements, the calculation of vendor allowances earned, and the determination of the  deferred 
vendor allowances recorded as a reduction to inventory.  
• We selected a sample of vendor allowances recorded as a reduction of cost of sales and (1) recalculated the amount 
recognized using the terms of the vendor agreement; (2) for certain arrangements, confirmed the terms of the agreement 
directly with the vendor; and (3) evaluated, based on the terms of the agreement, if the amount should be deferred and 
recorded as a reduction of merchandise inventory.  
• Where confirmation responses from ve ndors were not received, we completed alternative procedures such as agreement to 
underlying contractual arrangements, tested the settlement of the arrangement and held discussions with a sample of 
Company buyers to understand the terms of the agreement.  
• We tested the amount of deferred vendor allowances recorded as a reduction to inventory by developing an expectation for 
the amount based on the historical amounts recorded as a percentage of vendor allowances earned and comparing our 
expectation to the amo unt recorded by management.  
 
Goodwill — Best Buy Health Reporting Unit  — Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements  
 
The Company’s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its c arrying 
value . The goodwill balance was $984 million as of February 1, 2020, of which $541 million was related to the Best Buy Health 
reporting unit. The Company uses the discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of the Best Buy Health reporting u nit, which  
requires management to make subjective estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenues. Changes in these 
assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both. The fai r 
value of the Best Buy Health reporting unit exceeded its carrying value as of the measurement date and, therefore, no impairm ent was 
recognized.  
 
Given the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of the Best Buy Health reporti ng unit, performing audit 
procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to the forecasts of future revenu e of 
the Best Buy Health reporting unit, specifically for new products and services, required a high degr ee of auditor judgment and an 
increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.  
 
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit  
 
Our audit procedures related to the forecasts of future revenue used by management to estimate the fair value of the Best Buy  Health 
reporting unit included the following, among others:  
 
• We tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s goodwill i mpairment evaluation, including those over the determination 
of the fair value of the Best Buy Health reporting unit, such as controls related to management’s forecasts of future revenue . 
• We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast future reve nues by comparing actual results to management’s historical 
forecasts.  
• We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s revenue forecasts for the new products and services by comparing the 
forecasts to: (1) the Company’s historical revenue growth rates, in cluding for similar existing products and services; (2) internal 
communications to management and the board of directors; (3) underlying source documents, when available, such as customer 
contracts; (4) u nderlying analyses detailing business strategies and  growth plans; (5) forward -looking revenue expectations in 
external communications made by management to analysts and investors; and (6) industry reports containing analyses of the 
Company and its peers utilizing the assistance of our fair value specialist s. 
• We inquired of operating and sales management teams to determine whether the judgments and assumptions used in the future 
revenue projections were consistent with the strategy and long - range plans for the Best Buy Health reporting unit.

39 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  
 
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of  
Best Buy Co., Inc.  
Richfield, Minnesota  
 
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
 
We have  audited the internal control over financial reporting of Best Buy Co., Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Com pany”) as of 
February  1, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,  
effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2020, based on criteria establis hed in Internal Control — Integrated 
Framework (2013)  issued by COSO.  
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAO B), 
the consolidated financial statements as of and for the y ear ended February 1, 2020, of the Company and our report dated 
March  23, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the 
Company’s adoption of a new accounting standard.  
Basis for Op inion  
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its asses sment of 
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on  Internal Control 
Over Financial Reporting . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based 
on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independ ent with respect to the 
Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Ex change 
Commission and the PCAOB.  
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Thos e standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal contr ol over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and per forming 
such other procedures as we considered necessary i n the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our 
opinion.  
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reaso nable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted a ccounting 
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes t hose policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the ass ets of the 
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are rec orded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made  only in 
accordance with authorizations of management and director s of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a mat erial effect 
on the financial statements.  
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of 
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of chan ges in 
conditi ons, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

45 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  
 
1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
 
Unless the context otherwise requires, the use of the terms "Best Buy," "we," "us" and "our" in these Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements refers to Best  Buy Co., Inc. and, as applicable, its consolidated subsidiaries.  
 
Description of Business  
 
Our purpose is to enrich the lives of consumers through technology. We have  two reportable segments: Domest ic and International. 
The Domestic segment is comprised of the operations in all states, districts and territories of the U.S. under various brand names 
including Best  Buy, Best Buy Business, Best Buy Express, Best Buy Health, CST, Geek Squad, GreatCall, L ively, Magnolia and Pacific 
Kitchen and Home and the domain names bestbuy.com and greatcall.com. The International segment is comprised of all operations  in 
Canada and Mexico under the brand names Best  Buy, Best Buy Express, Best  Buy Mobile, Geek Squad and  the domain names 
bestbuy.ca and bestbuy.com.mx.  
 
On October 1, 2018, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of GreatCall, Inc. (“GreatCall”). On May 9, 2019, we acquired all of the 
outstanding shares of Critical Signal Technologies, Inc. (“CST”), and on August 7, 2019, we acquired the predictive healthcare 
technology business of BioSensics, LLC (“BioSensics”). Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions , for additional information.  
 
Basis of Presentation  
 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Best  Buy Co., Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. All intercompany 
balances and transactions are eliminated upon consolidation.  
 
In order to a lign our fiscal reporting periods and comply with statutory filing requirements, we consolidate the financial results of our 
Mexico operations on a  one-month lag. Our policy is to accelerate recording the effect of events occurring in the lag period that 
significantly affect our consolidated financial statements. No significant intervening event occurred in these operations that  would have 
materially affected our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or other factors had it been recorded dur ing fiscal 2020, fiscal 
2019 or fiscal 2018.  
 
Discontinued Operations  
 
Discontinued operations in fiscal 2018 reflects the proceeds attributed to a non -compete clause from the sale of Best Buy Europe to 
Carphone Warehouse plc.  
 
Use of Estimates in the Prep aration of Financial Statements  
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP") requ ires us to 
make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amo unts in the consolidated financial 
statements, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Future results could be materially affected if actual result s were to differ 
from these estimates and assumptions.  
 
Fiscal Year  
 
Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of January. Fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 included  52 weeks and fiscal 2018 
included  53 weeks, with the additional week occurring in the fourth quarter.  
 
Unadopted Accounting Pronouncements  
 
In January 201 7, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No.  2017 -04, 
Intangibles -Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment , which eliminates the requirement to calculate 
the implied  fair value of goodwill (i.e., Step 2 of the current goodwill impairment test) to measure a goodwill impairment charge.  Instead, 
entities will record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value (i.e. , measure the 
charge based on the current Step 1).  We do not believe the new guidance, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after 
December  15, 2019, will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
 
In August 2018, the FASB issu ed ASU 2018 -13, Fair Value Measurement - Disclosure Framework (Topic 820) . The updated 
guidance  improves the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements.  We do not believe the updated guidance, which is 
effective for fiscal years and interim period s within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, will have a material impact on 
our consolidated financial statements.

Adopted Accounting  Pronouncements  
 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016 -02, Leases , which requires the recognition of operating lease assets and lease liabilities 
on the balance sheet. Leases are classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expe nse 
recognition in the income statement. Under the new standard, disclosures are required to enable users of financial statements to 
assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.  
 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we adopted ASU 2016 -02 using the “Comparatives Under 840 Option” approach to transition. Under 
this method, financial informati on related to periods prior to adoption were as originally reported under the previous standard – ASC 
840, Leases . The effects of adopting the new standard (ASC 842, Leases ) in fiscal 2020 were recognized as a cumulative -effect 
adjustment to retained earni ngs as of the beginning of the fiscal first quarter. We elected the package of practical expedients permitted 
under the transition guidance within the new standard, which, among other things, allowed us to carry forward the historical lease 
classification as operating or capital leases. We also elected to combine lease and non -lease components and to exclude short -term 
leases from our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We did not elect the hindsight practical expedient in determining the lease term  for 
existing l eases as of February 3, 2019.  
 
The most significant impact of adoption was the recognition of operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities of $2.7 billion and 
$2.8 billion, respectively, while our accounting for existing capital leases (now refer red to as finance leases) remained substantially 
unchanged. The cumulative impact of these changes decreased retained earnings by $22 million, which included a $3 million net -of-tax 
adjustment made during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 related to on -adoption impairment charges. We expect the impact of adoption 
to be immaterial to our consolidated statements of earnings and consolidated statements of cash flows o n an ongoing basis. As part of 
our adoption, we also modified our control procedures and processes, none of which materially affected our internal control o ver 
financial reporting. See Note 10, Leases , for additional lease disclosures.  
 
The cumulative effe ct of the changes made to our Consolidated Balance Sheets for the adoption of this standard was as follows ($ in 
millions):

Segment Information  
 
Our business is organized into two reportable segments: Domestic (which is comprised of all states, districts and territories  of the U.S.) 
and International (which is comprised of all operations in Canada and Mexico). Our chief operating decision maker ("CODM") is our 
Chief Executive Officer. Our CODM has ultimate responsibility for enterprise decisions, including determining resource allocation for, 
and monitoring the performance of, the consolidated enterprise, the Do mestic reportable segment and the International reportable 
segment.  
 
Our CODM relies on internal management reporting that analyzes enterprise results to the net earnings level and reportable se gment 
results to the operating income level. We aggregate our  Best Buy Domestic and Best Buy Health operating segments into one 
Domestic reportable segment. We also aggregate our Canada and Mexico businesses into one International operating segment, whi ch 
represents the International reportable segment.

47 Business Co mbinations  
 
We account for business combinations under the  acquisition method  of accounting.  This method requires the recording of acquired 
assets and assumed liabilities at their acquisition date fair values.  The excess of the purchase price over the fair  value of assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill.  Results of operations related to business combinations are included 
prospectively beginning with the date of acquisition and transaction costs related to business combinations are r ecorded within selling, 
general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses.  
 
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash  
 
Cash primarily consists of cash on hand and bank deposits. Cash equivalents consist of money market funds, commercial paper, 
corporate bonds and time deposits with an original maturity of  3 months or less when purchased. The amounts of cash equivalents 
at February  1, 2020, and  February  2, 2019, were  $1,668  million  and $1,410  million, respectively, and the weighted -average interest 
rates were  1.8% and 2.5% , respectively.  
 
Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within our Consolidated Balance Sheets is reconciled to the total shown w ithin our 
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as follows ($ in millions):  
 
            
             February 1, 2020   February 2, 2019   February 3, 2018  
Cash and cash equivalents  $  2,229     $  1,980     $  1,101    
Restricted cash included in Other current assets    126      204      199   
Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash  $  2,355     $  2,184     $  1,300    
 
Amounts included in restricted cash are pledged as collateral or restricted to use for workers' compen sation and general liability 
insurance claims.  
 
Receivables  
 
Receivables consist primarily of amounts due from vendors for various vendor funding programs, banks for customer credit card  and 
debit card transactions and mobile phone network operators for de vice sales and commissions. We establish allowances for 
uncollectible receivables based primarily on historical collection trends. Our allowances for uncollectible receivables were $24 million 
and $23 million  at February  1, 2020, and  February  2, 2019, resp ectively. We did not have material write -offs during the periods 
presented . 
 
Merchandise Inventories  
 
Merchandise inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The weighted average method is used to det ermine 
the cost of inventory which includes costs of in -bound freight to move inventory into our distribution centers. Also included in the cost of 
inventory are certain vendor allowances. Costs associated with storing and transporting merchandise inventories to our retail  stores are 
expensed as incurred and included in cost of sales.  
 
Our inventory valuation also reflects markdown adjustments for the excess of the cost over the net recovery we expect to real ize from 
the ultimate disposition of inventory and establishes a new  cost basis. No adjustment is recorded for inventory that we are able to return 
to our vendors for full credit. Subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the reversal of previously reco rded 
markdown adjustments or an increase in the new ly established cost basis.  
 
Our inventory valuation reflects adjustments for physical inventory losses (resulting from, for example, theft). Physical inv entory is 
maintained through a combination of full location counts (typically once per year) and more r egular cycle counts.  
 
Property and Equipment  
 
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. We depreciate property and equipment to its residual value using the straight -line method 
over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are d epreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or 
the period from the date the assets are placed in service to the end of the lease term, which includes optional renewal perio ds if they 
are reasonably certain. Accelerated depreciation methods are generally used for income tax purposes.  
 
When property is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from our Consolidated Ba lance 
Sheets and any resulting gain or loss is reflected on our Consolidated Statement s of Earnings.  
 
Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Major renewals or replacements that substantially extend the useful l ife of 
an asset are capitalized and depreciated.  
 
Costs associated with the acquisition or development of software for internal use are capitalized and amortized over the expected 
useful life of the software, generally from two year s to seven year s. A subsequent addition, modification or upgrade to internal -use 
software is capitalized to the extent that it enhances the  software's functionality or extends its useful life. Capitalized software is 
included in Fixtures and equipment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Software maintenance and training costs are expensed i n the 
period incurred. The costs of developing softwa re for sale to customers is expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is 
established, which generally leads to expensing substantially all costs.

Estimated useful lives by major asset category are as follows (in years):  
  
  
Asset Category  Useful Life  
Buildings  5-35 
Leasehold improvements  2-10 
Fixtures and equipment  2-15 
 
Impairment of Long -Lived Assets  
 
Long -lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not 
be recoverable. When evaluating long -lived assets with impairment indicators for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying 
value of the asset to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows is less 
than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of 
the asset to its estimated fair value, which is typically based on estimated discounted future c ash flows. We recognize an impairment 
loss if the amount of the asset's carrying value exceeds the asset's estimated fair value.  
 
We evaluate locations for triggering events on a quarterly basis. For store locations, our primary indicator that asset carrying values 
may not be recoverable is negative store operating income for the most recent 12 -month period. We also monitor other factors when 
evaluating store locations for impairment, including significant changes in the manner of use or expected life  of the assets or significant 
changes in our business strategies.  
 
When reviewing long -lived assets for impairment, we group long -lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for 
which identifiable cash flows are largely independent o f the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For example, long -lived assets 
deployed at store locations are reviewed for impairment at the individual store level, which involves comparing the net carry ing value of 
all assets to the net cash flow proje ctions for each store. In addition, we conduct separate impairment reviews at other levels as 
appropriate, for example, to evaluate potential impairment of assets shared by several areas of operations, such as informati on 
technology systems.  
 
Leases  
 
The majority of our lease obligations are real estate operating leases used in our retail and distribution operations. Our financ e leases 
are primarily equipment -related. For any lease with an initial term in excess of 12  months, the related lease assets and l iabilities are 
recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as either operating or finance leases at the inception of an agreement where it  is 
determined that a lease exists. We have lease agreements that contain both lease and non -lease components. For l ease agreements 
entered into or reassessed after the adoption of ASC  842, Leases , we have elected to combine lease and non -lease components for all 
classes of assets. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on our Consolidated Bal ance Sheets; we recognize 
lease expense for these leases on a straight -line basis over the lease term.  
 
Operating lease assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities repr esent the 
obligation to mak e lease payments arising from the lease. These assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of 
future payments over the lease term at the commencement date. We estimate the incremental borrowing rate for each lease based  on 
an evaluatio n of our credit ratings and the prevailing market rates for collateralized debt in a similar economic environment with simila r 
payment terms and maturity dates commensurate with the terms of the lease. Our operating leases also typically require paymen t of 
real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance.  These components comprise the majority of our variable lease cost and 
are excluded from the present value of our lease obligations. In instances where they are fixed, they are included due to our  election to 
combine lease and non -lease components. Operating lease assets also include prepaid lease payments and initial direct costs and are 
reduced by lease incentives. Our lease terms generally do not include options to extend or terminate the lease un less it is reasonably 
certain that the option will be exercised. Fixed payments may contain predetermined fixed rent escalations. We recognize the related 
rent expense on a straight -line basis from the commencement date to the end of the lease term.  
 
Goodwill and Intangible  Assets  
 
Goodwill  
 
Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations . We test 
goodwill for impairment annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or whenever event s or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be 
recoverable. We monitor the existence of potential impairment indicators throughout the fiscal year. We test for goodwill imp airment at 
the reporting unit level. Reporting units are determined by id entifying components of operating segments which constitute businesses 
for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by segment management. No components were 
aggregated in arriving at our reporting units. We have goodwill  in two reporting units – Best Buy Domestic and Best Buy Health – with 
carrying values of $443  million and $541  million, respectively, as of February 1, 2020.  
 
Our detailed impairment testing involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with it s carrying value, including goodwill. Fair 
value reflects the price a potential market participant would be willing to pay for the reporting unit in an arms -length transaction and 
typically requires analysis of discounted cash flows and other market inform ation, such as trading multiples when applicable. If the fair 
value exceeds carrying value, then it is concluded that no goodwill impairment has occurred. If the carrying value of the rep orting unit 
exceeds its fair value, a second step is required to meas ure possible goodwill impairment loss. The second step includes hypothetically 
Table of Contents  
 
49 valuing the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired i n a business 
combination. Then, the implied fair val ue of the reporting unit's goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill. If the 
carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, we recognize an impairment lo ss in an 
amount equal to the excess,  not to exceed the carrying value.  
 
Intangible Assets  
 
Our valuation of identifiable intangible assets acquired is based on information and assumptions available to us at the time of 
acquisition, using income and market approaches to determine fair value, as appropriate.  
 
We amortize our definite -lived intangible assets over the estimated useful life of the asset. We do not amortize our indefinite -lived 
tradename, but test for impairment annually, or when indications of potential impairment exist. We utiliz e the relief from royalty method 
to determine the fair value of our indefinite -lived tradename. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, we recognize an impairment 
loss in an amount equal to the excess.  
 
Derivatives  
 
Net Investment Hedges  
 
We use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge against the effect of Canadian dollar exchange rate fluctuations on a portion of 
our net investment in our Canadian operations. The contracts have terms of up to  12 months. For a net investment hedge, we 
recogniz e changes in the fair value of the derivative as a component of foreign currency translation within other comprehensive incom e 
to offset a portion of the change in translated value of the net investment being hedged, until the investment is sold or liq uidated. We 
limit recognition in net earnings of amounts previously recorded in other comprehensive income to circumstances such as compl ete or 
substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged foreign operation. We report the gains and lo sses, if any, related 
to the amount excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness in net earnings.  
 
Interest Rate Swaps  
 
We utilized "receive fixed -rate, pay variable -rate" interest rate swaps to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our 
$650  million principal amount of notes due March 15, 2021 (“2021 Notes”) and on our $500  million principal amount of notes d ue 
October  1, 2028 (“2028 Notes”) . Our interest rate swap contracts are considered perfect hedges because the critical terms and notional 
amounts match those of our fixed -rate debt being hedged and are, therefore, accounted for as fair value hedges using t he shortcut 
method. Under the shortcut method, we recognize the change in the fair value of the derivatives with an offsetting change to the 
carrying value of the debt. Accordingly, there is no impact on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings from the fai r value of the 
derivatives.  
 
Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments  
 
We use foreign currency forward contracts to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to  
recognized receivable and payable balances denomin ated in non -functional currencies. The contracts generally have terms of up 
to 12 months. These derivative instruments are not designated in hedging relationships and, therefore, we record gains and losses o n 
these contracts directly to net earnings.  
 
Fair Value  
 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the princi pal or most 
advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the mea surement date. To 
measure fair value, we use a three -tier valuation hierarchy based upon observable and non -observable inputs:  
  
Level 1  — Unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.  
  
Level 2  — Significant other observable inputs available at the measurement date, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, either 
directly or indirectly, including:  
 
•  Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;  
•  Quoted pric es for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non -active markets;  
•  Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and  
•  Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by other observable market data.  
 
Level 3  — Significant unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data and reflect the use of significant 
management judgment. These values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management’ s 
estimates of market participant assumptions.  
 
The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. In instances where the inputs used to mea sure fair 
value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair va lue measurement has been determined based on the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular i tem to the fair 
value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability.  
Table of Contents  
 
50  
Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis relate primarily to our tangible fixed assets,  goodwill and 
other intangible assets, which are remeasu red when the derived fair value is below carrying value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
For these assets, we do not periodically adjust carrying value to fair value, except in the event of impairment. When we dete rmine that 
impairment has occurred, the  carrying value of the asset is reduced to fair value and the difference is recorded within SG&A and 
Restructuring charges on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings for non -restructuring and restructuring charges, respectively.  
 
Fair value remeasurements are based on significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). Fixed asset fair values are primarily derived using a 
discounted cash flow (“DCF”) model to estimate the present value of net cash flows that the asset or asset group was expected  to 
generate. The key  inputs to the DCF model generally include our forecasts of net cash generated from revenue, expenses and other 
significant cash outflows, such as capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate.  
 
Insurance  
 
We are self -insured for certain losses related to workers' compensation, medical and general liability claims; however, we obtain third -
party excess insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain claims. Some of these self -insured losses are managed through a 
wholly -owned in surance captive. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but 
not yet reported. We utilize valuations provided by qualified, independent third -party actuaries as well as internal insurance and risk  
expertise. Our self -insured liabilities included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows ($ in millions):  
        
        
 February 1, 2020   February 2, 2019  
Accrued liabilities  $  75    $  69   
Long -term liabilities    46      60   
Total  $  121    $  129   
 
Income Taxes  
 
We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized 
for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing 
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry -forwards. We record a valuation allowance to 
reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.  
 
In determining our provision for income taxes, we use an annual effective income tax rate based on annual income, permanent 
differences between book and tax income and statutory i ncome tax rates. The effective income tax rate also reflects our assessment of 
the ultimate outcome of tax audits. We adjust our annual effective income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or e vents 
becomes available. Discrete events, such as au dit settlements or changes in tax laws, are recognized in the period in which they occur.  
 
Our income tax returns are periodically audited by U.S. federal, state and local and foreign tax authorities. At any one time , multiple tax 
years are subject to audi t by the various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we 
may record a liability for such exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have establi shed a 
liability , is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provisions  in the 
period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxin g authority to 
examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. We include our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including 
accrued penalties and interest, in Long -term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and in Income tax expense on our 
Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  
 
Accrued Liabilities  
 
The major components of accrued liabilities are sales tax liabilities, advertising accruals, loyalty program liabilities, sal es return 
reserves, customer deposits and insurance l iabilities.  
 
Long -Term Liabilities  
 
The major components of long -term liabilities are unrecognized tax benefits, income tax liabilities, self -insurance reserves and deferred 
taxes.  
 
Foreign Currency  
 
Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at our 
Consolidated Balance Sheet dates. For operations reported on a  one-month lag, we use the exchange rates in effect  one month prior to 
our Consolidated Balance Sheet dates. Results of ope rations and cash flows are translated using the average exchange rates 
throughout the periods. The effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of assets and liabilities is included as a component of 
shareholders' equity in accumulated other com prehensive income. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, which are 
included in SG&A, have not been significant in any period presented.

51 Revenue Recognition  
 
We generate revenue from the sale of products and services, both as a principal and  as an agent. Revenue is recognized when control 
of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the transaction price considera tion that we 
expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Our revenu e excludes sales and usage -based taxes collected and is 
reported net of sales refunds, which includes an estimate of future returns and contract cancellations based on historical re fund rates, 
with a corresponding reduction to cost of sales. We defer the r evenue associated with any unsatisfied performance obligation until the 
obligation is satisfied, i.e., when control of a product is transferred to the customer or a service is completed.  
 
Product Revenue  
 
Product revenue is recognized when the customer takes physical control, either in our stores or at their home. Any fees charged to 
customers for delivery are a component of the transaction price and are recognized when delivery has been completed. We use 
delivery information at an individual co ntract level to determine when to recognize revenue for delivered products and any related 
delivery fee revenue.  
 
In most cases, we are the principal to product contracts as we have control of the physical products prior to transfer to the  customer. 
Accordingly, revenue is recognized on a gross basis. For certain sales, primarily activation -based software licenses and third -party 
stored -value cards, we are the sales agent providing access to the content and recognize commission revenue net o f amounts due to 
third parties who fulfill the performance obligation. For these sales, control passes upon providing access of the content to  the 
customer.  
 
Warranty obligations associated with the sale of our exclusive brands products are assurance -type warranties that are a guarantee of 
the product’s intended functionality and, therefore, do not represent a distinct performance obligation within the context of  the contract.  
 
Services - When we are the principal  
 
We recognize revenue for services, such as  installation, set -up, software troubleshooting, product repair, consultation and educational 
classes once the service is completed, as this is when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain the benef its of the 
service or serviced produc t. Payment terms are typically at the point of sale, but may also occur upon completion of the service. Our 
service contracts are primarily with retail customers, merchandise vendors (for factory warranty repairs) and third -party underwriters 
who sell exte nded warranty protection plans.  
 
For technical support membership contracts (for example, our Total Tech Support offering), we are responsible for fulfilling the support 
services to customers. These contracts have terms ranging from one month  to three year s and typically contain several performance 
obligations. Payment for the membership contracts is due at the start of the contract period. We have determined that our con tracts do 
not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our pay ment terms is to provide customers with a simplified 
method of purchasing our services, not to provide customers with financing. For performance obligations provided over time, w e 
recognize revenue on a usage basis, an input method of measuring progress ov er the related contract term. This method is derived by 
analysis of historical utilization patterns as this depicts when customers use the services and, accordingly, when delivery o f the 
performance obligation occurs. There is judgment in (1) determining t he level at which we apply a portfolio approach to these contracts; 
(2) measuring the relative standalone selling price for performance obligations within these contracts to the extent that the y are only 
bundled and sold to customers with other performance  obligations, or alternatively, using a cost -plus margin approach; and, (3) 
assessing the pattern of delivery across multiple portfolios of customers, including estimating current and future usage patt erns. When 
insufficient history of usage is available, we generally recognize revenue ratably over the life of the contract.  
 
Services - When we are the agent  
 
On behalf of third -party underwriters, we sell various hardware protection plans to customers that provide extended warranty coverage 
on their device p urchases. Such plans have terms ranging from one month  to five year s. Payment is due at the point of sale. Third -party 
underwriters assume the risk associated with the coverage and are primarily responsible for fulfillment. We record the net co mmissions 
(the amount charged to the customer less the premiums remitted to the underwriter) as revenue at a point in time when the 
corresponding product revenue is recognized. In addition, in some cases we are eligible to receive profit -sharing payments, a form of 
variable consideration, which are dependent upon the financial performance of the underwriter’s protection plan portfolio. We d o not 
share in any losses of the portfolio. We record any profit share as revenue once the uncertainty associated with the portfoli o period, 
which is calendar -year based, is no longer constrained using the expected value method. This typically occurs during our fiscal fourth 
quarter, with payment of the profit share occurring in the subsequent fiscal year. Service and commission reven ues earned from the 
sale of extended warranties represented  approximately 2% of revenue in fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018.  
 
We earn commissions from mobile network carriers to sell service contracts on their platforms. Revenue is recognized when control 
passes at a point in time upon sale of the contract and activation of the customer on the provider’s platform. The time betwe en when we 
activate the service with the customer and when we receive payment from the content provider is generally within  30 to 60 days, which 
is after control has passed. Activation commissions are subject to repayment to the carrier primarily in the event of customer 
cancellation for specified time periods after the sale. Commission revenue from mobile network carriers is reported net of the expected 
cancellations, which we estimate based on historical cancellation rates.

52 Credit Card Revenue  
  
We offer promotional financing and credit cards issued by third -party banks that manage and directly extend credit to our customers . 
Approximately 25% of revenue in fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 was transacted using one of our branded cards. We provide a 
license to our brand and marketing services, and we facilitate credit applications in our stores and online. The banks ar e the sole 
owners of the accounts receivable generated under the program and, accordingly, we do not hold any customer receivables relat ed to 
these programs and act as an agent in the financing transactions with customers. We are eligible to receive a prof it share from certain 
of our banking partners based on the annual performance of their corresponding portfolio, and we receive quarterly payments b ased on 
forecasts of full -year performance. This is a form of variable consideration. We record such profit s hare as revenue over time using the 
most likely amount method, which reflects the amount earned each quarter when it is determined that the likelihood of a signi ficant 
revenue reversal is not probable, which is typically quarterly. Profit -share payments oc cur quarterly, shortly after the end of each 
program quarter.  
  
Best Buy Gift Cards  
  
We sell Best Buy gift cards to our customers in our retail stores, online and through select third parties. Our gift cards do  not expire. We 
recognize revenue from gift c ards when the card is redeemed by the customer. We also recognize revenue for the portion of gift card 
values that is not expected to be redeemed ("breakage"). We estimate breakage based on historical patterns and other factors,  such as 
laws and regulation s applicable to each jurisdiction. We recognize breakage revenue using a method that is consistent with customer 
redemption patterns. Typically, over  90% of gift card redemptions (and therefore recognition of over 90% of gift card breakage revenue) 
occur w ithin one year of issuance. There is judgment in assessing (1) the level at which we group gift cards for analysis of breakag e 
rates, (2) redemption patterns, and (3) the ultimate value of gift cards which we do not expect to be redeemed. Gift card bre akag e 
income was  $35 million,  $34 million  and $40 million  in fiscal  2020, fiscal  2019  and fiscal  2018, respectively.  
  
Sales Incentives  
  
We frequently offer sales incentives that entitle our customers to receive a gift card at the time of purchase or an instant savings 
coupon that can be redeemed towards a future purchase. For sales incentives issued to customers that are only earned in conju nction 
with the purchase of products or services, the sales incentives represent an option that is a material right  and, accordingly, is a 
performance obligation in the contract. The revenue allocated to these sales incentives is deferred as a contract liability a nd is based on 
the cards or coupons that are projected to be redeemed. We recognize revenue for this perfor mance obligation when it is redeemed by 
the customer or when it is not expected to be redeemed. There is judgment in determining (1) the level at which we group ince ntives 
based on similar redemption patterns, (2) future redemption patterns, and (3) the ul timate number of incentives that we do not expect to 
be redeemed.  
  
We also issue coupons that are not earned in conjunction with a purchase of a product or service, typically as part of target ed 
marketing activities. This is not a performance obligation, but is recognized as a reduction of the transaction price when redeemed by 
the customer.  
  
Customer Loyalty Programs  
  
We have customer loyalty programs which allow members to earn points for each purchase completed with us or when using our co -
branded cre dit cards. Points earned enable members to receive a certificate that may be redeemed on future purchases. Depending on 
the customer's membership level within our loyalty program, certificate expirations typically range from  2 to 6 months from the date of 
issuance. Our loyalty programs represent customer options that provide a material right and, accordingly, are performance obl igations 
for each applicable contract. The relative standalone selling price of points earned by our loyalty program members is def erred and 
included in Accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the percentage of points that are projected to be  
redeemed. We recognize revenue for this performance obligation over time when a certificate is estimated to be redeemed by the 
customer. There is inherent judgment in estimating the value of our customer loyalty programs as they are susceptible to fact ors 
outside of our influence, particularly customer redemption activity. However, we have significant experience in estimati ng the amount 
and timing of redemptions of certificates, based primarily on historical data.

Vendor Allowances  
 
We receive funds from certain vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, primarily in the form of purchases -based or 
sales -based volumes and for product advertising and placement in our stores. We recognize these funds as a reduction of cost of sal es 
when the assoc iated inventory is sold. If the funds are not specifically related to purchase or sales volumes, the funds are recognized 
ratably over the performance period as the product promotion is completed. Funds that are determined to be a reimbursement of  
specific , incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell a vendor's products are recorded as an offset to the related expense wh en 
incurred.  
 
Advertising Costs  
 
Advertising costs, which are included in SG&A, are expensed over the period in which the advertisement is customer -facing. 
Advertising costs consist primarily of digital and television advertisements, as well as agency fees and production costs. Ad vertising 
expenses were  $840  million,  $777  million  and $776  million  in fiscal  2020, fiscal  2019  and fiscal  2018, respectively.  
 
Stock -Based Compensation  
 
We apply the fair value recognition provisions of accounting guidance as they relate to our stock -based compensation, which requires 
us to recognize expense for the fair value of our stock -based compensation awards. Compensation expense is recognized over the 
period in which services are required. It is recognized on a straight -line basis, except where there are performance awards that vest on 
a graded basis, in which case the expense for these awards is front -loaded or recognized on a graded -attribution basis.  
 
Comprehensive income (loss)  
Comprehensive income (loss) is computed as net earnings plus certain other items that are recorded directly to shareholders' equity. In 
addition to n et earnings, the significant component of comprehensive income (loss) includes foreign currency translation adjustments.  
 
2.  Acquisition s 
 
GreatCall, Inc.  
 
On October 1, 2018, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of GreatCall , Inc. (“GreatCall”)  for net cash consideration of $787  million.

Critical Sign al Technologies, Inc.  
 
On May 9, 2019, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Critical Signal Technologies, Inc. (“CST”), a health services co mpany, for 
net cash consideration of $125  million. The acquisition of CST is aligned with our strategy to ad dress health and wellness with a focus 
on aging  seniors and how technology can help them live longer in their homes.  
  
The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The purchase price allocation 
for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is substantially complete, but may be subject to immaterial changes. The acquired  
assets were primarily comprised of $83 million of customer relationships (amortized over 15 years) recorded within Other  assets on our 
Consolidated Balance Sheets . Goodwill of $52 million was recorded and assigned to our Best Buy Health  reporting unit and is not 
expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. We recorded $3 million of transac tion costs in fiscal 2020 related to the acquisition 
within SG&A expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Results of operations from the date of acquisition were incl uded 
within our Best Buy Heath  operating segment, Domestic reportable segment and Services revenue category. The acquisition of CST is 
not material to the results of our operations.  
 
BioSensics, LLC

Fair value measurements are reported in one of three levels based on the lowest level of significant input used: Level 1 (unadjusted 
quoted prices in active markets); Level 2 (observable market inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1); and Level  3 
(unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data).

active market.  
(5) Valued using select mutual fund performance that trad e with sufficient frequency and volume to obtain pricing information on an ongoing basis.  
 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments  
 
The fair values of cash, receivables, accounts payable and other payables approximated their carrying values because of the short -
term nature of these instruments. If these instruments were measured at fair value in the financial statements, they would be classified 
as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair values for other investments held at cost are not readily available, but we esti mate that the 
carrying values for these investments approximate their fair value s.

5.   Derivative Instruments  
 
We manage our economic and transaction exposure to certain risks by using foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge  against the 
effect of Canadian dollar exchange rate fluctuations on a p ortion of our net investment in our Canadian operations,  and interest rate 
swaps to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our 2021 Notes and 2028 Notes . In addition, we use foreign currency forward  
contracts not designated as hedging instruments to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  relative to 
recognized receivable and payable balances denominated in non -functional currencies.  
 
Our derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges and interes t rate swaps are recorded on our Consolidated Balance 
Sheets at fair value. See Note 4, Fair Value Measurements , for gross fair values of our outstanding  derivative instruments and

Short -Term Debt  
  
U.S. Revolving Credit Facility  
  
On April 17, 2018, we entered into a  $1.25  billion  five year  senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement (the "Facility") with a 
syndicate of banks. The Facility permits borrowings of up to  $1.25  billion  and expires in April 2023, with  no borrowings outstanding as 
of February  1, 2020, and February 2, 2019.   
  
The interest rate under the Facility is variable and, barring certain events of default, is determined at our option as: (i) the sum of (a) the 
greatest of (1) JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s prime rate, (2) the greater of the federal funds rate and the ov ernight bank funding rate 
plus, in each case,  0.5% , and (3) the one -month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), subject to certain adjustments plus  1%, and 
(b) a variable margin rate (the “ABR Margin”); or (ii) the LIBOR plus a variable margin rate (the  “LIBOR Margin”). In addition, a facility 
fee is assessed on the commitment amount. The ABR Margin, LIBOR Margin and the facility fee are based upon our current senior  
unsecured debt rating. Under the Facility, the ABR Margin ranges from  0.00%  to 0.30% , the LIBOR Margin ranges from 0.80%  to 
1.30%  and the facility fee ranges from  0.08%  to 0.20% . 
  
The Facility is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and contains customary affirmative and negative covenants. Among ot her 
things, these covenants restrict o ur and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to incur liens on certain assets; make material changes in 
corporate structure or the nature of our business; dispose of material assets; engage in certain mergers, consolidations and other 
fundamental changes; o r engage in certain transactions with our affiliates. The Facility also contains covenants that require us to 
maintain a maximum quarterly cash flow leverage ratio and a minimum quarterly interest coverage ratio. The Facility contains default 
provisions in cluding, but not limited to, failure to pay interest or principal when due and failure to comply with covenants. At  
February  1, 2020, we were in compliance with all such covenants.  
 
On March 19, 2020, we drew down the full amount of the Facility to increase our cash position and maximize flexibility in light of the 
uncertainty surrounding the impact of COVID -19. The interest rate for this draw under the Facility is variable at the 7 -day LIBOR plus a 
variable margin rate of 1.015% . The proceeds and resulting liability from the Facility will be included in Cash and cash equivalents and 
Short -term debt, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

2021 Notes  
  
In March 2011, we issued  $650  million  principal amount of notes due March 15, 2021 (the “2021 Notes”). The 2021 Notes bear interest 
at a fixed rate of  5.50%  per year, payable semi -annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on 
September  15, 2011. The 2021 Notes were issued at a slight discount to par, which when coupled with underwriting discounts of  $4 
million, resulted in net proceeds from the sale of the 2021 Notes of  $644  million.  
  
We may redeem some or all of the 2021 Notes at any time at a redemption price equa l to the greater of (i)  100%  of the principal 
amount, and (ii) the sum of the present values of each remaining scheduled payment of principal and interest discounted to th e 
redemption date on a semiannual basis, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the prin cipal amount to the redemption date as described 
in the indenture (including the supplemental indenture) relating to the 2021 Notes. Furthermore, if a change of control trigg ering event 
occurs, we will be required to offer to purchase the remaining unredee med 2021 Notes at a price equal to  101%  of their principal 
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the purchase date.  
  
The 2021 Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinat ed 
debt. The 2021 Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur debt secured by liens or to enter int o sale and 
lease -back transactions.  
  
2028 Notes  
  
In September 2018, we issued  $500  million  principal amount of notes due October 1, 2028 (the “2028 Notes”). The 2028 Notes bear 
interest at a fixed rate of  4.45%  per year, payable semi -annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on April 1, 2019. Net 
proceeds from the issuance were  $495  million  after underwriting and iss uance  discounts totaling  $5 million.  
  
We may redeem some or all of the 2028 Notes at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i)  100%  of the principal

redemption date on a semiannual basis, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount to the redemption date as des cribed 
in the indenture (including the supplemental indenture) relating to the 2028 Notes. Fu rthermore, if a change of control triggering event 
occurs, we will be required to offer to purchase the remaining unredeemed 2028 Notes at a price equal to  101%  of their principal 
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the purchase date.  
  
The 2028 Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated 
debt. The 2028 Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur debt secured by liens or to enter  into s ale and 
lease -back transactions.

7.   Shareholders' Equity  
 
Stock Compensation Plans  
 
Our Best Buy Co., Inc. Amended and Restated 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "Omnibus Plan") authorizes us to grant or issue non-
qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other equity awards 
up to a total of  22.5 million  shares. We have not granted incentive stock options under the Omnibus Plan. Under the terms of the 
Omnibus Pl an, awards may be granted to our employees, officers, advisers, consultants and directors. Awards issued under the 
Omnibus Plan vest as determined by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of our Board of Directors at the time of 
grant. Awards gran ted, forfeited or canceled under the previous plan, the 2004 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan, after 
February  1, 2014, adjust the amount available under the Omnibus Plan. At  February  1, 2020, a total of  9.4 million  shares were available 
for future grants u nder the Omnibus Plan.  
 
Upon adoption and approval of the Omnibus Plan, all of our previous equity incentive compensation plans were terminated. Howe ver, 
existing awards under those plans continued to vest in accordance with the original vesting schedule a nd will expire at the end of their 
original terms.  
 
Our outstanding stock options have a  10-year term. Outstanding stock options issued to employees generally vest over a  three year  
period. Share awards vest based either upon attainment of specified goals or solely upon continued employment ("time -based"). 
Outstanding share awards that are not time -based vest at the end of a three -year incentive period based upon our total shareholder 
return ("TSR") compared to the TSR of companies that comprise Standard  & Poor's 500 Index ("market -based") or upon the 
achievement of company performance goals ("performance -based"). Generally, time -based share awards vest 33% on each of the 
three annual anniversary dates following the grant date. Time -based share awards to dir ectors vest one year  from the grant date.

stock on the date of exercise exceeded the exercise price of the option) exercised during fiscal  2020, fiscal  2019  and fiscal  2018, w as 
$59 million, $33 million  and $57 million, respectively. At  February  1, 2020, there was  $10 million  of unrecognized compensation 
expense related to stock options that is expected to be recognized over a weighted -average period of  2.9 years.

Repurchase of Common Stock  
 
On February 23, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a  $3.0 billion  share repurchase program. There is no expiration date 
governing the period over which we can repurchase shares under this authorization.

common stock at a cost of  $56 million.  We have since temporarily suspended all share repurchases. Repurchased shares have been 
retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares.  
 
 
8.  Revenue  
 
We generate all of our revenue from contracts with customers from the sale of products and services. Contract balances primar ily 
consist of receivables and contract liabilities related to product merchandise not yet delivered to customers, unredeemed gif t cards, 
services not yet completed, and options that provide a material right to customers, such as our customer loyalty programs. Contract 
balances were as follows ($ in millions):

effectiveness and create a more seamless customer experience across all channels. All charges  incurred, including $10 million related 
to a voluntary early retirement offer,  relate d to termination benefits  from continuing operations within our Domestic segment .

Best Buy Mobile  
  
On March 1, 2018, we announced our intent to close all of our 257 remaining Best Buy Mobile stand -alone stores in the U.S . This 
decision was a result of changing economics in the mobile industry since we began opening  these stores in 2006, along with the 
integration of our mobile model into our core stores and on -line channel, which are more economically compelling today. All charges 
incurred were from continuing operations within our Domestic segment. No restructuring accrual related to this plan remains as of 
February 1, 2020.

In accordance with the prior guidance, ASC 840, Leases , our leases were previously designated as either capital, financing or 
operating. Previously designated capital leases are now considered finance leases under the new guidance, ASC 842, Leases , while 
our previously existing financing leases have been dere cognized and reclassified as operating leases. The designation of operating 
leases remains substantially unchanged under the new guidance. The future minimum lease payments by fiscal year as determined  
prior to the adoption of ASC 842, Leases , under our pr eviously designated capital, financing and operating leases (not including 
contingent rent) as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10 -K for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2019, were as follows ($ in

Tax Reform  
 
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. Among  other 
things, the Tax Act lowered the U.S. statutory tax rate from  35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, broadened the base to which U.S. 
income tax applies, imposed a one -time deemed repatriation tax on net unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries not previously 
subject to U.S. income tax and changed how foreign earnings a re subject to U.S. income tax.  
 
In response to the Tax Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”)  which 
provided guidance on accounting for the impact of the Tax Act. SAB 118 allowed companies to record provisional amounts to the extent 
they were reasonably estimable and adjust them over time as more information became available, not to extend beyond the 
measurement period of one year from the enactment of the Tax Act.  
 
As a result of the Tax Act, our blended U.S. statutory federal income tax rate was  33.7%  for fiscal 2018. In addition, we recorded 
provisional tax expense in fiscal 2018 of  $283  million. The  $283  million  included a  $209  million  charge associated with the deemed 
repatriation tax and a  $74 million  charge related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the new  21.0%  tax rate.  
 
In accordance with SAB 118, we completed the accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act and recorded the following 
adjustments to the provisional tax expense during fiscal 2019: (1) a  $20 million  reduction to the deemed repatriation tax liability, 
resulting in a final tax liability of  $189  million, and (2) a  $3 million  reduction to the revaluation of deferred tax asset s and liabilities to 
reflect the new tax rate, resulting in a net revaluation charge of  $71 million.

At February  1, 2020, we had deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards from international operations of  $78 million, of 
which  $73 million  will expire in various years through  2037  and the remaining amounts have no expiration; acquired U.S. federal net 
operating loss carryforwards of  $15 million, of which $11 million will expire in various years between  2023  and 2037 and the remaining 
amounts have no expiration; U.S. federal foreign tax credit carryforwards of  $6 million, which expire between 2024 and 2030; U.S. 
federal capital loss carryforwards of  $4 million, which expire between  2023 and 2025; state credit car ryforwards of  $8 million, which 
expire between  2022  and 2039; state net operating loss carryforwards of  $6 million, which expire between  2021  and 2039; international 
credit carryforwards of  $2 million, which have no expiration; and international capital lo ss carryforwards of  $8 million, which have no 
expiration.  
 
At February  1, 2020, a valuation allowance of  $96 million  had been established, of which  $5 million  is against U.S. federal foreign tax 
credit carryforwards;  $8 million  is against international capital loss carryforwards;  $78 million  is against international and state net 
operating loss carryforwards; $1 million is against international credit c arryforwards; and  $4 million  is against other state deferred tax 
assets. The  $5 million  increase from  February  2, 2019, is primarily due to the current year loss activity from international net operating 
loss carryforwards, as well as the acquired state ne t operating loss carryforwards, partially offset by the expiration of certain 
international net operating loss carryforwards.

Unrecognized tax benefits of  $300  million,  $282  million  and $263  million  at February  1, 2020,  February  2, 2019, and  February  3, 2018, 
respectively, would favorably impact our effective income tax rate if recognized.  
 
We recognize interest and penalties (not included in the "unrecognized tax benefits" above), as well as  interest received from favorable 
tax settlements, as components of income tax expense. Interest expense of  $11 million, interest expense of  $10 million  and interest 
income of  $10 million  was recognized in fiscal  2020, fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respecti vely. At  February  1, 2020,  February  2, 2019, 
and February  3, 2018, we had accrued interest of  $67 million,  $53 million  and $42 million, respectively.  
 
We file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, as well as income tax returns in various states an d foreign jurisdictions. With few 
exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non -U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years 
before fiscal 2011.  
 
Changes in state, federal, and foreign tax laws may increase or d ecrease our tax contingencies. The timing of the resolution of income 
tax examinations and controversies is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issue s raised by 
the taxing authorities may differ from the amount s accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive 
additional assessments by various tax authorities or reach resolutions of income tax examinations or controversies in one or more 
jurisdictions. These assessments, reso lutions, or law changes could result in changes to our gross unrecognized tax benefits. The 
actual amount of any changes could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any assessments, resolut ions or 
law changes. An estimate of the  amount or range of such changes cannot be made at this time.  
 
12.   Benefit Plans  
 
We sponsor retirement savings plans for employees meeting certain eligibility requirements. Participants may choose from vari ous 
investment options, including a fund compr ised of our company stock. Participants can contribute up to  50% of their eligible 
compensation annually as defined by the plan document, subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations. We match  100%  of the 
first 3% of participating employees' contributions and  50% of the next  2%. Employer contributions vest immediately. The total employer 
contributions were  $73 million,  $67 million  and $62 million  in fiscal  2020, fiscal  2019 and fiscal  2018, respectively.  
 
We offer a non -qualified, unfunded def erred compensation plan for highly -compensated employees and members of our Board of 
Directors. Amounts contributed and deferred under the plan are invested in options offered under the plan and elected by the 
participants. The liability for compensation d eferred under the plan was  $22 million  and $23 million  at February  1, 2020 , 
and February  2, 201 9, respectively, and is included in Long -term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 4, Fair Value 
Measurement s, for the fair value of assets held for deferred compensation.  
 
13.   Contingencies and Commitments  
 
We are involved in a number of legal proceedings. Where appropriate, we have made accruals with respect to these matters, whi ch are 
reflected on our Consolidated Financial Statements. However, there are cases where liability is not probable or the amount cannot be 
reasonably estimated and, therefore, accruals have not been made. We provide disclosure of matters where we believe it is rea sonably 
possible the impact may be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements . 
 
We had outstanding letters of credit with an aggregate fair value of  $81 million  at February  1, 2020.

16.   Subsequent Event s 
 
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of novel coronavirus  disease  (“COVID -19”) as a pandemic, and 
we expect our operations in all locations to be affected as the virus continues to proliferate. We have adjusted certain aspects of our 
operations to protect our employees and customers while still meeting customers’ needs for vital te chnology.  We will continue to 
monitor the situation closely and it is possible that we will implement further measures. In light of the uncertainty as to t he severity and 
duration of the pandemic, the impact on our revenues, profitability and financial pos ition is uncertain at this time.  
 
On March 19, 2020, we drew down the full amount of the Facility to increase our cash position and maximize flexibility in light of the 
uncertainty surrounding the impact of COVID -19. See Note 6, Debt , for additional information.  We also temporarily suspended all share 
repurchases.

Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), to allow timely de cisions regarding 
required disclosure. We have established a Disclosure Committee, consisting of certain members of management, to assist in th is 
evaluation. Our Disclosure Committee meets on a quarterly basis and more often if necessary.  
 
Our management, inc luding our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure 
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules  13a-15(e) and 15d -15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act), as of  February  1, 2020.
