5 | 2021 Annual ReportExecutive Summary
Incorporated in 1981, AES is a global e
nergy company accelerating the future of energy. Together with our many stakeholders, we areimproving lives by delivering the gree
ner, smarter energy solutions the world needs. Our diverse workforce is committed to continuous innovationand operational excelle
nce, while partnering with our customers on their strategic energy transitions and continuing to meet their energy needstoday.
Our Strategy
AES is an industry leader in develo
ping and growing the solutions that will enable the transition to low-carbon sources of energy andachievement of the Paris Agreement's goal of net-zero emissions by 2
050.Today we see an enormous business op
portunity from the once-in-a-lifetime transformation of the electricity sector driven by decarbonization,electrification, and digitalizatio
n. There is a substantial need for more renewable energy as well as an opportunity for innovation to develop newproducts and solutions that help customers accomplish the
ir individual decarbonization goals.At the core of AES' strategy is a dual focus on: (1) growing our portfolio of low-carbon products an
d solutions; and (2) working to develop andincubate new solutions and b
usiness models which will help drive change in the industry in the future.In 2021, we signed long-term contracts for approximately 5 GW of renewable power, bring
ing our backlog of projects — those with signedcontracts, but which are not yet in operation — to 9.2 GW. Our backlog serves as the core component of future growth.
Central to our renewables growth strategy is a focus on customer collaborati
on and co-creation, which helps us develop unique solutionsbased on specific customer needs. This approach n
ot only contributes to customer satisfaction and repeat business, but it also allows AES to workwith key customers on a bilateral basis rather than just through participati
on in bid processes.This approach has led to the co-creation of several first-of-its-kind industry innovati
ons, including an agreement to supply 24/7 carbon-freeenergy for Google's data centers in Virginia, ensuri
ng that the energy powering those data centers will be 90% carbon-free when measured on anhourly basis. In 2021, we signed a total of approximately 2 GW of other innovativ
e structures with various customers on a bilateral basis.
6 | 2021 Annual ReportWe are also working with some of the world's largest mining compa
nies in their transition to renewable energy in South America, essentiallyreducing the emissions of major supply chains. One way i
n which we are serving the mining industry is through our Green Blend offering, in whichwe work to integrate renewable energy with thermal po
wer during select hours of the day, reducing overall thermal generation and loweringemissions.
With our utilities, we are working with a broad range of stakehol
ders to transition to lower carbon forms of energy while promoting a JustTransition for the workers and communities who may be negatively imp
acted by the closure of fossil fuel facilities. At AES Indiana, for example, weare working to retire an additional 415 MW of convention
al generation by 2023, while adding new solar and energy storage to the grid.Our renewable growth strategy includes taking steps to ensure a
nd enable growth in future years. We massively expanded our pipeline ofdevelopment projects, which grew 70% to more than 55 GW at the end of 2021, both through ac
quisitions and increased investment in developmentactivities, such as securing land or advancin
g permitting and interconnection processes. For our projects in late-stage development, we worked tosecure supplier arrangements to avoid any potenti
al delays in relation to industry shortages, aided by our scale, supplier relationships, andadvanced planning measures.
We are also developing and inc
ubating new technologies that add value today and will drive our business in the future. We understand that theenergy industry is changing rapidly, an
d aim to proactively seek solutions that will give us a continued competitive advantage. At the core of ourinnovation strategy is AES Next, our business and tech
nology incubator. AES Next works to identify new and innovative business ventures thatprovide leading-edge and greene
r energy solutions.AES Next identifies upcoming trends in the in
dustry and opportunities for innovation. From there, we either develop capabilities in house ormake strategic investments in third-party ventures, targeting those in which we see ben
efit to our overall portfolio and where we believe AES canadd value.

Generation
We currently own and/or operate a generation portfolio of 31,45
9 MW, including generation from our integrated utility, AES Indiana. Ourgeneration fleet is diversified by fuel type. See disc
ussion below under Fuel Costs . Performance drivers of our generation businesses incl
ude types of electricity sales agreements, plant reliability and flexibility, availability ofgeneration capacity to meet contracted sales, fuel costs, seasonality, weath
er variations, economic activity, fixed-cost management, andcompetition.

7 | 2021 Annual ReportContract Sales 
— Most of our generation businesses sell electricity under medi um- or long-term contracts ("contract sales") or under short-termagreements in competitive markets ("short-term sales"). Our medium-term contract sales have terms of two to five years, while our long-term
contracts have terms of more than five years.
Contracts requiring fuel to generate energy, such as natural gas or coa
l, are structured to recover variable costs, including fuel and variableO&M costs, either through direct or indexation-based contractual pass-throughs or toll
ing arrangements. When the contract does not include a fuelpass-through, we typically hedge fuel costs or enter into fuel or energy su
pply agreements for a similar contract period (see discussion below underFuel Costs
). These contracts also help us to fund a significant portion of the total capital cost of the project through l ong-term non-recourse project-level financing.
Certain contracts include capacity payments that cover projected fixed costs of the pla
nt, including fixed O&M expenses, debt service, and areturn on capital invested. In addition, most of our contracts require that the majority of the capacity payments be denomin
ated in the currencymatching our fixed costs.
Contracts that do not have significant fuel cost or do not contain a capacity payme
nt are structured based on long-term spot prices with somenegotiated pass-through costs, allowin
g us to recover expected fixed and variable costs as well as provide a return on investment.These contracts are intended to reduce exposure to the volatil
ity of fuel and electricity prices by linking the business's revenues and costs. Wegenerally structure our business to eliminate or reduce foreig
n exchange risk by matching the currency of revenue and expenses, including fixedcosts and debt. Our project debt may consist of both fixed and floating rate debt for which we typically h
edge a significant portion of our exposure.Some of our contracted businesses also receive a regul
ated market-based capacity payment, which is discussed in more detail in the Short-Term Sales
 section below. Thus, these contracts, or other related commercial arrangements, significantly mitigate our exposure to chan
ges in power and, as applicable,fuel prices, currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates. In additio
n, these contracts generally provide for a recovery of our fixed operatingexpenses and a return on our investment, as long as we operate the p
lant to the reliability and efficiency standards required in the contract.Short-Term Sales 
— Our other generation businesses sell power an d ancillary services under short-term contracts with average terms of lessthan two years, including spot sales, directly in the short-term market or at regulated prices. The short-term markets are typically administered by a
system operator to coordinate dispatch. Short-term markets generally operate on merit order dispatch, where the least expe
nsive generationfacilities, based upon variable cost or bid pric
e, are dispatched first and the most expensive facilities are dispatched last. The short-term price istypically set at the marginal cost of energy or bid price (the cost of the last plant required to meet system demand). As a result, the cash flows and
earnings associated with these busi
nesses are more sensitive to fluctuations in the market price for electricity. In addition, many of these wholesalemarkets include markets for ancillary services to support the reliable operatio
n of the transmission system. Across our portfolio, we provide a widearray of ancillary services, including voltage su
pport, frequency regulation and spinning reserves.Many of the short-term markets in which we operate include regulated capacity markets. These capac
ity markets are intended to provideadditional revenue base
d upon availability without reliance on the energy margin from the merit order dispatch. Capacity markets are typically pricedbased on the cost of a new entrant and the system capacity relative to the desired leve
l of reserve margin (generation available in excess of peakdemand). Our generating facilities selling i
n the short-term markets typically receive capacity payments based on their availability in the market.Plant Reliability and Flexibili
ty — Our contract and short-term sales provide incentives to our generation plants to optimally mana ge availability,operating efficiency and flexibil
ity. Capacity payments under contract sales are frequently tied to meeting minimum standards. In short-term sales,our plants must be reliable and flexible to capture p
eak market prices and to maximize market-based revenues. In addition, our flexibility allows us tocapture ancillary service revenue whil
e meeting local market needs.Fuel Costs 
— For our thermal generation plants, fuel is a significant compone nt of our total cost of generation. For contract sales, we oftenenter into fuel supply agreements to match the contract period, or we may financially he
dge our fuel costs. Some of our contracts include indexationfor fuels. In those cases, we seek to match our fuel supply agreements to the indexation. For certain projects, we have toll
ing arrangements wherethe power offtaker is responsible for the supply and cost of fuel to our plants.

8 | 2021 Annual ReportIn short-term sales, we sell power at market prices that are generally reflective of the market cost of fuel at the time, and thus procure fuel
supply on a short-term basis, generally designed to match up with o
ur market sales profile. Since fuel price is often the primary determinant forpower prices, the economics of projects with short-term sales are often subject to volatility of relative fuel prices. For further information regarding
commodity price risk please see Item 7A.—
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures ab out Market Risk in this Form 10-K.43% of the capacity of our generation plants are fueled by rene
wables, including hydro, solar, wind, energy storage, biomass and landfill gas,which do not have significant fuel costs.
32% of the capacity of our generation plants are fueled by natura
l gas. Generally, we use gas from local suppliers in each market. A fewexceptions to this are AES Andes in Chil
e, where we purchase imported gas from third parties, and our plants in the Dominican Republic andPanama, where we import LNG to utilize in the local market.
23% of the capacity of our generation fleet is coal-fired. In the U.S., most of our coal-fired plants are supplied from domestic coal. At our non-
U.S. generation plants, and at our plants in Hawa
ii and Puerto Rico, we source coal internationally. Across our fleet, we utilize our global sourcingprogram to maximize the purchasing power of our fuel procurement.
2% of the capacity of our generation fleet utilizes pet coke, diesel or oi
l for fuel. We source oil and diesel locally at prices linked to internationalmarkets. We largely source pet coke from Mexico and the U.S.
Seasonality, Weather Variations and Eco
nomic Activity — Our generation businesses are affected by seasonal w eather patterns and,therefore, operating margin is not generated evenly throug
hout the year. Additionally, weather variations, including temperature, solar and windresources, and hydrological conditi
ons, may also have an impact on generation output at our renewable generation facilities. In competitive marketsfor power, local economic activity can also have an impact on p
ower demand and short-term prices for power.Fixed-Cost Management 
—  In our businesses with long-term contracts, the majority of the fixed O&M costs are recovered through the capacitypayment. However, for all generation businesses, mana
ging fixed costs and reducing them over time is a driver of business performance.Competition 
— For our businesses with medium- or long-term contracts, there is limited competition during the term of the contract. For short- term sales, plant dispatch and the price of electricity are determined by market competition and l
ocal dispatch and reliability rules.Utilities
Our utility businesses consist of AES Indiana and A
ES Ohio in the U.S. and four utilities in El Salvador. AES' six utility businesses distributepower to 2.6 million people and A
ES' two utilities in the U.S. also include generation capacity totaling 3,720 MW.AES Indiana,
 our fully integrated utility, and AES Ohio, our transmission and distribution regulated utility, operate as the sole distributors ofelectricity within their respective jurisdictions. AES Ind
iana owns and operates all of the facilities necessary to generate, transmit and distributeelectricity. AES Ohio owns and operates all of the faciliti
es necessary to transmit and distribute electricity. At our distribution business in El Salvador,we face limited competition due to significant barriers to enter the market. According to El Sa
lvador's regulation, large regulated customers have theoption of becoming unregulated us
ers and requesting service directly from generation or commercialization agents.In general, our utilities sell electricity directly to end-users, such as homes an
d businesses, and bill customers directly. Key performance driversfor utilities include the regulated rate of return and tariff, seasonality, weather variati
ons, economic activity and reliability of service. Revenue fromutilities is classified as regulated on the C
onsolidated Statements of Operations.Regulated Rate of Return and Tariff 
— In exchange for the right to sell or distribute electricity in a service territory, our utility businesses are subject to government regulation. This regulatio
n sets the framework for the prices ("tariffs") that our utilities are allowed to charge customers forelectricity and establishes service standards that we are requ
ired to meet.Our utilities are generally permitted to earn a regulated rate of return on assets, determined by the regul
ator based on the utility's allowedregulatory asset base, capital structure and cost of capital. The asset base on whic
h the utility is permitted a return is determined by the regulator,within the framework of applicable local l
aws, and is
9 | 2021 Annual Reportbased on the amount of assets that are considered used and us
eful in serving customers. Both the allowed return and the asset base are importantcomponents of the utility's earning power. The all
owed rate of return and operating expenses deemed reasonable by the regulator are recoveredthrough the regulated tariff that the utility charges to its customers.
The tariff may be reviewed and reset by the regulator from time to time depending on local regu
lations, or the utility may seek a change in itstariffs. The tariff is generally based upon usage level an
d may include a pass-through of costs that are not controlled by the utility, such as the costsof fuel (in the case of integrated utilities) and/or the costs of purchased energy, to the customer. Components of the tariff that are directly passed
through to the customer are usually adjusted through a summary regulatory process or an existi
ng formula-based mechanism. In some regulatoryregimes, customers with demand above an establishe
d level are unregulated and can choose to contract directly with the utility or with other retailenergy suppliers and pay non-byp
assable fees, which are fees to the distribution company for use of its distribution system.The regulated tariff generally recognizes that our utility bus
inesses should recover certain operating and fixed costs, as well as manageuncollectible amounts, quality of service an
d technical and non-technical losses. Utilities, therefore, need to manage costs to the levels reflected inthe tariff, or risk non-recovery of costs or diminished returns.
Seasonality, Weather Variations, and Econ
omic Activity — Our utility businesses are generally affected by seasona l weather patterns and,therefore, operating margin is not generated evenly throug
hout the year. Additionally, weather variations may also have an impact based on thenumber of customers, temperature variances from normal conditions, and customers' historic usage levels a
nd patterns. Retail sales, afteradjustments for weather variations, are also affected by changes in loc
al economic activity, energy efficiency and distributed generation initiatives,as well as the number of retail customers.
Reliability of Service 
— Our utility businesses must meet certain reliability standards, such as duration an d frequency of outages. Thosestandards may be explicit, with defined performance ince
ntives or penalties, or implicit, where the utility must operate to meet customer and/orregulator expectations.
Development and Construction
We develop and construct new generation faci
lities. For our utility business, new plants may be built or existing plants retrofitted in response tocustomer needs or to comply with regulatory developments. The projects are deve
loped subject to regulatory approval that permits recovery of ourcapital cost and a return on our investment. For our generation business
es, our priority for development is in key growth markets, where we canleverage our global scale an
d synergies with our existing businesses by adding renewable energy. We make the decision to invest in new projectsby evaluating the strategic fit, project returns and financial profile a
gainst a fair risk-adjusted return for the investment and against alternative uses ofcapital, including corporate debt repayme
nt.In some cases, we enter into long-term contracts for output from new facilities prior to commencing construction. To limit required equity
contributions from The AES Corporation, we also seek no
n-recourse project debt financing and other sources of capital, including partners, when itis commercially attractive. We typically contract with a third party to manage construction, although our construction mana
gement team supervisesthe construction work and tracks progress against the project's budget an
d the required safety, efficiency and productivity standards.Segments
The segment reporting structure uses the Company's management reporting structure as its foundati
on to reflect how the Company managesthe businesses internally and is main
ly organized by geographic regions which provides a socio-political-economic understanding of our business.
10 | 2021 Annual ReportWe are organized into four market-oriented SBUs: 
US and Utilities  (United States, Puerto Rico and El Salvador); South America  (Chile, Colombia, Argentina and Brazil); 
MCAC  (Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean); and Eurasia (Europe and Asia)  — which are led by our SBUPresidents. We have two lines of business: generatio
n and utilities. Each of our SBUs participates in our first business line, generation, in which weown and/or operate power plants to generate an
d sell power to customers, such as utilities, industrial users, and other intermediaries. Our US andUtilities SBU participates in our second b
usiness line, utilities, in which we own and/or operate utilities to generate or purchase, distribute, transmitand sell electricity to end-user customers in the residential, commercial, ind
ustrial and governmental sectors within a defined service area. In certaincircumstances, our utilities also generate and sell e
lectricity on the wholesale market.We measure the operating performance of our SBUs using Adjuste

AES Indiana
Business Description 
— IPALCO is a holding company whose princ ipal subsidiary is AES Indiana. AES Indiana is an integrated utility that isengaged primarily in generatin
g, transmitting, distributing, and selling electric energy to retail customers in the city of Indianapolis and neighboringareas within the state of Indiana and is subject to regulatory auth
ority—see Regulatory Framework and Market Structure below. AES Indiana has an exclusive right to provide electric service to the customers in its service area, covering abo
ut 528 square miles with an estimated population ofapproximately 977,000 peopl
e. AES Indiana owns and operates four generating stations, all within the state of Indiana. AES Indiana’s largestgenerating station, Petersburg, is coal-fired, and AES Indi
ana retired 230 MW Petersburg Unit 1 on May 31, 2021 and has plans to retire 415 MWPetersburg Unit 2 in 2023, which woul
d result in 630 MW of total retired economic capacity at this station (see Integrated Resource Plan below). The second largest station, Harding Street, uses natural gas and fue
l oil to power combustion turbines. In addition, AES Indiana operates a 20 MWbattery-based energy storage unit at Harding Street, which provid
es frequency response. The third station, Eagle Valley, is a CCGT natural gasplant. The fourth station, Georgetown, is a small peaking station that uses natural g
as to power combustion turbines. In addition, AES Indiana helpsmeet its customers' energy needs with long-term contracts for the purchase of 94 MW of solar-generated electricity and 300 MW of wind-generated
electricity. In December 2021, AES Indiana, through its whol
ly-owned subsidiary AES Indiana Devco Holdings 1, LLC, completed the acquisition ofHardy Hills Solar Energy LLC, inclu
ding the development of a 195 MW solar project (the "Hardy Hills Solar Project"). In July 2021, AES Indiana,through its wholly-owned subsid
iary AES Indiana Devco Holdings 2, LLC, executed an agreement to acquire a 250 MW solar and 180 MWh energystorage facility (the "Petersburg Solar Project").

16 | 2021 Annual ReportKey Financial Drivers 
—  AES Indiana's financial results are driven primarily by retail demand, weather, and maintenance costs. In addition,AES Indiana's financial resu
lts are likely to be driven by many other factors including, but not limited to:•
regulatory outcomes and impacts;•
the passage of new legislation, implementation of regulations, or other changes in regulation; and•
timely recovery of capital expenditures.Regulatory Framework and Market Structure 
— AES Indiana is subject to comprehensive regu lation by the IURC with respect to its servicesand facilities, retail rates and charges, the issuance of lon
g-term securities, and certain other matters. The regulatory authority of the IURC over AESIndiana's business is typical of regul
ation generally imposed by state public utility commissions. The IURC sets tariff rates for electric serviceprovided by AES Indiana. The IURC cons
iders all allowable costs for ratemaking purposes, including a fair return on assets used and useful toproviding service to customers.
AES Indiana's tariff rates for electric service to retail customers consist of basic rates and approved charges. In additi
on, AES Indiana's ratesinclude various adjustment mechanisms, incl
uding, but not limited to: (i) a rider to reflect changes in fuel and purchased power costs to meet AESIndiana's retail load requirements, referred to as the Fuel Adj
ustment Charge, (ii) a rider for the timely recovery of costs incurred to comply withenvironmental laws and regulati
ons, including a return (iii) a rider to reflect changes in ongoing RTO costs, (iv) riders for passing through tocustomers wholesale sales margins and cap
acity sales above and below established annual benchmarks, (v) a rider for a return on and ofinvestments for eligible TDSIC improvements, and (vi) a rider for cost recovery, lost margin recoveries and performance incentiv
es from AESIndiana's demand side manag
ement energy efficiency programs. Each of these tariff rate components function somewhat independently of oneanother, but the overall structure of AES Indiana's rates is subject to review at the time of any review of AES Indi
ana's basic rates and charges.Additionally, AES Indian
a's rider recoveries are reviewed through recurring filings.On October 31, 2018, the IURC issued an order approving an unc
ontested settlement agreement to increase AES Indiana's annual revenuesby $44 million, or 3% (the "2018 Base Rate Order"). This revenue increase primarily inc
ludes recovery through rates of costs associated with theCCGT at Eagle Valley, completed in the first half of 2018, and other constructio
n projects. New base rates and charges became effective onDecember 5, 2018. The 2018 Base Rate Order was AES Indi
ana's most recent base rate order and also provides customers with approximately $50million in benefits over a two-year period through a rate ad
justment mechanism that began in March 2019.AES Indiana is one of many transmission system owner members in MISO, an RTO which maintains functio
nal control over the combinedtransmission systems of its members and manages one of the largest energy and ancill
ary services markets in the U.S. MISO dispatches generationassets in economic order considering transmission co
nstraints and other reliability issues to meet the total demand in the MISO region. AES Indianaoffers electricity in the MISO day-ahead and real-time markets.
Development Strategy 
—  AES Indiana's construction program is composed of capital expenditures necessary for prudent utility operations andcompliance with environmental regu
lations, along with discretionary investments designed to replace aging equipment or improve overallperformance.
Senate Enrolled Act 560, the Transmission, Distributi
on, and Storage System Improvement Charge ("TDSIC") statute, provides for costrecovery outside of a base rate proceeding for new or replacement el
ectric and gas transmission, distribution, and storage projects that a publicutility undertakes for the purposes of safety, reliability, system modernization, or economic deve
lopment. Provisions of the TDSIC statute requirethat requests for recovery include a plan of at least five years and not more than seven for eligib
le investments. Once a plan is approved by theIURC, eighty percent of eligible costs can be recovered us
ing a periodic rate adjustment mechanism, referred to as a TDSIC mechanism.Recoverable costs include a return on, and of, the investment, inclu
ding AFUDC, post-in-service carrying charges, operation and maintenanceexpenses, depreciation, and property taxes. The remaini
ng twenty percent of recoverable costs are deferred for future recovery in the public utility’snext base rate case. The TDSIC mechanism is capped at an annu
al increase of two percent of total retail revenues.On March 4, 2020, the IURC issued an order approving the projects in AE
S Indiana's seven-year TDSIC Plan for eligible transmission,distribution, and storage system improvements totaling $1.2 bill
ion from 2020 through 2026. Beginning in June 2020, AES Indiana files an annualTDSIC rate adjustment for a return on, and of, investments through March 31 with rates requested to be effective each November. Annua
l TDSICplan update filings are required to be stag
gered by six months as ordered by the IURC and are filed each December. The total
17 | 2021 Annual Reportamount of AES Indiana’s equipment ap
proved for TDSIC recovery as of December 31, 2021 was $160 million.Integrated Resource Plan 
—  In December 2019, AES Indiana filed its Integrated Resource Plan ("IRP"), which describes AES Indiana'sPreferred Resource Portfolio for meeting generation capac
ity needs for serving AES Indiana's retail customers over the next several years. AESIndiana's Preferred Resource Portfolio is AES Ind
iana's reasonable least cost option and provides a cleaner and more diverse generation mix forcustomers. The IRP includes the retirement of approximately 630 MW of coal-fired generation by 20
23. Based on extensive modeling, AES Indianadetermined that the cost of operating Petersburg Units 1 and 2 exceeds the va
lue customers receive compared to alternative resources. Retirementof these units allows the company to cost-effectively diversify the portfolio and transitio
n to lower cost and cleaner resources while maintaining areliable system.
AES Indiana retired 230 MW Petersburg Unit 1 on May 31, 2021 an
d has plans to retire 415 MW Petersburg Unit 2 in 2023, which will result in630 MW of total retired economic capacity at this station. In November 2021, AES Indiana receiv
ed approval from the IURC for approvals and costrecovery associated with the Petersburg retirements, which includ
es: (1) AES Indiana's creation of regulatory assets for the net book value ofPetersburg units 1 and 2 upon retirement; (2) a method for amortization of the regulatory assets; and (3) recovery of the regulatory assets through
ongoing amortization in AES Indi
ana’s future rate cases. The order reserves all rights of all the parties with respect to the ratemaking treatmentrelated to the regulatory assets, including the proper rate of return and mechanisms for recovery.
AES Indiana issued an all-so
urce Request for Proposal in December 2019, in order to competitively procure replacement capacity by June 1,2023, which is the first year AES Indiana is expected to have a ca
pacity shortfall. Modeling indicated that a combination of wind, solar, storage, andenergy efficiency would be the lowest reaso
nable cost option for the replacement capacity, but AES Indiana continues to assess the type, size, andlocation of resources in the bids it received. In December 2021, AE
S Indiana completed the acquisition of the Hardy Hills Solar Project, which is a195 MW solar project to be developed and expecte
d to commence operations in 2023. AES Indiana received an order from the IURC approving theproject in June of 2021. In July 2021, AES Indian
a executed an agreement to acquire the Petersburg Solar Project, which is a 250 MW solar and180 MWh energy storage facility expected to commence operations in 2
024, and on November 24, 2021, AES Indiana received an order from theIURC approving the project.
In December 2021, AES Indiana received e
quity capital contributions of $275 million from AES and CDPQ on a proportional share basis to beused for funding needs related to AES India
na’s TDSIC and replacement generation projects.AES Ohio
Business Description 
— DPL is an energy holding company w hose principal subsidiary is AES Ohio. AES Ohio is a utility company thattransmits and distributes electricity to retail customers in a 6,000 square mile area of West Central Ohio and is sub
ject to regulatory authority—seeRegulatory Framework and Market Structure 
below. AES Ohio has the exclusive right to provid e transmission and distribution services to itscustomers, and procures retail standard service offer ("SSO") electric service on behalf of residential, commercial, industrial, an
d governmentalcustomers through a competitive bid auction process. In previous years, AES Ohio Gen
eration was also a primary subsidiary, but DPL hassystematically exited this generation busin
ess. AES Ohio Generation retired its last remaining operating asset in May 2020 and sold it in June 2020.Key Financial Drivers 
— Following the removal of the Decoupli ng Rider in December 2019, DPL's financial results are driven primarily by retaildemand and weather. DPL's financi
al results are likely to be driven by other factors as well, including, but not limited to:•
regulatory outcomes and impacts;•
the passage of new legislation, implementation of regulations, or other changes in regulations; and•
timely recovery of transmission and distribution expenditures.Regulatory Framework and Market Structure 
— AES Ohio is regulated by the PUCO for its distribution services and facil ities, retail rates andcharges, reliability of service, compliance with rene
wable energy portfolio requirements, energy efficiency program requirements, and certain othermatters. The PUCO maintains jurisdiction over the delivery of electricity, SSO, and other retail electric services.

18 | 2021 Annual ReportElectric customers within Ohio are permitted to purchase power under contract from a Competitive Retail E
lectric Service ("CRES") provider orfrom their local utility under SSO rates. The SSO generation supply is provid
ed by third parties through a competitive bid process. Ohio utilities havethe exclusive right to provide transmission and distributi
on services in their state-certified territories. While Ohio allows customers to choose retailgeneration providers, AES Ohio is required to provi
de retail generation service at SSO rates to any customer that has not signed a contract with aCRES provider or as a provider of last resort in the event of a CRES provider default. SSO rates are subject to rules an
d regulations of the PUCOand are established through a competitive b
id process for the supply of power to SSO customers.AES Ohio's distribution rates are regulated by the PU
CO and are established through a traditional cost-based rate-setting process. AES Ohiois permitted to recover its costs of providing distribution service as well as earn a regul
ated rate of return on assets, determined by the regulator,based on the utility's allowed reg
ulated asset base, capital structure, and cost of capital. AES Ohio's retail rates include various adjustmentmechanisms including, but not limited to, the timely recovery of costs incurred related to power purch
ased through the competitive bid process,participation in the PJM RTO, severe storm damage, and energy efficiency. AES Ohio's transmissi
on rates are regulated by FERC.AES Ohio is a member of PJM, an RTO that operates the transmission systems owned by utilities operating in a
ll or parts of a multi-stateregion, including Ohio. PJM also admin
isters the day-ahead and real-time energy markets, ancillary services market and forward capacity market forits members.
On November 30, 2020, AES Ohio filed a new Distributi
on Rate Case Application proposing a revenue increase of $121 million per year andincorporating DIR investments that were planned a
nd approved in the last rate case but not yet included in distribution rates, other distributioninvestments since September 2015, investments necessitated by the torna
dos that occurred on Memorial Day in 2019, and other proposedincreases. The rate case also includes a propos
al for increased tree-trimming expenses and certain customer demand-side management programsand recovery of prior-approved regulatory assets for tree trimming, uncollectible expe
nses and rate case expense. A hearing on this case was heldbeginning in January 20
22, and the case is pending a commission order.In March 2020, AES Ohio filed an applicatio
n for a formula-based rate for its transmission service, which was approved and made effectiveMay 3, 2020. In December 2020, an uncontested settlement was reached reg
arding these rates and filed with the FERC. It was approved on April15, 2021.
Smart Grid and Comprehensive Settlement 
— On October 23, 2020, AES Ohio entered into a Stipulation an d Recommendation (settlement)with the staff of the PUCO and various customers, and organizations representing customers of AES Ohi
o and certain other parties with respect to,among other matters, AES Ohio's applications pend
ing at the PUCO for (i) approval of AES Ohio's plan to modernize its distribution grid (the "SmartGrid Plan"), (ii) findings that AES Ohio passed the SEET for 2018 and 2
019, and (iii) findings that AES Ohio's current ESP 1 satisfies the SEET andthe more favorable in the aggregate ("MFA") regulatory test. A hearing was held in Janu
ary 2021 for consideration of this settlement and on June16, 2021, the PUCO issued their opinion a
nd order accepting the stipulation as filed. Several applications for rehearing of the PUCO's ordersrelating to the comprehensive settlement were filed and d
enied on December 1, 2021. The OCC appealed this final PUCO Order to the OhioSupreme Court on December 6, 2021; this appeal remains p
ending. With the PUCO’s issuance of their opinion and order, AES has made cashcontributions of $150 million in 20
21 to improve AES Ohio's infrastructure and modernize its grid while maintaining liquidity.Separate from the ESP process, on January 23, 2020, AES Ohio filed w
ith the PUCO requesting approval to defer its decoupling costsconsistent with the methodology approved i
n its Distribution Rate Case. If approved, deferral would be effective December 18, 2019 and goingforward would reduce impacts of weather, energy efficiency programs, and eco
nomic changes in customer demand. An evidentiary hearing washeld on this matter on May 4, 2021.
Development Strategy 
— Planned construction projects primarily relate to new inv estments in and upgrades to AES Ohio's transmission anddistribution system. Capital projects are subject to continuin
g review and are revised in light of changes in financial and economic conditions, loadforecasts, legislative and regulatory develo
pments, and changing environmental standards, among other factors.DPL is projecting to spend an estimated $78
6 million on capital projects from 2022 through 2024, which includes expected spending underAES Ohio's Smart Grid Plan included in the Stip
ulation and Recommendation entered into on October 23, 2020 (see Regulatory Framework and Market Structure
 above) as well as other new transmission and distributi on projects. The Smart Grid Plan, as approved, provides for a return on andrecovery of up to $249 million of Phase 1 investments and recovery of operati
onal and maintenance expenses through AES
19 | 2021 Annual ReportOhio's existing Infrastructure Investment Rider for a term of four years, under an aggregate cap of $268 million on the amount of such inv
estmentsand expenses that is recoverable, and an ackn
owledgement that AES Ohio may file a subsequent application with the PUCO within three yearsseeking approvals for Phase 2 of the Smart Grid Plan.
AES Clean Energy
Business Description 
— AES' U.S. renewables portfolio, referred to as AES Clean E nergy, is one of the top U.S. renewables growth platforms.It collectively comprises AES Renewabl
e Holdings, sPower, AES Clean Energy Development, and other renewable assets, as part of its broaderinvestments in the U.S.
On February 1, 2021, specifically identified proj
ects in the sPower and AES Renewable Holdings development platforms were merged to formAES Clean Energy Develo
pment, which serves as the development vehicle for all future renewable projects in the U.S. sPower remains an AESunconsolidated affiliate after the merger.
In November 2021, AES Clean Energy Dev
elopment acquired Valcour Intermediate Holdings, which owns a portfolio of six wind farms in NewYork with total generating capacity of 612 MW. The Valcour portfolio prod
uces over 30% of the state's wind power, complementing AES CleanEnergy's existing operating and d
evelopment solar and energy storage assets in the state of New York. In December 2021, AES Clean EnergyDevelopment acquired Community Energy, a U.S. solar dev
eloper with a mission to commercialize utility-scale solar and decarbonize the grid.Community Energy brings a 10 GW pipeline of renewa
bles projects and an industry-leading development team to AES Clean Energy.AES Clean Energy aims to solve our customers' energy cha
llenges. AES Clean Energy offers its customers an expanded portfolio ofinnovative solutions based o
n cutting-edge technologies that are designed to accelerate their energy futures. Generation capacity of the systemsowned and/or operated under AES C
lean Energy is 4,312 MW across the U.S. with another 1,093 MW under construction. This capacity includes3,156 MW of solar, 1,861 MW of wind, and 388 MW of energy storage.
A majority of solar projects under AES Clean Energy hav
e been financed with tax equity structures. Under these tax equity structures, the taxequity investors receive a portion of the economic attributes of the facilities, incl
uding tax attributes, that vary over the life of the projects. Based oncertain liquidation provisio
ns of the tax equity structures, this could result in variability to earnings attributable to AES compared to the earningsreported at the facilities.
Key Financial Drivers 
— The financial results of AES Clean Energy are primari ly driven by the efficient construction and operation ofrenewable energy facilities across the U.S. und
er long-term PPAs, through which the energy price on the entire production of these facilities isguaranteed. The financial results of renewa
ble assets are primarily driven by the amount of wind or solar resource at the facilities, availability offacilities, and growth in projects.
Laurel Mountain, Buffalo Gap I, Buffalo Gap II, and Buffalo Gap III are exposed to the volatility of energy prices and the
ir revenue may changematerially as energy prices fluctuate in their respective markets of operations. Laurel Mou
ntain also operates 16 MW of battery energy storage thatis sold into the PJM market as regulation energy. For these projects, PJM and ERCOT power prices impact fina
ncial results.Development Strategy 
— As states, communities, and organizations of all types make commitments and plan to reduce their carbo n footprints,renewables are the fastest-growing source of electricity generati
on in the U.S. AES Clean Energy works with its customers to co-create and deliverthe smarter, greener energy solutions that meet their needs, including 24/7 carb
on-free energy. The merged renewables platform has broughttogether sPower's and AES' differentiated ca
pabilities in solar, wind, and energy storage to accelerate customers' energy transitions.AES Clean Energy's renewa
ble project backlog includes 4,414 MW of projects for which long-term PPAs have been signed or, as applicable,tariffs have been assigned through a regulatory process. The b
udget for construction of the projects currently under construction and the contractedprojects is over $4.1 billion. AES Clea
n Energy is actively developing new products and renewable sites to serve the current and future needs of itscustomers.
U.S. Conventional Generation
Business Description 
— In the U.S., we own a conventional generation portfoli o. The principal markets and locations where we are engaged inthe generation and supply of electricity (energy an
d capacity) are the California Independent System Operator ("CAISO"), PJM, Hawaii, and PuertoRico. AES Southland, operating i
n the CAISO, is our most significant generation business.
20 | 2021 Annual ReportMany of our non-renewable U.S. generation pl
ants provide baseload operations and are required to maintain a guaranteed level of availability.Any change in availabi
lity has a direct impact on financial performance. Some plants are eligible for availability bonuses if they meet certainrequirements. Coal and natural gas are used as the primary fuels. Coa
l prices are set by market factors internationally, while natural gas prices aregenerally set domestically. Recently we hav
e seen international impacts on domestic gas prices (Henry Hub) due to the large amount of U.S. naturalgas that can be exported through the liquefaction p
lants that have come online in recent years. Price variations for these fuels can change thecomposition of generation costs and energy prices i
n our generation businesses.These generation businesses h
ave entered into long-term PPAs with utilities or other offtakers. Some businesses with PPAs havemechanisms to recover fuel costs from the offtaker, including an energy payment partially based o
n the market price of fuel. When market pricefluctuations in fuel are borne by the offtaker, revenue may change as fuel prices fluctu
ate, but the variable margin or profitability should remainconsistent. These businesses often have an op
portunity to increase or decrease profitability from payments under their PPAs depending on suchitems as plant efficiency and availabil
ity, heat rate, ability to buy coal at lower costs through AES' global sourcing program, and fuel flexibility.Warrior Run currently operates as a QF, as defined under the PURPA. This busin
ess entered into a long-term contract with an electric utilitythat had a mandatory obligation to purchase po
wer from QFs at the utility's avoided cost (i.e. the likely costs for both energy and capital investmentthat would have been incurred by the purchas
ing utility if that utility had to provide its own generating capacity or purchase it from another source).To be a QF, a cogeneration facility must produce electricity and useful thermal en
ergy for an industrial or commercial process or heating or coolingapplication in certain proportions to the facil
ity's total energy output and meet certain efficiency standards. To be a QF, a small power productionfacility must generally use a renewable resource as its en
ergy input and meet certain size criteria or be a cogeneration facility that simultaneouslygenerates electricity and process heat or steam.
Our non-QF generation businesses in the U.S. currently operate as Exempt Wholes
ale Generators as defined under the Energy Policy Act of1992, amending the Public Util
ity Holding Company Act (“PUHCA”). These businesses, subject to approval of FERC, have the right to sell power atmarket-based rates, either directly to the wholesale market or to a third-party offtaker such as a power marketer or utility/industrial customer. Under
the Energy Policy Act and FERC's regulati
ons, approval from FERC to sell wholesale power at market-based rates is generally dependent upon ashowing to FERC that the seller lacks market power in generati
on and transmission, that the seller and its affiliates cannot erect other barriers tomarket entry, and that there is no opportunity for abusive transactions involving regu
lated affiliates of the seller.The U.S. wholesale electricity market consists of multiple distinct regio
nal markets that are subject to both federal regulation, as implementedby FERC, and regional regulatio
n as defined by rules designed and implemented by the RTOs, non-profit corporations that operate the regionaltransmission grid and maintain organize
d markets for electricity. These rules, for the most part, govern such items as the determination of themarket mechanism for setting the system marginal price for energy and the establishment of guideli
nes and incentives for the addition of newcapacity. See Item 1A.—
Risk Factors  for additional discussion on U.S. regulatory matters. AES Southland
Business Description 
— AES Southland is one of the largest generati on operators in California by aggregate installed capacity, with aninstalled gross capacity of 3,803 MW at the end of 2021. The five coastal pow
er plants comprising AES Southland are in areas that are critical forlocal reliability and play a
n important role in integrating the increasing amounts of renewable generation resources in California. AES Southland iscomposed of three once-through cooling ("OTC") power plants, two combine
d cycle gas-fired generation facilities and an interconnected battery-based energy storage facility.
AES Huntington Beach, LLC, AES A
lamitos, LLC, and AES Redondo Beach ("Southland OTC units") are contracted through ResourceAdequacy Purchase Agreements (“RAPAs”). Under the RAP
As, as approved by the California Public Utilities Commission, these generating stationsprovide resource adequacy capacity, and h
ave no obligation to produce or sell any energy to the RAPA counterparty. However, the generatingstations are required to bid energy into the Californi
a ISO markets. Southland OTC units entered into commodity swap contracts to economicallyhedge price variability inhere
nt in electricity sales arrangements. Compensation under these RAPAs is dependent on the availability of the AESSouthland units in the Californi
a ISO market. Failure to achieve the minimum availability target would result in an assessed penalty.
21 | 2021 Annual ReportIn November 2014, AES Southland was a
warded 20-year contracts by Southern California Edison ("SCE") to provide 1,284 MW of combinedcycle gas-fired generation and 100 MW of interconnected b
attery-based energy storage ("Southland Energy units"). The agreements for thecombined cycle gas-fired generation were ame
nded in 2019 increasing contracted capacity to 1,299 MW and additional amendments during 2021further increased contracted capacity to 1,348 MW. The contracts are RAPAs with annual en
ergy put options. If AES Southland exercises theannual put option, all capacity, energy a
nd ancillary services will be sold to SCE in exchange for a fixed monthly fee that covers fixed operating cost,debt service, and return on capital. In addition, SCE wil
l reimburse variable costs and provide the natural gas. Southland Energy may exercise theannual put option for any contract year by delivering n
otice of such exercise to SCE at least one year before the start of such contract year, and nomore than two years before the start of any contract year. Southland Energy units are required to bid energy into the C
alifornia ISO market if theannual put option is not exercised.
In April 2017, the California Energy Commissio
n unanimously approved the licenses for the Southland Energy combined cycle projects at AESAlamitos and AES Huntington Be
ach. In June 2017, AES closed the financing of $2 billion, funded with a combination of non-recourse debtand AES equity. Construction of the combined cycle ca
pacity began in 2017. At the end of 2019, five of the twelve Southland OTC generation unitswere retired to support the construction efforts of the Southland Energy combined cycle g
as-fired generation projects in anticipation of COD, whichwas reached in early February 2020. The construction of the Al
amitos Energy Center, an interconnected battery-based energy storage facility,began in June 2019 and commercia
l operation was achieved on January 1, 2021.On January 23, 2020, the Statewide Advisory Committee on Coo
ling Water Intake Structures adopted a recommendation to present to theSWRCB to extend OTC compliance dates for the remaining South
land OTC units at AES Huntington Beach and AES Alamitos until December 31,2023 and AES Redond
o Beach until December 31, 2021. On September 1, 2020, in response to a request by the state's energy, utility, and gridoperators and regulators, the SWRCB approved amendme
nts to its OTC. The SWRCB public hearing regarding the final decision on theamendment of the OTC policy was held on October 19, 2021 and the B
oard voted in favor of extending the compliance date for AES RedondoBeach to December 31, 2023. The AES Redo
ndo Beach NPDES permit has been administratively extended. The SWRCB OTC Policy previouslyrequired the shutdown and permanent retirement of all remain
ing Southland OTC generating units by December 31, 2020. There is currently no planto replace the OTC generating units at the AES Redon
do Beach generating station following the retirement. See United States Environmental and Land-Use Legislation and Regula
tions— Cooling Water Intake for further discussion of AES Southland’s plans regard ing the OTC Policy.Key Financial Drivers 
— AES Southland's availa bility is one of the most important drivers of operations, along with market demand and pricesfor gas and electricity.
AES Hawaii
Business Description 
— AES Hawaii receives an energy payme nt from its offtaker under a PPA expiring in 2022, which is based on a fixedrate indexed to the Gross National Product Implicit Price Deflator. Since the en
ergy payment is not directly linked to market prices for fuel, the riskarising from fluctuations in market prices for coal is borne by AES Hawaii. AE
S Hawaii has entered into fixed-price coal purchase commitments tomanage fuel price risk during 2022.
In July 2020, the Hawaii State Legislature p
assed Senate Bill 2629 which will prohibit AES Hawaii from generating electricity from coal afterDecember 31, 2022. This will restrict the Company from contracting the asset beyond the exp
iration of its existing PPA, and as a result, AES plansto retire the AES Hawaii facility in 2022.
Key Financial Drivers 
— AES Hawaii's financial resu lts are driven by fuel costs and outages. The Company has entered into fuel contracts tomitigate the risks associated with fluctuating prices.
Puerto Rico
Business Description 
— AES Puerto Rico owns and operates a coal-fired co generation plant and a solar plant of 524 MW and 24 MW,respectively, representing approximately 8% of the install
ed capacity in Puerto Rico. Both plants are fully contracted through long-term PPAs withPREPA expiring in 2027 a
nd 2037, respectively. AES Puerto Rico receives a capacity payment based on the plants' twelve month rolling averageavailability, receiving the full payme
nt when the availability is 90% or higher. See Item 7.—Management's Discussion  and Analysis of FinancialCondition and Results of Operations—K
ey Trends and Uncertainties—Macroeconomic and Political—Puerto Rico for further discussion of the long- term PPAs with PREPA.

22 | 2021 Annual ReportKey Financial Drivers 
— Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to, improved o perational performance and plantavailability.
Regulatory Framework and Market Structure
 — Puerto Rico has a single electric grid managed by P REPA, a state-owned entity that providesvirtually all of the electric power consumed in Puerto Ric
o and generates, transmits, and distributes electricity to 1.5 million customers. Since June2021 PREPA contracted LUMA Energy to manag
e the transmission, distribution and commercialization activities. The Puerto Rico Energy Bureau isthe main regulatory body. The bureau approves wh
olesale and retail rates, sets efficiency and interconnection standards, and oversees PREPA'scompliance with Puerto Rico's renew
able portfolio standard.Puerto Rico's electricity is 98% produced by thermal pla
nts (43% from natural gas, 38% from petroleum, and 17% from coal), while theremaining 2% is supplied by renew
able resources (wind, solar, and hydro).Development Strategy
 — Puerto Rico has clear goals of supplying its system from renewable resources, with targets of 40% from renewab lesby 2025 and 100% from renewables by 205
0. To achieve the established targets, PREPA intends to issue six requests for proposal for generationfrom renewable sources in the coming years. The first request for proposal was issued in Fe
bruary 2021. AES Puerto Rico, through AES CleanFlexible Energy, is working to deliver gree
n energy solutions to meet the country's needs, with a long-term strategy to achieve 24/7 carbon-freeenergy. AES Clean Flexible E
nergy expects to have a portfolio of solar and storage projects participating. As applicable, tariffs will be assignedthrough a regulatory process. AES Clean Flexi
ble Energy is actively developing new renewable sites to serve the future needs of Puerto Rico and itscommunities.

l regulations see Item 1.— United States Environmental and Land-Use Legislation andRegulations
. El Salvador
Business Description 
— AES El Salvador is the majority owner of four of the five distribution compani es operating in El Salvador (CAESS,CLESA, EEO and DEUSEM). AES El Salva
dor's territory covers 77% of the country and accounted for 4,076 GWh of the wholesale market energysales during 2021. AES El Salv
ador owns and operates two solar farms, Opico Power and Moncagua with 4 MW and 3 MW capacity, respectively;AES Nejapa, a biomass power pla
nt of 6 MW capacity; and 50% of Bosforo and Cuscatlan Solar, solar farms of 100 MW and 10 MW capacity,respectively. The energy produced by these solar farms is fully contracted by AES
' utilities in El Salvador.In addition, AES El Salvador offers customers non-regulate
d services such as energy trading, electromechanical construction, O&M ofelectrical assets, EPC, pole rental, and tax collection for munici
palities.Key Financial Drivers 
— Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to: •
improved operational performance;•
variability in energy demand driven by weather; and•
the impact of fuel oil prices on energy tariff prices, which affect cash flow due to a three-month delay in the pass-through of energy costs tothe tariffs charged to customers.
Regulatory Framework and Market Structure 
— El Salvador's national electric market is composed of ge neration, distribution, transmission,and marketing businesses, a market and system operator, and regulatory agenc
ies. The operation of the transmission system and the wholesalemarket is based on production costs with a marginal economic mod
el that rewards efficiency and allows investors to have guaranteed profits, whileend users receive affordable rates. The energy sector is governed by the Genera
l Electricity Law, which establishes two regulatory entitiesresponsible for monitoring its compliance:
•
The National Energy Council is the highest authority on energy policy and strategy, and the coordinating body for the different energysectors. One of its main objectives is to promote investment in non-conventional rene
wable sources to diversify the energy matrix.•
The General Superintendence of Electricity and Telecommunications regulates the market and sets consumer prices, and, jointly with thedistribution companies in El Salv
ador, developed the tariff calculation applicable from 2018 until 2022. The next tariff calculation isscheduled for 2022, and will be effective starting i
n 2023.
23 | 2021 Annual ReportEl Salvador has a national el
ectric grid that interconnects directly with Guatemala and Honduras, allowing transactions with all CentralAmerican countries. The sector has approximately 1,865 MW of installed cap
acity, composed of thermal (47%), hydroelectric (30%), solar (11%),biomass (9%), and wind (3%) generation plants.
Development Strategy 
— In order to explore new business opportunities, AES E l Salvador created AES Soluciones, an LED public lightingservice provider and the main commercial and industria
l solar photovoltaic EPC provider in the country. AES Next is also the O&M services providerfor the Bosforo project.
 Furthermore, the four distribution companies operated by AES El Salvador started a modernization and digitization initiativeas part of the development, sustainability, and growth strategy of the business.

Chile
Business Description 
— In Chile, through AES Andes, we are engag ed in the generation and supply of electricity (energy and capacity) in theSEN—see 
Regulatory Framework and Market Structure below. AES Andes is the third largest generati on operator in Chile in terms of installedcapacity with 3,377 MW, excluding energy storage, and has a market share of approx
imately 12% as of December 31, 2021.AES Andes owns a diversified ge
neration portfolio in Chile in terms of geography, technology, customers, and energy resources. AES Andes'generation plants are located near the princ
ipal electricity consumption centers, including Santiago, Valparaiso, and Antofagasta. AES Andes'diverse generation portfolio provides flex
ibility for the management of contractual obligations with regulated and unregulated customers, providesbackup energy to the spot market and facilitates operations und
er a variety of market and hydrological conditions.AES Andes' Green Blend strategy aims to reduce carbon i
ntensity and incorporate renewable energy to extend our existing conventionalPPAs. This strategy de-links company's PPAs from legacy fossil resources, grows its renew
able energy portfolio, and delivers a competitive, reliableenergy solution. In line with the Green Blend strategy, AES A
ndes has committed to not build additional coal-based power plants and to advance thedevelopment of new renewable pro
jects, including the implementation of battery energy storage systems ("BESS") and other technologicalinnovations that will provide greater flexi
bility and reliability to the system.
28 | 2021 Annual ReportAES Andes currently has long-term contracts, with an average remainin
g term of approximately 9 years, with regulated distribution companiesand unregulated customers, such as mining and i
ndustrial companies. In general, these long-term contracts include pass-through mechanisms forfuel costs along with price indexations to U.S. Cons
umer Price Index ("CPI").In addition to energy payments, AES Andes also rece
ives capacity payments to compensate for availability during periods of peak demand.The grid operator, Coordinador Electrico Naci
onal ("CEN"), annually determines the capacity requirements for each power plant. The capacity priceis fixed semiannually by the Nationa
l Energy Commission and indexed to the CPI and other relevant indices.In January 2022, Inversiones Cachagua S
pA, a wholly-owned AES subsidiary in Chile, completed a tender offer for the shares of AES Andesheld by minority shareholders. Upon completi
on, AES' indirect beneficial interest in AES Andes increased from 67% to 99%. As of December 31,2021, AES owned 67% of
 AES Andes.Key Financial Drivers 
—  Hedging strategies at AES Andes limit volatility to the underlying financial drivers. In addition, financial results arelikely to be driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:
•
dry hydrology scenarios;•
forced outages;•
changes in current regulatory rulings altering the ability to pass through or recover certain costs;•
fluctuations of the Chilean peso;•
tax policy changes;•
legislation promoting renewable energy and/or more restrictive regulations on thermal generation assets; and•
market price risk when re-contracting.Regulatory Framework and Market Structure 
— The Chilean electricity industry is divide d into three business segments: generation,transmission, and distribution. Private companies op
erate in all three segments, and generators can enter into PPAs to sell energy to regulated andunregulated customers, as well as to other generators in the spot market.
Chile operates in a single po
wer market, referred to as the SEN, which is managed by the grid operator CEN. The SEN has an installedcapacity of 27,819 MW, and represents 99% of the installed generatio
n capacity of the country.CEN coordinates all generatio
n and transmission companies in the SEN. CEN minimizes the operating costs of the electricity system, whilemaximizing service quality and reliab
ility requirements. CEN dispatches plants in merit order based on their variable cost of production, allowing forelectricity to be supplied at the lowest availa
ble cost. In the south-central region of the SEN, thermoelectric generation is required to fulfill demandnot satisfied by hydroelectric, solar, and wind output and is critica
l to provide reliable and dependable electricity supply under dry hydrologicalconditions in the highest demand are
a of the SEN. In the northern region of the SEN, which includes the Atacama Desert, thermoelectric capacityrepresents the majority of installed capacity. The fuels used for thermoelectric generati
on, mainly coal, diesel, and LNG, are indexed to internationalprices. In 2021, the installed generation cap
acity in the Chilean market was composed of 47% thermoelectric, 25% hydroelectric, 16% solar, 10%wind, and 2% other fuel sources.
Hydroelectric plants represent a significant portion of the system's instal
led capacity. Precipitation and snow melt impact hydrologicalconditions in Chile. Rain occ
urs principally from June to August and snow melt occurs from September to December. These factors affect dispatchof the system's hydroelectric and thermoelectric generation plants, thereby infl
uencing spot market prices.The Ministry of Energy has primary responsibility for the Chilean el
ectricity system directly or through the National Energy Commission and theSuperintendency of Electricity and Fuels.
All generators can sell energy through contracts with regu
lated distribution companies or directly to unregulated customers. Unregulatedcustomers are customers whose connected capacity is higher than 5 MW. Customers with connected ca
pacity between 0.5 MW and 5.0 MW canopt for regulated or unregulated contracts for a minimum period of four years. By law, both regulated and u
nregulated customers are required topurchase all electricity under contracts. Generators may also sell energy to other pow
er generation companies on a short-term
29 | 2021 Annual Reportbasis at negotiated prices outside the spot market. Electricity prices in Chi
le are denominated in USD, although payments are made in Chileanpesos.
The Chilean government’s decarb
onization plan includes the complete retirement of the SEN coal fleet by the end of 2040 and carbonneutrality by 2050. On December 26, 2020, the Ministry of Energy’s Supreme Decree N
umber 42 went into effect, allowing coal plants to enter intoStrategic Reserve Status (“SRS”) and receive 60% of capacity payments for the 5-year period follow
ing its shutdown to remain connected as abackup in case of a system emergency. Following the issua
nce of this regulation and per the disconnection and termination agreement signed withthe Chilean government in June 20
19, AES Andes accelerated the retirement plans of its Ventanas 1 and Ventanas 2 coal-fired units. Ventanas 1was shut down on December 29, 2020 and e
ntered into SRS. Concurrently, AES Andes requested the shutdown of Ventanas 2 as soon as possible.Ventanas 2’s shut down and transition i
nto SRS is pending resolution of current system transmission constraints in order to guarantee systemstability and ensure a responsible e
nergy transition. The CEN has indicated that the unit’s retirement into SRS would be postponed until at leastSeptember 1, 2022.
In July 2021, AES Andes committed to allow the shutdow
n of coal-fired operations at its Ventanas 3, Ventanas 4, Angamos 1, and Angamos 2units as soon as January 1, 2025, once the safety, sufficiency, and competitiven
ess of the system allows it. These four units together have aninstalled capacity of 1,095 MW. In July 2021, the Company completed the sa
le of its entire ownership interest in Guacolda, a 764 MW coal-firedplant located in Chile. Guacold
a, Ventanas, and Angamos represent an aggregate of 2.2 GW of coal-fired capacity, or 72% of AES Andes’ legacycoal fleet. Each unit has publicly ann
ounced phase-out plans in line with the Company’s decarbonization strategy. AES Andes continues to workunder the Green Blend strategy to accelerate the phase-out of the remainin
g two coal-fired plants.Environmental Regulation
 — In March 2019, a new decontamination plan for the Ventanas reg ion was approved. AES Andes hasimplemented the requirements as defined by the pla
n and is awaiting the approval of the environmental authority.Chilean law requires all e
lectricity generators to supply a certain portion of their total contractual obligations with non-conventional renewableenergy ("NCRE"). Generation companies are able to meet this requirement by bui
lding NCRE generation capacity (wind, solar, biomass,geothermal, and small hydroelectric technolo
gy) or purchasing NCREs from qualified generators. Non-compliance with the NCRE requirements willresult in fines. AES Andes currently fulfills the NCRE requ
irements by utilizing AES Andes' solar and biomass power plants and by purchasingNCREs from other generation companies. At present, AES Andes is i
n the process of negotiating additional NCRE supply contracts to meet futurerequirements.
Since 2017, emissions of particulate matter, SO
, NO , and CO  are monitored for plants with an installed capacity over 50 MW; these emissions are taxed. In the case of CO
, the tax is equivalent to $5 per ton emitted. Certain PPAs have clauses al lowing the Company to pass thegreen tax costs to unregulated customers, while some distribution PP
As do not allow for the pass through of these costs. During 2021, the ChileanGeneral Water Direction, as part of the Ministry of Public Works, established the obligation to insta
ll and maintain effective monitoring systems forwater withdrawal. We are currently implementing these systems in the power pla
nts for which they are required.Development Strategy 
— AES Andes is committed to reducing the coal intensity of the Chil ean power grid and plans to increase therenewable energy capacity in its portfolio. As part of this commitment, and in additi
on to the 531 MW hydroelectric generation that Alto Maipo willdeliver to the system, AES Andes purchased the 110 MW Los Cururos wind farm and its substatio
n in northern Chile, and has finished constructionon the 80 MW Andes 2a facility. Also under construction are the 68 MW Mesamávida win
d farm, 73 MW Campo Lindo wind farm, and 180 MWAndes Solar 2b facility, which also inc
ludes 112 MW of BESS, to supply agreements with its main mining customers in execution of the new GreenBlend strategy. In total, the pipeline currently has 3.1 GW under developme
nt at different stages and diversified geographically.On November 17, 2021, Alto Maipo SpA, the develop
er of the Alto Maipo Hydroelectric Project and subsidiary of AES Andes, filed a voluntarypetition for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. See Item 7.—

30 | 2021 Annual ReportColombia
Business Description 
— We operate in Colombia through AES Chiv or, a subsidiary of AES Andes, which owns a hydroelectric plant with aninstalled capacity of 1,000 MW and Tunjita, a 20 MW run-of-river hydroelectric plant, both locate
d approximately 160 km east of Bogota, as well asCastilla and San Fernando, 21 MW and 61 MW respectively, both so
lar facilities. AES Chivor’s installed capacity accounted for approximately 6% ofsystem capacity at the end of 2021. AES Chivor is depende
nt on hydrological conditions, which influence generation and spot prices of non-contracted generation in Colombia.
AES Chivor's commercial strategy aims to execute contracts with commercial and industria
l customers and bid in public tenders, mainly withdistribution companies, in order to reduce margin volati
lity with proper portfolio risk management. The remaining energy generated by our portfolio issold to the spot market, including ancillary services. Additi
onally, AES Chivor receives reliability payments for maintaining the plant's availability andgenerating firm energy during periods of power scarcity, such as adverse hy
drological conditions, in order to prevent power shortages.Key Financial Drivers 
— Hydrological conditions larg ely influence Chivor's power generation. Maintaining the appropriate contract level, whilemaximizing revenue through the sale of excess gen
eration, is key to Chivor's results of operations. In addition to hydrology, financial results aredriven by many factors, including, but not limited to:
•
forced outages;•
fluctuations of the Colombian peso; and•
spot market prices.Regulatory Framework and Market Structure 
— Electricity supply in Colombia is concentrated i n one main system, the SIN, whichencompasses one-third of Colombia's territory, providing e
lectricity to 97% of the country's population. The SIN's installed capacity, primarilyhydroelectric (68%) and thermal (30%), totaled 17,563 MW as of December 31, 2021. The marked seasona
l variations in Colombia's hydrologyresult in price volatility in the short-term market. In 2021, 82% of total energy demand was supplied by hy
droelectric plants.The electricity sector in Colombia operates under a competitiv
e market framework for the generation and sale of electricity, and a regulatedframework for transmission and distribution of electricity. The distinct activities of the electricity sector are governed by Co
lombian laws and CREG,the Colombian regulating entity for energy an
d gas. Other government entities have a role in the electricity industry, including the Ministry of Minesand Energy, which defines the government's p
olicy for the energy sector; the Public Utility Superintendency of Colombia, which is in charge ofoverseeing utility companies; and the Mini
ng and Energy Planning Unit, which is in charge of expansion of the generation and transmission network.The generation sector is organized on a competitiv
e basis with companies selling their generation in the wholesale market at the short-termprice or under bilateral contracts with other participants, includ
ing distribution companies, generators and traders, and unregulated customers atfreely negotiated prices. The National Dis
patch Center dispatches generators in merit order based on bid offers in order to ensure that demand willbe satisfied by the lowest cost combination of availa
ble generating units.The expansion of the system is supported by two schemes: i) reliability charg
e auctions where firm energy commitments are focused onconventional technology p
ower plants, and ii) auctions of long-term energy contracts assigned for periods of 15 years aimed at non-conventionalrenewable resources.
Development Strategy 
— AES Colombia is committed to transform into a renewable growth platform by supporting its customers to diversify their energy supply and become more competitive. As part of this commitment, AES Colombia is dev
eloping a pipeline of 1.3 GW of solar and windprojects. Six projects (1,149 MW) of wind energy are located in La Guajira, one of the win
diest spots on Earth, and two projects (255 MW) wereawarded a 15-year PPA at the last renewable a
uction in 2019. One project (99 MW) of the Wind Cluster has Environmental License and theEnvironmental Impact Assessment for 308 MW was submitted in August 2021, and the other projects conti
nue to progress. During 2021 theCompany also was awarded a 26 MW solar project through a 1
5-year PPA and will start construction early 2022. Solar projects have beenfundamental in leading the rene
wable market in Colombia.Argentina
Business Description 
— AES operates plants in Argentina totalin g 4,220 MW, representing 10% of the
31 | 2021 Annual Reportcountry's total installed capacity. AES owns a div
ersified generation portfolio in Argentina in terms of geography, technology, and fuel source. AESArgentina's plants are placed in strategic l
ocations within the country in order to provide energy to the spot market and customers, making use ofwind, hydro, and thermal plants.
AES primarily sells its energy in the wholesa
le electricity market where prices are largely regulated. In 2020, approximately 86% of the energywas sold in the wholesale el
ectricity market and 14% was sold under contract sales made by TermoAndes, Vientos Neuquinos, and VientosBonaerenses power plants.
Key Financial Drivers 
— Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to: •
forced outages;•
exposure to fluctuations of the Argentine peso;•
changes in hydrology and wind resources;•
timely collection of FONINVEMEM installments and outstanding receivables (see Regulatory Framework and Market Structure below); •
natural gas prices and availability for contracted generation at TermoAndes; and•
domestic energy demand and exports.Regulatory Framework and Market Structure 
— Argentina has one main power system, the SADI, which serves 96% of the country. As of December 31, 2021, the installed capacity of the SADI totale
d 42,989 MW. The SADI's installed capacity is composed primarily of thermoelectricgeneration (60%) and hydroelectric generati
on (26%), as well as wind (8%), nuclear (4%), and solar (2%).Thermoelectric generation in the SADI is primarily natural g
as. However, scarcity of natural gas during winter periods (June to August) due totransport constraints result in the use of alternative fuels, such as oil and coal. The SA
DI is also highly reliant on hydroelectric plants. Hydrologicalconditions impact reservoir water levels and large
ly influence the dispatch of the system's hydroelectric and thermoelectric generation plants and,therefore, influence market costs. Precipitation in Argentina occurs princi
pally from May to October.The Argentine regulatory framework divides the electricity sector into ge
neration, transmission, and distribution. The wholesale electric marketis comprised of generation companies, transmission compa
nies, distribution companies, and large customers who are permitted to trade electricity.Generation companies can sell their output in the sp
ot market or under PPAs. CAMMESA manages the electricity market and is responsible fordispatch coordination. The Electricity Natio
nal Regulatory Agency is in charge of regulating public service activities and the Secretariat of Energyregulates system framework and grants concessions or authorizations for sector activities. In Argentina, there is a toll
ing scheme in which theregulator establishes prices for electricity and defines fue
l reference prices. As a result, our businesses are particularly sensitive to changes inregulation.
The Argentine electric market is an "average cost" system. Generators are compensated for fixed costs and non-fuel variabl
e costs, underprices denominated in Argentine p
esos. CAMMESA is in charge of providing the natural gas and liquid fuels required by the generation companies,except for coal.
During 2021, although the governme
nt increased prices to the end user, subsidies and the system deficit also increased. By December 2021,distribution companies recovered an avera
ge 37% of the total cost of the system.AES Argentina contributed certain accou
nts receivable to fund the construction of new power plants under FONINVEMEM agreements. Thesereceivables accrue interest and have bee
n collected in monthly installments over 10 years after commercial operation date of the related plant tookplace. AES Argentina participated i
n the construction of three power plants under the FONINVEMEM structure, and in addition to the repayment ofthe accounts receivable contributed, AES Arge
ntina will receive a pro rata ownership interest in each of these plants once the accounts receivableshave been fully repaid. FONINVEMEM I and II installments were fully repai
d in the first quarter of 2020 and in 2021 the ownership interests inTermoeléctrica San Martín and Termoeléctrica Manuel Belgran
o were defined after the incorporation of the National Government as majorityshareholder. The transfer of the property of the power plants to these companies has not occured yet. FONINVEMEM III installments, related to
Termoeléctrica Guillermo Brown which commenced op
erations in April 2016, are still being collected. See Item 7.—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Cond
ition and Results of Operations—Capital Resources and Liquidity—Long-Term Receivables and Note 7. — FinancingReceivables
 in Item 8.— Financial Statements  and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K  for further discussion of receivables in Argentina.In 2020 and 2021, the Argentine peso d
evalued against the USD by approximately 29% and 18%, respectively, and Argentina’s economycontinued to be highly inflatio
nary. Since September 2019, currency controls

evaluation of the Argentine peso and keep Argentine central bank reserves at acceptable levels for the nextgovernment of Argentina
. Development Strategy 
— Currently, 890 MW of renewable greenfield projects are in early an d mid stages of development. These projectscould be used to participate in future private PPAs or pub
lic auctions. In addition, "behind the meter” and off-grid solutions are being developed forthe industrial mining sector.
Brazil
Business Description 
— AES Brasil has a portfolio of 12 hydroelectric power pl ants in the state of São Paulo with total installed capacity of2,658 MW. These hydroelectric plants operate under a 33-year concess
ion expiring in 2032.Over the past three years, AES Brasil acquired and develop
ed three solar power complexes in the state of São Paulo, which are fullycontracted with 20-year PPAs and together account for 295 MW of installed cap
acity. AES Brasil represents approximately 11% of the totalgeneration capacity in the state of São Paulo.
AES Brasil also owns Alto Sertão II, a wind complex loc
ated in the state of Bahia with an installed capacity of 386 MW and subject to 20-yearPPAs expiring between 203
3 and 2035, and in December 2020, also acquired the Ventus wind complex located in the state of Rio Grande do Nortewith an installed capacity of 187 MW and subject to a 20-year PP
A expiring in 2034.In April 2021, AES Brasil acquired Mand
acaru and Salinas (formerly MS Wind and Santos Wind Complexes, respectively), located in thestates of Rio Grande do Norte and Ceará, in the northeast region of Brazil. The compl
exes have been operational since 2014 with 159 MW ofinstalled capacity, fully sold in the regul
ated market for 20 years.In the second half of 2020, AES acquired an ad
ditional 19.8% ownership in AES Brasil and on December 31, 2020 its economic interest was44.1%. Through multiple transactions in 2021, AE
S acquired an additional 1.6% ownership in AES Brasil. Additionally, AES migrated AES Brasil'sshares to the Novo Mercado, which is a listing segment of the Brazilia
n stock exchange with the highest standards of corporate governance inBrazil, requiring equity capital to be compose
d only of common shares. The reorganization and the exchange of shares was completed on March26, 2021, and the shares issued by AES Brasil started tradin
g on Novo Mercado on March 29, 2021. The Company maintained majorityrepresentation on AES Brasil’s board of directors.
On October 1, 2021, as part of the reorganization process, AES Brasil conclude
d a follow-on offering for the issuance of 93,000,000 newlyissued shares to fund its renewable energy portfoli
o at a cost of $207 million. As a result, AES' indirect beneficial interest in AES Brasil increased1%, from 45.7% to 46.7%. As of December 31, 2021, AES owned 47% of AES Brasil and is the control
ling shareholder. The Company consolidatesAES Brasil's results in the South America SBU reportab
le segment.AES Brasil aims to contract most of its physical guarantee requirements and sell the remai
ning portion in the spot market. The commercialstrategy is reassessed periodically accordin
g to changes in market conditions, hydrology, and other factors. AES Brasil generally sells availableenergy through medium-term bilateral contracts.
Key Financial Drivers 
— The electricity market in Brazil is highly depende nt on hydroelectric generation, therefore electricity pricing is drivenby hydrology. Plant availabil
ity is also a significant financial driver as in times of high hydrology, AES is more exposed to the spot market. AESBrasil's financial results are driven by many factors, includi
ng, but not limited to:•
hydrology, impacting quantity of energy generated in the MRE (see Regulatory Framework and Market Structure below for fur therinformation);
•
growth in demand for energy;•
market price risk when re-contracting;•
asset management;•
cost management; and•
ability to execute on its growth strategy.Regulatory Framework and Market Structure 
— In Brazil, the Ministry of Mines and Energy determines the maximum amount of energy a generation plant can sell, calle
d physical guarantee, representing the long-term average expected energy production of the plant. Under currentrules, physical guarantee energy can be so
ld to distribution companies through long-term regulated auctions or under unregulated bilateral contractswith large

33 | 2021 Annual Reportconsumers or energy trading companies.
Brazil has installed capacity of 184 GW, composed of hydroel
ectric (60%), thermoelectric (25%), renewable (14%), and nuclear (1%) sources.Operation is centralized and controlled by the n
ational operator, ONS, and regulated by the Brazilian National Electric Energy Agency ("ANEEL").The ONS dispatches generators based on their margin
al cost of production and on the risk of system rationing. Key variables for the dispatchdecision are forecasted hydrologica
l conditions, reservoir levels, electricity demand, fuel prices, and thermal generation availability.In case of unfavorable hydrology, the ONS will reduce hy
droelectric dispatch to preserve reservoir levels and increase dispatch of thermalplants to meet demand. The consequences of unfavorab
le hydrology are (i) higher energy spot prices due to higher energy production costs atthermal plants and (ii) the need for hydro plants to purchase energy in the sp
ot market to fulfill their contractual obligations.A mechanism known as the MRE was created under ONS to share hydrolo
gical risk across MRE hydro generators by using a generationscaling factor ("GSF") to adjust generators' physical guarantee during p
eriods of hydrological scarcity. If the hydro plants generate less than the totalMRE physical guarantee, the hydro generators may need to purch
ase energy in the short-term market. When total hydro generation is higher thanthe total MRE physical guarantee, the surplus is proportion
ally shared among its participants and they may sell the excess energy on the spotmarket.
In September 2020, Law 14.052/2020 pu
blished by ANEEL was approved by the President, establishing terms for compensation to MREhydro generators for the incorrect application of the GSF mechanism from 2013 to 2018, which resu
lted in higher charges assessed to MRE hydrogenerators by the regulator. Under the law, compensation was i
n the form of an offer for a concession extension for each hydro generator inexchange for full payment of billed GSF trade payabl
es, the amount of which was reduced in conjunction with the payment for a concessionextension. On August 12, 2021, ANEEL pub
lished Resolution number 2.919/2021, establishing an extension for the end of the concession originallygranted to AES Brasil's hydroelectric plants, from 2029 to 2032
. Development Strategy 
— AES Brasil's strategy is to grow by adding renewab le capacity to its generation platform through acquisition orgreenfield projects, to focus on client satisfaction and in
novation to offer new products and energy solutions, and to be recognized for excellence inasset management.
On May 21, 2021, AES Brasil acquired the Cajuína Win
d Complex phase I (Santa Tereza with installed capacity of 420 MW) and on July 29,2021, AES Brasil acquired phas
e II (São Ricardo with installed capacity of 437 MW). The two complexes are greenfield wind power projects in thestates of Rio Grande do Norte and Ceará with potential insta
lled capacity up to 1.2 GW total. Of this total capacity, 211 MW is committed with long-term PPAs signed in February 2021 with Ferbasa (165 MW) and Minasl
iga (46 MW), for energy supply over a period of 20 years beginning in 2024and 2023, respectively. Additiona
lly, on August 16, 2021, AES Brasil signed an investment agreement with BRF to develop a project of 160 MWthrough a joint venture partnership, of which 80 MW will be fulfil
led through a 15-year PPA starting in 2024.On July 19, 2021, AES Brasil acquired the Serra Verde pro
ject, which complements the Cajuína Complex mentioned above. This project has279 MW of installable capacity of greenfield wi
nd power in the state of Rio Grande do Norte. A 13-year PPA was signed with Copel for 11 MW,starting in 2023.
On October 26, 2021, AES Brasil signed a 15-year PPA with A
lcoa for 150 MW, starting in 2024. AES Brasil is seeking long-term PPAs to fulfillthe remaining installed capacity at the Caj
uína Complex.On December 22, 2021, AES Tucano Holdi
ng I S.A., a subsidiary of AES Brasil, signed an investment agreement with Unipar Indupa do BrasilS.A. ("Unipar"), to develop a project of 40 MW through a joint venture partnership, with a 19-year PPA starting in 20
24.On December 28, 2021, AES Brasil acquired Sky Arin
os, a solar project with installable capacity of 459 MW, in the city of Arinos in the state ofMinas Gerais.
Under the current terms of the 2018 legal agreement in connection w
ith AES Brasil's concession with the state government, AES Brasil isrequired to increase its capacity in the state of São Paulo by an a
dditional 81 MW by October 2024. On November 30, 2021 AES Brasil acquiredAGV Solar VII Geradora de Energia S.A, a special purpose e
ntity with installable capacity of 33 MW of solar generation. AES Brasil continues topursue new opportunities to achieve the a
dditional capacity.

Dominican Republic
Business Description 
— AES Dominicana consists of three operating subs idiaries: Andres, Los Mina, and Bayasol. With a total of 747 MW ofinstalled capacity, AES provides 14% of the cou
ntry's capacity and supplies approximately 22% of the country's energy demand via thesegeneration facilities. 668 MW is predominantly contracted u
ntil 2022 with government-owned distribution companies and large customers.AES has a strategic partnership with the Estrella and Li
nda Groups ("Estrella-Linda"), a consortium of two leading Dominican industrial groupsthat manage a diversified business portfolio.
Andres, Los Mina, and Bayasol are owned 8
5% by AES. Andres owns and operates a combined cycle natural gas turbine and an energystorage facility with combined generation ca
pacity of 329 MW, as well as the only LNG import terminal in the country, with 160,000 cubic meters ofstorage capacity. Los Mina owns and operates a combin
ed cycle facility with two natural gas turbines and an energy storage facility with combinedgeneration capacity of 368 MW. Bayasol owns and o
perates a 50 MW solar farm.AES Dominicana has a long-term LNG purchase co
ntract through 2023 for 33.6 trillion btu/year with a price linked to NYMEX Henry Hub. TheLNG contract terms allow delivery to various markets in Latin America. These plants capital
ize on the competitively-priced LNG contract by sellingpower where the market is dominated by fuel oil-based g
eneration. Andres has a long-term contract to sell regasified LNG to industrial users withinthe Dominican Republic usi
ng compression technology to transport it within the country, thereby capturing demand from industrial and commercialcustomers.
Key Financial Drivers 
— Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to: •
changes in spot prices due to fluctuations in commodity prices (since fuel is a pass-through cost under the PPAs, any variation in oil priceswill impact spot sales for Andres);
•
contracting levels and the extent of capacity awarded; and
37 | 2021 Annual Report•
growth in domestic natural gas demand, supported by new infrastructure such as the Eastern Pipeline and second LNG tank.Regulatory Framework and Market Structure 
— The Dominican Republic en ergy market is a decentralized industry consisting of generation,transmission, and distribution businesses. Generati
on companies can earn revenue through short- and long-term PPAs, ancillary services, and acompetitive wholesale generati
on market. All generation, transmission, and distribution companies are subject to and regulated by the GeneralElectricity Law.
Two main agencies are responsibl
e for monitoring compliance with the General Electricity Law:•
The National Energy Commission drafts and coordinates the legal framework and regulatory legislation. They propose and adopt policiesand procedures to implement best practices, support the proper functionin
g and development of the energy sector, and promote investment.•
The Superintendence of Electricity's main responsibilities include monitoring compliance with legal provisions, rules, and technicalprocedures governing generatio
n, transmission, distribution, and commercialization of electricity. They monitor behavior in the electricitymarket in order to prevent monopolistic practices.
In addition to the two agencies responsib
le for monitoring compliance with the General Electricity Law, the Ministry of Industry and Commercesupervises commercial and industrial activities i
n the Dominican Republic as well as the fuels and natural gas commercialization to end users.The Dominican Republic h
as one main interconnected system with 5,027 MW of installed capacity, composed of thermal (74%), hydroelectric(12%), wind (7%), and solar (7%).
Development Strategy 
— AES will continue to develop the commercia lization of natural gas and incorporate partners directly in gasinfrastructure projects. AES partnered with Energas in a joint venture wh
ich has been operating the 50 km Eastern Pipeline since February 2020.The joint venture is also developi
ng a new LNG facility of 120,000 cubic meters, including additional storage, regasification, and truck loadingcapacity, for which the COD is expected by 2023. This will al
low AES to reach new customers who have converted, or are in the process ofconverting, to natural gas as a fuel source, and better operational flex
ibility.Panama
Business Description 
— AES owns and operates five hydroelectric pla nts totaling 705 MW of generation capacity, a natural gas-fired powerplant with 381 MW of generation capacity, a wind farm of 55 MW and four solar plants of 10 MW each, which collectiv
ely represent 31% of the totalinstalled capacity in Panama. Furthermore, AES operates a
n LNG regasification facility, a 180,000 cubic meter storage tank, and a truck loadingfacility.
The majority of our hydroelectric plants in Panama are based o
n run-of-the-river technology, with the exception of 223 MW Changuinola plantwith regulation reservoirs and the 260 MW Bayano pl
ant. Hydrological conditions have an important influence on profitability. Variations in hydrologycan result in an excess or a shortfall in energy production relativ
e to our contractual obligations. Hydro generation is generally in a shortfall positionduring the dry season from January through May, which is offset by thermal and wind gen
eration since its behavior is opposite and complementaryto hydro generation.
Our hydro and thermal assets are mainly contracted through medium to long-term PPAs with distributio
n companies. A small volume of ourhydro plants are contracted with unregulated users. Our hydro assets in Pan
ama have PPAs with distribution companies expiring up to December2030 for a total contracted capacity of 377 MW. Our thermal asset in Panama has PPAs with distribution compa
nies for a total contracted capacityof 350 MW expiring in August 2028.
Key Financial Drivers 
— Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to: •
changes in hydrology, which impacts commodity prices and exposes the business to variability in the cost of replacement power;•
fluctuations in commodity prices, mainly oil and natural gas, which affect the cost of thermal generation and spot prices;•
constraints imposed by the capacity of transmission lines connecting the west side of the country with the load, keeping surplus powertrapped during the rainy season; and
•
country demand as GDP growth is expected to remain strong over the short and medium term.
38 | 2021 Annual ReportRegulatory Framework and Market Structure 
— The Panamanian power sector is composed of three distinct op erating business units:generation, distribution, and transmission. Generators can enter into sh
ort-term and long-term PPAs with distributors or unregulated consumers. Inaddition, generators can enter into alternative sup
ply contracts with each other. Outside of PPAs, generators may buy and sell energy in the short-term market. Generators can only contract up to their firm capacity.
Three main agencies are responsibl
e for monitoring compliance with the General Electricity Law:•
The National Secretary of Energy in Panama ("SNE") has the responsibilities of planning, supervising, and controlling policies of the energysector within Panama. The SNE proposes laws a
nd regulations to the executive agencies that regulate the procurement of energy andhydrocarbons for the country.
•
The National Authority of Public Services ("ASEP") is an autonomous agency of the government. ASEP is responsible for the control andoversight of public services in Panama, inclu
ding electricity, the transmission and distribution of natural gas utilities, and the companies thatprovide such services.
•
The National Dispatch Center ("CND") implements the economic dispatch of electricity in the wholesale market. The National DispatchCenter's objectives are to minimize the total cost of generation and mai
ntain the reliability and security of the electric power system. Short-term power prices are determined on an hourly basis by the last dispatch
ed generating unit. Physical generation of energy is determined bythe National Dispatch Center regardless of contractua
l arrangements.Panama's current total installed capacity is 3,849 MW, composed of hydroe
lectric (46%), thermal (37%), wind (7%), and solar (10%)generation.
Development Strategy 
— Given our LNG facility’s excess capacity in Panama, the company is deve loping natural gas supply solutions for thirdparties such as power generators and industrial a
nd commercial customers. This strategy will support a growing demand for natural gas in theregion and will contribute to AES' missi
on by reducing CO emissions as a result of using LNG. In addition to investing in LNG infrastructure, AES is investing i
n renewable projects within the region. This will increase complementary non-hydro renewable assets in the system and contribute to the reduction of hydro
logical risk in Panama.Mexico
Business Description 
— AES has 1,361 MW of installed capacity in Mexico. The TEG and TEP pet coke-fired p lants, located in Tamuin, SanLuis Potosi, supply power to their offtakers under long-term PPAs expirin
g in 2027 with a 90% availability guarantee. TEG and TEP secure their fuelunder a long-term contract.
Merida is a CCGT located on Mexico's Yucatan Pen
insula. Merida sells power to the CFE under a capacity and energy based long-term PPAthrough 2025. Additionally, the pl
ant purchases natural gas and diesel fuel under a long-term contract with one of the CFE’s subsidiaries, the cost ofwhich is then passed through to the CFE under the terms of the PPA.
Mesa La Paz is a 306 MW wind project developed u
nder a joint venture with Grupo Bal, located in Llera, Tamaulipas. Mesa La Paz sells 82%of its power under long-term PPAs expiring up to 2045.
Key Financial Drivers 
— Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to: •
fully contracting the companies, providing additional benefits from improved operational performance, including performance incentivesand/or excess energy sales;
•
changes in the methodology to calculate spot energy prices or Locational Marginal Prices, which impacts the excess energy sales to theCFE (see 
Regulatory Framework and Market Structure  below) in (i) TEG and TEP under self-supply scheme, and (ii) Mesa La Paz un derthe New Market Rules; and
•
improved operational performance and plant availability.Regulatory Framework and Market Structure 
— Mexico´s main electrical system is called the National Interconn ected System ("SIN"), whichgeographically covers an area from Puerto Peñasc
o, Sonora to Cozumel, Quintana Roo. Mexico also has three isolated electrical systems: (1) theBaja California Interconnected System, which is i
nterconnected with the WECC; (2) the Baja California Sur Interconnected System; and (3) theMulegé Interconnected System, a very small electrical system. All three are isolated from the SIN and from each other. 
The Mexican power industry comprises the activities of generation, transmission, distribution, and commercia
lization segments, considering transmission and distribution to beexclusive state services.

39 | 2021 Annual ReportIn addition to the Ministry of Energy, three main agencies are responsib
le for regulating the market agents and their activities, monitoringcompliance with the Electric Industry Law and the Market Rules, and the surve
illance of operational compliance and management of the wholesaleelectricity market:
•
The Energy Regulatory Commission is responsible for the establishment of directives, orders, methodologies, and standards to regulate theelectric and fuel markets, as well as granting permits.
•
The National Center for Energy Control, as an ISO, is responsible for managing the wholesale electricity market, transmission anddistribution infrastructure, planning network deve
lopments, guaranteeing open access to network infrastructure, executing competitivemechanisms to cover regulated demand, and setting transmission ch
arges.•
The Electricity Federal Commission ("CFE") owns the transmission and distribution grids and is also the country's basic supplier. CFE is theofftaker for IPP generators, and together with its own power units has more than 50% of the current generation market share.
Mexico has an installed capacity totalin
g 89 GW with a generation mix composed of thermal (63%), hydroelectric (14%), wind (9%), solar (8%),and other fuel sources (6%).

1% interest in the Mong Duong 2 plant. The sale is expected to close inin early 2023, subject to customary approval from the Government of Vietnam.
Key Financial Drivers 
— Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to, the operati ng performance and availability ofthe facility.
Regulatory Framework and Market Structure 
— The Ministry of Industry and Trade in Vietnam is primarily responsible for formulating a program to restructure the power industry, developing the electricity market, and promulgating e
lectricity market regulations. The fuel supply isowned by the government through Vinacomi
n, a state-owned entity, and PetroVietnam.The Vietnam power market is divided into three regions (North, Central, an
d South), with total installed capacity of approximately 75 GW. Thefuel mix in Vietnam is composed primarily of coal (32%), hydropower (29%) and rene
wables, including solar and wind (27%). EVN, the nationalutility, owns 39% of installed generation ca
pacity.The government is in the process of realigning EV
N-owned companies into three different independent operations in order to create acompetitive power market. The first stage of this realignment was the implementation of the Competitive El
ectricity Market, which has been inoperation since 2012. The second stag
e was the introduction of the Electricity Wholesale Market, which has been in operation since the beginning of2019. The third and final stage impacts the Electricity Retail Market, which w
ill undergo similar reforms after 2022. BOT power
43 | 2021 Annual Reportplants will not directly participate in the pow
er market; alternatively, a single buyer will bid the tariff on the power pool on their behalf.Development Strategy 
— In Vietnam, we continue to advance the developme nt of our Son My LNG terminal project, which has a designcapacity of up to 9.6 million metric tonnes per annum, and the Son My 2 CCGT project, which has a ca
pacity of about 2,250 MW. In October 2019,we received formal approval as a government-mandated i
nvestor in the Son My LNG terminal project in partnership with PetroVietnam Gas and inSeptember 2021, we signed the joint venture a
greement with PetroVietnam Gas. In September 2019, we received formal approval as thegovernment-mandated investor with 100% equity ow

Business Description 
— Our AES Maritza plant is a 690 MW lignite fuel thermal power plant. AES Maritza's entire pow er output is contractedwith NEK, the state-owned public electricity supp
lier, independent energy producer, and trading company. Maritza is contracted under a 15-yearPPA that expires in May 2026. AES Maritza has been coll
ecting receivables from NEK in a timely manner since 2016. However, NEK's liquidityposition remains subject to political con
ditions and regulatory changes in Bulgaria.The DG Comp is reviewing NEK’s PPA with A
ES Maritza pursuant to the European Union’s state aid rules. AES Maritza believes that its PPAis legal and in compliance w
ith all applicable laws. For additional details see Key Trends and Uncertainties  in Item 7.— Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Co
ndition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K . AES also owns an 89% economic interest in the St. Niko
la wind farm with 156 MW of installed capacity. The power output of St. Nikola is soldto customers operating on the liberalized electricity market and the pl
ant receives additional revenue per the terms of an October 2018 Contract forPremium with the state-owned Electricity Security Fund.
Key Financial Drivers 
—  Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:•
regulatory changes in the Bulgarian power market;•
results of the DG Comp review;•
availability and load factor of the operating units;•
the level of wind resources for St. Nikola;•
spot market price volatility beyond the level of compensation through the Contract for Premium for St. Nikola; and•
NEK's ability to meet the payment terms of the PPA contract with Maritza.Regulatory Framework and Market Structure 
— The electricity sector in Bulgaria allows both regu lated and competitive segments. In itscapacity as the public provider of electricity, NEK acts as a single b
uyer and seller for all regulated transactions on the market. Electricity outside theregulated market trades on one of the platforms of the Independent Bulgari
an Electricity Exchange day-ahead market, intra-day market, or bilateralcontracts market. Bulgaria is working with the European Commissio
n on the implementation of a model that allows for a gradual phase-out ofregulated energy prices.
Bulgaria’s power sector is supported by a diverse g
eneration mix, universal access to the grid, and numerous cross-border connections withneighboring countries. In additio
n, it plays an important role in the energy balance in the Balkan region.Bulgaria has 13 GW of installed capacity ena
bling the country to meet and exceed domestic demand and export energy. Installed capacity isprimarily thermal (45%), hydro (25%), and nuclear (16%).
Environmental Regulation 
— In 2017, new EU environmental standards were en acted that regulate emissions from the combustion of solidfuels for large combustion plants, known as the Best Availa
ble Techniques Reference Document for Large Combustion Plants, which applies to AESMaritza. AES Maritza was granted a derogation with respect to some requirements of these standards. Formal decis
ion for the preliminary executionof that derogation was made by the Bulgarian env
ironmental authorities in February 2021 and is in full force and effect.
44 | 2021 Annual ReportIn July 2020, the EU approved the Next Generation EU ("NGEU") recovery instrument, which aims at mitigating the ec
onomic and socialimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic and making Europea
n economies and societies more sustainable. The main funding component of NGEU is theEU’s Recovery and Resilienc
e Facility ("RRF"). In October 2021, Bulgaria submitted its Recovery and Resilience Plan ("RRP") to the EuropeanCommission to describe the reforms and investments which Bulgari
a wishes to make with the support of the RRF. In its RRP, Bulgaria proposes acoal phase-out plan aiming at retiring coa
l-fired power plants by 2038. Such coal phase-out plan is subject to negotiation with the EuropeanCommission, and subsequent approva
l by the Bulgarian Parliament.To date, there are no EU or Bulgarian regulations that limit the ab
ility of AES Maritza to operate.Jordan

The Company faces certain risks and uncertainties related to numero
us environmental laws and regulations, including existing and potentialGHG legislation or regulations, and actual or pote
ntial laws and regulations pertaining to water discharges, waste management (including disposal ofcoal combustion residuals), and certain air emissio
ns, such as SO, NO , particulate matter, mercury, and other hazardous air pollutants. Such risks and
2X 
47 | 2021 Annual Reportuncertainties could result in increased ca
pital expenditures or other compliance costs which could have a material adverse effect on certain of ourU.S. or international subsidiaries, and our cons
olidated results of operations. For further information about these risks, see Item 1A.—Risk Factors
— Our operations are subject to significant government regulation and could be adversely affected by changes in the law or regulatoryschemes; Several of our businesses are subject to potential
ly significant remediation expenses, enforcement initiatives, private party lawsuits andreputational risk associated with CCR; Our business
es are subject to stringent environmental laws, rules and regulations; and  Concerns about GHGemissions and the potential risks associated w
ith climate change have led to increased regulation and other actions that could impact ourbusinesses
 in this Form 10-K. For a discussion of the laws and regulations of indiv idual countries within each SBU where our subsidiaries operate,see discussion within Item 1.—
Business  of this Form 10-K under the applicable SBUs. Many of the countries in which the Company does busi
ness have laws and regulations relating to the siting, construction, permitting,ownership, operation, modification, repair an
d decommissioning of, and power sales from electric power generation or distribution assets. Inaddition, international projects fund
ed by the International Finance Corporation, the private sector lending arm of the World Bank, or many otherinternational lenders are subject to World Bank e
nvironmental standards or similar standards, which tend to be more stringent than local countrystandards. The Company often has used advance
d generation technologies in order to minimize environmental impacts, such as combined fluidizedbed boilers and advanced g
as turbines, and environmental control devices such as flue gas desulphurization for SO emissions and selective catalytic reduction for NO
 emissions. Environmental laws and regulati
ons affecting electric power generation and distribution facilities are complex, change frequently, and havebecome more stringent over time. The Company has incurred and will co
ntinue to incur capital costs and other expenditures to comply with theseenvironmental laws and regulati
ons. The Company may be required to make significant capital or other expenditures to comply with theseregulations. There can be no assurance that the busi
nesses operated by the subsidiaries of the Company will be able to recover any of thesecompliance costs from their counterparties or customers such that the Company's consolidate
d results of operations, financial condition, and cashflows would not be materially affected.
Various licenses, permits, and approvals are require
d for our operations. Failure to comply with permits or approvals, or with environmentallaws, can result in fines, penalties, capital expe
nditures, interruptions, or changes to our operations. Certain subsidiaries of the Company are subjectto litigation or regulatory action relating to environme
ntal permits or approvals. See Item 3.— Legal Proceedings in this Form 10-K for more detail with respect to environmental litigation and reg
ulatory action.United States Env
ironmental and Land-Use Legislation and RegulationsIn the United States, the CAA and various state laws and regul
ations regulate emissions of SO, NO , particulate matter, GHGs, mercury, and other hazardous air pollutants. Certain appl
icable rules are discussed in further detail below.CSAPR — 
CSAPR addresses the "good neig hbor" provision of the CAA, which prohibits sources within each state from emitting any airpollutant in an amount which wil
l contribute significantly to any other state’s nonattainment of, or interference with maintenance of, any NAAQS. TheCSAPR required significan
t reductions in SO and NO  emissions from power plants in many states in which subsidiari es of the Company operate.The Company is required to comply with the CSAPR i
n several states, including Ohio, Indiana, and Maryland. The CSAPR is implemented in partthrough a market-based program under which complianc
e may be achievable through the acquisition and use of emissions allowances created bythe EPA. The Company complies with CSAP
R through operation of existing controls and purchases of allowances on the open market, as needed.On October 26, 2016, the EPA published a final rule to up
date the CSAPR to address the 2008 ozone NAAQS ("CSAPR Update Rule"). TheCSAPR Update Rule finds that NO
 ozone season emissions in 22 states (includ ing Indiana, Maryland, and Ohio) affect the ability of downwindstates to attain and maintain the 2008 ozone NAAQS, an
d, accordingly, the EPA issued federal implementation plans that both updated existingCSAPR NO
 ozone season emission budgets for electric gen erating units within these states and implemented these budgets through modificationsto the CSAPR NO
 ozone season allowance tradi ng program. Implementation started in the 2017 ozone season (May-September 2017). Affectedfacilities began to receive fewer ozone seas
on NO allowances in 2017, resulting i n the need to purchase additional allowances. Additionally, onSeptember 13, 2019, the D.C. Circuit remanded a portion of the CSAPR U
pdate Rule to the EPA. On October 30, 2020, the EPA issued a proposedrule addressing 21 states’ (includin

48 | 2021 Annual Report2008 ozone NAAQS. On April 30, 2021, the EPA p
ublished a final rule to address the 2020 D.C. Circuit decision. The EPA is issuing new oramended federal implementation pl
ans for 12 states, including Indiana, Maryland, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, with revised CSAPR NO ozone season emission budgets for electric generating units with
in these states via a new CSAPR NO Ozone Season Group 3 Trading Program. Implementation began during the 2021 ozon
e season (May-September 2021) with an effective date of June 29, 2021. AES Indiana facilities and AES Warrior Run inMaryland will receive
 fewer ozone season NO allowances for future NO  ozone seasons beginnin g in 2021 and later, possibly resulting in the needto purchase additional allo
wances. In addition, subject sources in these states were required to surrender an equivalent number of previouslyallocated 2021-2024 Group 2 al
lowances by deadlines in 2021. This requirement applies inclusive of assets and allowances that have since beensold and/or retired, including former AES assets in Ohio and P
ennsylvania. While AES no longer operates electric generating units subject to therevised CSAPR Update Rule i
n Ohio or Pennsylvania, certain prior AES sources in these states were required to surrender an equivalent number ofpreviously allocated 2021-2
024 Group 2 allowances and on July 14, 2021 the required allowances were recalled by the EPA, fulfilling this obligation.While the Company's additiona
l CSAPR compliance costs to date have been immaterial, the future availability of and cost to purchase allowances tomeet the emission reduction requirements is uncertain at this time, but it could be material if certain facil
ities will need to purchase additionalallowances based on reduced
 allocations.New Source Review ("NSR") — 
The NSR requirements under the CAA impose certain req uirements on major emission sources, such aselectric generating stations, if changes are made to the sources that result in a sign
ificant increase in air emissions. Certain projects, includingpower plant modifications, are excluded from these NSR req
uirements if they meet the routine maintenance, repair, and replacement ("RMRR")exclusion of the CAA. There is ongoing u
ncertainty and significant litigation regarding which projects fall within the RMRR exclusion. Over the pastseveral years, the EPA has filed suits against coal-fired po
wer plant owners and issued NOVs to a number of power plant owners alleging NSRviolations. See Item 3.—
Legal Proceedings  in this Form 10-K for more detail with respect to environmental litigation and regu latory action, includingan NOV issued by the EPA against AES Indi
ana concerning NSR and prevention of significant deterioration issues under the CAA. If NSRrequirements are imposed on any of the power plants own
ed by the Company's subsidiaries, the results could have a material adverse impact onthe Company's business, financial co
ndition, and results of operations.Regional Haze Rule — 
The EPA's "Regional Haze R ule" is intended to reduce haze and protect visibility in designated federal areas, and setsguidelines for determining the best avai
lable retrofit technology ("BART") at affected plants and how to demonstrate "reasonable progress" towardeliminating man-made haze by 2064. The R
egional Haze Rule required states to consider five factors when establishing BART for sources, includingthe availability of emission controls, the cost of the controls, and the effect of reducing emissio
n on visibility in Class I areas (including wildernessareas, national parks, and similar areas). The statute would require comp
liance within five years after the EPA approves the relevant SIP or issues afederal implementation plan, althou
gh individual states may impose more stringent compliance schedules. In September 2017, the EPA published afinal rule affirming the continued validity of the EPA
's previous determination allowing states to rely on the CSAPR to satisfy BART requirements. Allof the Company’s facilities that are subject to BART comply by meeting the requ
irements of CSAPR.The second phase of the Regiona
l Haze Rule began in 2019. States were required to submit regional haze plans for this secondimplementation period in 2021 to demo
nstrate reasonable progress towards reducing visibility impairment in Class I areas. States may need torequire additional emissions co
ntrols for visibility impairing pollutants, including on BART sources, during the second implementation period. Wecurrently cannot predict the impact of this second implementation perio
d, if any, on any of our Company’s U.S. subsidiaries. To date, none of thestates in which we operate have submitted plans i
dentifying potential impacts to Company facilities.NAAQS — 
Under the CAA, the EPA sets NAAQS for six principal poll utants considered harmful to public health and the environment, includingozone, particulate matter, NO
, and SO , which result from coal combustion. Areas meeting the NAAQS are designate d "attainment areas" whilethose that do not meet the NAAQS are considered "nonattainment areas." Each state must develo
p a plan to bring nonattainment areas intocompliance with the NAAQS, which may inclu
de imposing operating limits on individual plants. The EPA is required to review NAAQS at five-yearintervals.
Based on the current and potential future ambient air standards, certain of the states in wh
ich the Company's subsidiaries operate havedetermined or will be required to determine wheth
er certain areas within such states meet the NAAQS. Some of these states may be required tomodify their SIPs to detail how the states will attain or maintain their attainment status. As part of this process, it is possible that the appl

49 | 2021 Annual Reportregulatory agency or the EPA may require reductions of emissions from our generati
ng stations to reach attainment status for ozone, fine particulatematter, NO
, or SO . The compliance costs of the Company's U.S. subsidiaries cou ld be material.Mercury and Air Toxics Standard — 
In April 2012, the EPA’s rule to establish maximum achiev able control technology standards for hazardousair pollutants regulated under the CAA emitted from coal an
d oil-fired electric utilities, known as “MATS”, became effective and AES facilitiesimplemented measures to comply, as applicable.
In June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court remanded MATS to the D.C. Circuit due to the EPA’s failure to cons
ider costs before deciding toregulate power plants under Section 1
12 of the CAA and subsequently remanded MATS to the EPA without vacatur. On May 22, 2020, the EPApublished a final findin
g that it is not “appropriate and necessary” to regulate hazardous air pollutant emissions from coal- and oil-fired electricgenerating units (EGUs) (reversing its prior 2016 finding), but that the EPA wou
ld not remove the source category from the CAA Section 112(c) listof source categories and would not chang
e the MATS requirements. Several petitioners have filed for judicial review of the final finding and the D.C.Circuit, on February 16, 2021, granted the EPA's request that the rule be he
ld in abeyance pending the EPA's review. On January 31, 2022, theEPA released a pre-publicatio
n proposed rule to revoke its May 2020 finding and reaffirm its 2016 finding that it is appropriate and necessary toregulate these emissions. Further rulemakings and/or procee
dings are possible; however, in the meantime, MATS remains in effect. We currentlycannot predict the outcome of the regulatory or judicial process, or its impact, if any, on our MATS compliance p
lanning or ultimate costs.Greenhouse Gas Emissions — 
In January 2011, the EPA began regulati ng GHG emissions from certain stationary sources, including a pre-construction permitting program for certain new construction or major modifications, known as the Preve
ntion of Significant Deterioration ("PSD"). Iffuture modifications to our U.S.-based businesses' sources bec
ome subject to PSD for other pollutants, it may trigger GHG BACT requirements andthe cost of compliance with such requirements may be material.
On October 23, 2015, the EPA's rule establishing NS
PS for new electric generating units became effective, establishing CO emissions standards for newly constructed coal-fueled electric gen
erating plants, which reflects the partial capture and storage of CO emissions from the plants. The EPA also promulgated NSP
S applicable to modified and reconstructed electric generating units, which will serve as a floor for futureBACT determinations for such units. The NSPS could h
ave an impact on the Company's plans to construct and/or modify or reconstruct electricgenerating units in some locations. On December 20, 20
18, the EPA published proposed revisions to the final NSPS for new, modified, andreconstructed coal-fired electric utility steam generating units propos
ing that the best system of emissions reduction for these units is highly efficientgeneration that would be equiv
alent to supercritical steam conditions for larger units and sub-critical steam conditions for smaller units, and notpartial carbon capture and sequestration, as was fina
lized in the 2015 final NSPS. The EPA did not include revisions for natural-gas combined cycleor simple cycle units in the December 20, 2018 proposa
l. In January 2021, the EPA issued a final rule determining when standards are appropriatefor GHG emissions from stationary source categories for new source but did not take final action on the 2018 pro
posal to revise the 2015 finalNSPS. On April 5, 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated and remanded the fina
l January 2021 final rule. Challenges to the GHG NSPS are being held inabeyance at this time.
On August 31, 2018, the EPA published i
n the Federal Register proposed Emission Guidelines for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from ExistingElectric Utility Generating Units, known as the Affordable Cl
ean Energy (ACE) Rule. On July 8, 2019, the EPA published the final ACE Rule alongwith associated revisions to implementing reg
ulations. The final ACE Rule established COemission rules for existing power plants under CAA Section 111(d) and replaced the EPA
's 2015 Clean Power Plan Rule (CPP). In accordance with the ACE Rule, the EPA determined that heat rateimprovement measures are the best system of emissions reductions for existing coal-fired electric generati
ng units. The final rule requires states,including Indiana an
d Maryland, develop a State Plan to establish CO emission limits for designated facilities, includ ing AES Indiana Petersburg'sand AES Warrior Run's coal-fired electric generatin
g units. States have three years to develop their plans under the rule. On February 19, 2020,Indiana published a First Notice for the Indian
a ACE Rule indicating that IDEM intends to determine the best system of emissions reductions andCO
 standards for affected units. Impacts remain largely uncertain because Indiana's State Plan has not yet been developed. On January 19, 2021,the D.C. Circuit vacated and remanded to the EPA the ACE Rul
e, although the parties had an opportunity to request a rehearing at the D.C. Circuitor seek a review of the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. On March 5, 2021, the D.C. Circuit issued the partial mandate effectuati
ng the vacaturof the ACE Rule. In effect, the CPP will not take effect while the EPA is addressin
g the remand of the ACE rule by promulgating a new Section111(d) rule to regulate greenhouse gases from existing e

50 | 2021 Annual Reportunits. On October 29, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court granted petitions to review the decision by the D.C. Circu
it to vacate the ACE Rule. The impactof the results of such litigation and potential future greenh
ouse gas emissions regulations remains uncertain, but it could be material.On November 4, 2020, the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement became effective. However, on Janu
ary 20, 2021, President Bidensigned and submitted an instrument for the U.S. to rejoin the Paris Agreement effective February 19, 20
21. In addition, in November 2021, theinternational community gathered in Glasgo
w at the 26th Conference to the Parties on the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change("COP26"), during which multiple announceme
nts were made, including a call for parties to eliminate certain fossil fuel subsidies and pursue furtheraction on non-carbon dioxide GHGs. As such, there is some uncertainty with resp
ect to the impact of GHG rules on AES Indiana. The GHG BACTrequirements will not apply at least until we construct a new maj
or source or make a major modification of an existing major source, and the NSPSwill not require us to comply with an emissions standard u
ntil we construct a new electric generating unit. We do not have any planned majormodifications of an existing source or plans to construct a new major source at this time which are ex
pected to be subject to these regulations.Furthermore, the EPA, states, and other utilities are still evaluating potentia
l impacts of the GHG regulations in our industry. In light of theseuncertainties, we cannot predict the impact of the EPA’s current and future GHG regulations o
n our consolidated results of operations, cash flows,and financial condition.
Due to the future uncertainty of these regulations and associate
d litigation, we cannot at this time determine the impact on our operations orconsolidated financial resu
lts, but we believe the cost to comply with the ACE Rule, should it be upheld and implemented in its current or asubstantially similar form, could be material. The GHG NSPS remains in effect at this time, and, absent further action from the EPA that rescinds or
substantively revises the NSPS, it could impact any Compa
ny plans to construct and/or modify or reconstruct electric generating units in somelocations, which may have a material impact on our busin
ess, financial condition, or results of operations.Cooling Water Intake — 
The Company's facilities are subject to a variety of rules governi ng water use and discharge. In particular, theCompany's U.S. facilities are subject to the CWA Section 316(b) rule iss
ued by the EPA that seeks to protect fish and other aquatic organisms byrequiring existing steam electric generating faci
lities to utilize the best technology available ("BTA") for cooling water intake structures. On August15, 2014, the EPA published its final stan
dards based on CWA Section 316(b) which require certain subject facilities to choose among seven BTAoptions to reduce fish impingement. In addition, certain facil
ities must conduct studies to assist permitting authorities to determine whether and whatsite-specific controls, if any, are required to reduce entrainment of aquatic organisms. It is possible that this dec
ision-making process, which includespermitting and public input, could result in the n
eed to install closed-cycle cooling systems (closed-cycle cooling towers), or other technology. Finally,the standards require that new units added to an existin
g facility to increase generation capacity are required to reduce both impingement andentrainment. It is not yet possible to predict the total impacts of this final rule at this time, including any chall
enges to such final rule and the outcomeof any such challenges. However, if additio
nal capital expenditures are necessary, they could be material.AES Southland's current plan is to comply with the SWR
CB OTC Policy by shutting down and permanently retiring all existing generating unitsat AES Alamitos, AES Huntington Beach, an
d AES Redondo Beach that utilize OTC by the compliance dates included in the OTC Policy. TheSWRCB reviews the implementation plan a
nd latest information on OTC generating unit retirement dates and new generation availability to evaluatethe impact on electrical system reliability and OTC complianc
e dates for specific units.The Company’s California subsi
diaries have signed 20-year term PPAs with Southern California Edison for the new generating capacity, whichhave been approved by the Californ
ia Public Utilities Commission. Construction of new generating capacity began in June 2017 at AES HuntingtonBeach and July 2017 at AES Alamitos. The n
ew air-cooled combined cycle gas turbine generators and battery energy storage systems wereconstructed at the AES Alamitos and AES Huntingto
n Beach generating stations. The new air-cooled combined cycle gas turbine generators at theAES Alamitos and AES Huntingto
n Beach generating stations began commercial operation in early 2020 and there is currently no plan to replacethe OTC generating units at the AES Redondo B
each generating station following the retirement. Certain OTC units were required to be retired in2019 to provide interconnection cap
acity and/or emissions credits prior to startup of the new generating units, and the remaining AES OTCgenerating units in California w
ill be shutdown and permanently retired by the OTC Policy compliance dates for these units. The SWRCB OTCPolicy required the shutdown and p
ermanent retirement of all remaining OTC generating units at AES Alamitos, AES Huntington Beach, and AESRedondo Beach by December 31, 20
20. The initial amendment extended the deadline for shutdown and retirement of AES Alamitos and AESHuntington Beach’s remainin
g OTC generating units to December 31, 2023 and extended the deadline for shutdown and
51 | 2021 Annual Reportretirement of AES Redondo Beach’s remaini
ng OTC generating units to December 31, 2021 (the “AES Redondo Beach Extension”). In October2020, the cities of Redondo Beach an
d Hermosa Beach filed a state court lawsuit challenging the AES Redondo Beach Extension. AES opposed theaction and the court granted an order dismissing the matter. Plaintiffs have initi
ated an additional challenge to the permit, and the outcome of thatlawsuit is unclear. On March 16, 2021 the SACCWIS released the
ir draft 2021 report to SWRCB. The report summarizes the State of California’scurrent electrical grid reliability needs an
d recommended a two-year extension to the compliance schedule for AES Redondo Beach to addresssystem-wide grid reliability needs. The SWRCB p
ublic hearing regarding the final decision on the amendment of the OTC policy was held onOctober 19, 2021 and the Board voted in favor of extending the compl
iance date for AES Redondo Beach to December 31, 2023. The AESRedondo Beach NPDE
S permit has been administratively extended.Power plants are required to comply with the more stringent of state or federal requirements. At present, the California state requ
irements aremore stringent and have earlier compliance dates tha
n the federal EPA requirements, and are therefore applicable to the Company's Californiaassets.
Challenges to the federal EPA's rul
e were filed and consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, although implementationof the rule was not stayed while the challeng
es proceeded. On July 23, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the rule. TheSecond Circuit later denied a petitio
n by environmental groups for rehearing. The Company anticipates that compliance with CWA Section 316(b)regulations and associated costs coul
d have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.Water Discharges — 
In June 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ("the agencies") pub lished a rule defining federaljurisdiction over waters of the U.S., known as the "Waters of the U.S." (WOTUS) rule. This rule, which initially became effective in August 201
5,could expand or otherwise chang
e the number and types of waters or features subject to CWA permitting. However, after repealing the 2015WOTUS rule on October 22, 2019, the agencies, on April 21, 2020, issu
ed the final “Navigable Waters Protection” (NWP) rule which again revisedthe definition of waters of the U.S. On August 30, 2021, the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona issued an order vacating and remand
ing theNWP Rule. This vacatur of the NWP Rule applies natio
nwide. As such, the agencies are interpreting waters of the U.S. consistent with the pre-2015regulatory regime until further notice. On December 7, 2021, the agencies pu
blished a proposed rule to define the scope of waters regulated underthe CWA. The proposed rule would restore regulatio
ns defining WOTUS that were in place prior to 2015, with updates to be consistent with relevantSupreme Court decisions. A second rulemakin
g process is planned to further build upon this proposed rule. On January 24, 2022, the U.S. SupremeCourt granted certiorari on a wetlands case (
Sackett v. EPA ) on the limited question of: “Whether the Ninth Circuit set forth the proper test for determining whether wetlands are ‘waters of the Unite
d States’ under the Clean Water Act.” The Ninth Circuit employed Justice Kennedy’s“significant nexus” test from the 2006 
Rapanos v. United States decision; the plurali ty opinion in Rapanos  required a water body to have a "continuous surface connection" with a water of the United States in ord
er to be considered a wetland covered by the CWA. In Sackett v. EPA , the Court may finally provide clarity on which test from the 2006 
Rapanos decision controls. It is too early to determine whether the newly promulgated NWP rule or any outcome of litigation may have a material impact on our busin
ess, financial condition, or results of operations.On November 3, 2015, the EPA published its final E
LG rule to reduce toxic pollutants discharged into waters of the U.S. by steam-electricpower plants through technology ap
plications. These effluent limitations for existing and new sources include dry handling of fly ash, closed-loop ordry handling of bottom ash, and more stringent effluent limitations for flue gas desu
lfurization wastewater. AES Indiana Petersburg has installed adry bottom ash handling system in response to the CCR rule and w
astewater treatment systems in response to the NPDES permits in advance ofthe ELG compliance date. Other U.S. businesses already incl
ude dry handling of fly ash and bottom ash and do not generate flue gasdesulfurization wastewater. However, it is too early to determine wheth
er any outcome of litigation or current or future revisions to the ELG rulemight have a material impact on our business, financial co
ndition, and results of operations.On April 23, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision i
n the Hawaii Wildlife Fund v. County of Maui  case related to whether a CWA permit is required when pollutants origin
ate from a point source but are conveyed to navigable waters through a nonpoint source, such asgroundwater. The Court held that discharges to ground
water require a permit if the addition of the pollutants through groundwater is the functionalequivalent of a direct discharge from the point source into navi
gable waters. A number of legal cases relevant to determination of "functionalequivalent" are ongoing in vari
ous jurisdictions. It is too early to determine whether the Supreme Court decision or the result of litigation to"functional equivalent" may have a material impact on our bus
iness, financial condition, or results of operations.
52 | 2021 Annual ReportSelenium Rule
 — In June 2016, the EPA published the final national chronic aquatic life criterion for the pollutant selenium in fresh water.NPDES permits may be updated to include sel
enium water quality-based effluent limits based on a site-specific evaluation process, which includesdetermining if there is a reasonable potentia
l to exceed the revised final selenium water quality standards for the specific receiving water bodyutilizing actual and/or project discharg
e information for the generating facilities. As a result, it is not yet possible to predict the total impacts of thisfinal rule at this time, including any challe
nges to such final rule and the outcome of any such challenges. However, if additional capital expendituresare necessary, they could be material. AES Indiana wo
uld seek recovery of these capital expenditures; however, there is no guarantee it would besuccessful in this regard.
Waste Management — 
On October 19, 2015, an EPA rule regulating CCR un der the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act asnonhazardous solid waste bec
ame effective. The rule established nationally applicable minimum criteria for the disposal of CCR in new andcurrently operating landfills and surface impo
undments, including location restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring,corrective action and closure requirements, and post-closure care. The primary enforcement mecha
nisms under this regulation would be actionscommenced by the states and private lawsuits. On December 16, 2016, the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act ("WIN Act") was
signed into law. This includes prov
isions to implement the CCR rule through a state permitting program, or if the state chooses not to participate, apossible federal permit program. If this rule is finalized before Indian
a or Puerto Rico establishes a state-level CCR permit program, AES CCR unitsin those locations could eventua
lly be required to apply for a federal CCR permit from the EPA. The EPA has indicated that it will implement aphased approach to amending the C
CR Rule, which is ongoing. On August 28, 2020, the EPA published final amendments to the CCR Rule titled "AHolistic Approach to Closure Part A: Deadli
ne to Initiate Closure," that, among other amendments, required certain CCR units to cease waste receiptand initiate closure by April 11, 2021. The C
CR Part A Rule also allowed for extensions of the April 11, 2021 deadline if the EPA determines certaincriteria are met. Facilities seeking such an extension were req
uired to submit a demonstration to the EPA by November 30, 2020. On January 25,2022, the EPA released proposed d
eterminations regarding nine CCR Part A Rule demonstrations. On the same day, the EPA issued fourcompliance-related letters notifying certain other faciliti
es of their compliance obligations under the federal CCR regulations. The determinations andletters include interpretations regarding impl
ementation of the CCR Rule. It is too early to determine the direct or indirect impact of these letters orany determinations that may be made.
The CCR rule, current or proposed amendments to the CCR rule, the results of groundwater monitori
ng data, or the outcome of CCR-relatedlitigation could have a material impact on o
ur business, financial condition, and results of operations. AES Indiana would seek recovery of anyresulting expenditures; however, there is no guara
ntee we would be successful in this regard.On January 2, 2020, Puerto Rico Senate Bill 12
21 was signed by the Puerto Rico Governor into law and became effective as Act 5-2020. Act5-2020 prohibits the disposal an
d unencapsulated beneficial use of CCR and places restrictions on storage of CCR in Puerto Rico. Puerto RicoDepartment of Natural and Environmental Resources d
eveloped implementation regulations which became effective on June 10, 2021. Prior to Act5-2020's approval, the Company had p
ut in place arrangements to dispose or beneficially use its coal ash and combustion residual outside of PuertoRico. It is too early to determine whether this might have a material impact on our business, financi
al condition, and results of operations. Biden Administration Actions Affecting Env
ironmental Regulations — On January 20, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order ("EO")titled “Protecting Public Health and the Env
ironment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis” directing agencies to, among other tasks,review regulations issued und
er the prior administration to determine whether they should be suspended, revoked, or revised. As provided for by theEO, the EPA submitted a letter to the DOJ seeking to obtain abeyances or stays of proceedings i
n pending litigation that seeks review of regulationspromulgated during the Trump Administration. The Bid
en Administration also issued a Memorandum titled “Regulatory Freeze Pending Review”directing agencies to refrain from proposing or issuing a
ny rules until the Biden Administration has reviewed and approved those rules. Theseactions may have an impact on regulations that may affect our business, financi
al condition, or results of operations.International Environmental

At AES, our people are instrumental to helping us meet the worl
d’s energy needs. Supporting our people is a foundational value for AES. All ofour actions are grounded in the shared valu
es that shape AES’ culture: Safety First, Highest Standards, and All Together. The AES Corporation isled and managed by our Chief Executiv
e Officer and the Executive Leadership Team with the guidance and oversight of our Board of Directors.As of December 31, 2021, the Company and its subsidiari
es had approximately 8,450 full time/permanent employees. The following chart listsour full time/permanent employees by SBU:
As of December 31, 2021, approximately 35% of our U.S. employees were sub
ject to collective bargaining agreements. Collective bargainingagreements between us and these labor un
ions expire at various dates ranging from 2023 to 2024. In addition, certain employees in non-U.S.locations were subject to collective barga
ining agreements, representing approximately 60% of the non-U.S. workforce. Management believes thatthe Company's employee relations are favorab
le.Safety
At AES, safety is one of our core values. Conducting safe operations at our facil
ities around the world, so that each person can return homesafely, is the cornerstone of our daily activities and decisio
ns. Safety efforts are led by our Chief Operating Officer and supported by safetycommittees that operate at the local site level. Hazards in the workplace are active
ly identified and management tracks incidents so remedial actionscan be taken to improve workplace safety.
AES has established a Safety Manageme
nt System (“SMS”) Global Safety Standard that applies to all AES employees, as well as contractorsworking in AES facilities and constructio
n projects. The SMS requires continuous safety performance monitoring, risk assessment, and performanceof periodic integrated environmental, hea
lth, and safety audits. The SMS provides a consistent framework for all AES operational businesses andconstruction projects to set expectations for risk identification and reductio
n, measure performance, and drive continuous improvements. The SMSstandard is consistent with the OHSAS 18001/ISO 4500
1 standard, and during 2020 approximately 42% of our locations have elected to formallycertify their SMS to the OHSAS 18001/ISO 45001 international stand
ard. AES calculates lost time incident (“LTI”) rates for our employees andcontractors based on OSHA standards, based on 200,00
0 labor hours, which equates to 100 workers who work 40 hours per week and 50 weeksper year. In 2021, there was a 11% decrease in LTI cases. In 2021, AES’ LTI Rate was 0.075 for AES

54 | 2021 Annual ReportPeople, 0.107 for operational contractors, and 0.028 for construction co
ntractors. In 2021, the Company had no work-related fatalities.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented sign
ificant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees,as well as the communities in which we operate. This i
ncludes having employees work from home to the extent they were able, while implementingadditional safety measures for employees continu
ing critical on-site work.Talent
We believe AES’ success depen
ds on its ability to attract, develop, and retain key personnel. The skills, experience, and industry knowledge ofkey employees significantly benefit our op
erations and performance. We have a comprehensive approach to managing our talent and developingour leaders in order to ensure our people have the rig
ht skills for today and tomorrow, whether that requires us to build new business models orleverage leading technologies.
We emphasize employee developme
nt and training. To empower employees, we provide a range of development programs and opportunities,skills, and resources they need to be successful by focusing o
n experience and exposure, as well as formal programs including our ACE Academyfor Talent Development and our Trainee Program.
At AES, we believe that our individua
l differences make us stronger. Our Diversity and Inclusion Program is led by our Diversity and InclusionOfficer. Governance and standards are guided by the Chief Human R
esources Officer, with input from members of the Executive Leadership Team.Compensation
AES’ executive compensation ph
ilosophy emphasizes pay-for-performance. Our incentive plans are designed to reward strong performance,with greater compensation paid when p
erformance exceeds expectations and less compensation paid when performance falls below expectations.We invest significant time and resources to ensure our compensation pro
grams are competitive and reward the performance of our people. Everyyear, AES people who are not part of a collective barga
ining agreement are eligible for an annual merit-based salary increase. In addition,individuals are eligi
ble for a salary increase if they receive a significant promotion. For non-collectively bargained employees at certain levels in theorganization, we offer annual incentiv
es (bonus) and long-term compensation to reinforce the alignment between AES' employees and AES.Executive Officers
The following individ
uals are our executive officers:Stephen Coughlin, 
50  years old, has served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer since October 2021. Prior to assuminghis current position, he led AES' Corporate Strategy an

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
You should consider carefully the foll
owing risks, along with the other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K.Additional risks and uncertainties a
lso may adversely affect our business and operations. We routinely encounter and address risks, some of whichmay cause our future results to be materially different than we presently anticipate. The categori
es of risk we have identified in Item 1A.—Risk Factors
 include risks associated with our operations, gov ernmental regulation and laws, our indebtedness and financial condition. These risk factorsshould be read in conjunctio
n with Item 7.— Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in thisForm 10-K and the Consolidated Financ
ial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. If any of the following eventsactually occur, our business, financial results and fin
ancial condition could be materially adversely affected. Risks Associated with our Operations
The operation of power generation, distribution and transmission facilities involves significant risks.
We are in the business of generating and distributi
ng electricity, which involves certain risks that can adversely affect financial and operatingperformance, including:
•
changes in the availability of our generation facilities or distribution systems due to increases in scheduled and unscheduled plant outages,equipment failure, failure of transmission systems, labor disputes, disruptio
ns in fuel supply, poor hydrologic and wind conditions, inability tocomply with regulatory or permit requirements, or catastrophic events such as fires, floods, storms, hurricanes, earthquakes, dam failures,
tsunamis, explosions, terrorist acts, cyber attacks or other similar occurrences; and
•
changes in our operating cost structure, including, but not limited to, increases in costs relating to gas, coal, oil and other fuel; fueltransportation; purchased electricity; operations, maintenanc
e and repair; environmental compliance, including the cost of purchasingemissions offsets and capital expenditures to instal
l environmental emission equipment; transmission access; and insurance.
57 | 2021 Annual ReportOur businesses require reliable transportation so
urces (including related infrastructure such as roads, ports and rail), power sources and watersources to access and conduct operations. The avail
ability and cost of this infrastructure affects capital and operating costs and levels of productionand sales. Limitations, or interruptions in this infrastructure or at the facilities of our subsidiari
es, including as a result of third parties intentionally orunintentionally disruptin
g this infrastructure or the facilities of our subsidiaries, could impede their ability to produce electricity.In addition, a portion of our generation facilities w
ere constructed many years ago and may require significant capital expenditures formaintenance. The equipment at our plants requires p
eriodic upgrading, improvement or repair and replacement equipment or parts may be difficultto obtain in circumstances where we rely on a single su
pplier or a small number of suppliers. The inability to obtain replacement equipment or parts,due to disruption of the supply chain or other factors, may impact the ability of our plants to perform. Breakdown or failure of one of our op
eratingfacilities may prevent the facility from performing under applicable p
ower sales agreements which, in certain situations, could result in termination ofa power purchase or other agreement or incurrence of a liabil
ity for liquidated damages and/or other penalties.Power generation involves haz
ardous activities, including acquiring, transporting and unloading fuel, operating large pieces of rotatingequipment and delivering e
lectricity to transmission and distribution systems. In addition to natural risks, such as earthquakes, floods, lightning,hurricanes and wind, hazards, such as fire, explosio
n, collapse and machinery failure, are inherent risks in our operations which may occur as aresult of inadequate internal processes, techno
logical flaws, human error or actions of third parties or other external events. The control andmanagement of these risks depend upon ade
quate development and training of personnel and on operational procedures, preventativemaintenance plans, and specific programs sup
ported by quality control systems, which may not prevent the occurrence and impact of these risks.The hazards described above, alon
g with other safety hazards associated with our operations, can cause significant personal injury or loss oflife, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equi
pment, contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension ofoperations. The occurrence of any one of these events may result in our bein
g named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantialdamages, environmental cleanup costs, person
al injury and fines and/or penalties.Furthermore, we and our affiliates are parties to material litigation and regu
latory proceedings. See Item 3.— Legal Proceedings  below. Therecan be no assurance that the outcomes of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our conso
lidated financial position.We do a significant amount of business outside the U.S., including in developing countries.
A significant amount of our revenue is generated in d
eveloping countries and we intend to expand our business in certain developing countriesin which AES or its customers have an existing presence. Internatio
nal operations, particularly in developing countries, entail significant risks anduncertainties, including:
•
economic, social and political instability in any particular country or region;•
adverse changes in currency exchange rates;•
government restrictions on converting currencies or repatriating funds;•
unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulations or in trade, monetary, fiscal or environmental policies;•
high inflation and monetary fluctuations;•
restrictions on imports of solar panels, wind turbines, coal, oil, gas or other raw materials;•
threatened or consummated expropriation or nationalization of our assets by foreign governments;•
unexpected delays in permitting and governmental approvals;•
unexpected changes or instability affecting our strategic partners in developing countries;•
failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or other applicable anti-bribery regulations;•
unwillingness of governments, agencies, similar organizations or other counterparties to honor contracts;•
unwillingness of governments, government agencies, courts or similar bodies to enforce contracts that are economically advantageous toAES and less beneficial to governme
nt or private party counterparties, against those counterparties;•
inability to obtain access to fair and equitable political, regulatory, administrative and legal systems;•
adverse changes in government tax policy and tax consequences of operating in multiple jurisdictions;
58 | 2021 Annual Report•
difficulties in enforcing our contractual rights or enforcing judgments or obtaining a favorable result in local jurisdictions; and•
inability to attract and retain qualified personnel.Developing projects in less dev
eloped economies also entails greater financing risks and such financing may only be available from multilateralor bilateral international financi
al institutions or agencies that require governmental guarantees for certain project and sovereign-related risks. Therecan be no assurance that project financing wi
ll be available.Further, our operations may experience volatility in revenu
es and operating margin caused by regulatory and economic difficulties, politicalinstability and currency devaluatio
ns, which may increase the uncertainty of cash flows from these businesses.Any of these factors could have a material, adverse effect on our business, results of operations an
d financial condition.Our businesses may incur substantial costs and liabilities and be exposed to price volatility as a result of risks
associated with the wholesale electricity markets.
Some of our businesses sell or buy electricity in the spot markets when they operate at lev
els that differ from their power sales agreements orretail load obligations or whe
n they do not have any powers sales agreements. Our businesses may also buy electricity in the wholesale spotmarkets. As a result, we are exposed to the risks of rising and falling prices in those markets. The open market wholes
ale prices for electricity canbe volatile and generally reflect the varia
ble cost of the source generation which could include renewable sources at near zero pricing or thermalsources subject to fluctuating cost of fuels such as coal, natural gas or oil derivativ
e fuels in addition to other factors described below. Consequently,any changes in the generation sup
ply stack and cost of coal, natural gas, or oil derivative fuels may impact the open market wholesale price ofelectricity.
Volatility in market prices for fuel and electricity may result from, among other things:
•
plant availability in the markets generally;•
availability and effectiveness of transmission facilities owned and operated by third parties;•
competition and new entrants;•
seasonality, hydrology and other weather conditions;•
illiquid markets;•
transmission, transportation constraints, inefficiencies and/or availability;•
renewables source contribution to the supply stack;•
increased adoption of distributed generation;•
energy efficiency and demand side resources;•
available supplies of coal, natural gas, and crude oil and refined products;•
generating unit performance;•
natural disasters, terrorism, wars, embargoes, pandemics and other catastrophic events;•
energy, market and environmental regulation, legislation and policies;•
general economic conditions that impact demand and energy consumption; and•
bidding behavior and market bidding rules.Wholesale power prices may experience significant volatility in our markets which could impact our operations and
opportunities for future growth.
The wholesale prices offered for electricity have bee
n volatile in the markets in which we operate due to a variety of factors, including theincreased penetration of renewabl
e generation resources, low-priced natural gas and demand side management. The levelized cost of electricityfrom new solar and wind generation sources has d
ecreased substantially in recent years as solar panel costs and wind turbine costs have declined,while wind and solar capac
ity factors have increased. These renewable resources have no fuel costs and very low operational costs, while only operating during certain periods of time (daylig
ht) or weather conditions (higher winds). This, combined with changes in oil, gas, and coal pricing,has led to increasingly volatile e
lectricity markets across our
59 | 2021 Annual Reportmarkets. A
lso, in many markets, new PPAs have been awarded for renewa ble generation at prices significantly lower than those awarded just a fewyears ago.
This trend of volatility in wholesale prices co
uld continue and could have a material adverse impact on the financial performance of our existinggeneration assets to the extent they currently sell or buy power into the spot market to serve our contracts or will seek to sell power into the sp
otmarket once our contracts expire.
The COVID-19 pandemic, or the future outbreak of any other highly infectious or contagious diseases, could impact
our business and operations.
The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted gl
obal economic activity, including electricity and energy consumption. COVID-19 or anotherpandemic could have material and a
dverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows due to, among other factors:•
further decline in customer demand as a result of general decline in business activity;•
further destabilization of the markets and decline in business activity negatively impacting customers’ ability to pay for our services whendue or at all, including downstream impacts, whereby the uti
lities’ customers are unable to pay monthly bills or receiving a moratorium frompayment obligations, resulting in in
ability on the part of utilities to make payments for power supplied by our generation companies;•
decline in business activity causing our commercial and industrial customers to experience declining revenues and liquidity difficulties thatimpede their ability to pay for power that we supply;
•
government moratoriums or other regulatory or legislative actions that limit changes in pricing, delay or suspend customers’ paymentobligations or permit extended payment terms applica
ble to customers of our utilities or to our offtakers under power purchase agreements,in particular, to the extent that such measures are not mitigated by associated government subsi
dies or other support to address anyshortfall or deficiencies in payments;
•
claims by our PPA counterparties for delay or relief from payment obligations or other adjustments, including claims based on force majeureor other legal grounds;
•
further decline in spot electricity prices;•
the destabilization of the markets and decline in business activity negatively impacting our customer growth in our service territories at ourutilities;
•
negative impacts on the health of our essential personnel and on our operations as a result of implementing stay-at-home, quarantine,curfew and other social distancing measures;
•
delays or inability to access, transport and deliver fuel to our generation facilities due to restrictions on business operations or other factorsaffecting us and our third-party suppliers;
•
delays or inability to access equipment or the availability of personnel to perform planned and unplanned maintenance or disruptions insupply chain, which can, in turn, lead to disruptio
n in operations;•
a deterioration in our ability to ensure business continuity, including increased cybersecurity attacks related to the work-from-homeenvironment;
•
further delays to our construction projects, including at our renewables projects, and the timing of the completion of renewables projects;•
delay or inability to receive the necessary permits for our development projects due to delays or shutdowns of government operations;•
delays in achieving our financial goals, strategy and digital transformation;•
deterioration of the credit profile of The AES Corporation and/or its subsidiaries and difficulty accessing the capital and credit markets onfavorable terms, or at all, and a severe disruption and instability in the g
lobal financial markets, or deterioration in credit and financingconditions, which could affect our access to capital nec
essary to fund business operations or address maturing liabilities on a timely basis;•
delays or inability to complete asset sales on anticipated terms or to redeploy capital as set forth in our capital allocation plans;•
increased volatility in foreign exchange and commodity markets;•
deterioration of economic conditions, demand and other related factors resulting in impairments to goodwill or long-lived assets; and
60 | 2021 Annual Report•
delay or inability in obtaining regulatory actions and outcomes that could be material to our business, including for recovery of COVID-19related losses and the review and approv
al of our rates at our U.S. regulated utilities.The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic also depends o
n factors, including the effectiveness and timing of vaccine development and distributionefforts, the development of more virulent COVID-19 variants as well as third-party actions taken to contain its spread an
d mitigate its public healtheffects. The COVID-19 pandemic presents material uncertainty that could adversely affect our gen
eration facilities, transmission and distributionsystems, development projects, energy storage sales by Fluence, and resu
lts of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The COVID-19pandemic may also heighten many of the other risks described i
n this section.Adverse economic developments in China could have a negative impact on demand for electricity in many of our
markets.
The Chinese market has been driving gl
obal materials demand and pricing for commodities over the past decade. Many of these commoditiesare produced in our key electricity markets. After experiencing rapid growth for more than a decad
e, China’s economy has experienced decreasingforeign and domestic demand, weak investment, factory overcapacity and ov
ersupply in the property market, and has experienced a significantslowdown in recent years. U.S. tariffs have also had a negative imp
act on China's economic growth. Continued slowing in China’s economic growth,demand for commodities and/or material changes in pol
icy could result in lower economic growth and lower demand for electricity in our keymarkets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financi
al condition and prospects.We may not have adequate risk mitigation and/or insurance coverage for liabilities.
Power generation, distribution and transmissi
on involves hazardous activities. We may become exposed to significant liabilities for which wemay not have adequate risk mitigation and/or insuranc
e coverage. Furthermore, through AGIC, AES’ captive insurance company, we take certaininsurance risk on our businesses. We maintain an amou
nt of insurance protection that we believe is customary, but there can be no assurance it willbe sufficient or effective in light of all circumstances, hazards or liabiliti
es to which we may be subject. Our insurance does not cover every potentialrisk associated with our operations. Adequate cov
erage at reasonable rates is not always obtainable. In particular, the availability of insurance forcoal-fired generation assets has decreased as certai
n insurers have opted to discontinue or limit offering insurance for such assets. Certain insurershave also withdrawn from insuring hydroel
ectric assets. We cannot provide assurance that insurance coverage will continue to be available in theamounts or on terms similar to our current policies. In addition, insurance may not fully cover the liabi
lity or the consequences of any businessinterruptions such as natural catastrophes, equipment fail
ure or labor dispute. The occurrence of a significant adverse event not adequately coveredby insurance could have a material adverse effect on our bus
iness, results or operations, financial condition, and prospects.We may not be able to enter into long-term contracts that reduce volatility in our results.
Many of our generation plants conduct business u
nder long-term sales and supply contracts, which helps these businesses to manage risks byreducing the volatility associated with p
ower and input costs and providing a stable revenue and cost structure. In these instances, we rely on powersales contracts with one or a limited number of customers for the majority of, and in some cases all of, the relevant plant's output and reve
nues overthe term of the power sales contract. The remaining terms of the power sales contracts of our generation plants range from one to more than 20
years. In many cases, we also limit our exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices by entering i
nto long-term contracts for fuel with a limited number ofsuppliers. In these instances, the cash flows and results of operations are d
ependent on the continued ability of customers and suppliers to meettheir obligations under the relevant po
wer sales contract or fuel supply contract, respectively. Some of our long-term power sales agreements are atprices above current spot market prices and some of our long-term fuel supply contracts are at prices below current market prices. The loss of
significant power sales contracts or fuel supply contracts, or the failure by any of the parties to such contracts that prevents us from fulfilling our
obligations thereunder, could a
dversely impact our strategy by resulting in costs that exceed revenue, which could have a material adverse impacton our business, results of operations and financi
al condition. In addition, depending on market conditions and regulatory regimes, it may be difficultfor us to secure long-term contracts, either where our current contracts are expiring or for new development projects. The inability to enter into lo
ng-term contracts could require many of our businesses to purchase inputs at market prices and sell el
ectricity into spot markets, which may not befavorable.

61 | 2021 Annual ReportWe have sought to reduce counterparty credit risk under our long-term contracts by entering into power sal
es contracts with utilities or othercustomers of strong credit quality and by obtaining guarante
es from certain sovereign governments of the customer's obligations; however, many ofour customers do not have or have not maintained, investment-grade credit ratings. Our generatio
n businesses cannot always obtain governmentguarantees and if they do, the government may not have an investment grade cred
it rating. We have also located our plants in different geographicareas in order to mitigate the effects of regional economic downturns; howev
er, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be effective.Our renewable energy projects and other initiatives face considerable uncertainties.
Wind, solar, and energy storage projects are subject to substantial risks. Some of these busi
ness lines are dependent upon favorableregulatory incentives to support continued inv
estment, and there is significant uncertainty about the extent to which such favorable regulatoryincentives will be availa
ble in the future. In particular, in the U.S., AES’ renewable energy generation growth strategy depends in part on federal,state and local government policies an
d incentives that support the development, financing, ownership and operation of renewable energygeneration projects, including i
nvestment tax credits, production tax credits, accelerated depreciation, renewable portfolio standards, feed-in-tariffsand similar programs, renewable energy credit mechan
isms, and tax exemptions. If these policies and incentives are changed or eliminated, or AESis unable to use them, there could be a material adverse impact on AE
S’ U.S. renewable growth opportunities, including fewer future PPAs or lowerprices in future PPAs, decreased revenues, reduced eco
nomic returns on certain project company investments, increased financing costs, and/ordifficulty obtaining financing.
Furthermore, production levels for our wind and solar projects may be dep
endent upon adequate wind or sunlight resulting in volatility inproduction levels and profitabil
ity. For our wind projects, wind resource estimates are based on historical experience when available and on windresource studies conducted by an indep
endent engineer. These wind resource estimates are not expected to reflect actual wind energy productionin any given year, but long-term averages of a resource.
As a result, these types of projects face considerable risk, including that favorab
le regulatory regimes expire or are adversely modified. At thedevelopment or acquisition stage, our abi
lity to predict actual performance results may be hindered and the projects may not perform as predicted.There are also risks associated with the fact that some of these projects exist in markets where long-term fixed-price contracts for the major cost
and revenue components may be unavai
lable, which in turn may result in these projects having relatively high levels of volatility. These projects canbe capital-intensive and gen
erally are designed with a view to obtaining third-party financing, which may be difficult to obtain. As a result, thesecapital constraints may reduce our ability to develop or obta
in third-party financing for these projects.Our acquisitions may not perform as expected.
Acquisitions have been a sig
nificant part of our growth strategy historically and more recently as we grow our renewables business. Althoughacquired businesses may have sign
ificant operating histories, we may have limited or no history of owning and operating certain of thesebusinesses, and possibly limited or no ex
perience operating in the country or region where these businesses are located. We also may encounterchallenges in integrating a
nd realizing the expected benefits of these acquisitions as well as integration or other one-time costs that are greater thanexpected. Such businesses may not generate sufficie
nt cash flow to support the indebtedness incurred to acquire them or the capital expendituresneeded to develop them; and the rate of return from such businesses may not justify our investment of capital to acqu
ire them. In addition, some ofthese businesses may have been governme
nt owned and some may be operated as part of a larger integrated utility prior to their acquisition. If wewere to acquire any of these types of businesses, there can be no assuranc
e that we will be successful in transitioning them to private ownership orthat we will not incur unforeseen oblig
ations or liabilities.Competition is increasing and could adversely affect us.
The power production markets in which we operate are ch
aracterized by numerous strong and capable competitors, many of whom may haveextensive and diversified devel
opmental or operating experience (including both domestic and international) and financial resources similar to, orgreater than, ours. Further, in recent years, the power production industry has been characterized by strong an
d increasing competition with respectto both obtaining power sales agreeme
nts and acquiring existing power generation assets. In certain markets, these factors have caused reductionsin prices contained in new pow
er sales agreements and, in many cases, have caused higher acquisition prices for existing assets throughcompetitive bidding practices. The evoluti
on of competitive
62 | 2021 Annual Reportelectricity markets and the development of highly efficient gas-fired po
wer plants and renewables such as wind and solar have also caused, andcould continue to cause, price pressure in certain po
wer markets where we sell or intend to sell power. In addition, the introduction of low-costdisruptive technologies or the entry of non-traditiona
l competitors into our sector and markets could adversely affect our ability to compete, whichcould have a material adverse effect on our businesses, op
erating results and financial condition.Supplier and/or customer concentration may expose us to significant financial credit or performance risks.
We often rely on a single contracted supplier or a small number of suppl
iers for the provision of fuel, transportation of fuel and other servicesrequired for the operation of some of our facilities. If these suppliers cannot perform, we would seek to meet our fuel requ
irements by purchasingfuel at market prices, exposing us to market price volatility and the risk that fuel and transportation may not be avail
able during certain periods at anyprice, which could adversely impact the profitabil
ity of the affected business and our results of operations, and could result in a breach ofagreements with other counterparties, including, with
out limitation, offtakers or lenders. Further, our suppliers may source certain materials fromareas impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which may cause de
lays and/or disruptions to our development projects or operations.The financial performance of our facilities is depe
ndent on the credit quality of, and continued performance by, suppliers and customers. Attimes, we rely on a single customer or a few customers to purchase all or a significant portion of a facility's outp
ut, in some cases under long-termagreements that account for a substantial percentage of the anticipate
d revenue from a given facility. Counterparties to these agreements maybreach or may be unable to perform their obligations, due to bankru
ptcy, insolvency, financial distress or other factors. Furthermore, in the event of abankruptcy or similar insolvency-type proceedin
g, our counterparty can seek to reject our existing PPA under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or similarbankruptcy laws, including those in P
uerto Rico. We may not be able to enter into replacement agreements on terms as favorable as our existingagreements, and may have to sell power at market prices. A counterparty's breach by of a PPA or other agreement coul
d also result in the breach ofother agreements, including the affected business
es debt agreements. Any failure of a supplier or customer to fulfill its contractual obligations couldhave a material adverse effect on our financial results.
We may incur significant expenditures to adapt to our businesses to technological changes.
Emerging technologies may be superi
or to, or may not be compatible with, some of our existing technologies, investments and infrastructure,and may require us to make significant expenditures to remain competitiv
e, or may result in the obsolescence of certain of our operating assets. Ourfuture success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticip
ate and successfully adapt to technological changes, to offer services and products thatmeet customer demands and evolving industry standards. Techn
ological changes that could impact our businesses include:•
technologies that change the utilization of electric generation, transmission and distribution assets, including the expanded cost-effectiveutilization of distributed generation (e.g., rooftop solar and commun
ity solar projects), and energy storage technology;•
advances in distributed and local power generation and energy storage that reduce demand for large-scale renewable electricity generationor impact our customers’ performance of long-term agreements; and
•
more cost-effective batteries for energy storage, advances in solar or wind technology, and advances in alternative fuels and otheralternative energy sources.
Emerging technologies may also al
low new competitors to more effectively compete in our markets or disintermediate the services we provideour customers, including traditional utility and ce
ntralized generation services. If we incur significant expenditures in adapting to technologicalchanges, fail to adapt to significant technolo
gical changes, fail to obtain access to important new technologies, fail to recover a significant portion ofany remaining investment in obsolete assets, or if implemented tech
nology fails to operate as intended, our businesses, operating results andfinancial condition coul
d be materially adversely affected.Cyber-attacks and data security breaches could harm our business.
Our business relies on electronic systems and network technol
ogies to operate our generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure. Wealso use various financial, accounti
ng and other infrastructure systems. Our infrastructure may be targeted by nation states, hacktivists, criminals,insiders or terrorist groups. Such an attack, by hacking, malware or other means, may interrupt our operations, cause property damage, affect our
ability to control

63 | 2021 Annual Reportour infrastructure assets, cause the release of sensitive customer information or limit communications with third parties. Any loss or corruptio
n ofconfidential or proprietary data through a breach may:
•
impact our operations, revenue, strategic objectives, customer and vendor relationships;•
expose us to legal claims and/or regulatory investigations and proceedings;•
require extensive repair and restoration costs for additional security measures to avert future attacks; and•
impair our reputation and limit our competitiveness for future opportunities.•
impact our financial and accounting systems and, subsequently, our ability to correctly record, process and report financial information.We have implemented measures to help prevent unauth
orized access to our systems and facilities, including certain measures to comply withmandatory regulatory reliability standards. To date, cyber-attacks have not had a materia
l impact on our operations or financial results. We continueto assess potential threats and vulnerabiliti
es and make investments to address them, including global monitoring of networks and systems,identifying and implementing n
ew technology, improving user awareness through employee security training, and updating our security policies aswell as those for third-party providers. We cannot guarantee the extent to which our security measures wil
l prevent future cyber-attacks and securitybreaches or that our insurance coverage will ad
equately cover any losses we may experience. Further, we do not control certain of joint ventures orour equity method investments and cannot guarantee that their efforts will be effective.
Certain of our businesses are sensitive to variations in weather and hydrology.
Our businesses are affected by variations in general we
ather patterns and unusually severe weather. Our businesses forecast electric salesbased on best available informatio
n and expectations for weather, which represents a long-term historical average. While we also consider possiblevariations in normal weather patterns and potentia
l impacts on our facilities and our businesses, there can be no assurance that such planning canprevent these impacts, which can adversely affect our business. Generally, dema
nd for electricity peaks in winter and summer. Typically, whenwinters are warmer than expected and summers are cooler than expected, demand for energy is l
ower, resulting in less demand for electricity thanforecasted. Significant variations from normal weather where our busi
nesses are located could have a material impact on our results of operations.Changes in weather can also affect the productio
n of electricity at power generation facilities, including, but not limited to, our wind and solarfacilities. For example, the level of wind resource affects the revenue produc
ed by wind generation facilities. Because the levels of wind and solarresources are variable and difficult to predict, our results of operations for indivi
dual wind and solar facilities specifically, and our results ofoperations generally, may vary significantly from period to perio
d, depending on the level of available resources. To the extent that resources are notavailable at planned l
evels, the financial results from these facilities may be less than expected. In addition, we are dependent upon hydrologicalconditions prevailing from time to time in the broad geograp
hic regions in which our hydroelectric generation facilities are located. Changes intemperature, precipitation and snow pack conditi
ons also could affect the amount and timing of hydroelectric generation.To the extent that hydrological conditions result in dro
ughts or other conditions negatively affect our hydroelectric generation business, such ashas happened in Panama i
n 2019, our results of operations can be materially adversely affected. Additionally, our contracts in certain marketswhere hydroelectric facilities are prevalent may require us to purch
ase power in the spot markets when our facilities are unable to operate atanticipated levels and the price of such spot po
wer may increase substantially in times of low hydrology.Severe weather and natural disasters may present significant risks to our business.
Weather conditions directly influence the dema
nd for electricity and natural gas and other fuels and affect the price of energy and energy-related commodities. In addition, severe weather and natura
l disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, icing events, earthquakes, damfailures and tsunamis can be destructive and coul
d prevent us from operating our business in the normal course by causing power outages andproperty damage, reducing revenue, affecting the avail
ability of fuel and water, causing injuries and loss of life, and requiring us to incur additionalcosts, for example, to restore service and repair damaged facilities, to obtain replacement po
wer and to access available financing sources. Ourpower plants could be placed at greater risk of damage sh
ould changes in the global climate produce unusual variations in temperature and weatherpatterns, resulting in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, includ
ing heatwaves, fewer cold temperature extremes, abnormal levels ofprecipitation resulting in river and coastal urb
an floods in North America or reduced water availability and increased flooding across Central andSouth America, and changes in coast lines d
ue to sea level change.
64 | 2021 Annual ReportDepending on the nature and l
ocation of the facilities and infrastructure affected, any such incident also could cause catastrophic fires;releases of natural gas, natural gas odorant, or other greenhous
e gases; explosions, spills or other significant damage to natural resources orproperty belonging to third parties; personal in
juries, health impacts or fatalities; or present a nuisance to impacted communities. Such incidents mayalso impact our business partners, supply chains an
d transportation, which could negatively impact construction projects and our ability to provideelectricity and natural gas to our customers.
A disruption or failure of electric generation, transmission or distributi
on systems or natural gas production, transmission, storage or distributionsystems in the event of a hurricane, tornado or other severe weather event, or otherwise, could prevent us from operating our bus
iness in thenormal course and could result in any of the adverse conse
quences described above. At our businesses where cost recovery is available, recoveryof costs to restore service and repair damaged facilities is or may be subject to regulatory approva
l, and any determination by the regulator not topermit timely and full recovery of the costs incurred. Any of the foregoing could have a material adv
erse effect on our business, financial condition,results of operations, reputation and prospects.
Our development projects are subject to substantial uncertainties.
We are in various stages of developing and co
nstructing power plants and renewables projects. Certain of these projects have signed long-term contracts or made similar arrangements for the sale of electricity. Successful completion of the development of these projects dep
ends uponovercoming substantial risks, including risks relati
ng to siting, financing, engineering and construction, permitting, governmental approvals,commissioning delays, supply chai
n related disruptions to our access to materials, or the potential for termination of the power sales contract as aresult of a failure to meet certain milestones. In certain cases, our subsidiaries may enter into oblig
ations in the development process even thoughthey have not yet secured financing, PPAs, or other important elements for a successful project. For example, our subsi
diaries may instructcontractors to begin the construction process or seek to procure equipment without hav
ing financing, a PPA or critical permits in place (or enter intoa PPA, procurement agreement or other agreement without agreed financ
ing). If the project does not proceed, our subsidiaries may retain certainliabilities. Furthermore, we may undertake significant dev
elopment costs and subsequently not proceed with a particular project. We believe thatcapitalized costs for projects under development are recovera
ble; however, there can be no assurance that any individual project reach commercialoperation. If development efforts are not successful, we may abandon certain projects, resultin
g in, writing off the costs incurred, expensing relatedcapitalized development costs incurred a
nd incurring additional losses associated with any related contingent liabilities.We do not control certain aspects of our joint ventures or our equity method investments.
We have invested in some joint ventures in which o
ur subsidiaries share operational, management, investment and/or other control rights withour joint venture partners. In many cases, we may exert influence over the joint venture pursuant to a manageme
nt contract, by holding positions onthe board of the joint venture company or on management committees and/or through certain l
imited governance rights, such as rights to vetosignificant actions. However, we do not always h
ave this type of influence over the project or business and we may be dependent on our jointventure partners or the management team of the joint venture to operate, manage, invest or otherwise control such proj
ects or businesses. Our jointventure partners or the management team of our joint ventures may not have the level of experience, techn
ical expertise, human resources,management and other attributes necessary to operate these projects or busin
esses optimally, and they may not share our business priorities. Insome joint venture agreements in which we do hav
e majority control of the voting securities, we have entered into shareholder agreements grantingminority rights to the other shareholders.
The approval of joint venture partners also may be required for us to receive distrib
utions of funds from jointly owned entities or to transfer ourinterest in projects or businesses. The control or influence exerted by o
ur joint venture partners may result in operational management and/orinvestment decisions that are different from the decisions we would make a
nd could impact the profitability and value of these joint ventures. Inaddition, if a joint venture partner becomes insolve
nt or bankrupt or is otherwise unable to meet its obligations to or share of liabilities for the jointventure, we may be responsible for meeting certain oblig
ations of the joint ventures to the extent provided for in our governing documents orapplicable law.
Further, we have a significant equity method investment in Flue
nce. As a publicly listed company, Fluence is governed by its own Board ofDirectors, whose members have fiduciary duties to the Fluence shareh
olders. While we have certain rights to appoint representatives to the FluenceBoard of Directors, the interests of the Fluence

65 | 2021 Annual Reportshareholders, as represented by the Fluence Bo
ard of Directors, may not align with our interests or the interests of our securityholders.In addition, we are generally depe
ndent on the management team of our equity method investments to operate and control such projects orbusinesses. While we may exert influence pursua
nt to having positions on the boards of such investments and/or through certain limited governancerights, such as rights to veto significant actions, we do not always have this type of influ
ence and the scope and impact of such influence may belimited. The management teams of our equity method investments may not have the level of experi
ence, technical expertise, human resources,management and other attributes necessary to operate these projects or busin
esses optimally, and they may not share our business priorities,which could have a material adverse effect on valu
e of such investments as well as our growth, business, financial condition, results of operationsand prospects.
Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may impact our financial results and position.
Our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations results primarily from the translation exposure assoc
iated with the preparation of theConsolidated Financi
al Statements, as well as from transaction exposure associated with transactions in currencies other than an entity's functionalcurrency. While the Consolidated Financ
ial Statements are reported in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of several of our subsidiaries outsidethe U.S. are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency a
nd translated into U.S. dollars by applying appropriate exchange rates. Asa result, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currenc
ies where our foreign subsidiaries report could causesignificant fluctuations in our results. In addition, whi
le our foreign operations expenses are generally denominated in the same currency ascorresponding sales, we have transaction ex
posure to the extent receipts and expenditures are not denominated in the subsidiary's functionalcurrency. Moreover, the costs of doing business abroad may increase as a result of adverse excha
nge rate fluctuations.We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates.
We routinely enter into contracts to hedge a portion of our purchase and sal
e commitments for electricity, fuel requirements and othercommodities to lower our financial exposure relate
d to commodity price fluctuations. As part of this strategy, we routinely utilize fixed price orindexed forward physical purchase a
nd sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or onexchanges. We also enter into contracts which help us mana
ge our interest rate exposure. However, we may not cover the entire exposure of ourassets or positions to market price or interest rate volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. Furthermore, the risk management practices we
have in place may not always perform as planned. In particul
ar, if prices of commodities or interest rates significantly deviate from historical prices orinterest rates or if the price or interest rate volatility or distribution of these changes deviates from historical norms, our risk management practices
may not protect us from significant losses. As a result, fluctuating commodity prices or interest rates may negatively impact our financial results to
the extent we have unhedged or inad
equately hedged positions. In addition, certain types of economic hedging activities may not qualify for hedgeaccounting under U.S. GAAP, resulting in increas
ed volatility in our net income. The Company may also suffer losses associated with "basis risk,"which is the difference in performance between the he
dge instrument and the underlying exposure (usually the pricing node of the generationfacility). Furthermore, there is a risk that the current counterparties to these arrangements may fail or are unable to perform part or all of their
obligations under these arrangeme
nts, while we seek to protect against that by utilizing strong credit requirements and exchange trades, theseprotections may not fully cover the exposure in the event of a counterparty default. For our businesses w
ith PPA pricing that does not completelypass through our fuel costs, the businesses attempt to manage the exposure through flex
ible fuel purchasing and timing of entry and terms of ourfuel supply agreements; however, these risk management efforts may not be successful and the resulti
ng commodity exposure could have amaterial impact on these businesses and/or our results of operations.
Our utilities businesses may experience slower growth in customers or in customer usage.
Customer growth and customer usage in our utilities busin
esses are affected by external factors, including mandated energy efficiencymeasures, demand side management requirements, and eco
nomic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and incomegrowth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall l
evel of economic activity. A lack of growth, or a decline, in the number of customersor in customer demand for electricity may cause us to not realize the anticipated benefits from significa
nt investments and expenditures and have amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial cond
ition, results of operations and prospects.
66 | 2021 Annual ReportSome of our subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans and their net pension plan obligations may
require additional significant contributions.
We have 32 defined benefit plans, five at U.S. subsidi
aries and the remaining plans at foreign subsidiaries, which cover substantially all of theemployees at these subsidiaries. Pensi
on costs are based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of returnon pension plan assets, the expected life sp
an of pension plan beneficiaries and the discount rate used to determine the present value of futurepension obligations. Any of these ass
umptions could prove to be incorrect, resulting in a shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pensionobligations under the pensi
on plan. We periodically evaluate the value of the pension plan assets to ensure that they will be sufficient to fund therespective pension obligati
ons. Downturns in the debt and/or equity markets, or the inaccuracy of any of our significant assumptions underlying theestimates of our subsidiaries' pension pl
an obligations, could result in a material increase in pension expense and future funding requirements. Oursubsidiaries that participate in these pla
ns are responsible for satisfying the funding requirements required by law in their respective jurisdictions forany shortfall of pension plan assets as compared to pens
ion obligations under the pension plan, which may necessitate additional cash contributionsto the pension plans that could adversely affect our and o
ur subsidiaries' liquidity. See Item 7.—Management's Discussion  and Analysis—CriticalAccounting Policies and Estimates—
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans and Note 15— Benefit Plans  included in Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
. Impairment of goodwill or long-lived assets would negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net
worth.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately $
1.2 billion of goodwill, which represented approximately 4% of our total assets.Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment at least annu
ally, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. We may berequired to evaluate the potential impairment of goo
dwill outside of the required annual evaluation process if we experience situations, such as:deterioration in general economic co
nditions or our operating or regulatory environment; increased competitive environment; lower forecastedrevenue; increase in fuel costs, particularly costs that we are unable to pass throu
gh to customers; increase in environmental compliance costs;negative or declining cash flows; loss of a key contract or customer, particularly whe
n we are unable to replace it on equally favorable terms;developments in our strategy; divestiture of a significant compone
nt of our business; or adverse actions or assessments by a regulator. These typesof events and the resulting analyses could resu
lt in goodwill impairment. Additionally, goodwill may be impaired if our acquisitions do not perform asexpected. Long-lived assets are initial
ly recorded at fair value, are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful lives, and are evaluated forimpairment only when impairment indicators, similar to those describ
ed above for goodwill, are present. Any impairment of goodwill or long-livedassets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financ
ial condition, results of operations, and prospects.Risks associated with Government
al Regulation and LawsOur operations are subject to significant government regulation and could be adversely affected by changes in the
law or regulatory schemes.
Our ability to predict, influence or respond appropriately to cha
nges in law or regulatory schemes, including obtaining expected or contractedincreases in electricity tariff or contract rates or tariff adjustments for increased expenses, could adversely impact our results of operations.
Furthermore, changes in laws or regulations or changes i
n the application or interpretation of regulatory provisions in jurisdictions where we operate,particularly at our utilities where electricity tariffs are subject to regulatory review or approva
l, could adversely affect our business, including:•
changes in the determination, definition or classification of costs to be included as reimbursable or pass-through costs to be included in therates we charge our customers, including but not limited to costs incurred to upgrade o
ur power plants to comply with more stringentenvironmental regulations;
•
changes in the determination of an appropriate rate of return on invested capital or that a utility's operating income or the rates it chargescustomers are too high, resulting in a rate reduction or consumer rebates;
•
changes in the definition or determination of controllable or non-controllable costs;•
changes in tax law;•
changes in law or regulation that limit or otherwise affect the ability of our counterparties (including sovereign or private parties) to fulfill theirobligations (includin
g payment obligations) to us;
67 | 2021 Annual Report•
changes in environmental law that impose additional costs or limit the dispatch of our generating facilities;•
changes in the definition of events that qualify as changes in economic equilibrium;•
changes in the timing of tariff increases;•
other changes in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions;•
other changes related to licensing or permitting which affect our ability to conduct business; or•
other changes that impact the short- or long-term price-setting mechanism in the our markets.Furthermore, in many countries where we conduct business, the regulatory env
ironment is constantly changing and it may be difficult to predictthe impact of the regulations on our businesses. The impacts describ
ed above could also result from our efforts to comply with European MarketInfrastructure Regulation, which includes regu
lations related to the trading, reporting and clearing of derivatives and similar regulations may bepassed in other jurisdictions where we co
nduct business. Any of the above events may result in lower operating margins and financial results for theaffected businesses.
Several of our businesses are subject to potentially significant remediation expenses, enforcement initiatives,
private party lawsuits and reputational risk associated with CCR.
CCR generated at our current and former coal-fired generation pla
nt sites, is currently handled and/or has been handled by: placement inonsite CCR ponds; disposal an
d beneficial use in onsite and offsite permitted, engineered landfills; use in various beneficial use applications,including encapsul
ated uses and structural fill; and used in permitted offsite mine reclamation. CCR currently remains onsite at several of ourfacilities, including in CCR p
onds. The EPA's final CCR rule provides that enforcement actions can be commenced by the EPA, states, or territories,and private lawsuits. Compliance with the U.S. federa
l CCR rule; amendments to the federal CCR rule; or federal, state, territory, or foreign rules orprograms addressing CCR may require us to incur substantial costs. In additi
on, the Company and our businesses may face CCR-related lawsuitsin the United States and/or internationally that may expos
e us to unexpected potential liabilities. Furthermore, CCR-related litigation may alsoexpose us to unexpected costs. In addition, CCR, and its producti
on at several of our facilities, have been the subject of significant interest fromenvironmental non-governmental orga
nizations and have received national and local media attention. The direct and indirect effects of such mediaattention, and the demands of responding to and a
ddressing it, may divert management time and attention. Any of the foregoing could have amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial cond
ition, results of operations, reputation and prospects.Some of our U.S. businesses are subject to the provisions of various laws and regulations administered by FERC,
NERC and by state utility commissions that can have a material effect on our operations.
The AES Corporation is a registered electric hol
ding company under the PUHCA 2005 as enacted as part of the EPAct 2005. PUHCA 2005eliminated many of the restrictions that had been in place u
nder the U.S. Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, while continuing to provideFERC and state utility commissions with enhance
d access to the books and records of certain utility holding companies. PUHCA 2005 also createsadditional potential cha
llenges and opportunities. By removing some barriers to mergers and other potential combinations, the creation of large,geographically disperse
d utility holding companies is more likely. These entities may have enhanced financial strength and therefore an increasedability to compete with us in the U.S..
Other parts of the EPAct 2005 allow FERC to remove the PURPA purchase/sa
le obligations from utilities if there are adequate opportunities tosell into competitive markets. FERC has exercised this power with a rebuttab
le presumption that utilities located within the control areas of MISO,PJM, ISO New England, Inc., the New York Independent System Operator, Inc., and ERCOT are not required to purchase or sell po
wer from or toQFs above a certain size. Additionally, FERC has the p
ower to remove the purchase/sale obligations of individual utilities on a case-by-case basis.While these changes do not affect existing contracts, certain of our QFs that have had sales contracts expire are no
w facing a more difficult marketenvironment and that is likely to continue for other AES QFs with existing co
ntracts that will expire over time.FERC strongly encourages competition in w
holesale electric markets. Increased competition may have the effect of lowering our operatingmargins. Among other steps, FERC has encouraged RTOs and ISOs to develo
p demand response bidding programs as a mechanism forresponding to peak electric demand. These pro
grams may reduce the value of generation assets. Similarly, FERC is encouraging the constructionof new transmission

68 | 2021 Annual Reportinfrastructure in accordance with provisions of EPAct 2005. Alth
ough new transmission lines may increase market opportunities, they may alsoincrease the competition in our existing markets.
FERC has civil penalty authority over violati
ons of any provision of Part II of the FPA, which concerns wholesale generation or transmission, aswell as any rule or order issued thereunder. The FPA als
o provides for the assessment of criminal fines and imprisonment for violations under theFPA. This penalty authority was enhanced i
n EPAct 2005. As a result, FERC is authorized to assess a maximum penalty authority established bystatute and such penalty authority has been and w
ill continue to be adjusted periodically to account for inflation. With this expanded enforcementauthority, violations of the FPA and FERC's regul
ations could potentially have more serious consequences than in the past.Pursuant to EPAct 2005, the NERC has been certified by FE
RC as the ERO to develop mandatory and enforceable electric system reliabilitystandards applicable through
out the U.S. to improve the overall reliability of the electric grid. These standards are subject to FERC review andapproval. Once approved, the reliability stand
ards may be enforced by FERC independently, or, alternatively, by the ERO and regional reliabilityorganizations with responsibi
lity for auditing, investigating and otherwise ensuring compliance with reliability standards, subject to FERC oversight.Violations of NERC reliabi
lity standards are subject to FERC's penalty authority under the FPA and EPAct 2005.Our U.S. utility businesses face significant regulation by the
ir respective state utility commissions. The regulatory discretion is reasonably broadin both Indiana and Ohio and inc
ludes regulation as to services and facilities, the valuation of property, the construction, purchase, or lease ofelectric generating facilities, the classificatio
n of accounts, rates of depreciation, the increase or decrease in retail rates and charges, the issuance ofcertain securities, the acquisition and sale of some pu
blic utility properties or securities and certain other matters. These businesses face the risk ofunexpected or adverse regulatory action whic
h could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.See Item 1.
— Business—US and Utilities SBU. Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws, rules and regulations.
Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws a
nd regulations by many federal, regional, state and local authorities, internationaltreaties and foreign governmental authorities. These l
aws and regulations generally concern emissions into the air, effluents into the water, use ofwater, wetlands preservation, remediation of contaminatio
n, waste disposal, endangered species and noise regulation. Failure to comply with suchlaws and regulations or to obtain or comply with any ass
ociated environmental permits could result in fines or other sanctions. For example, inrecent years, the EPA has issued NOVs to a number of coal-fired generating pl
ants alleging wide-spread violations of the new source review andprevention of significant deterioration provis
ions of the CAA. The EPA has brought suit against and obtained settlements with many companies forallegedly making major modificatio
ns to a coal-fired generating units without proper permit approvals and without installing best available controltechnology. The primary focus of these NOVs has been emissions of SO
 and NO  and the EPA has imposed fines and require d companies toinstall improved pollution control tech
nologies to reduce such emissions. In addition, state regulatory agencies and non-governmental environmentalorganizations have pursued civi
l lawsuits against power plants in situations that have resulted in judgments and/or settlements requiring theinstallation of expensive pol
lution controls or the accelerated retirement of certain electric generating units.Furthermore, Congress and other domestic and foreign governmental a
uthorities have either considered or implemented various laws andregulations to restrict or tax certain emissions, particularly those involving a
ir emissions and water discharges. These laws and regulations haveimposed, and proposed laws and reg
ulations could impose in the future, additional costs on the operation of our power plants. See Item 1.—
Business—Environmental and Land-Use Regulations. We have incurred and will continue to inc
ur significant capital and other expenditures to comply with these and other environmental laws andregulations. Changes in, or new deve
lopment of, environmental restrictions may force us to incur significant expenses or expenses that may exceedour estimates. There can be no assurance that we would be ab
le to recover all or any increased environmental costs from our customers or that ourbusiness, financial conditio
n, including recorded asset values or results of operations, would not be materially and adversely affected.2x 
69 | 2021 Annual ReportConcerns about GHG emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change have led to increased
regulation and other actions that could impact our businesses.
International, federal and various region
al and state authorities regulate GHG emissions and have created financial incentives to reduce them.In 2021, the Company's subsidiaries op
erated businesses that had total CO emissions of approximately 47 million metric tonnes, approximate ly 16million of which were emitted by our U.S. businesses (both figures are o
wnership adjusted). The Company uses CO emission estimation methodologies supported by "The Greenho
use Gas Protocol" reporting standard on GHG emissions. For existing power generation plants, COemissions data are either obtained directly from plant contin
uous emission monitoring systems or calculated from actual fuel heat inputs and fueltype CO
 emission factors. The estimated annual CO  emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric power generation facilities of the Comp any'ssubsidiaries that are in construction or developme
nt are approximately 4 million metric tonnes (ownership adjusted). This estimate is based on anumber of projections and assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, such as the forecasted dispatch, antic
ipated plant efficiency, fuel type, COemissions rates and our subsidiaries' ach
ieving completion of such construction and development projects. While actual emissions may varysubstantially; the projects under construction or develo
pment when completed will increase emissions of our portfolio and therefore could increasethe risks associated with regulation of GHG emissions.
There currently is no U.S. federal legislation imposi
ng mandatory GHG emission reductions (including for CO) that affects our electric power generation facilities; however, in 201
5, the EPA promulgated a rule establishing New Source Performance Standards for CO emissions for newly constructed and modified/reconstructed fossil-fueled el
ectric utility steam generating units larger than 25 MW and in 2018 proposed revisions to therule. In 2019, the EPA promulgated the Affordable Cle
an Energy (ACE) Rule which establishes heat rate improvement measures as the best systemof emissions reductions for existing coal-fired electric generati
ng units. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated and remanded to EPA theACE Rule although the parties hav
e the opportunity to request a rehearing at the D.C. Circuit or seek a review of the decision by the U.S. SupremeCourt. The impact of this decision and potential new or revise
d rules from the current Administration remains uncertain. In 2010, the EPA adoptedregulations pertaining to GHG emissions that require ne
w and existing sources of GHG emissions to potentially obtain new source review permitsfrom the EPA prior to construction or modification. In 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that such permitting would on
ly be required if suchsources also must obtain a new source review permit for increases in other regul
ated pollutants. For further discussion of the regulation of GHGemissions, see Item 1.
— Business—Environmental and Land-Use Regulations—U.S. Environmental and Land-Use Legislation and Regulations—Greenhouse Gas Emissions
 above. The Parties to the United Nations Framework Conventi on on Climate Change's Paris Agreement established along-term goal of keeping the increase in gl
obal average temperature well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. We anticipate that the ParisAgreement will continue the trend toward efforts to decarbonize the g
lobal economy and to further limit GHG emissions. The impact of GHGregulation on our operations wil
l depend on a number of factors, including the degree and timing of GHG emissions reductions required under anysuch legislation or regulation, the cost of emissions red
uction equipment and the price and availability of offsets, the extent to which market basedcompliance options are availa
ble, the extent to which our subsidiaries would be entitled to receive GHG emissions allowances without having topurchase them in an auction or on the open market and the impact of such leg
islation or regulation on the ability of our subsidiaries to recover costsincurred through rate increases or otherwise. The costs of compliance cou
ld be substantial.Our non-utility, generation subsidiaries seek to pass o
n any costs arising from COemissions to contract counterparties. Likewise, our utility subsidiaries seek to pass on any costs arising from CO
 emissions to customers. However, there can be no assurance that we will effectively pass such costs onto the contract counterparties or customers, respectively, or that the cost and burden associated with any disp
ute over which partybears such costs would not be burdensome and costly.
Furthermore, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Ch
ange, physical risks from climate change could include, but are notlimited to, increased runoff and earlier spring peak disc
harge in many glacier and snow-fed rivers, warming of lakes and rivers, an increase in sealevel, and changes and variab
ility in precipitation and in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. Physical impacts may have thepotential to significantly affect our business and o
perations. For example, extreme weather events could result in increased downtime and operationand maintenance costs at our electric power transmission and d
istribution assets and facilities. Variations in weather conditions, primarilytemperature and humidity, would also be expecte
d to affect the energy needs of customers. A decrease in energy consumption could decrease ourrevenues. In addition, while revenues w

70 | 2021 Annual Reportexpected to increase if the energy consumption of customers increased, such i
ncrease could prompt the need for additional investment ingeneration capacity.
In addition to government regulators, many groups, includi
ng politicians, environmentalists, the investor community and other private partieshave expressed increasing concern a
bout GHG emissions. New regulation, such as the initiatives in Chile, Hawaii, and the Puerto Rico EnergyPublic Policy Act, may adversely affect our operations. See Item 7.
— Management's Discussion and Analysis—Key Trends and Uncertainties—Decarbonization Initiatives
.  Responding to these decarbonization initiatives, including developments in our strategy in line with these initiatives maypresent challenges to our business. We may be unab
le to develop our renewables platform as quickly as anticipated. Further, we may be unable todispose of coal-fired generation assets at anticip
ated prices, the estimated useful lives of these assets may decrease, and the value of such assetsmay be impaired. These initiatives could als
o result in the early retirement of coal-fired generation facilities, which could result in stranded costs ifregulators disallow full recovery of investments.
Negative public perception of our GHG emissions co
uld have an adverse effect on our relationships with third parties, our ability to attractadditional customers, our business devel
opment opportunities, and our ability to access finance and insurance for our coal-fired generation assets.In addition, plaintiffs previously brought tort lawsuits that were dismiss
ed against the Company because of its subsidiaries' GHG emissions.Future similar lawsuits may prevail or result in damages awards or other relief. We may also be sub
ject to risks associated with the impact onweather conditions. See 
Certain of our businesses are sensitive to variations in w eather and hydrology and Severe weather and natural disastersmay present significant risks to our business and adversely affect our financi
al results within this section for more information. If any of the foregoing risks materialize, costs may increase or revenues may decrease and there could be a materia
l adverse effect on our results of operations, financialcondition,cash flows and reputation.
Concerns about data privacy have led to increased regulation and other actions that could impact our businesses.
In the ordinary course of business, we collect and retain sensitiv
e information, including personal identifiable information about customers,employees, customer energy usage and other information as we
ll as information regarding business partners and other third parties, some of whichmay constitute confidential information. The theft, damage or improper disclosure of sens
itive electronic data collected by us can subject us topenalties for violation of applica
ble privacy laws, subject us to claims from third parties, require compliance with notification and monitoringregulations, and harm o
ur reputation. Although we maintain technica l and organizational measures to protect personal identifiable information andother confidential information, breaches of, or disruptions to, our information techn
ology systems could result in legal claims, liability or penaltiesunder privacy laws or damage to operations or to the company's reputati
on, which could adversely affect our business.We are also subject to various data privacy and security laws and reg
ulations globally, as well as contractual requirements, as a result ofhaving access to and processing confid
ential and personal identifiable information in the course of business. If we are unable to comply withapplicable laws and reg
ulations or with our contractual commitments, as well as maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriatecontrols with respect to privacy and security requirements, we may suffer regulatory consequences that cou
ld be costly or otherwise adversely affectour business. In addition, any actual or perceived fai
lure on the part of one of our equity affiliates could have a material adverse impact on ourresults of operations and prospects.
Tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect us.
We operate in the U.S. and various non-U.S. jurisdictions an
d are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state and localgovernments and of many non-U.S. jurisdictions. From time to time, legislative measures may be enacted that cou
ld adversely our overall taxpositions regarding income or other taxes, our effective tax rate or tax payments. For example, in the third quarter of 2021, both the United States
Senate and the United States House of Repres
entatives passed $3.5 trillion budget resolutions as a first step to the budget reconciliation processthat could include U.S. corporate and internatio
nal tax reforms. As part of the reconciliation process, the House Ways and Means Committeemarked up a version of the “Build Back Better Act”. The Build Back Better Act included U.S. corporate a
nd international tax reform proposals thatwould increase the U.S. corporate income tax rate, modify the Global Intangib
le Low Taxed Income rules, create additional interest deductionlimitations and provide clean en
ergy incentives, among others. The Company believes it would benefit
71 | 2021 Annual Reportfrom the clean energy initiatives, though the tax implications may be u
nfavorable in the short term. As of the filing date, the Build Back Better Acthad not been voted on in the United States Se
nate.With respect to international tax reform, in the third quarter of 2021,132 member countries of the OECD “Inclusive Framework” group released
a statement announcing a coordinated framework that wou
ld reallocate taxing rights over the profits of multinational corporations and establish aglobal minimum tax at a 15% rate. On December 20, 2021 the OECD released a set of Model Ru
les related to the so-called Pillar 2 global minimumtax known as the Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE). On December 22, 20
21, the European Commission proposed a draft Directive establishing aglobal minimum level of taxation. The proposa
l, if approved by all 27 EU Member States, would require each Member State to transpose theDirective into their respective national laws by D
ecember 31, 2022 for the Income Inclusion Rule to come into effect as of January 1, 2023 and theUnder Taxed Payments Rule to come into effect January 1, 2024. The Sub
ject to Tax Rule was excluded from the draft Directive. These Rules,collectively, comprise the main facets of the GloBE. The potential impact to the Company is n
ot known, but may be material. Implementation of theframework would require multilateral agreement and/or cou
ntry specific legislative action, including in the U.S.Risks Related to our Indebte
dness and Financial ConditionWe have a significant amount of debt.
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $19 b
illion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis. All outstanding borrowingsunder The AES Corporation's revolvi
ng credit facility are unsecured. Most of the debt of The AES Corporation's subsidiaries, however, is secured bysubstantially all of the assets of those subsidiaries. A substa
ntial portion of cash flow from operations must be used to make payments on our debt.Furthermore, since a significant percentage of our assets are used to secure this debt, this reduces the amou
nt of collateral available for futuresecured debt or credit support and reduces our flexibility in o
perating these secured assets. This level of indebtedness and related security couldhave other consequences
, including:•
making it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations;•
increasing our vulnerability to general adverse industry and economic conditions, including adverse changes in foreign exchange rates,interest rates and commodity prices;
•
reducing available cash flow to fund other corporate purposes and grow our business;•
limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;•
placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged; and•
limiting, along with financial and other restrictive covenants relating to such indebtedness, our ability to borrow additional funds, pay cashdividends or repurchase common stock.
The agreements governing our indebte
dness, including the indebtedness of our subsidiaries, limit, but do not prohibit the incurrence ofadditional indebted
ness. If we were to become more leveraged, the risks described above would increase. Further, our actual cash requirementsmay be greater than expected and our cash flows may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstand
ing debt as it becomes due. In that event, we maynot be able to borrow money, sell assets, raise equity or otherwise raise funds o
n acceptable terms to refinance our debt as it becomes due. Inaddition, our ability to refinance existing or future ind
ebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at that time. Anyrefinancing of our debt could result in high
er interest rates or more onerous covenants that restrict our business operations. See Note 11— Debtincluded in Item 8.
— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a schedule of our debt maturities. The AES Corporation's ability to make payments on its outstanding indebtedness is dependent upon the receipt of
funds from our subsidiaries.
The AES Corporation is a holdin
g company with no material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Almost all of The AES Corporation'scash flow is generated by the operating activities of its subsi
diaries. Therefore, The AES Corporation's ability to make payments on its indebtednessand to fund its other obligations is depen
dent not only on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate cash, but also on the ability of the subsidiaries todistribute cash to it in the form of dividends, fees, interest, tax sharing payments, loans or otherwise.Our subsidiaries face vari
ous restrictions in theirability to distribute cash. Most of the subsidiaries are obligate
d, pursuant to loan agreements, indentures or non-recourse financing arrangements, tosatisfy certain restricted payment covenants or other conditions before they may make distributions. Busi
ness performance and local accounting andtax rules may also limit dividend distributions. Subs
idiaries in foreign countries may also be prevented from distributing funds as a
72 | 2021 Annual Reportresult of foreign governments restricting the repatriation of funds or the conversion of currencies. Our subsidiari
es are separate and distinct legalentities and, unless they have expressly guara
nteed The AES Corporation's indebtedness, have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay anyamounts due pursuant to such debt or to make any funds availabl
e whether by dividends, fees, loans or other payments.Existing and potential future defaults by subsidiaries or affiliates could adversely affect us.
We attempt to finance our domestic and foreign projects through non-recourse debt or "non-recourse fin
ancing" that requires the loans to berepaid solely from the project's revenues and provid
e that the repayment of the loans (and interest thereon) is secured solely by the capital stock,physical assets, contracts and cash flow of that project subsidiary or affiliate. As of December 31, 202
1, we had approximately $19 billion ofoutstanding indebtedness o
n a consolidated basis, of which approximately $3.8 billion was recourse debt of the Parent Company and approximately$14.8 billion was non-recourse d
ebt. In some non-recourse financings, the Parent Company has explicitly agreed, in the form of guarantees,indemnities, letters of credit, letter of credit reimbursement agreements and agreements to pay, to undertake certain limited obl
igations andcontingent liabilities, most of which wil
l only be effective or will be terminated upon the occurrence of future events.Certain of our subsidiaries are in default with respect to all or a portio
n of their outstanding indebtedness. The total debt classified as current inour Consolidated Balanc
e Sheets related to such defaults was $237 million as of December 31, 2021. While the lenders under our non-recoursefinancings generally do not hav
e direct recourse to the Parent Company, such defaults under non-recourse financings can:•
reduce the Parent Company's receipt of subsidiary dividends, fees, interest payments, loans and other sources of cash because asubsidiary will typically be proh
ibited from distributing cash to the Parent Company during the pendency of any default;•
trigger The AES Corporation's obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or other credit support provided toor on behalf of such subsidiary;
•
trigger defaults in the Parent Company's outstanding debt. For example, The AES Corporation's revolving credit facility and outstandingsenior notes include events of default for certain bankruptcy relate
d events involving material subsidiaries and relating to accelerations ofoutstanding material debt of material subsidiari
es or any subsidiaries that in the aggregate constitute a material subsidiary; or•
result in foreclosure on the assets that are pledged under the non-recourse financings, resulting in write-downs of assets and eliminatingany and all potential future benefits derive
d from those assets.None of the projects that are in default are owned by subsid
iaries that, individually or in the aggregate, meet the applicable standard ofmateriality in The AES Corporation's revolvi
ng credit facility or other debt agreements to trigger an event of default or permit acceleration under suchindebtedness. However, as a result of future mix of distributions, write-down of assets, dispositi
ons and other changes to our financial position andresults of operations, one or more of these subsidiaries, individ
ually or in the aggregate, could fall within the applicable standard of materiality andthereby upon an acceleration of such subsi
diary's debt, trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of Parent Company indebtedness.The AES Corporation has significant cash requirements and limited sources of liquidity.
The AES Corporation requires cash primarily to fund: princi
pal repayments of debt, interest, dividends on our common stock, acquisitions,construction and other project commitments, other equity commitments (including business d
evelopment investments); equity repurchases; taxesand Parent Company overhead costs. Our principal sources of li
quidity are: dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries, proceeds fromfinancings at the Parent Company, and proceeds from asset sales. See Item 7.—
Management's Discussion and An alysis —Capital Resources andLiquidity
. We believe that these sources will be adequate to meet our obl igations for the foreseeable future, based on a number of materialassumptions about access the capital or commercial lend
ing markets, the operating and financial performance of our subsidiaries, exchange rates,our ability to sell assets, and the ability of our subsidiari
es to pay dividends and other distributions; however, there can be no assurance that thesesources will be available w
hen needed or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than expected. In addition, our cash flow may not besufficient to repay our debt obligations at maturity and we may have to refinance suc
h obligations. There can be no assurance that we will besuccessful in obtaining such refinanc
ing on acceptable terms.
73 | 2021 Annual ReportOur ability to grow our business depends on our ability to raise capital on favorable terms.
We rely on the capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by op
erating cash flows. Our ability to arrange forfinancing on either a recourse or non-recourse basis a
nd the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors, some of which are beyondour control, including: general econ
omic and capital market conditions; the availability of bank credit; the availability of tax equity partners; thefinancial condition, performance and pros
pects of AES as well as our competitors; and changes in tax and securities laws. Should access to capitalnot be available to us, we may have to sell assets or cease further investments, includ
ing the expansion or improvement of existing facilities, any ofwhich would affect our future growth.
A downgrade in the credit ratings of The AES Corporation or its subsidiaries could adversely affect our access to the
capital markets, interest expense, liquidity or cash flow.
If any of the credit ratings of the The AES Corporation and its subsidiaries were to be d
owngraded, our ability to raise capital on favorableterms could be impaired and our borrowing costs could i
ncrease. Furthermore, counterparties may no longer be willing to accept general unsecuredcommitments by The AES Corporation to provide credit support. Accordingly, we may be req
uired to provide some other form of assurance, such asa letter of credit and/or collateral, to backstop or replace any credit support by The AES Corporati
on, which reduces our available credit. There canbe no assurance that counterparties will accept such g
uarantees or other assurances.The market price of our common stock may be volatile.
The market price and trading volumes of our common stock could fluctuate substantial
ly due to factors including general economic conditions,conditions in our industry and our markets, environmental an
d economic developments, and general credit and capital markets conditions, as wellas developments specific to us, including risks descri
bed in this section, failing to meet our publicly announced guidance or key trends and othermatters described in Item 7.—

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
We maintain offices in many places around the world, gen
erally pursuant to the provisions of long- and short-term leases, none of which webelieve are material. With a few exceptions, our facilities, which are d
escribed in Item 1— Business of this Form 10-K, are subject to mortgages orother liens or encumbrances as part of the project's related finance facil
ity. In addition, the majority of our facilities are located on land that is leased.However, in a few instances, no accompanying pro
ject financing exists for the facility, and in a few of these cases, the land interest may not besubject to any encumbrance and is owned o
utright by the subsidiary or affiliate.ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
The Company is involved in certain cla
ims, suits and legal proceedings in the normal course of business. The Company has accrued forlitigation and claims when it is proba
ble that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Companybelieves, based upon information it currently poss
esses and taking into account established reserves for estimated liabilities and its insurancecoverage, that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings and actio
ns is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidatedfinancial statements. It is reasonably possible, howev
er, that some matters could be decided unfavorably to the Company and could require theCompany to pay damages or make expenditures in amou
nts that could be material, but cannot be estimated as of December 31, 2021.In December 2001, Grid Corporation of Odisha (“GRIDCO”) served a notice to arbitrate pursuant to the Indian Arbitration and C
onciliation Actof 1996 on the Company, AES Orissa Distribution Private Limite
d (“AES ODPL”), and Jyoti Structures (“Jyoti”) pursuant to the terms of theshareholders agreement between GRIDCO, the Company, AE
S ODPL, Jyoti and the Central Electricity Supply Company of Orissa Ltd. (“CESCO”),an affiliate of the Company. In the arbitration, GRIDCO asserted that a comfort letter issued by the Company in connection with the C
ompany'sindirect investment in CESCO obligates the Comp
any to provide additional financial support to cover all of CESCO's financial obligations toGRIDCO. GRIDCO appeared to be seeking approximately $18
9 million in damages, plus undisclosed penalties and interest, but a detailed allegeddamage analysis was not filed by GRIDCO. The Company co
unterclaimed against GRIDCO for damages. In June 2007, a 2-to-1 majority of thearbitral tribunal rendered its award rejecting GRIDCO's cla
ims and holding that none of the respondents, the Company, AES ODPL, or Jyoti, had
74 | 2021 Annual Reportany liability to GRIDCO. The respondents' countercla
ims were also rejected. A majority of the tribunal later awarded the respondents, including theCompany, some of their costs relating to the arbitration. GRIDCO filed challenges of the tribuna
l's awards with the local Indian court. GRIDCO'schallenge of the costs award has been dismiss
ed by the court, but its challenge of the liability award remains pending. A hearing on the liabilityaward has not taken place to date. The Company bel
ieves that it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itselfvigorously in these proceedings; ho
wever, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts.Pursuant to their environmental audit, AES Sul an
d AES Florestal discovered 200 barrels of solid creosote waste and other contaminants at apole factory that AES Florestal had been operatin
g. The conclusion of the audit was that a prior operator of the pole factory, Companhia Estadual deEnergia (“CEEE”), had been using those contami
nants to treat the poles that were manufactured at the factory. On their initiative, AES Sul and AESFlorestal communicated with Brazilian auth
orities and CEEE about the adoption of containment and remediation measures. In March 2008, theState Attorney of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil filed a public civil acti
on against AES Sul, AES Florestal and CEEE seeking an orderrequiring the companies to mitigate the contaminated are
a located on the grounds of the pole factory and an indemnity payment of approximatelyR$6 million ($1 million). In October 2011, the State Attorney filed a request for an inj
unction ordering the defendant companies to contain andremove the contamination immediately. The court granted inju
nctive relief on October 18, 2011, but determined that only CEEE was required toperform the removal work. In May 2012, CEEE began the removal work in compliance w
ith the injunction. The case is now awaiting judgment. Theremoval and remediation costs are estimated to be approximately R$
10 million to R$41 million ($2 million to $7 million), and there could beadditional costs which cannot be estimate
d at this time. In June 2016, the Company sold AES Sul to CPFL Energia S.A. and as part of the sale,AES Guaiba, a holding company of AE
S Sul, retained the potential liability relating to this matter. The Company believes that there are meritoriousdefenses to the claims asserted against it and will defe
nd itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will besuccessful in its efforts.
In February 2017, the EPA issued a NOV for DPL Stuart Station, allegi
ng violations of opacity in 2016. On May 31, 2018, Stuart Station wasretired, and on December 20, 2019, it was transferred to an unaffiliated third-party purchaser, alo
ng with the associated environmental liabilities.In October 2015, AES Indiana received a similar NOV all
eging violations at Petersburg Station. In addition, in February 2016, AES Indianareceived an NOV from the EPA alleging viol
ations of NSR and other CAA regulations, the Indiana SIP, and the Title V operating permit atPetersburg Station. On August 31, 2020, AES Indiana reac
hed a settlement with the EPA, the DOJ and IDEM, resolving these purported violationsof the CAA at Petersburg Station. The settlement agreement, in the form of a proposed judicial co
nsent decree, was approved and entered by theU.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana on March 23, 2021, and includes, among other items, the follow
ing requirements: annual capson NO
 and SO  emissions and more stringent emissions limits than AES India na's current Title V air permit; payment of civil penalties totaling $1.5million; a $5 million environmenta
l mitigation project consisting of the construction and operation of a new, non-emitting source of generation at thesite; expenditure of $0.3 million on a state-only enviro
nmentally beneficial project to preserve local, ecologically-significant lands; and retirement ofUnits 1 and 2 prior to July 1, 2023. If AES Indiana does not meet the retirement obligati
on, it must install a Selective Non-Catalytic ReductionSystem on Unit 4.
In September 2015, AES Southland Dev
elopment, LLC and AES Redondo Beach, LLC filed a lawsuit against the California CoastalCommission (the “CCC”) over the CCC's determination that the site of AES Redon
do Beach included approximately 5.93 acres of CCC-jurisdictionalwetlands. The CCC has asserted that AES Redo
ndo Beach has improperly installed and operated water pumps affecting the alleged wetlands inviolation of the California Coastal Act an
d Redondo Beach Local Coastal Program. Potential outcomes of the CCC determination could include anorder requiring AES Redondo B
each to perform a restoration and/or pay fines or penalties. AES Redondo Beach believes that it has meritoriousarguments concerning the underlying C
CC determination, but there can be no assurances that it will be successful. On March 27, 2020, AESRedondo Beach, LLC sold the site to an u
naffiliated third-party purchaser that assumed the obligations contained within these proceedings. On May26, 2020, CCC staff sent AES a Notice of Violation (NOV) directing AE
S to submit a Coastal Development Permit (“CDP”) application for theremoval of the water pumps within the alleged wetla
nds. AES has submitted the CDP to the permitting authority, the City of Redondo Beach (“theCity”), with respect to AES’s plans to disable or remove the pumps. The NOV also directed AE
S to submit technical analysis regarding additionalwater pumps located within onsite electrical va
ults and a CDP application for their continued operation. AES has responded to the CCC, providingthe requested analysis and seekin
g further discussion with the agency regarding the CDP. On October 14, 2020, the City deemed the CDPapplication to be complete and in
dicated a public hearing will be required, at whichx2 
75 | 2021 Annual Reporttime AES must present additional information and an
alysis on the pumps within the alleged wetlands and the onsite electrical vaults.In January 2017, the Superintendenci
a del Medio Ambiente (“SMA”) issued a Formulation of Charges asserting that Alto Maipo is in violation ofcertain conditions of the Environmental Approv
al Resolution (“RCA”) governing the construction of Alto Maipo’s hydropower project, for, amongother things, operating vehicles at unauthoriz
ed times and failing to mitigate the impact of water infiltration during tunnel construction (“InfiltrationWater”). In February 2017, Alto Maipo submitted a compliance plan (“Complianc
e Plan”) to the SMA which, if approved by the agency, wouldresolve the matter without materially impacting construction of the project. In April 2018, the SMA approv
ed the Compliance Plan (“April 2018Approval”). Among other things, the Compliance Pla
n as approved by the SMA requires Alto Maipo to obtain from the Environmental EvaluationService (“SEA”) a definitive interpretation of the RCA’s provisio
ns concerning the authorized times to operate certain vehicles. A number of lawsuitshave been filed in relation to the April 2
018 Approval. These lawsuits were consolidated into one process in the Second Environmental Tribunal ofSantiago ("Tribunal"). In October 2021, the Tribunal issued a ruli
ng in favor of Alto Maipo and the SMA, upholding the validity of the CompliancePlan and dismissing all cons
olidated lawsuits. This ruling was appealed. The appeal is now in the Chilean Supreme Court, which is consideringwhether to accept the appeal. Further, in January 2022, Alto Maipo rece
ived the definitive interpretation of the RCA´s provisions concerning theauthorized times to operate certain vehicles. According
ly, Alto Maipo intends to request that the Compliance Plan be declared fulfilled and formallyclosed. If the Compliance Plan is ultimately decl
ared to be fulfilled and closed, and if the above-referenced appeal is dismissed, the Formulation ofCharges will be discharged w
ithout penalty. Otherwise, Alto Maipo could be subject to penalties, and the project could be negatively impacted. AltoMaipo will pursue its interests vigorously in these matters; however, there can be n
o assurances that it will be successful in its efforts.In June 2017, Alto Maipo terminated one of its contractors, Constructora Nuevo Maipo S.A. (“CNM”), given CNM’s stoppag
e of tunnelingworks, its failure to produce a completion plan, and its other breaches of contract. Also, Alto Maip
o drew $73 million under letters of credit (“LCFunds”) in connection with its termination of CNM. Alto Maipo initiate
d arbitration against CNM to recover excess completion costs and otherdamages totaling at least $236 millio
n (net of the LC Funds) relating to CNM’s breaches (“First Arbitration”). CNM denied liability and sought adeclaration that its termination was wrongful, damages al
legedly resulting from that termination, and other relief. CNM alleged that it was entitled todamages ranging from $70 million to $170 mil
lion (which included the LC Funds) plus interest and costs, based on various scenarios. Alto Maipocontested these submissions. The evidentiary he
aring in the First Arbitration took place May 20-31, 2019, and closing arguments were heard June9-10, 2020. Also, in August 2018, CNM purported to initiate a se
parate arbitration against AES Andes and the Company (“Second Arbitration”). Inthe Second Arbitration, CNM sought to pierce Alto Maipo’s corp
orate veil and appeared to seek an award holding AES Andes and the Companyjointly and severally liabl
e to pay any alleged net amounts that are found to be due to CNM in the First Arbitration or otherwise. The SecondArbitration was consolidated into the First Arbitration. In October 2021, the Tribun
al issued a final and enforceable Partial Award in favor of AltoMaipo. The Tribunal held, among other things, that Alto Maip
o properly terminated the relevant tunneling contract and that Alto Maipo’s draw of theLC Funds was proper. Also, the Tribunal determined that Alto Mai
po was entitled to be paid additional damages of nearly $107 million (net afteroffsets) and that interest would accrue on the total amount of damages awarded unti
l paid by CNM. The Tribunal also dismissed the SecondArbitration as moot. The Tribunal reserved for further proceedings, the issues of the interest to be paid by CNM an
d, as to all parties, the award oflegal fees and costs. To date, CNM has not paid the damages aw
arded to Alto Maipo. Instead, CNM has made an application for an immaterialcorrection to the Partial Award. CNM has also filed an appl
ication to revise the Partial Award seeking to reduce the net damages awarded to AM toapproximately $42 million. Alto Maipo w
ill contest the application for revision. In the meantime, the Tribunal has established the schedule for thenext phase of the proceedings relating to interest, fees, and costs. Each of Alto Maipo, AE
S Andes, and the Company believes it has meritoriousclaims and/or defenses and will pursue its interests vig
orously; however, there can be no assurances that each will be successful in its efforts.In October 2017, the Maritime Prosecution Office from Valparaíso issued a ruling alleg
ing responsibility by AES Andes for the presence of coalwaste on Ventanas beach, and propos
ed a fine before the Maritime Governor. AES Andes submitted its statement of defense, denying theallegations. An evidentiary stage w
as concluded and then re-opened by order of the Maritime Governor on February 5, 2019 to allow AES Andes anopportunity to present reports and other evidence to challe
nge the grounds of the ruling. AES Andes has completed its presentation of evidence andawaits the Maritime Prosecution Office’s decision of the case. In May 2021, AES And
es was notified of an amended Opinion of the MaritimeProsecution Office which extends the allege
d liability to a third party and
76 | 2021 Annual Reportreduces the proposed fine to AES Andes to approx
imately $372,000. AES Andes responded to the new Opinion on May 31. On August 18, theMaritime Governor issued a resolution affirming the proposed fine, and o
n September 8, AES Andes filed an administrative action with the MaritimeGovernor requesting reconsideration of the fine. On December 28, 202
1 the resolution rejecting the reinstatement appeal was notified and onJanuary 17, 2022 AES Andes filed a
n appeal against that ruling. AES Andes believes that it has meritorious defenses to the allegations; however,there are no assurances that it will be successful in defend
ing this action.In December 2018, a lawsuit was filed in Domin
ican Republic civil court against the Company, AES Puerto Rico, and three other AESaffiliates. The lawsuit purports to be brought on behalf of over 100 D
ominican claimants, living and deceased, and appears to seek relief relating toCCRs that were delivered to the Dominican Re
public in 2004. The lawsuit generally alleges that the CCRs caused personal injuries and deaths anddemands $476 million in al
leged damages. The lawsuit does not identify, or provide any supporting information concerning, the alleged injuries ofthe claimants individually. Nor does the l
awsuit provide any information supporting the demand for damages or explaining how the quantum wasderived. The relevant AES companies be
lieve that they have meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against them and will defend themselvesvigorously in this proceeding; how
ever, there can be no assurances that they will be successful in their efforts.In February 2019, a separate lawsuit was filed in Domi
nican Republic civil court against the Company, AES Puerto Rico, two other AESaffiliates, and an unaffiliated company an
d its principal. The lawsuit purports to be brought on behalf of over 200 Dominican claimants, living anddeceased, and appears to seek relief relatin
g to CCRs that were delivered to the Dominican Republic in 2003 and 2004. The lawsuit generallyalleges that the CCRs caused persona
l injuries and deaths and demands over $900 million in alleged damages. The lawsuit does not identify, orprovide any supporting information concern
ing, the alleged injuries of the claimants individually. Nor does the lawsuit provide any informationsupporting the demand for damages or explain
ing how the quantum was derived. In August 2020, at the request of the relevant AES companies, thecase was transferred to a different civil court. Preliminary hearings are ongoin
g in that court. The relevant AES companies believe that they havemeritorious defenses to the claims asserted against them and will d
efend themselves vigorously in this proceeding; however, there can be noassurances that they will be successful in their efforts.
In October 2019, the Superintendency of the Environment (the "SMA") notified AES An
des of certain alleged breaches associated with theenvironmental permit of the Ventanas Complex, initiati
ng a sanctioning process through Exempt Resolution N° 1 / ROL D-129-2019. The allegedcharges include exceedin
g generation limits, failing to reduce emissions during episodes of poor air quality, exceeding limits on discharges to thesea, and exceeding noise limits. AES A
ndes has submitted a proposed “Compliance Program” to the SMA for the Ventanas Complex. The latestversion of this Compliance Program was submitted on May 26, 2021. On Decemb
er 30, 2021, the Compliance Program was approved by the SMA.However an ex officio action was brought by the SMA due to al
leged exceedances of generation limits, which would require the Company to reduceSO2, NOx and PM emissions in order to achieve the emissions offset establishe
d in the Compliance Program. On January 6, 2022, AES Andes fileda reposition with the SMA seeking modificatio
n of the means for compliance with the ex officio action. The reposition filing is currently under reviewby the SMA. The effects of the ex officio action are suspended until the reposition is reso
lved, but the SMA ruling is otherwise unaffected. Fines arepossible if the SMA determines there is an unsatisfactory execution of the Comp
liance Program. The cost of proposed Compliance Program isapproximately $10.8 million.
In March 2020, Mexico’s Comisión Federal de Electrici
dad (“CFE”) served an arbitration demand upon AES Mérida III. CFE makes allegationsthat AES Mérida III is in breach of its obligations under a power and ca
pacity purchase agreement ("Contract") between the two parties, whichallegations relate to CFE’s own fail
ure to provide fuel within the specifications of the Contract. CFE seeks to recover approximately $190 million inpayments made to AES Merida under the Contract as well as approximate
ly $431 million in alleged damages for having to acquire power fromalternative sources in the Yucatan Penins
ula. AES Mérida has filed an answer denying liability to CFE and asserting a counterclaim for damagesdue to CFE’s breach of its obligations. The parties submitted the
ir respective initial briefs and supporting evidence in December 2020. Afteradditional briefing, the evide
ntiary hearing took place in November 2021. Closing arguments are scheduled for May 2022. Subsequently, thearbitration Tribunal will issue its decis
ion in the case. AES Mérida believes that it has meritorious defenses and claims and will assert themvigorously in the arbitration; however, there can be no assura
nces that it will be successful in its efforts.In February 2022, a lawsuit was filed in Dominic
an Republic civil court against the Company. The lawsuit purports to be brought on behalf ofover 425 Dominican claimants, living a
nd deceased, and appears to seek relief relating to CCRs that were delivered to the Dominican Republic in2003 and 2004. The lawsui
t generally alleges
77 | 2021 Annual Reportthat the CCRs caused personal injuries a
nd deaths and demands over $600 million in alleged damages. The lawsuit does not identify or provide anysupporting information concerning the al
leged injuries of the claimants individually. Nor does the lawsuit provide any information supporting thedemand for damages or explaining ho
w the quantum was derived. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims assertedagainst it and will defend itself vigoro
usly in this proceeding; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts.ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES

81 | 2021 Annual ReportITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RES
ULTS OF OPERATIONSExecutive Summary
In 2021, AES delivered on its strategic and financ
ial objectives. We completed construction or the acquisition of 2.1 GW of renewablesgeneration and signed lo
ng-term PPAs for an additional 5 GW of new renewables. Fluence completed its IPO and began trading in November 2021.See 
Overview of our Strategy included in Item 1.— Business  of this Form 10-K for further information. Compared with last year, diluted earnings per share from continu
ing operations decreased $0.68, from $0.06 to a loss of $0.62. This decreasereflects the loss on deconsolidation of Alto Maip
o in the current period, higher current year impairments, and lower contributions from Brazil due tothe prior year revision of the GSF liability and drier hydrology; partia
lly offset by higher margins at our US and Utilities SBU including newrenewables, Southland En
ergy, and Southland, lower Parent Company interest expense due to realized gains on de-designated interest rate swapsand lower interest rates, gains on Fluence capita
l raisings, a gain on remeasurement of our interest in sPower's development platform, and lowerincome tax expense.
Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP measure, increased $
0.08, from $1.44 to $1.52, mainly reflecting higher contributions from our US and UtilitiesSBU, including new renew
ables and Southland Energy, higher generation at Chivor due to the life extension project completed in the prior year andbetter hydrology, and lower Parent Company interest expe
nse due to realized gains on de-designated interest rate swaps and lower interest rates;partially offset by a higher adjusted tax rate, lower contributions from Brazil due to the prior year revisi
on of the GSF liability and drier hydrology, theprior year impacts of a gain on sale of land in the U.S., incremental capital
ized interest in Chile, and recovery of previously expensed payments fromcustomers in Chile; and the impact of the inclusion of shares und
erlying the purchase contract component of our March 2021 equity units issuance.

Consolidated Operating Margin
 — Operating margin increased $344 million, or 15%, in 2020 compared to 2019, driven by:•
$370 million in South America primarily due to the drivers discussed above, as well as a $184 million favorable revision to the GSF liability atTietê related to the passage of a regulation provid
ing concession extensions to hydro plants as compensation for prior period non-hydrological risk charges incorrectly assessed by the reg

86 | 2021 Annual ReportGeneral and administrative expenses decre
ased $31 million, or 16%, to $165 million for 2020 compared to $196 million for 2019, primarily dueto a higher reallocation of information technol
ogy costs to the SBUs and lower professional fees, partially offset by higher development costs.Interest expense
Interest expense decreased $127 millio
n, or 12%, to $911 million for 2021, compared to $1,038 million for 2020 primarily due to realized gainson de-designated interest rate swaps, lower interest rates related to refinanc
ing at the Parent Company and lower monetary correction due to theGSF settlement in March 2021.
Interest expense decreased $12 million, or 1%, to $1,038 mill
ion for 2020, compared to $1,050 million for 2019 primarily due to incrementalcapitalized interest in Chile an
d lower interest rates due to refinancing at the Parent Company, partially offset by lower capitalized interest due to thecommencement of operations at the Alamitos and Huntington B
each facilities in February 2020.Interest income
Interest income increased $30 million, or 11%, to $298 milli
on for 2021, compared to $268 million for 2020 primarily due to the arbitrationproceeding in Chile, the commencement of a sales-type l
ease at the AES Energy Storage Alamitos project in January 2021, and higher CAMMESAinterest rates on receivables in Argentina, partially offset by a low
er loan receivable balance in Vietnam.Interest income decreased $50 million, or 16%, to $268 milli
on for 2020, compared to $318 million for 2019 primarily due to the decrease of theLIBOR rate on receivables in Argentina, a lower lo

Loss on extinguishment of debt decreased $1
08 million, or 58%, to $78 million for 2021, compared to $186 million for 2020. This decrease wasprimarily due to prior year losses of $145 million and $
34 million at the Parent Company and DPL, respectively, resulting from the redemption ofsenior notes and a $16 million loss resu
lting from the Panama refinancing. These decreases were partially offset in 2021 by a loss of $27 million dueto the prepayment at AES Brasil, losses at Argentina and AES A
ndes of $17 million and $14 million, respectively, due to repayments, and arefinancing resulting in a loss at Andres of $14 mil
lion.Loss on extinguishment of debt increased $1
7 million, or 10% to $186 million for 2020, compared to $169 million for 2019. This increase wasprimarily due to the increases mentioned above p
artially offset by losses of $45 million at DPL, $31 million at Mong Duong, $29 million at AESAndes, $28 million at Colon, and $
24 million at Cochrane in 2019 resulting from the redemption or refinancing of senior notes.See Note 11—
Debt  included in Item 8.— Financial Statements  and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information. Other income
Other income increased $335 million to $41
0 million for 2021, compared to $75 million for 2020 primarily due to the current year gain onremeasurement of our equity interest in the sPower development platform to its acquisitio
n-date fair value, recognized as part of the merger to formAES Clean Energy Develo
pment, legal arbitration at Alto Maipo, and the gain on remeasurement of contingent consideration of the Great CoveSolar acquisition at Clean En
ergy, partially offset by the prior year gain on sale of Redondo Beach land at Southland.Other income decreased $70 million, or 48% to $75 milli
on for 2020, compared to $145 million for 2019 primarily due to 2019 gains oninsurance recoveries associated with prop
erty damage at the Andres facility and upgrading the tunnel lining at Changuinola, partially offset by the2020 gain on sale of Redondo
 Beach land at Southland.Other expense
Other expense increased $7 million, or 13%, to $60 milli
on for 2021, compared to $53 million for 2020 primarily due to a current year lossrecognized at commencement of a sales-type lease at AES Ren
ewable Holdings and an increase in loss on sale and disposal of assets, partiallyoffset by lower losses on sales of Stabilization Fun
d receivables in Chile and compliance with an arbitration decision in 2020.
87 | 2021 Annual ReportOther expense decreased $27 million, or 34% to $53 mil
lion for 2020, compared to $80 million for 2019 primarily due to 2019 lossesrecognized at commencement of sales-type leases at AES Ren
ewable Holdings, the 2019 loss on disposal of assets at Changuinola associated withupgrading the tunnel lini
ng, and lower defined benefit plan costs at AES Indiana in 2020, partially offset by a loss on sale of Stabilization Fundreceivables in Chile and 
compliance with an arbitration decision in 2020.See Note 21—

Gain (loss) on disposal and sale of business interests
Loss on disposal and sale of busi
ness interests increased $1,588 million to $1,683 million for 2021, compared to $95 million for 2020, primarilydue to the $2,074 million loss on the deco
nsolidation of Alto Maipo, partially offset by the issuance of new shares by Fluence, our equity methodinvestment, to new investors, which AES has accounted for as a gain o
n the partial disposition of its investment in Fluence, and the gain on the saleof Guacolda.
Loss on disposal and sale of busi
ness interests was $95 million for 2020, primarily due to the loss on sale of Uruguaiana and the loss on thesettlement of the arbitration related to the sale of Kazakhstan HPPs, partially offset by the gain o
n sale of OPGC; as compared to a gain of $28million for 2019, primarily due to the gain on sale of a portio
n of our interest in sPower's operating assets, the gain on the merger of Simple Energyto form Uplight, and the gain on transfer of Stuart and Killen, partially offset by the loss on sale of Ki
lroot and Ballylumford.See Note 24—

 of this Form 10-K for further information. Asset impairment expense
Asset impairment expense increased $711 mil
lion to $1,575 million for 2021, compared to $864 million for 2020. This increase was primarilydue to impairments of $649 million and $15
5 million related to AES Andes’ commitment to accelerate the retirement of the Ventanas 3 & 4 andAngamos coal-fired plants, respectively, a $475 mill
ion impairment at Puerto Rico associated with the economic costs and reputational risks ofdisposal of coal combustion residua
ls off island, impairments of $29 million, $73 million, and $91 million at Buffalo Gap I, II, and III wind generationfacilities, respectively, due to an expired PPA an
d volatile spot prices in the ERCOT market, and a $67 million impairment at the Mountain View I & IIwind facilities related to a repowering pro
ject that will result in decommissioning the majority of the existing wind turbines in advance of theirdepreciable lives. The increase w
as partially offset by the $564 million and $213 million impairments related to the Angamos and Ventanas 1 & 2coal-fired plants in Chile in the prior year and the $
38 million impairment of the generation facility in Hawaii during 2020.Asset impairment expense increased $679 mil
lion to $864 million for 2020, compared to $185 million for 2019. This increase was primarilydriven by a $781 million impairment related to certain co
al-fired plants at AES Andes and a $30 million impairment of the Estrella del Mar I powerbarge in Panama, compared to a $115 millio
n impairment at Kilroot and Ballylumford upon meeting the held-for-sale criteria in 2019.See Note 22—

ny receivables denominated in Euro, partially offset by unrealizedderivative gains on foreign currency derivatives d

n gains of $55 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven byrealized and unrealized g
ains on foreign currency derivatives related to government receivables in Argentina and unrealized gains at the ParentCompany resulting from the appreciation of intercompany receiv
ables denominated in Euro.The Company recognized net foreign currency transactio
n losses of $67 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven byunrealized losses on foreign currency deriv
atives related to government receivables in Argentina and unrealized losses associated with thedevaluation of long-term receivables de
nominated in the Argentine peso.Other non-operating expense
Other non-operating expense was $202 mil
lion and $92 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, due to the other-than-temporary impairment ofthe OPGC equity method investment. In December 2019, an other-than-temporary impairment of $92 million w
as identified at OPGC primarily due tothe estimated market value of the Company's investment and other negative d
evelopments impacting future expected cash flows at the investee. InMarch 2020, the Company recognized an add
itional $43 million other-than-temporary impairment due to the economic slowdown. In June 2020, theCompany agreed to sell its entire stake in the OPGC investment, resulting in an oth
er-than-temporary impairment of $158 million. There were noother non-operating expenses durin
g the year ended December 31, 2021.See Note 8—
Investments in and Advances to Affiliates  included in Item 8.— Financial Statements  and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for furthe
r information.Income tax benefit (expense)
Income tax benefit was $133 million for the twelve months ende
d December 31, 2021, compared to income tax expense of $216 million for thetwelve months ended December 31, 2020. The Comp
any's effective tax rates were 13% and 44% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and2020, respectively.
The net change in the 2021 effective tax rate was primarily due to the 202
1 impacts of the deconsolidation of Alto Maipo and the assetimpairment at Puerto Rico. These impacts were partially offset by the income tax benefit related to effective settlement resultin
g from the examclosure of the Company’s U.S. 2017 tax return. Additionally offsetting the aforeme
ntioned impacts was the benefit associated with the release ofvaluation allowance d
ue to a change in expected realizability of net operating loss carryforwards at one of our Brazilian subsidiaries. The 2020effective tax rate was impacted by the other-than-temporary impairment of the OPGC equity method investment and the loss on sale of the
Company’s entire interest in AES Uruguai
ana, partially offset by the recognition of a federal ITC for the Na Pua Makani wind facility in Hawaii. SeeNote 22—

 Note 24—Held-for-Sale and Dispositions  included in Item 8.— Financial Statements  and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for details of the sale of the Company's entire interest of AES Urugua
iana and the deconsolidation of Alto Maipo.Income tax expense decreased $136 milli
on to $216 million in 2020 as compared to $352 million for 2019. The Company's effective tax rateswere 44% and 35% for the years ended December 31, 2020 a
nd 2019. The net increase in the 2020 effective tax rate was primarily due to the 2020impacts of the drivers cited above. Further, the 2019 rate was impacted by the nondeductib
le losses on the sale of the Company's entire 100%interest in the Kilroot coal and oil-fired plant an
d energy storage facility and the Ballylumford gas-fired plant in the United Kingdom and associatedasset impairments. Further impacting the 2019 effective tax rate were the effects of the Argentine peso devaluati
on to tax expense, as well as topretax income for nondeductible unreal
ized losses on foreign currency derivatives related to government receivables in Argentina. See Note 24—
Held-for-Sale and Dispositions included in Item 8.— Financial Statements  and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for details of the sales. Our effective tax rate reflects the tax effect of significant operations outside the U.S., which are generally taxed at rates different than the U.S.
statutory rate. Foreign earnings may be taxed at rates higher than the U.S. corporate rate of 21% and are also subject to current U.S. taxation und
erthe GILTI rules introduced by the TCJA. A future

Net equity in losses of affiliates decreased $99 mil
lion, or 80%, to $24 million in 2021, compared to $123 million in 2020. This was primarilydriven by earnings at sPower in 2021 of $79 mil
lion, compared to losses in the prior year, driven by renewable projects that came online and prioryear impairments of certain development projects, and $81 milli
on of losses at AES Andes in 2020 mainly due to a long-lived asset impairment andthe suspension of equity method accountin
g at Guacolda. This decrease in losses was partially offset by an increase in losses at Fluence of $45million due to shipping issu
es, cost overruns and delays at projects under construction, and an increase in costs associated with the growingbusiness, as well as an increase in loss
es at Uplight of $10 million due to higher costs associated with the growing business.Net equity in losses of affiliates decreased $49 mil
lion, or 28%, to $123 million in 2020, compared to $172 million in 2019. This was primarilydriven by a $31 million increase in e
arnings due to lower long-lived asset impairments at Guacolda, AES Andes' 50%-owned equity affiliate, during2020 as compared to 2019.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling i
nterests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries decreased $648 million to a loss of $542 million in2021, compared to income of $106 million in 2
020. This decrease was primarily due to:•
Loss on deconsolidation of Alto Maipo due to loss of control after Chapter 11 filing;•
Asset impairments at Buffalo Gap;•
Increased costs associated with growing and accelerating the U.S. renewables development pipeline;•
Lower earnings in Brazil due to the prior year favorable revision of the GSF liability; and•
Lower earnings in the Dominican Republic due to the sale of Itabo in the second quarter.These decreases were partially offset by:
•
Allocation of earnings at Southland Energy to noncontrolling interests;•
Higher earnings in Panama primarily due to the prior year asset impairment and loss on extinguishment of debt; and•
Higher earnings in Colombia due to the life extension project at the Chivor hydroelectric plant completed in the prior year and betterhydrology.
Net income attributable to noncontrolling i
nterests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries decreased $69 million, or 39%, to $106 million in 2020,compared to $175 million in 2019. This d
ecrease was primarily due to:•
Lower earnings in Chile due to long-lived asset impairments at AES Andes, partially offset by net gains from early contract terminations atAngamos and lower interest expense du
e to incremental capitalized interest;•
Lower earnings in Colombia due to drier hydrology and a life extension project at the Chivor hydroelectric plant;•
Prior year insurance recoveries net of outages at Andres; and•
HLBV allocation of losses to noncontrolling interests at AES Renewable Holdings.These decreases were partially offset by:
•
Higher earnings in Brazil due to the favorable revision of the GSF liability; and•
Prior year losses on extinguishment of debt at Mong Duong and Colon.

Net income attributable to The AES Corporation decre
ased $455 million to a loss of $409 million in 2021, compared to income of $46 million in2020. This decrease was primarily due to:
•
Loss on deconsolidation of Alto Maipo due to loss of control after Chapter 11 filing;•
Higher asset impairments in the current year; and•
Lower margins at our South America SBU primarily due to the prior year revision of the GSF liability at Brazil.These decreases were partially offset by:
•
Gain due to the initial public offering of Fluence;•
Gain on remeasurement of our equity interest in the sPower development platform to acquisition-date fair value;•
Prior year other-than-temporary impairment of OPGC;•
Lower Parent interest expense due to realized gains on de-designated interest rate swaps and lower interest rates;•
Prior year losses on extinguishment of debt at the Parent and DPL;•
Higher margins at our US and Utilities SBU primarily due to favorable price variances under the commercial hedging strategy at Southlandand at Southland Energy mainly du

Lower income tax expense.Net income attributable to The AES Corporation decre
ased $257 million, or 85% to $46 million in 2020, compared to $303 million in 2019. Thisdecrease was primarily due to:
•
Long-lived asset impairments at AES Andes and Panama;•
Net impact of current and prior year other-than-temporary impairments of OPGC;•
Higher losses on extinguishment of debt in the current year, primarily due to major refinancings at the Parent Company;•

91 | 2021 Annual ReportNon-GAAP Measures
Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted PTC an
d Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP supplemental measures that are used by management andexternal users of our Consolidated Financ
ial Statements such as investors, industry analysts and lenders.For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company upd
ated the definition of Adjusted EPS item (g) tax benefit or expense related to the enactment effects of 2017 U.S. tax law reform and related regulations and any subse
quent period adjustments related to enactment effects to include the 2021 tax benefit on reversal of uncertai
n tax positions effectively settled upon the closure of the Company's 2017 U.S. tax return exam.Effective January 1, 2021, the Company changed the defi
nitions of Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted PTC, and Adjusted EPS to removethe adjustment for costs directly associated with a major restructuring program, including, but not limited to, workforce reductio
n efforts, relocations,and office consolidation. As this adjustment was sp
ecific to the major restructuring program announced by the Company in 2018, we believeremoving this adjustment from our non-GAAP definitions provides simp
lification and clarity for our investors.For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company chan
ged the definitions of Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPSto exclude net gains at Angamos, one of our business
es in the South America SBU, associated with the early contract terminations with MineraEscondida and Minera Spenc
e. We believe the inclusion of the effects of this non-recurring transaction would result in a lack of comparability in ourresults of operations and would distort the metrics that our investors use to measure us.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company chan
ged the definitions of Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS to exclude gains and lossesrecognized at commencement of sales-type leases. We believe thes
e transactions are economically similar to sales of business interests andexcluding these gains or losses better reflects the underly
ing business performance of the Company.Adjusted Operating Margin
We define Adjusted Operating Margin as Operating Margin, ad
justed for the impact of NCI, excluding (a) unrealized gains or losses related toderivative transactions; (b) benefits and costs associated with disp
ositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures; and(c) net gains at Angamos, one of our businesses in the South America SB
U, associated with the early contract terminations with Minera Escondidaand Minera Spence. The allocatio
n of HLBV earnings to noncontrolling interests is not adjusted out of Adjusted Operating Margin. See Review of Consolidated Results of Operations
 for definitions of Operating Margin and cost of sales. The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted Operating Margin is 
Operating Margin . We believe that Adjusted Operating Margin better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company. Factors in this determin
ation include the impact of NCI, where AES consolidates theresults of a subsidiary that is not wholly owned by the Compa
ny, as well as the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivativetransactions and strategic decisions to dispose of or acqu
ire business interests. Adjusted Operating Margin should not be construed as analternative to Operating Margin, which is determined in accord

Adjusted PTC
We define Adjusted PTC as pre-tax income from continuing op
erations attributable to The AES Corporation excluding gains or losses of theconsolidated entity due to (a) unrealized g
ains or losses related to derivative transactions and equity securities; (b) unrealized foreign currency gainsor losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits and costs associated with dispositi
ons and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, andgains and losses recognized at commenceme
nt of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; (e) gains, losses and costs due to the earlyretirement of debt; and (f) net gains at Angamos, one of our businesses in the South America SBU, assoc
iated with the early contract terminationswith Minera Escondida and Minera Sp
ence. Adjusted PTC also includes net equity in earnings of affiliates on an after-tax basis adjusted for thesame gains or losses excluded from consolidate
d entities.Adjusted PTC reflects the impact of NCI and excludes the items specified i
n the definition above. In addition to the revenue and cost of salesreflected in Operating Margin, Adjusted PTC inclu
des the other components of our Consolidated Statement of Operations, such as general and administrative expenses
 in the Corporate segment, as well as business devel opment costs, interest expense  and interest income,  other expenseand 
other income, realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and net equity in earnings of affiliates . The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted PTC is 
income from continuing operations attributable to The A ES Corporation. We believe that Adjusted PTC better reflects the underlying business p
erformance of the Company and is the most relevant measure considered in theCompany's internal evaluatio
n of the financial performance of its segments. Factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealizedgains or losses related to derivative transactions or equity securiti
es remeasurement, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due toimpairments, strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire busin
ess interests or retire debt, and the non-recurring nature of the impact of the earlycontract terminations at Angamos, which affect results in a given period or periods. In add
ition, Adjusted PTC represents the business performanceof the Company before the application of statutory income tax rates and tax adjustments, inclu
ding the effects of tax planning, corresponding to thevarious jurisdictions in which the Comp
any operates. Given its large number of businesses and complexity, the Company concluded that AdjustedPTC is a more transparent measure that better assists investors in determining which busin
esses have the greatest impact on the Company'sresults.
Adjusted PTC should not be construed as a
n alternative to income from continuing operations attributable to The A ES Corporation, which is determined in accordance with GAAP.

ed gains or losses related to derivative transactions and equity securities; (b)unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, be

ns and any subsequent period adjustmentsrelated to enactment effects, including the 2021 tax benefit on reversal of unc
ertain tax positions effectively settled upon the closure of theCompany's U.S. tax return exam.
The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EPS is dil
uted earnings per share from continuing operations. We believe that AdjustedEPS better reflects the underlying business performance of the Compa
ny and is considered in the Company's internal evaluation of financialperformance. Factors in this determination include the variabi
lity due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions or equitysecurities remeasurement, unrealized foreign currency gai
ns or losses, losses due to impairments, strategic decisions to dispose of or acquirebusiness interests or retire debt, the one-time impact of the 2017 U.S. tax law reform and subsequent period a
djustments related to enactmenteffects, and the non-recurring nature of the impact of the early contract terminations at Angamos, which affect results in a given period or peri
ods.Adjusted EPS should not be construe
d as an alternative to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which is determined inaccordance with GAAP.

94 | 2021 Annual ReportThe Company reported a loss from continuing operatio
ns of $0.62 for the year ended December 31, 2021. For purposes of measuring dilutedloss per share under GAAP, common stock equivalents were exclu

99 | 2021 Annual ReportKey Trends and Uncertainties
During 2022 and beyond, we ex
pect to face the following challenges at certain of our businesses. Management expects that improvedoperating performance at certain businesses, growth from new busin
esses, and global cost reduction initiatives may lessen or offset their impact. Ifthese favorable effects do not occur, or if the challenges described be
low and elsewhere in this section impact us more significantly than wecurrently anticipate, or if volatile foreign currencies and commoditi
es move more unfavorably, then these adverse factors (or other adverse factorsunknown to us) may have a material impact on our operating margin, net income attributa
ble to The AES Corporation and cash flows. We continueto monitor our operations and address challen
ges as they arise. For the risk factors related to our business, see Item 1.—Business  and Item 1A. —
Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. Operational
COVID-19 Pandemic 
— The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted globa l economic activity, including electricity and energy consumption,and caused significant volatil
ity in financial markets intermittently in the last two years. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic we have conducted ouressential operations without sign
ificant disruption. We derive approximately 85% of our total revenues from our regulated utilities and long-termsales and supply contracts or PPAs at our generation bus
inesses, which contributes to a relatively stable revenue and cost structure at most of ourbusinesses. In 2021, our operational loc
ations continued to experience the impact of, and recovery from, the COVID-19 pandemic. Across our globalportfolio, our utilities businesses have ge
nerally performed in line with our expectations consistent with a recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.While we cannot predict the length and magn
itude of the pandemic, including the impact of current or future variants, or how it could impact globaleconomic conditions, a delayed recov
ery with respect to demand may adversely impact our financial results for 2022. Also see Item 1A.—Risk Factors
 of this Form 10-K. We continue to monitor and manage our credit exposures in a prud
ent manner. Our credit exposures have continued in-line with historicallevels and within the customary 45-60 day grace peri
od. We have not experienced material credit-related impacts from our PPA offtakers due to theCOVID-19 pandemic.
Our supply chain management has remained robust duri
ng this challenging time and we continue to closely manage and monitordevelopments. We continue to experience certain min
or delays in some of our development projects, primarily in permitting processes and theimplementation of interconnections, due to governme
nts and other authorities having limited capacity to perform their functions.Operational Sensitivity to Dry Hydrological Conditions
 — Our hydroelectric generation facilities are sensitive to chang es in theweather, particularly the level of water inflows into gen
eration facilities. While our operations in Panama, Colombia, Brazil, and Chile haveexperienced challeng
es arising from dry hydrology from time to time, the current dry hydrological conditions in Brazil have exceeded historicallevels. If these hydrological conditions co
ntinue to persist, we may need to purchase energy at higher prices to fulfill our contractual arrangements.Trade Restrictions and Supply Chain 
— In recent years, increased tensions between the U.S. and Chin a have resulted in policies thatrestrict or increase costs on trade, such as tariffs and import restrictions, that have impacted the renewable energy industry. While we have b
eenable to largely mitigate any material impacts so far, China is the largest supp
lier of raw materials and components used in solar panels. Imports ofsolar panels into the U.S. from China and Southeast Asi
a have been delayed or challenged in certain instances. In addition, substantial shortages inshipping services and disruptio
ns in global supply chain, recent disruptions specific to solar panel imports including the uncertainty around theapplication of additiona
l tariffs on solar panel imports from Southeast Asia, and the potential detainment of panels by U.S. Customs and BorderProtection has further challenged the supply ch
ain related to renewable energy. While we have contracted and substantially secured our expectedrequirements for U.S. solar panels for 2022, these disruptions may persist and impact our supp
liers’ ability or willingness to meet their contractualagreements. AES will continue to monitor devel
opments and take prudent steps towards maintaining a robust supply chain for our renewablesprojects.
Macroeconomic and Political
The macroeconomic and political env
ironments in some countries where our subsidiaries conduct business have changed during 2021. Thiscould result in significant impacts to tax laws and enviro
nmental and energy policies. Additionally, we operate in multiple countries and as such aresubject to volatility in exchange rates at the

100 | 2021 Annual Reportsubsidiary level. See Item 7A.—
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures Ab out Market Risk for fur ther information.Argentina
 — In the run up to the 2019 Presidential elections, the Argentine peso devalued significantly and the government of Argentinaimposed capital controls and anno
unced a restructuring of Argentina’s debt payments. Restrictions on the flow of capital have limited the availabilityof international credit, and economic conditi
ons in Argentina have further deteriorated, triggering additional devaluation of the Argentine peso and adeterioration of the country’s risk profile. Following the el
ection of Alberto Fernández in October 2019, the administration has been evaluatingsolutions to the Argentine economic crisis. On February 27, 2020, the Secretari
at of Energy passed Resolution No. 31/2020 that includes thedenomination of tariffs in local currency indexed by l
ocal inflation, and reductions in capacity payments received by generators. These regulatorychanges have negatively impacte
d our financial results. In addition, Argentina restructured its public debt in 2020 through an agreement with itsinternational creditors. Although the situatio
n in Argentina remains challenging, it has not had a material impact on our current exposures to date,and payments on the long-term receivables for the FONINVEMEM Agreements are current. For further information, see Note 7—
Financing Receivables
 in Item 8.— Financial Statements  and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. Chile
 — On December 19, 2021, Gabriel Boric was elected president of Chi le with 56 percent of the vote in the second round. Boric will takeoffice on March 11, 2022, after two years of political and social turmoil in Chi
le driven by massive protests over inequality, leading the countrythrough the process of writing a new constitution. Boric has decl
ared his goal of introducing significant reforms in key areas such as pensions,education, labor, and health services. To mitigate the fiscal imp
act of these initiatives, Boric also declared his intention to introduce a tax reform toincrease mining royalties and increas
e income, emissions, and wealth taxes among other changes. These and other initiatives could result inregulatory or policy changes that may affect our results of operations in Chile.
The Chilean government held a referen
dum in October 2020, which determined that a new constitution will be drafted by a constitutionalconvention. A second vote was held al
ongside municipal and gubernatorial elections in April 2021 to elect the members of the constitutionalconvention. A third vote, which is expected to occur in 2022, wo
uld accept or reject the new constitution after it is drafted.In November 2019, the Chilean government en
acted Law 21,185 that establishes a Stabilization Fund for regulated energy prices. Historically,the government updated the prices for regulated energy contracts every six months to reflect the indexati
on the contracts have to exchange ratesand commodities prices. The new law freezes regulate
d prices and does not allow the pass-through of these contractual indexation updates tocustomers beyond the pricing in effect at July 1, 2019, until new low
er-cost renewable contracts are incorporated into pricing in 2023. Consequently,costs incurred in excess of the July 1, 2019 price will be accumul
ated and borne by generators. The receivables will be paid by distributioncompanies and the face value will b
e recognized by a Tariff Decree issued by the regulator every six months. In December 2020, AES Andesexecuted an agreement for the sale of the receivables gen
erated pursuant the Tariff Stabilization Law at a discount. See Note 7 —Financing Receivables
 included in Item 8.— Financial Statements  and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information.Puerto Rico
 — Our subsidiaries in Puerto Rico have long-term PPAs with state-owned PREPA, which has been facing economic challengesthat could result in a material adverse effect on our business in Puerto Ric
o.The Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stabi
lity Act (“PROMESA”) was enacted to create a structure for exercising federaloversight over the fiscal affairs of U.S. territories and created procedures for adjusting debt accumulate
d by the Puerto Rico government and,potentially, other territories (“Title III”). PROMESA also expedites the approval of key energy projects and other critical pro
jects in Puerto Rico.PROMESA allowed for the establishment of an Oversight Board w
ith broad powers of budgetary and financial control over Puerto Rico. TheOversight Board filed for bankruptcy on behalf of PREPA un
der Title III in July 2017. As a result of the bankruptcy filing, AES Puerto Rico and AESIlumina’s non-recourse debt of $201 millio
n and $29 million, respectively, continue to be in technical default and are classified as current as ofDecember 31, 2021. The Company is in complia
nce with its debt payment obligations as of December 31, 2021.On January 2, 2020, the Governor of Puerto Rico signed a bill that prohi
bits the disposal and unencapsulated beneficial use of coal combustionresiduals in Puerto Rico. Prior to this bill's approv
al, the Company had put in place arrangements to dispose or beneficially use its coal ash andcombustion residual outside of Puerto Rico.
New factors arose in the first quarter of 2021 associated with the economic costs and operati
onal and reputational risks of disposal of coalcombustion residuals off island. In addition, ne
w legislative initiatives surrounding the prohibition of coal generation assets in Puerto Rico wereintroduced. Collectively, these factors

101 | 2021 Annual Reportalong with management’s decisi
on on how to best achieve our decarbonization goals resulted in an indicator of impairment at its asset group inPuerto Rico. The Company performed an impairment analysis a
nd determined that the carrying amount of its coal-fired long-lived assets was notrecoverable. As a result, the Company recognized asset impairment exp
ense of $475 million.Considering the information avail

 — In July 2017, the United Kingdom Financia l Conduct Authority announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR.In the U.S., the Alternative Reference Rate Committee at the Federal Reserve identifie
d the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") as itspreferred alternative rate for LIBOR; alternative reference rates in other key markets are under development. On March 5, 2021, the Financial
Conduct Authority ("FCA") announced the future cessation or non-represe
ntativeness of the LIBOR benchmark settings, to cease publication of one-week and two-month USD LIBOR rates by December 31, 2021, and exten
ding the cessation dates for the overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month, and 12-month USD LIBOR rates through June 30, 2023. AES ho
lds a substantial amount of debt and derivative contracts referencing LIBORas an interest rate benchmark. In order to facilitate an organized transition from LIBOR to alternative benchmark rate(s), AES has establis
hed aprocess to measure and mitigate risks associated with the cessation of LIBOR. As part of this initiative, alternativ
e benchmark rates have been, andcontinue to be, assessed, and implemented for newly ex
ecuted agreements. Many of AES’ existing agreements include provisions designed tofacilitate an orderly transition from LIBOR, and interest rate derivatives address the LIBOR transition through the a
doption of the ISDA 2020 IBORFallbacks Protocol and subsequ
ent amendments. To the extent that the terms of the credit agreements and derivative instruments do not alignfollowing the cessation of LIBOR rates, AES will seek to ne
gotiate contract amendments with counterparties or additional derivatives contracts.Global Tax 
— The macroeconomic and political enviro nments in the U.S. and some countries where our subsidiaries conduct businesshave changed during 202
0 and 2021. This could result in significant impacts to tax law. For example, the “American Rescue Plan Act of 2021”was signed into law on March 11, 2021. The $1.9 trill
ion act includes COVID-19 relief as well as broader stimulus, but also includes severalrevenue-raising and business tax provis
ions. Two corporate income tax increases partially offset the cost of the bill: the elimination of a beneficialforeign tax credit rule, and the expansion of executive compe
nsation deduction limits effective in 2027.In the third quarter of 2021, both the United States Senate and the United States H
ouse of Representatives passed $3.5 trillion budgetresolutions as a first step to the budget reconciliation process that coul
d include U.S. corporate and international tax reforms. As part of thereconciliation process, the House Ways and Means C
ommittee marked up a version of the “Build Back Better Act”. The Build Back Better Actincluded U.S. corporate and internation
al tax reform proposals that would increase the U.S. corporate income tax rate, modify the GILTI rules,create additional interest deduction l
imitations and provide clean energy incentives, among others. The Company believes it would benefit from theclean energy initiatives, though the tax implic
ations may be unfavorable in the short term. As of the filing date, this legislation has not been voted onin the United States Senate.
With respect to international tax reform, in the third quarter of 2021,132 member countries of the OECD “Inclusive Framework” group released
a statement announcing a coordinated framework that wou
ld reallocate taxing rights over the profits of multinational corporations and establish aglobal minimum tax at a 15% rate. On December 20, 2021 the OECD released a set of Model Ru
les related to the so-called Pillar 2 global minimumtax known as the Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE)
.  On December 22, 2021, the European Commission proposed a draft Directive establishing aglobal minimum level of taxation. The proposa
l, if approved by all 27 EU Member States, would require each Member State to transpose theDirective into their respective national laws by D
ecember 31, 2022 for the Income Inclusion Rule to come into effect as of January 1, 2023 and theUnder Taxed Payments Rule to come into effect January 1, 2024. The Sub
ject to Tax Rule was excluded from the draft Directive. These Rules,collectively, comprise the main facets of the GloBE. The potential impact to the Company is n
ot known, but may be material. Implementation of theframework would require multilateral agreement and/or cou
ntry specific legislative action, including in the U.S.Inflation 
— In the markets in which we operate, there have been higher rates of inflation i n recent months. While most of our contracts in ourinternational businesses are in
dexed to inflation, in general, our U.S.-based generation contracts are not indexed to inflation. If inflation continues toincrease in our markets, it may increase our expenses that we may not be able to pass through to customers. It may also increase the costs of some
of our

102 | 2021 Annual Reportdevelopment projects that could negative
ly impact their competitiveness. Our utility businesses do allow for recovering of operations andmaintenance costs through the regulatory process, which may have timin
g impacts on recovery.Alto Maipo
The Company's subsidiary, Alto Maipo, is currently constructing a hy
droelectric facility near Santiago, Chile which is approximately 99%complete and started generating energy in the fourth quarter of 2021 as p
art of the commissioning process. The Alto Maipo project (the “Project”)has experienced significant constructio
n difficulties, which resulted in a substantial increase in project costs over the original budget and led to aseries of negotiations that resulted in securing ad
ditional funding from creditors and additional equity injections from AES Andes.On March 17, 2017, Alto Maipo completed the first financial and leg
al restructuring of the Project. Following this restructuring, Alto Maipoterminated a construction contract with Constructora Nuevo Maipo S.A. (“CNM”) as a result of CNM’s failure to perform. On July 3, 2017, CNM filed
a claim against Alto Maipo before the International C
hamber of Commerce (“ICC”) for cost overruns and contract termination. Prior to this claim, AltoMaipo issued an arbitration request before the ICC for multiple contract breach
es by CNM. See Item 3.—Legal Proceedings  in this Form 10-K forfurther information and status of the proceedings.
In February 2018, Alto Maipo signed an amend
ed EPC contract with Strabag, which increased the scope of the original contract to incorporateCNM’s work and was approved by the creditors in May 2018 as part of the second restructuring of the Proj
ect.On August 27, 2021, Alto Maipo updated its creditors with respect to the construction bu
dget and long-term business plan for the Project, whichconsiders different scenarios for spot prices, decarbonization i
nitiatives, and hydrological conditions, among other significant variables. Under someof these scenarios, Alto Maipo may experience reduced future cash flo
ws, which would limit its ability to repay debt. Alto Maipo’s managementinitiated negotiations with its creditors to restructure its obligatio
ns and achieve a sustainable long-term capital structure for Alto Maipo.On November 17, 2021, Alto Maipo SpA commenced a reorgan
ization proceeding in accordance with Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,through a voluntary petition. Conseque
ntly, after Chapter 11 filing, The AES Corporation is no longer considered to have control over Alto Maipoand, therefore, derecognized Alto Maipo from its Consolid
ated Balance Sheets and recognized an after-tax loss of approximately $1.2 billion, net ofnoncontrolling interests, in the Consol
idated Statement of Operations in the fourth quarter of 2021, associated with the loss of control attributable tothe former controlling interest.
Alto Maipo is party to a restructuring support agreement to which holders of more than 78% of the outstandin
g senior indebtedness are party,and which contemplates a plan of reorgan
ization in which AES Andes will own all of the equity of the reorganized company. If Alto Maipo is unableto renegotiate the terms of its financial arrangements with its creditors and is unable to meet its obli
gations under those arrangements as they comedue, the creditors may enforce their rights under the credit agreements. These finance agreements are no
n-recourse with respect to The AESCorporation.
Decarbonization Initiatives
Several initiatives have been a
nnounced by regulators and offtakers in recent years, with the intention of reducing GHG emissions generatedby the energy industry. Our strategy of shifting towards clean energy platforms, including rene
wable energy, energy storage, LNG, and modernizedgrids is designed to position us for continue
d growth while reducing our carbon intensity. The shift to renewables has caused certain customers tomigrate to other low-carbon energy solutions and this trend may contin
ue. Certain of our contracts contain clauses designed to compensate for earlycontract terminations, but we cannot guarantee full recovery. In February 2022, the Company a
nnounced its intent to exit coal generation by year-end 2025 versus our prior expectation of a reduction to bel
ow 10% by year-end 2025, subject to necessary approvals. Although the Companycannot currently estimate the financial impact of these decarboniz
ation initiatives, new legislative or regulatory programs further restricting carbonemissions could require material capital ex
penditures, result in a reduction of the estimated useful life of certain coal facilities, or have other materialadverse effects on our financial results. For further discussion of our strategy of shifting towards clean energy p
latforms see Item 1—Executive Summary
. Chilean Decarbonization Plan
 — The Chilean government has announced an initiative to phase out coal power plants by 2040 andachieve carbon neutrality by 2050. On June 4, 201
9, AES Andes signed an agreement
103 | 2021 Annual Reportwith the Chilean government to cease the operati
on of two coal units for a total of 322 MW as part of the phase-out. Under the agreement, Ventanas1 (114 MW) will cease operation in November 2022 a
nd Ventanas 2 (208 MW) in May 2024; however AES Andes has announced its intention toaccelerate the disconnection of these units. On December 26, 20
20, the Chilean government issued Supreme Decree Number 42, which allows coalplants to remain connected to the grid in “strategic reserve status” for five years after ceasing operations, receive a reduced ca
pacity payment, anddispatch, if necessary, to ensure the electric system’s reliability. On December 29, 2020, Venta
nas 1 ceased operation and entered "strategicreserve status." Ventanas 2 is also expected to enter "strategic reserve status" in September 2022. On July 6, 2021, AES And
es and the Chileangovernment signed an amendment to the decarbon
ization agreement to include the Ventanas 3 (267 MW), Ventanas 4 (270 MW), Angamos 1 (277MW), and Angamos 2 (281 MW) plants. The plants will be available for disco
nnection after January 2025, subject to system reliability andsufficiency. The Company performed an impairment analysis at June 3
0, 2021 and determined the carrying amounts of these asset groups were notrecoverable. As a result, AES Andes recognized ass
et impairment expense of $804 million ($540 million net of NCI). See Item 1—Business — SouthAmerica SBU
— Chile for further discussion. Considering the information available as of the filing date, management believes the carrying amount ofour coal-fired long-lived assets in Chil
e of $1.1 billion is recoverable as of December 31, 2021.Puerto Rico Energy Public Policy Act 
—  On April 11, 2019, the Governor of Puerto Rico signed the Puerto Rico Energy Public PolicyAct (“the Act”) establishing guidelines for grid efficiency and e
liminating coal as a source for electricity generation by January 1, 2028. The Actsupports the accelerated deployment of renewab
les through the Renewable Portfolio Standard and the conversion of coal generating facilities toother fuel sources, with compliance targets of 40% by 2025, 60% by 2040, an
d 100% by 2050. AES Puerto Rico’s long-term PPA with PREPAexpires November 30, 2027. PREPA and A
ES Puerto Rico have discussed different strategic alternatives, but have yet to reach any agreement. Anyagreement that may be reached would be subject to len
der and regulatory approval, including that of the Oversight Board that filed for bankruptcyon behalf of PREPA.
 As described under Macroeconomic and Political above, additional factors arose in the first quarter of 2021 with respect to the disposal of coal combustion residua
ls, which contributed to the Company recognizing an asset impairment expense of $475 million. Considering theinformation available as of the filing date, mana
gement believes the carrying amount of our long-lived assets in Puerto Rico of $79 million isrecoverable as of December 31, 2021.
Hawaii 
— In July 2020, the Hawaii State Legislature passed a bill that will prohibit AES Hawaii from generating electricity from coal afterDecember 31, 2022. This bill will restrict the Company from contracting the asset beyo
nd the expiration of its existing PPA, and as a result, AESplans to retire the AES Hawaii coal facility in 2
022. Considering the information available as of the filing date, management believes the carryingamount of our coal-fired long-lived assets in Hawa
ii of $14 million is recoverable as of December 31, 2021.For further information about the risks associated with decarbonizatio
n initiatives, see Item 1A.—Risk Factors — Concerns about GHGemissions and the potential risks associated w
ith climate change have led to increased regulation and other actions that could impact ourbusinesses
 included in this Form 10-K. Regulatory
AES Maritza PPA Review
 — DG Comp is conducting a preliminary review of whether AES Maritza’s PPA with NEK is compliant with theEuropean Union's State Aid rul
es. No formal investigation has been launched by DG Comp to date. However, AES Maritza has been engaging indiscussions with the DG Comp case team and the Government of Bulgaria ("GoB") to attempt to reach a negotiated resoluti
on of the DG Comp’sreview ("PPA Discussions"). The PPA Discussions are o
ngoing and the PPA continues to remain in place. However, there can be no assurance that,in the context of the PPA Discussions, the other parties will not seek a prompt termination of the PP
A.We do not believe termination of the PPA is justified. Neverthe
less, the PPA Discussions involve a range of potential outcomes, including butnot limited to the termination of the PPA and payment of some level of compensatio
n to AES Maritza. Any negotiated resolution would be subject tomutually acceptable terms, lender consent, and DG Comp approva
l. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of the PPA Discussions or whenthose discussions will conclu
de. Nor can we predict how DG Comp might resolve its review if the PPA Discussions fail to result in an agreementconcerning the agency's review. AES Maritza be
lieves that its PPA is legal and in compliance with all applicable laws, and it will take all actionsnecessary to protect its interests, whether through negotiated

104 | 2021 Annual Reportagreement or otherwise. However, there can be no assurance that this matter will be resolv
ed favorably; if it is not, there could be a materialadverse effect on the Company’s financial cond
ition, results of operation, and cash flows.Considering the information avail
able as of the filing date, management believes the carrying value of our long-lived assets at Maritza ofapproximately $959 million is recovera
ble as of December 31, 2021.Foreign Exchange Rates
We operate in multiple countries and as such are subj
ect to volatility in exchange rates at varying degrees at the subsidiary level and betweenour functional currency, the USD, and currencies of the countries in whic
h we operate. In 2019 there was a significant devaluation in the Argentinepeso against the USD, which had an imp
act on our 2019 results. Continued material devaluation of the Argentine peso against the USD could havean impact on our future results. The Argentine economy continues to be cons
idered highly inflationary under U.S. GAAP; as such, all of ourArgentine businesses are reported usin
g the USD as the functional currency. For additional information, refer to Item 7A.—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
. Impairments
Long-lived Assets
 —  During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized asset impairment expense of $1.6 billion. SeeNote 22—
Asset Impairment Expense  included in Item 8.— Financial Statements  and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information.After recognizing these impairment expenses, the carrying valu
e of our long-lived assets that were assessed for impairment in 2021 totaled $243million at December 31, 2021.
Events or changes in circumstances that may necessitate recoverability tests and pote
ntial impairments of long-lived assets may include, butare not limited to, adverse changes in the regulatory environme
nt, unfavorable changes in power prices or fuel costs, increased competition due toadditional capacity in the grid, techno
logical advancements, declining trends in demand, evolving industry expectations to transition away from fossilfuel sources for generation, or an expectation it is more likely than not the asset wil
l be disposed of before the end of its estimated useful life.Goodwill
 — The Company currently has no reporting units considered to be "at risk". A reporting unit is considered "at risk" when its fairvalue does not exceed its carrying amount by 10%. The Compa
ny monitors its reporting units at risk of impairment for interim impairment indicators,and believes that the estimates and assumptions use
d in the calculations are reasonable as of December 31, 2021. Should the fair value of any ofthe Company’s reporting units fall below its carrying amo
unt because of reduced operating performance, market declines, changes in the discountrate, regulatory changes, or other adverse conditions, goodw
ill impairment charges may be necessary in future periods.Capital Resources and Liquidity
Overview
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had unrestricted cash and cas
h equivalents of $943 million, of which $41 million was held at theParent Company and qualified h
olding companies. The Company had $232 million in short-term investments, held primarily at subsidiaries, andrestricted cash and debt service reserves of $541 million. The Compa
ny also had non-recourse and recourse aggregate principal amounts of debtoutstanding of $14.8 billion a
nd $3.8 billion, respectively. Of the $1.4 billion of our current non-recourse debt, $1.1 billion was presented as suchbecause it is due in the next twelve months and $23
7 million relates to debt considered in default due to covenant violations. None of the defaultsare payment defaults but are instead technical defau
lts triggered by failure to comply with covenants or other requirements contained in the non-recourse debt documents, of which $230 million is d
ue to the bankruptcy of the offtaker.We expect current maturities of non-recourse debt to be repaid from net cash provided by operating activiti
es of the subsidiary to which thedebt relates, through opportunistic refinancing activ
ity, or some combination thereof. We have $25 million of recourse debt which matures within thenext twelve months. From time to time, we may elect to repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, privately ne
gotiated transactionsor otherwise when management believ
es that such securities are attractively priced. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing marketconditions, our liquidity requirements, and oth
er factors. The amounts involved in any such repurchases may be material.
105 | 2021 Annual ReportWe rely mainly on long-term debt obligations to fund our construction activ
ities. We have, to the extent available at acceptable terms, utilizednon-recourse debt to fund a significant portion of the capital ex
penditures and investments required to construct and acquire our electric powerplants, distribution companies, and related ass
ets. Our non-recourse financing is designed to limit cross-default risk to the Parent Company or othersubsidiaries and affiliates. Our non-recourse lon
g-term debt is a combination of fixed and variable interest rate instruments. Debt is typicallydenominated in the currency that matches the currency of the revenue expected to be ge
nerated from the benefiting project, thereby reducingcurrency risk. In certain cases, the currency is matched through the use of derivative instruments. The majority of our non-recourse debt is funded
by international commercial banks, with debt capac
ity supplemented by multilaterals and local regional banks.Given our long-term debt obligations, the Company is sub
ject to interest rate risk on debt balances that accrue interest at variable rates. Whenpossible, the Company will borrow funds at fixed i
nterest rates or hedge its variable rate debt to fix its interest costs on such obligations. In addition,the Company has historically tried to maintain at least 70% of its consol
idated long-term obligations at fixed interest rates, including fixing theinterest rate through the use of interest rate swaps. These efforts apply to the notional amount of the swaps compared to the amount of related
underlying debt. Presently, the Parent Company's o
nly material unhedged exposure to variable interest rate debt relates to drawings of $365 millionunder its revolving credit facility. On a consolidated bas
is, of the Company's $18.8 billion of total gross debt outstanding as of December 31, 2021,approximately $2.4 billion bore i
nterest at variable rates that were not subject to a derivative instrument which fixed the interest rate. Brazil holds$1.1 billion of our floating rate non-recourse exp
osure as variable rate instruments act as a natural hedge against inflation in Brazil.In addition to utilizing non-recourse de
bt at a subsidiary level when available, the Parent Company provides a portion, or in certain instancesall, of the remaining long-term financing or credit required to fund dev
elopment, construction or acquisition of a particular project. These investmentshave generally taken the form of equity investments or intercompany loans, wh
ich are subordinated to the project's non-recourse loans. Wegenerally obtain the funds for these investments from our cash flows from operations, proceeds from the sales of assets and/or the procee
ds fromour issuances of debt, common stock and other securities. Similarly, in certain of our business
es, the Parent Company may provide financialguarantees or other credit support for the benefit of counterparties who have entered i
nto contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity, equipment,or other services with our subsidiaries or lenders. In such circumstances, if a business defa
ults on its payment or supply obligation, the ParentCompany will be responsibl
e for the business' obligations up to the amount provided for in the relevant guarantee or other credit support. As ofDecember 31, 2021, the Parent Company had provid
ed outstanding financial and performance-related guarantees or other credit supportcommitments to or for the benefit of our businesses, which were limited by the terms of the agreements, of approximately $2.2 billion i
n aggregate(excluding those collateralize
d by letters of credit and other obligations discussed below).As a result of the Parent Company's split rating, some counterparties may be unwil
ling to accept our general unsecured commitments toprovide credit support. Accordingly, with respect to both new and ex
isting commitments, the Parent Company may be required to provide someother form of assurance, such as a letter of credit, to backstop or replace our credit support. The Parent Company may not be able to provide
adequate assurances to such counterparties. To the extent we are requ
ired and able to provide letters of credit or other collateral to suchcounterparties, this will reduce the amount of credit availab
le to us to meet our other liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2021, we had $119 millionin letters of credit outstanding provided under our unsec
ured credit facilities, and $48 million in letters of credit outstanding provided under ourrevolving credit facility. These letters of credit operate to guarantee performance relatin
g to certain project development and construction activitiesand business operations. During the ye
ar ended December 31, 2021, the Company paid letter of credit fees ranging from 1% to 3% per annum onthe outstanding amounts.
We expect to continue to seek, where possible, non-recourse de
bt financing in connection with the assets or businesses that we or ouraffiliates may develop, construct or acquire. However, depend
ing on local and global market conditions and the unique characteristics of individualbusinesses, non-recourse debt may not be availa
ble on economically attractive terms or at all. If we decide not to provide any additional funding orcredit support to a subsidiary project that is under construction or has near-term debt payment oblig
ations and that subsidiary is unable to obtainadditional non-recourse debt, such subs
idiary may become insolvent, and we may lose our investment in that subsidiary. Additionally, if any of oursubsidiaries lose a significa
nt customer, the subsidiary may need to withdraw from a project or restructure the non-recourse debt financing. If we orthe subsidiary choose not to proceed with a project or are una
ble to successfully complete a restructuring of the non-recourse debt, we may lose ourinvestment in that subsidiary.

106 | 2021 Annual ReportMany of our subsidiaries depend on timely an
d continued access to capital markets to manage their liquidity needs. The inability to raisecapital on favorable terms, to refinance existing indebte
dness or to fund operations and other commitments during times of political or economicuncertainty may have material adverse effects on the financial cond
ition and results of operations of those subsidiaries. In addition, changes in thetiming of tariff increases or delays in the regulatory determinations under the relev
ant concessions could affect the cash flows and results ofoperations of our businesses.
Long-Term Receivables
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately $
58 million of gross accounts receivable classified as Other noncurrent assets . These noncurrent receivables mostly consist of accounts receiva
ble in Argentina and Chile that, pursuant to amended agreements or governmentresolutions, have collection perio
ds that extend beyond December 31, 2022, or one year from the latest balance sheet date. The majority ofArgentine receivables have be
en converted into long-term financing for the construction of power plants. Noncurrent receivables in Chile pertainprimarily to revenues recognized on regulate
d energy contracts that were impacted by the Stabilization Fund created by the Chilean government. Aportion relates to the extension of existing PPAs with the ad
dition of renewable energy. See Note 7—Financing Receivables  included in Item 8. —

tical—Chile of this Form 10-K for further information. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately $
1.2 billion of loans receivable primarily related to a facility constructed under aBOT contract in Vietnam. This loan receivable represents contract consid
eration related to the construction of the facility, which was substantiallycompleted in 2015, and will be co
llected over the 25-year term of the plant's PPA. In December 2020, Mong Duong met the held-for-sale criteria andthe loan receivable balanc
e, net of CECL reserve, was reclassified to held-for-sale assets. As of December 31, 2021, $91 million of the loanreceivable balance was cla
ssified as Current held-for-sale assets and $1.1 billion was clas sified as Noncurrent held-for-sale assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

113 | 2021 Annual ReportParent Company Liquidity
The following discussion is i
ncluded as a useful measure of the liquidity available to The AES Corporation, or the Parent Company, given thenon-recourse nature of most of our indebtedness. Parent Company Liq
uidity as outlined below is a non-GAAP measure and should not be construedas an alternative to 
Cash and cash equivalents,  which is determined in accordance with GAAP. Pare nt Company Liquidity may differ from similarlytitled measures used by other companies. The principa
l sources of liquidity at the Parent Company level are dividends and other distributions fromour subsidiaries, including refin
ancing proceeds, proceeds from debt and equity financings at the Parent Company level, including availability underour revolving credit facility, and proceeds from asset sales. Cash requirements at the Parent Comp
any level are primarily to fund interest andprincipal repayments of debt, construction commitments, other equity commitments, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, taxes, Parent
Company overhead and devel
opment costs, and dividends on common stock.The Company defines Parent Company Li
quidity as cash available to the Parent Company, including cash at qualified holding companies, plusavailable borrowings un
der our existing credit facility. The cash held at qualified holding companies represents cash sent to subsidiaries of theCompany domiciled outside of the U.S. Such subs
idiaries have no contractual restrictions on their ability to send cash to the Parent Company.Parent Company Liquidity is reconcil
ed to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, Cash and cash equivalents , at the pe riodsindicated as follows (in millions):

$ 878 $ 924 The Parent Company paid divide
nds of $0.60 per outstanding share to its common stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2021.While we intend to continue payment of divid
ends and believe we will have sufficient liquidity to do so, we can provide no assurance that we willcontinue to pay dividends, or if continued, the amou
nt of such dividends.Recourse Debt
Our total recourse debt was $3.8 billion and $3.4 bi
llion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Note 11—Debt  in Item 8. —
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for additional detail. We believe that our sources of liquidity will be a
dequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. This belief is based on a number ofmaterial assumptions, including, without limitati
on, assumptions about our ability to access the capital markets, the operating and financialperformance of our subsidiaries, currency exchange rates, power market pool prices, an
d the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. In addition,our subsidiaries' ability to declare a
nd pay cash dividends to us (at the Parent Company level) is subject to certain limitations contained in loans,governmental provisions and other agreeme
nts. We can provide no assurance that these sources will be available when needed or that the actualcash requirements will not be greater than anticipate
d. We have met our interim needs for shorter-term and working capital financing at the ParentCompany level with our revolving credit facil
ity. See Item 1A.—Risk Factors — The AES Corporation's ability to make payments on its outstandingindebtedness is depend
ent upon the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries, of this Form 10-K. Various debt instruments at the Parent Company level, inclu
ding our revolving credit facility, contain certain restrictive covenants. Thecovenants provide for, among other items, limitations on liens; restrictions and limitati
ons on mergers and acquisitions and the disposition of assets;maintenance of certain financial ratios; and fina
ncial and other reporting requirements. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with thesecovenants at the Parent Company level.
Non-Recourse Debt
While the lenders under our non-recourse debt fina
ncings generally do not have direct recourse to the Parent Company, defaults thereundercan still have important consequences for our results of operations a
nd liquidity, including, without limitation:
114 | 2021 Annual Report•
reducing our cash flows as the subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to the Parent Company during the time period ofany default;
•
triggering our obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or other credit support we have provided to or onbehalf of such subsidiary;
•
causing us to record a loss in the event the lender forecloses on the assets; and•
triggering defaults in our outstanding debt at the Parent Company.For example, our revolving credit facility and outstandin
g debt securities at the Parent Company include events of default for certainbankruptcy-related events involving material su
bsidiaries. In addition, our revolving credit agreement at the Parent Company includes events ofdefault related to payment defaults and acceleratio
ns of outstanding debt of material subsidiaries.Some of our subsidiaries are currently in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstan
ding indebtedness. The total non-recourse debtclassified as current in the accompanying Cons
olidated Balance Sheets amounts to $1.4 billion. The portion of current debt related to such defaultswas $237 million at December 31, 2021, al
l of which was non-recourse debt related to three subsidiaries — AES Puerto Rico, AES Ilumina, andAES Jordan Solar. None of the defaults are payment defau
lts, but are instead technical defaults triggered by failure to comply with other covenantsor other conditions contained in the non-reco
urse debt documents, of which $230 million is due to the bankruptcy of the offtaker. See Note 11—Debt in Item 8.—
Financial Statements  and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for additional detail. None of the subsidiaries that are currently in default are subsi
diaries that met the applicable definition of materiality under the ParentCompany's debt agreements as of December 31, 2021, in order for such defau
lts to trigger an event of default or permit acceleration under theParent Company's indebtedness. Ho
wever, as a result of additional dispositions of assets, other significant reductions in asset carrying values orother matters in the future that may impact our financial position and results of operations or the financia
l position of the individual subsidiary, it ispossible that one or more of these subsidiaries coul
d fall within the definition of a "material subsidiary" and thereby trigger an event of default andpossible acceleration of the inde
btedness under the Parent Company's outstanding debt securities. A material subsidiary is defined in the ParentCompany's revolving credit facility as any busi
ness that contributed 20% or more of the Parent Company's total cash distributions from businessesfor the four most recently completed fiscal quarters. As of December 31, 2021, none of the defaults listed above, ind
ividually or in the aggregate,results in or is at risk of triggering a cross-default under the recourse debt of the Parent Company.

ated with these obligations include change ofcontrol, construction cost overruns, subsidiary default, political risk, tax indemniti
es, spot market power prices, sponsor support and liquidateddamages under power sales agreements for projects in dev
elopment, in operation and under construction. While we do not expect that we will berequired to fund any material amounts under these conting
ent contractual obligations beyond 2021, many of the events which would give rise tosuch obligations are beyond o
ur control. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to fund our obligations under these contingentcontractual obligations if we are required to make substa
ntial payments thereunder.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The Consolidated Financ
ial Statements of AES are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgments,and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the fina
ncial statements and the reported amounts ofrevenue and expenses during the p
eriods presented. AES' significant accounting policies are described in Note 1—General and Summary of Significant Accounting Poli
cies to the Consolidated Financial Stateme nts included in Item 8.—Financial Statements  and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.
An accounting estimate is considered critical if the estimate requ
ires management to make assumptions about matters that were highlyuncertain at the time the estimate was made, different estimates reasonably could have b
een used, or the impact of the estimates and assumptionson financial condition or operati
ng performance is material.Management believes that the accounting estimates emp
loyed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actualresults could materially differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these ba
lances in future periods. Management has discussedthese critical accounting policies w
ith the Audit Committee, as appropriate. Listed below are the Company's most significant critical accountingestimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Co
nsolidated Financial Statements.Income Taxes
 — We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our worldwide income tax provisionrequires significant judgment and is bas
ed on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service andother taxing authorities. Certain of the Company's subsid
iaries are under examination by relevant taxing authorities for various tax years. TheCompany regularly assesses the potential o
utcome of these examinations in each tax jurisdiction when determining the adequacy of the provisionfor income taxes. Accounting guidance for uncertainty in inc
ome taxes prescribes a more likely than not recognition threshold. Tax reserves havebeen established, which the Comp
any believes to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, reservesare adjusted only when there is more information avai
lable or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. While the Companybelieves that the amounts of the tax estimates are reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate o
utcome of current or future examinations may bematerially different than the reserve amounts.
Because we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple juris
dictions in which we operate, any changes in our geographicalearnings mix could materially impact our effective tax rate. Furthermore, our tax position could be adverse
ly impacted by changes in tax laws, taxtreaties or tax regulations, or the interpretation or
(5)(1)

116 | 2021 Annual Reportenforcement thereof and such changes may be more likely or become more like
ly in view of recent economic trends in certain of the jurisdictions inwhich we operate.
In addition, no taxes have been recorded on u
ndistributed earnings for certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent such earnings areconsidered to be indefinitely reinv
ested in the operations of those subsidiaries. Should the earnings be remitted as dividends, the Company may besubject to additional foreign withh
olding and state income taxes.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recogniz
ed for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statementcarrying amounts of the existing assets and liabiliti
es, and their respective income tax bases. The Company establishes a valuation allowance whenit is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Comp
any has elected to treat GILTI as an expense inthe period in which the tax is accrued. Accordingly, no d
eferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded related to GILTI.Impairments
 — Our accounting policies on goodwill and long-lived assets are described in detail in Note 1—General and Summary of Significant Accounting Poli
cies, included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The Company makes considerable jud gments in its impairment evaluations ofgoodwill and long-l
ived assets, starting with determining if an impairment indicator exists. Events that may result in an impairment analysis beingperformed include, but are not limited to: adverse changes in the regu
latory environment, unfavorable changes in power prices or fuel costs,increased competition due to additio
nal capacity in the grid, technological advancements, declining trends in demand, evolving industry expectationsto transition away from fossil fuel sources for generation, or an expectation it is more likely than not that the asset wil
l be disposed of before the endof its previously estimated useful life. The Company exercises ju
dgment in determining if these events represent an impairment indicator requiringthe computation of the fair value of goodwill and/or the recovera
bility of long-lived assets. The fair value determination is typically the mostjudgmental part in an impairment evaluatio
n. Please see Fair Value  below for fu rther detail.As part of the impairment evaluation process, management analyzes the se
nsitivity of fair value to various underlying assumptions. The level ofscrutiny increases as the gap between fair value an
d carrying amount decreases. Changes in any of these assumptions could result in managementreaching a different conclusion regardi
ng the potential impairment, which could be material. Our impairment evaluations inherently involveuncertainties from uncontrollable events that could p
ositively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions.Further discussion of the impairment charges recognized by the Comp
any can be found within Note 9—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Note 22—
Asset Impairment Expense  to the Consolidated Financial Stateme nts included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Depreciation
 — Depreciation, after consideration of salvage value and asset retirement obligations, is computed using the straight-linemethod over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are determined on a compos
ite or component basis. The Company considers manyfactors in its estimate of useful lives, including expected usag
e, physical deterioration, technological changes, existence and length of off-takeragreements, and laws and regulations, amon
g others. In certain circumstances, these estimates involve significant judgment and requiremanagement to forecast the impact of relevant factors over an extended time horizon.
Useful life estimates are continually evalu
ated for appropriateness as changes in the relevant factors arise, including when a long-lived assetgroup is tested for recoverability. Depreciation studies are performed peri
odically for assets subject to composite depreciation. Any change to usefullives is considered a change in acc
ounting estimate and is made on a prospective basis.Fair Value 
— For information regarding the fair value hierarchy, see Note 1— General and Summary of Significant Accounting P oliciesincluded in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 — A significant number of the Company's financial instruments are carried at fair value withchanges in fair value recognized i
n earnings or other comprehensive income each period. Investments are generally fair valued based on quotedmarket prices or other observable market data such as interest rate indices. The Company's investments are primarily certificates of de
posit andmutual funds. Derivatives are valued using obs
ervable data as inputs into internal valuation models. The Company's derivatives primarily consist ofinterest rate swaps, foreign currency instruments, and commodity and embedded derivativ
es. Additional
117 | 2021 Annual Reportdiscussion regarding the nature of these financ
ial instruments and valuation techniques can be found in Note 5—Fair Value  included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Fair Value of Nonfinancial Assets and Liabilities
 — Significant estimates are made in determining the fair value of long-lived tangibleand intangible assets (i.e., property, plant and equi
pment, intangible assets and goodwill) during the impairment evaluation process. In addition, themajority of assets acquired and liabilities ass
umed in a business combination and asset acquisitions by VIEs are required to be recognized at fairvalue under the rele
vant accounting guidance.The Company may engage an inde
pendent valuation firm to assist management with the valuation. The Company generally utilizes the incomeapproach to value nonfinanci
al assets and liabilities, specifically a Discounted Cash Flow ("DCF") model to estimate fair value by discounting cashflow forecasts, adjusted to reflect market participant assumptions, to the extent necessary, at an appropriate discount rate.
Management applies considera
ble judgment in selecting several input assumptions during the development of our cash flow forecasts.Examples of the input assumptions that our forecasts are sensitive to include macroec
onomic factors such as growth rates, industry demand,inflation, exchange rates, power prices, and commodity prices. Whenev
er appropriate, management obtains these input assumptions fromobservable market data sources (e.g., Economic Intelligence Un
it) and extrapolates the market information if an input assumption is not observablefor the entire forecast period. Many of these input assumptions are dependent on oth
er economic assumptions, which are often derived fromstatistical economic models with inherent limitatio
ns such as estimation differences. Further, several input assumptions are based on historicaltrends which often do not recur. It is not uncommon that different market data sources have different views of the macroeconomic factor
expectations and related assumptions. As a result, macroeconomic factors and rel
ated assumptions are often available in a narrow range; however,in some situations these ranges become wide a
nd the use of a different set of input assumptions could produce significantly different budgets andcash flow forecasts.
A considerable amount of judgment is also a
pplied in the estimation of the discount rate used in the DCF model. To the extent practical, inputsto the discount rate are obtained from market data sources (e.g., Bloomberg). The Company selects and uses a set of public
ly traded companiesfrom the relevant industry to estimate the discount rate inputs. Management applies jud
gment in the selection of such companies based on its viewof the most likely market participants. It is reasonably possible that the selection of a different set of likely market participants cou
ld produce differentinput assumptions and result in the use of a different discount rate.
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
 — We enter into various derivative transactions in order to hedgeour exposure to certain market risks. We primarily use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate, commodity, and foreign currency
exposures. We do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. See N
ote 6—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  included inItem 8 of this Form 10-K for further information on the classification.
The fair value measurement standard requires the Company to consi
der and reflect the assumptions of market participants in the fair valuecalculation. These factors include non
performance risk (the risk that the obligation will not be fulfilled) and credit risk, both of the reporting entity (forliabilities) and of the counterparty (for assets). Credit risk for AES is evaluated at the level of the entity that is party to the contract. Nonperformance
risk on the Company's derivative instruments is an adjustment to the fair value pos
ition that is derived from internally developed valuation modelsthat utilize market inputs that may or may not be observable.
As a result of uncertainty, complexity, and judgment, accounting estimates related to deriv
ative accounting could result in material changes toour financial statements under different conditions or utiliz
ing different assumptions. As a part of accounting for these derivatives, we makeestimates concerning nonperformance, volatiliti
es, market liquidity, future commodity prices, interest rates, credit ratings, and future foreignexchange rates. Refer to Note 5—
Fair Value  included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details. The fair value of our derivative portfolio is generally d
etermined using internal and third party valuation models, most of which are based onobservable market inputs, including interest rate curves and forward a
nd spot prices for currencies and commodities. The Company derives most ofits financial instrument market assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters and Platt's). In some cases, where market
data is not readily available, manag
ement uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to derive market assumptions to determine afinancial instrument's fair value. In certain instances, publ
ished pricing may not extend through the remaining term of the contract and managementmust make assumptions to extrapolate the curve.

118 | 2021 Annual ReportSpecifically, where there is limited forward curve data with respect to foreign exc
hange contracts beyond the traded points, the Company utilizes theinterest rate differential approach to construct the remaining portion of the forward curve. For individ
ual contracts, the use of different valuationmodels or assumptions could have a material effect on the calcul
ated fair value.Regulatory Assets
 — Management continually assesses whether regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factorssuch as applicable regulatory cha
nges, recent rate orders applicable to other regulated entities, and the status of any pending or potentialderegulation legislati
on. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, any asset write-offs would be required to be recognized in operatingincome.
Consolidation
 — The Company enters into transactions impacting the Company's equity interests in its affiliates. In connection with eachtransaction, the Company must determine whether the transaction impacts the Company's co
nsolidation conclusion by first determining whether thetransaction should be evaluated u
nder the variable interest model or the voting model. In determining which consolidation model applies to thetransaction, the Company is required to make judgments about ho
w the entity operates, the most significant of which are whether (i) the entity hassufficient equity to finance its activities, (ii) the equity holders, as a group, have the characteristics of a control
ling financial interest, and (iii) whetherthe entity has non-substantive voting rights.
If the entity is determined to be a variable interest entity, the most significant judgment in determinin
g whether the Company must consolidatethe entity is whether the Company, including its related p
arties and de facto agents, collectively have power and benefits. If AES is determined tohave power and benefits, the entity will be cons
olidated by AES.Alternatively, if the entity is determined to be a voting model entity, the most significant jud
gments involve determining whether the non-AESshareholders have substantive particip
ating rights. The assessment of shareholder rights and whether they are substantive participating rightsrequires significant judgment since the rights provi
ded under shareholders' agreements may include selecting, terminating, and setting thecompensation of management responsibl
e for implementing the subsidiary's policies and procedures, and establishing operating and capitaldecisions of the entity, including bud
gets, in the ordinary course of business. On the other hand, if shareholder rights are only protective in nature(referred to as protective rights), then such rights would not overcome the presumption that the owner of a majority voting interest shall cons
olidateits investee. Significant judgment is required to determin
e whether minority rights represent substantive participating rights or protective rights thatdo not affect the evaluation of control. While both represent an approva
l or veto right, a distinguishing factor is the underlying activity or action towhich the right relates.
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans
 — The Company recognizes a net asset or liability reflecting the funded status of pensionand other postretirement plans with current-year changes in actuaria
l gains or losses recognized in AOCL, except for those plans at certain of theCompany's regulated utilities that can recover portio
ns of their pension and postretirement obligations through future rates. The valuation of theCompany's benefit obligatio
n, fair value of plan assets, and net periodic benefit costs requires various estimates and assumptions, the mostsignificant of which include the disc
ount rate and expected return on plan assets. These assumptions are reviewed by the Company on an annualbasis. Refer to Note 1—
General and Summary of Significant Accounting P olicies included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.Revenue Recognition
 — The Company recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of energy, capacity, and other services to customers inan amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitle
d. In applying the revenue model, we determine whether the sale ofenergy, capacity, and other services represent a single performance ob
ligation based on the individual market and terms of the contract. Generally,the promise to transfer energy and capacity represent a performance obligatio
n that is satisfied over time and meets the criteria to be accounted foras a series of distinct goods or services. Progress toward satisfaction of a performance obligati
on is measured using output methods, such asMWhs delivered or MWs made available, and when we are e
ntitled to consideration in an amount that corresponds directly to the value of ourperformance completed to date, we recognize revenue in the amo
unt to which we have the right to invoice. For further information regarding thenature of our revenue streams and our critical accounting polic
ies affecting revenue recognition, see Note 1—General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Leases
 — The Company recognizes operating and finance right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets formost leases with an initial term of greater than 12 months. Lease liabil
ities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are recorded based on thepresent value of lease payments over the

119 | 2021 Annual Reportexpected lease term. Our subsidiaries’ incremental borrowi
ng rates are used in determining the present value of lease payments when the implicitrate is not readily determinable. Certain adjustments to the right-of-use asset may be required for items such as prepayme
nts, lease incentives, orinitial direct costs. For further information regarding the nature of our leases and our critical acco
unting policies affecting leases, see Note 1—
General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Credit Losses 
— The Company uses a forward-looking "expected loss" mode l to recognize allowances for credit losses on trade and otherreceivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans, and other instruments. For availa
ble-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, theCompany continues to measure credit losses as it was done u
nder previous GAAP, except that unrealized losses due to credit-related factors arenow recognized as an allow
ance on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding adjustment to earnings in the Consolidated Statements ofOperations. For further information regarding credit losses, see Note 1—

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Overview Regarding Market Risks
Our businesses are exposed to and proactively mana
ge market risk. Our primary market risk exposure is to the price of commodities,particularly electricity, oil, natural gas, coal, and environme
ntal credits. In addition, our businesses are exposed to lower electricity prices due toincreased competition, includin
g from renewable sources such as wind and solar, as a result of lower costs of entry and lower variable costs. Weoperate in multiple countries and as such are sub
ject to volatility in exchange rates at varying degrees at the subsidiary level and between ourfunctional currency, the USD, and currencies of the countries in whic
h we operate. We are also exposed to interest rate fluctuations due to ourissuance of debt and related financia
l instruments.The disclosures presented in this Item 7A are based upo
n a number of assumptions; actual effects may differ. The safe harbor provided inSection 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sectio
n 21E of the Exchange Act shall apply to the disclosures contained in this Item 7A. For furtherinformation regarding market risk, see Item 1A.—
Risk Factors , Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may impact our financial results andposition
; Wholesale power prices may experience significant volatility in our markets which could impact our operations and opportunities for futuregrowth;
 We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates; and Certain of our businessesare sensitive to variations in weather and hydrol
ogy of this 2021 Form 10-K. Commodity Price Risk
Although we prefer to hedge our exposure to the impact of market fluctuations in the price of el
ectricity, fuels, and environmental credits, someof our generation businesses operate un
der short-term sales or under contract sales that leave an unhedged exposure on some of our capacity orthrough imperfect fuel pass-throughs. These businesses sub
ject our operational results to the volatility of prices for electricity, fuels, andenvironmental credits in competitive markets. We employ risk management strategies to hedge o
ur financial performance against the effects offluctuations in energy commodity prices. The implementation of these strategi
es can involve the use of physical and financial commodity contracts,futures, swaps, and options.
The portion of our sales and purchases that are not subject to such agreeme
nts or contracted businesses where indexation is not perfectlymatched to business drivers will be exposed to commodity price risk. When he
dging the output of our generation assets, we utilize contract salesthat lock in the spread per MWh between variable costs and the price at whic
h the electricity can be sold.AES businesses will see cha
nges in variable margin performance as global commodity prices shift. For 2022, we project pre-tax earningsexposure on a 10% (uncorrelated) move in commodity prices to be approximate
ly a $5 million gain for power and oil, a $5 million loss for coal, and a$15 million loss for natural gas.
 Our estimates exclude correlation of oil with coal or natural gas. For example, a decline in oil or natural gas pricescan be accompanied by a declin
e in coal price if commodity prices are correlated. In aggregate, the Company's downside exposure occurs
120 | 2021 Annual Reportwith lower power, lower oil, higher natural g
as, and higher coal prices. Exposures at individual businesses will change as new contracts or financialhedges are executed, and our sensitivity to chang
es in commodity prices generally increases in later years with reduced hedge levels at some of ourbusinesses.
Commodity prices affect our businesses differently dependi
ng on the local market characteristics and risk management strategies. Spot powerprices, contract indexation provisions, and gen
eration costs can be directly or indirectly affected by movements in the price of natural gas, oil, andcoal. We have some natural offsets across our businesses such that low commodity prices may benefit certain b
usinesses and be a cost to others.Exposures are not perfectly linear or symmetric. The sensitivities are affected by a number of local or indirect market factors. Examples of these
factors include hydrology, local energy market supply/d
emand balances, regional fuel supply issues, regional competition, bidding strategies, andregulatory interventions such as price caps. Operational flex
ibility changes the shape of our sensitivities. For instance, certain power plants may limitdownside exposure by reducin
g dispatch in low market environments. Volume variation also affects our commodity exposure. The volume soldunder contracts or retail concessions can vary based on weath
er and economic conditions, resulting in a higher or lower volume of sales in spotmarkets. Thermal unit availability and hydrology ca
n affect the generation output available for sale and can affect the marginal unit setting powerprices.
In the US and Utilities SBU, the generation bus
inesses are largely contracted but may have residual risk to the extent contracts are notperfectly indexed to the business drivers. At Southland, our existi
ng once-through cooling generation units (“Legacy Assets”) have been requestedto continue operating beyond their current retirement date and h
ave been approved for an extended permit for between one and three years. Theseassets have contracts in capacity and have seen incrementa
l value in energy revenues.In the South America SBU, our business in Chile o
wns assets in the central and northern regions of the country and has a portfolio of contractsales in both. The significant portion of our PPAs inc
lude mechanisms of indexation that adjust the price of energy based on fluctuations in the priceof coal, with the specific indices and timing varying by co
ntract, in order to mitigate changes in the price of fuel. For the portion of our contracts notindexed to the price of coal, we have implemented a h
edging strategy based on international coal financial instruments for up to 3 years. InColombia, we operate under a shorter-term sales strategy with spot market exposure for uncontracted volumes. Beca
use we own hydroelectricassets there, contracts are not indexed to fuel. Additionally, in Brazil, the hydro
electric generating facility is covered by contract sales. Under normalhydrological volatility, spot price risk is mitigated throug
h a regulated sharing mechanism across all hydroelectric generators in the country. Underdrier conditions, the sharing mechanism may not be sufficient to cover the busin
ess' contract position, and therefore it may have to purchase powerat spot prices driven by the cost of thermal generation.
In the MCAC SBU, our businesses have commodity exposure on u
nhedged volumes. Panama is highly contracted under financial and load-following PPA type structures, exposing the busi
ness to hydrology-based variance. To the extent hydrological inflows are greater than or less thanthe contract volumes, the business will be sensitive to chan
ges in spot power prices which may be driven by oil and natural gas prices in some timeperiods. In the Dominican Republic, we o
wn natural gas plants contracted under a portfolio of contract sales, and both contract and spot prices maymove with commodity prices. Additionally, the contract levels do not al
ways match our generation availability and our assets may be sellers of spotprices in excess of contract levels or a net buyer in the spot market to satisfy contract obligations.
In the Eurasia SBU, our assets operating in Vietnam and B
ulgaria have minimal exposure to commodity price risk as it has no or minormerchant exposure and fuel is subject to a pass-through mechan
ism.Foreign Exchange Rate Risk
In the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency risk and other foreign o
perations risks that arise from investments inforeign subsidiaries and affiliates. A key compo
nent of these risks stems from the fact that some of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates utilizecurrencies other than our consolidated reporting currency, the US
D. Additionally, certain of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates have entered intomonetary obligations in USD or currencies other than the
ir own functional currencies. Certain of our foreign subsidiaries calcul ate and pay taxes incurrencies other than their own functional currency. 
We have varying degrees of exposure to changes in the exc hange rate between the USD andthe following currencies: Argentine pes
o, Brazilian real, Chilean peso, Colombian peso, Dominican peso, Euro, and Mexican peso. Thesesubsidiaries and affiliates have attempted to limit pote
ntial foreign exchange exposure by entering into revenue contracts that adjust to changes inforeign exchange rates. We also use foreign currency forwards, swaps, and opti
ons where possible to manage our risk related to certain foreigncurrency fluctuations.

121 | 2021 Annual ReportAES enters into foreign currency hedges to protect economic valu
e of the business and minimize the impact of foreign exchange ratefluctuations to AES' portfolio. While protecting cash flows, the he
dging strategy is also designed to reduce forward-looking earnings foreignexchange volatility. Due to variation of timing an
d amount between cash distributions and earnings exposure, the hedge impact may not fully coverthe earnings exposure on a realized b
asis, which could result in greater volatility in earnings. The largest foreign exchange risks over a 12-monthforward-looking period stem from the following currencies: Brazil
ian real, Colombian peso, and Euro. As of December 31, 2021, assuming a 10%USD appreciation, cash distributions attributa
ble to foreign subsidiaries exposed to movement in the exchange rate are projected to be impacted byless than $(5) million for Brazilian real and less tha
n $5 million each for Colombian peso and Euro. These numbers have been produced by applyinga one-time 10% USD appreciation to forecasted expos
ed cash distributions for 2022 coming from the respective subsidiaries exposed to thecurrencies listed above, net of the impact of outstanding hedg
es and holding all other variables constant. The numbers presented above are net ofany transactional gains/losses. These sens
itivities may change in the future as new hedges are executed or existing hedges are unwound.Additionally, updates to the forecasted cash distrib
utions exposed to foreign exchange risk may result in further modification. The sensitivitiespresented do not capture the impacts of any administrative market restrictions or currency inconvertibility.
Interest Rate Risks
We are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of our issuance of variable-rate and fixe
d-rate debt, as well asinterest rate swap, cap, floor, and option agreements. Decisions on the fixed-flo
ating debt mix are made to be consistent with the risk factors facedby individual business
es or plants. Depending on whether a plant's capacity payments or revenue stream is fixed or varies with inflation, we partiallyhedge against interest rate fluctuations by arrangin
g fixed- or variable-rate financing. In certain cases, particularly for non-recourse financing, weexecute interest rate swap, cap, and floor agreements to effectively fix or limit the interest rate exposure on the underlyin
g financing. Most of ourinterest rate risk is related to non-recourse financings at our businesses.
As of December 31, 2021, the portfolio's pre-tax earnings exposure for 202
2 to a one-time 100-basis-point increase in interest rates for ourArgentine peso, Brazilian real, Chi
lean peso, Colombian peso, Euro, and USD denominated debt would be approximately $20 million on interestexpense for the debt denominated in these currenci
es. These amounts do not take into account the historical correlation between these interestrates.

124 | 2021 Annual ReportGoodwill Impairment Evaluation of the AES Andes Reporting Unit
Description of the
Matter
At December 31, 2021, the Company’s goodwill balance was $1,177 million, of which $644 million relates to the AESAndes reporting unit. As disclosed in Note 1 to the cons
olidated financial statements, the Company’s goodwill is testedfor impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level. The goo
dwill impairment test at the AES Andes reporting unitinvolves the use of significant unobserva
ble inputs to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. This estimate of fairvalue is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine wh
ether goodwill is impaired.Auditing the Company's measurement of the fair value of the AES A
ndes reporting unit involved a high degree ofsubjectivity given the lack of observable in
puts to estimate the reporting unit’s fair value. Key inputs that had asignificant impact on the valuation incl
uded the prospective financial information (including the estimated growth inrenewable projects, forward electricity prices and deve
lopments in the Chilean capacity market) and the discount rate,which were forward-looking and bas
ed upon expectations about future economic and market conditions.How We Addressed the
Matter in 
Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over theCompany’s goodwill impa
irment review process at the AES Andes reporting unit. For example, we tested controls overmanagement’s review of the valuation model, the sig
nificant assumptions used to develop the estimates, and thecompleteness and accuracy of the data used in the valu
ations.To test the estimated fair value of the Company’s AES Andes reporting un
it, we performed audit procedures thatincluded, among others, assessing the methodo
logies used to develop the estimate of fair value, testing the significantassumptions discussed above, and testing the comp
leteness and accuracy of the underlying data used by theCompany in its analyses. We compared the significant assumpti
ons used by management to current industry andeconomic trends as well as historical results. We assessed the historica
l accuracy of management’s estimates andperformed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to eva
luate the changes in the fair value of the reporting unitthat would result from changes in the assumptions. We also involve
d valuation specialists to assist in our evaluation ofthe overall methodologies and the d
iscount rate used in the fair value estimate.Identification and Valuation of Long-Lived Asset Impairments and Re-evaluation of Useful Lives
Description of the
Matter
At December 31, 2021, the Company's property, plant and equipment had an aggregate net carrying value ofapproximately $19,906 million. As disc
losed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, when circumstancesindicate the carrying amount of long-lived assets in a h
eld-for-use asset group may not be recoverable, the Companyevaluates the assets for potential impairment and re-evaluates the remai
ning useful life. These circumstances mayinclude, but are not limited to, changes in the regulatory env
ironment, demand, power prices or fuel costs, technologicaladvancements, physical deterioration, or an expectati
on it is more likely than not that the asset will be disposed ofbefore the end of its useful life. In 2021, as disclosed in Footnote 2
2 to the consolidated financial statements, theCompany recognized a total asset impairment expens
e of $1,575 million, primarily related to the Company’s PuertoRico, Ventanas 3 & 4 and Angamos asset groups.

125 | 2021 Annual ReportAuditing the Company's identific
ation and evaluation of impairment indicators involved significant auditor judgmentconsidering the many geographic, regu
latory, and economic environments in which the Company operates. Similarly,auditing the Company’s re-evaluati
on of useful lives required a high degree of subjectivity, particularly as it related to theCompany’s coal generation assets giv
en the Company’s decarbonization initiatives and the potential risks associatedwith climate change that have led to increased reg
ulation and other actions. These audit procedures required anevaluation of a wide variety of circumstances for potential chan
ges in useful lives or impairment indicators. In addition,auditing the Company’s valuati
on of long-lived asset impairments involved significant judgment related to the estimationof the asset groups’ fair value. There was a high degree of subj
ectivity given the lack of observable inputs to estimatethe fair value. Key inputs that had a significant impact on the valu
ation included the prospective financial information(including the expected retirement dates of the plants and the pro
babilities assigned to the different scenarios) and thediscount rate, which were forward-looking and b
ased upon expectations about future economic and market conditions.How We Addressed the
Matter in 
Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company’s controlsover the identification of impairment indicators, estimation of useful liv
es (including any changes if necessary) andvaluation of the long-lived asset impairments. For example, we tested man
agement’s monitoring controls overbusinesses that have had been affected or are expecte
d to be affected by the circumstances above. Our testing alsoincluded management’s review co
ntrols of the valuation model, the significant assumptions used to develop theestimates, and the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the val
uations.Our audit procedures included, among others, making in
quiries of management (including personnel in operations) tounderstand changes in the busin
esses, reading industry journals and publications to independently identify changes inthe regulatory environments or the geographic areas an
d evaluating whether management has considered identifiedchanges, if any. We considered businesses for which current po
wer prices are significantly less than contractual priceswithin Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) that are also ne
ar expiration. We also considered the Company’s ability tore-contract certain of its coal generation assets upon the expiration of a PPA, giv
en the most recent legislative orregulatory changes. We evaluated the Company
’s analysis of the useful lives of its coal generation assets, consideringthe existing PPAs and the Company’s ab
ility to use the assets subsequent to the expiration of a PPA, based on anyregulatory or market changes. For projects that were still under construction, we compared the Company
's actualprogress to their budgets, inspected engineeri
ng reports when considered appropriate, and considered project overruns.We reviewed disaggregated financ
ial results for deterioration in earnings performance compared to prior periods,negative cash flows from operations, and working cap
ital deficiencies and assessed whether these would representimpairment indicators, when applicab
le. We also considered and assessed conditions and trends in the industry and theunderlying economies and ev
aluated sale or disposition activities.When testing the impairment analyses for AES Puerto Rico, Ventan
as and Angamos, our audit procedures included,among others, obtaining an understand
ing of management’s strategic view of the plants given the regulatory changes,evaluating management’s assessment of the low
est level of identifiable cash flows, assessing the appropriateness ofmethodologies, testing the significant assumpti
ons discussed above and testing the completeness and accuracy of theunderlying data used by the Company i
n its analyses. We compared the significant assumptions used by managementto current industry and economic trends, latest regulations as well as historic
al results. We assessed the historicalaccuracy of management’s estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of sig
nificant assumptions to evaluate thechanges in the fair value of the asset groups that would result from changes i
n the assumptions. We also involvedvaluation specialists to assist in our evalu
ation of the overall methodology and the discount rate used in the fair valueestimate.

126 | 2021 Annual ReportAccounting for the Merger of sPower and Distributed Energy Development Platforms
Description of the
Matter
As disclosed in Footnote 25 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed the merger of the sPowerand AES Renewable H
oldings development platforms to form AES Clean Energy Development in 2021. As part of thetransaction, AES acquired an additio
nal 25% ownership interest in the sPower development platform in exchange for a25% ownership interest in specifically i
dentified development entities of AES Renewable Holdings, certain future exitrights in the new partnership, and $7 million of cash. The ac
quisition of the sPower development platform wasaccounted for as a step acquisition as a result of the Company’s previ
ously held interest. The sPower developmentassets were remeasured at their acquisition-date fair values resulti
ng in a $214 million gain. The Company alsorecorded goodwill of $45 milli
on representing the difference between the fair value of the consideration transferred andthe fair value of the identifiable assets acquired a
nd liabilities assumed.Auditing the Company’s accounti
ng for the merger was complex due to the significant estimation in management’sdetermination of the fair value of the non-cash consideratio
n transferred as well as the acquired assets. Specifically, thefair value of the sPower development pipel
ine and the intangible assets associated with the contracted anduncontracted projects acquired from sPower involved si
gnificant estimation uncertainty. The estimation uncertainty wasprimarily related to underlying assumptions ab
out the future performance of the development projects or otherunobservable inputs. The Company us
ed a discounted cash flow model to measure the fair value of the developmentpipeline and acquire
d intangible assets. The significant assumptions used included discount rates and certainassumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results (e.g., pipeline capacity, developer profit, probab
ility of projectcompletion and expected timing of completio
n). These significant assumptions were forward looking and could beaffected by future economic and market conditions.
How We Addressed the
Matter in 
Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over theCompany’s accounting for the step acquisitio
n. For example, we tested controls over the recognition and measurementof the consideration transferred and intangibl
e assets acquired, including management’s review of the valuation models,the significant assumptions used to develo
p the estimates, and the completeness and accuracy of the data used in thevaluations.
To test the estimated fair value of the development pipeline a
nd intangible assets, we performed audit procedures thatincluded, among others, evaluating the C
ompany's selection of the valuation methodology, evaluating the methods andsignificant assumptions used by the Company
's valuation specialist, and evaluating the completeness and accuracy ofthe underlying data supporting the sig
nificant assumptions and estimates. For example, we compared the significantassumptions used by management to third-party industry data, the Company’s bu
dgets and forecasts as well ashistorical results. We also involved valuatio
n specialists to assist in our evaluation of the overall methodology and thediscount rates used in the fair value estimate.

1. GENERAL AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The AES Corporation is a holdin
g company (the "Parent Company") that, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, (collectively, "AES" or "theCompany") operates a geographically d
iversified portfolio of electricity generation and distribution businesses. Generally, the liabilities of individualoperating entities are non-recourse to the Parent Company a
nd are isolated to the operating entities. Most of our operating entities are structured aslimited liability entities, which limit the li
ability of shareholders. The structure is generally the same regardless of whether a subsidiary is consolidatedunder a voting or variable interest model. The preparatio
n of these consolidated financial statements is in conformity with accounting principlesgenerally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP").
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION 
— The consolidated financial statements of the Compa ny include the accounts of The AES Corporationand its controlled subsidiaries. Furthermore, VIEs in which the C
ompany has an ownership interest and is the primary beneficiary, thus controllingthe VIE, have been consolidated. Intercompany transactio
ns and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in entities where theCompany has the ability to exercise significa
nt influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS 
— Noncontrolling interests are classified as a sep arate component of equity in the Consolidated BalanceSheets and Consolidated Stateme
nts of Changes in Equity. Additionally, net income and comprehensive income attributable to noncontrollinginterests are reflected separately from consolidated net income and compre
hensive income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations andConsolidated Statements of Changes i
n Equity. Any change in ownership of a subsidiary while the controlling financial interest is retained isaccounted for as an equity transaction between the control
ling and noncontrolling interests. Losses continue to be attributed to the noncontrollinginterests, even when the noncontrolling i
nterests' basis has been reduced to zero.Equity securities with redemption features that are not solely withi
n the control of the issuer are classified outside of permanent equity.Generally, initial measurement will be at fair value. Su
bsequent measurement and classification vary depending on whether the instrument isprobable of becoming redeemabl
e. When the equity instrument is not probable of becoming redeemable, subsequent allocation of income anddividends is classified in perman
ent equity. For those securities where it is probable that the instrument will become redeemable or that are currentlyredeemable, AES recognizes chan
ges in the fair value at each accounting period against retained earnings or additional paid-in-capital in theabsence of retained earnings, subject to the floor of the initia
l fair value. Further, the allocation of income and dividends, as well as the adjustment tofair value, is classified outside permanent equ
ity. Instruments that are mandatorily redeemable are classified as a liability.EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS 
— Investments in entities over which the Company has the ability to exercise si gnificant influence, but notcontrol, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting a
nd reported in Investments in and advances to affiliates  on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s prop
ortionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in Net equity in losses of affiliates on the Consolidated Statements of Operations
. The Company utilizes the cumulative earni
ng approach to determine whether distributions received from equity method investees are returnson investment or returns of investment. The Company discontinues the appl
ication of the equity method when an investment is reduced to zero andthe Company is not otherwise committed to provide further financial supp
ort to the investee. The Company resumes the application of the equitymethod accounting to the extent that net income is greater than the share of net losses not previous
ly recorded.Upon acquiring the investment, we determine the fair valu
e of the identifiable assets and assumed liabilities and the basis difference betweeneach fair value and the carrying amount of the correspondin
g asset or liability in the financial statements of the investee. The AES share of theamortization of the basis difference is recognized in
 Net equity in losses of affiliates  in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the life of the asset or liability.
The Company periodically assess
es if impairment indicators exist at our equity method investments. When an impairment is observed, anyexcess of the carrying amount over its estimated fair value is recognized as impairment expe
nse when the loss in value is deemed other-than-temporary and included in 
Other non-operating expense  in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
133 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019BUSINESS INTERESTS 
— Acquisitions and disposals of bus iness interests are generally transactions pertaining to operational legal entities,which may be accounted for as a consolidated b
usiness, an asset, or an equity method investment. Losses on expected sales of business interestsare limited to the impairment of long-lived assets as of the date of execution of the sales agre
ement, which are recognized in Asset impairment expense
 in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Any gains/(loss es) upon the completion of disposals, which include reclassification ofcumulative translation adjustments, are recognized i
n Gain (loss) on disposal and sale of busin ess interests in the Consolidated Statements of Operations upon completion of the sale.
ALLOCATION OF EARNINGS
 — Certain of the Company's businesses are subject to profit-sharing arrang ements where the allocation ofcash distributions and the sharing of tax benefits are not base
d on fixed ownership percentages. These arrangements exist for certain U.S.renewable generation partnersh
ips to designate different allocations of value among investors, where the allocations change in form or percentageover the life of the partnership. For these businesses, the Company uses the hypoth
etical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method when it is areasonable approximation of the profit-sharing arran
gement. The HLBV method calculates the proceeds that would be attributable to each partnerbased on the liquidation prov
isions of the respective operating partnership agreement if the partnership was to be liquidated at book value at thebalance sheet date. Each partner’s share of income in the p
eriod is equal to the change in the amount of net equity they are legally able to claimbased on a hypothetical liqu
idation of the entity at the end of a reporting period compared to the beginning of that period, adjusted for any capitaltransactions.
The HLBV method is used both to allocate the eq
uity earnings attributable to AES when the Company accounts for the renewable business asan equity method investment and to calculate the earni
ngs attributable to noncontrolling interest when the business is consolidated by AES. In theearly months of operations of a renewable generati
on facility where HLBV results in a significant decrease in the hypothetical liquidation proceedsattributable to the tax equity investor due to the recognition of investment tax credits ("ITCs") or other adjustments as required by the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code, the Company records the impact (sometimes referred to as the ‘Day one ga
in’) to income in the same period.USE OF ESTIMATES 
— U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the asset and liabil ity balancesreported as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, as wel
l as the revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period.Actual results could differ from those estimates. Items subject to such estimates and assumptions include: the carrying amount an
d estimated usefullives of long-lived assets; asset retirement obligations; impa
irment of goodwill, long-lived assets and equity method investments; valuationallowances for receivables and d
eferred tax assets; the recoverability of regulatory assets; regulatory liabilities; the fair value of financialinstruments; the fair value of assets and liabilities acquire
d as business combinations or as asset acquisitions by variable interest entities; contingentconsideration arising from business combin
ations or asset acquisitions by variable interest entities; the measurement of equity method investmentsor noncontrolling interest using the HLB
V method for certain renewable generation partnerships; pension liabilities; the incremental borrowing ratesused in the determination of lease liab
ilities; the determination of lease and non-lease components in certain generation contracts; environmentalliabilities; and potential l
itigation claims and settlements.HELD-FOR-SALE DISPOSAL GROUPS 
— A disposal group classified as hel d-for-sale is reflected on the balance sheet at the lower of itscarrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell. A loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the disp
osal group exceeds its estimated fairvalue less cost to sell. This loss is limited to the carrying value of long-l
ived assets until the completion of the sale, at which point, any additional lossis recognized. If the fair value of the disposal group subseq
uently exceeds the carrying amount while the disposal group is still held-for-sale, anyimpairment expense previously recogniz
ed will be reversed up to the lesser of the previously recognized expense or the subsequent excess.Assets and liabilities related to a disp
osal group classified as held-for-sale are segregated in the current balance sheet in the period in whichthe disposal group is classified as he
ld-for-sale. Assets and liabilities of held-for-sale disposal groups are classified as current when they areexpected to be disposed of within twelve months. Transacti
ons between the held-for-sale disposal group and businesses that are expected tocontinue to exist after the disposal are not eliminated to appro
priately reflect the continuing operations and balances held-for-sale. See Note 24—
Held-for-Sale and Dispositions for further information.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 
— Discontinued operations reporting occ urs only when the disposal of a business or a group of businessesrepresents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on the Company's operations and fina
ncial results. The Company reports financialresults for discontinued operations

134 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019separately from continuing operations to disting
uish the financial impact of disposal transactions from ongoing operations. Prior period amounts inthe Consolidated Statements of Operations and Co
nsolidated Balance Sheets are retrospectively revised to reflect the businesses determined to bediscontinued operations. The cash flo
ws of businesses that are determined to be discontinued operations are included within the relevant categorieswithin operating, investing and fin
ancing activities on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Transactions between the businesses d
etermined to be discontinued operations and businesses that are expected to continue to exist after thedisposal are not eliminated to appropri
ately reflect the continuing operations and balances held-for-sale. The results of discontinued operationsinclude any gain or loss recogniz
ed on closing or adjustment of the carrying amount to fair value less cost to sell, including gains or lossesassociated with noncontrollin
g interests upon completion of the disposal transaction. Adjustments related to components previously reported asdiscontinued operations un
der prior accounting guidance are presented as discontinued operations in the current period even if the disposed-ofcomponent to which the adjustments are related woul
d not meet the criteria for presentation as a discontinued operation under current guidance.FAIR VALUE 
— Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an ass et or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly, hypotheticaltransaction between market participants at the measurement date, or exit price. The Company app
lies the fair value measurement accountingguidance to financial assets and l
iabilities in determining the fair value of investments in marketable debt and equity securities, included in theConsolidated Balance Sheet line
 items Short-term investments  and Other noncurrent assets ; derivative assets, included in Other current assets  and Other noncurrent assets
; and, derivati ve liabilities, included in Accrued and other liabilities (current)  and Other noncurrent liabilities . The Company applies the fair value measurement guida
nce to nonfinancial assets and liabilities upon the acquisition of a business or of an asset acquisition by avariable interest entity, or in conjunction with the measurement of an asset retirement obl
igation or a potential impairment loss on an asset group,equity method investments, or goodwill.
When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabi
lities required to be reflected at their fair values, the Company considers theprincipal or most advantageous market in which it wou
ld transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing theassets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance. The Company is pro
hibited from including transactioncosts and any adjustments for blockage factors in determining fair value.
In determining fair value measurements, the Company maximizes the use of observab
le inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs.Assets and liabilities are categorize
d within a fair value hierarchy based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair valuemeasurement:
•
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;•
Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets orliabilities, quoted prices for identica
l or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can becorroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; or
•
Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values of the assets or liabilities.Any transfers between all levels within the fair valu
e hierarchy levels are recognized at the end of the reporting period.CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 
— The Company considers unrestricted cash on hand, cash b alances not restricted as to withdrawal orusage, deposits in banks, certificates of deposit and short-term marketable securities with ori
ginal maturities of three months or less to be cash andcash equivalents.
RESTRICTED CASH AND DEBT SERV
ICE RESERVES — Cash balances restricted as to withdrawal or usage, primarily via co ntract, areconsidered restricted cash.

$ 1,484 $ 1,827 INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES 
— The Company's marketable investments are primarily unsecured d ebentures, certificatesof deposit, government debt securities and money market funds.
Short-term investments consist of marketable equity securities and debt securities with origi
nal maturities in excess of three months withremaining maturities of less than one year. Marketable debt securities wh
ere the Company has both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturityare classified as held-to-maturity and are carried at amortized cost, net of any allowance for credit losses i
n accordance with ASC 326. Remainingmarketable debt securities are classified as avail
able-for-sale or trading and are carried at fair value.Unrealized gains or losses on ava
ilable-for-sale debt securities that are not credit-related are reflected in AOCL, a separate component ofequity, and the Consolidated Statements of Compreh
ensive Income (Loss). Any credit-related impairments are recognized as an allowance with acorresponding impact recognized as a credit loss i
n Other Expense. Unrealized gains or losses on eq uity investments are reported in Other income . Interest and dividends on investments are reported in 
Interest income  and Other income , respectively. Gains and losses on sales of investments are determined using the specific identificati
on method.ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABL
E AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS — Accounts and notes receivable are carried at amortized cost. The Company periodically assesses the co
llectability of accounts receivable, considering factors such as historical collectionexperience, the age of accounts receivable a
nd other currently available evidence supporting collectability, and records an allowance for doubtfulaccounts in accordance with ASC 326 for the estimated unc
ollectible amount as appropriate. Credit losses on accounts and notes receivable aregenerally recognized in 
Cost of Sales . Certain of our businesses charge interest on accounts receivab le. Interest income is recognized on anaccrual basis. When collection of such interest is not reasona
bly assured, interest income is recognized as cash is received. Individual accounts andnotes receivable are written off when they are no longer de
emed collectible.INVENTORY 
— Inventory primarily consists of fuel and other raw materials used to generate power, and op erational spare parts and suppliesused to maintain power generation an
d distribution facilities. Inventory is carried at lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is the sum of thepurchase price and expenditures inc
urred to bring the inventory to its existing location. Inventory is primarily valued using the average cost method.Generally, if it is expected fuel inventory will not be recovered throu
gh revenue earned from power generation, an impairment is recognized to reflectthe fuel at net realizable value. The carrying amount of spare parts and su
pplies is typically reduced only in instances where the items areconsidered obsolete.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS 
— Long-lived assets include property, plant an d equipment, assets under finance leases and intangible assets subjectto amortization (i.e., finite-lived intangible assets).
Property, plant and equipment 
— Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. The cost of renew als andimprovements that extend the useful life of property, plant and equipment are cap
italized.Construction progress payments, engineering costs, insura
nce costs, salaries, interest and other costs directly relating to construction inprogress are capitalized during the construction p
eriod, provided the completion of the construction project is deemed probable, or expensed at thetime construction completion is determined to no longer be pro
bable. The continued capitalization of such costs is subject to risks related tosuccessful completion, including thos
e related to government approvals, site identification, financing, construction permitting and contractcompliance. Construction-in-progress bala
nces are transferred to electric generation and distribution assets when an asset group is ready for itsintended use. Government subsidies, liqu
idated damages recovered for construction delays, and income tax credits are recorded as a reduction toproperty, plant and equipment and reflected in cash flo
ws from investing activities. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
136 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019Depreciation, after consideration of salvage va
lue and asset retirement obligations, is computed using the straight-line method over theestimated useful lives of the assets, which are determined on a composite or compo
nent basis. Capital spare parts, including rotable spare parts,are included in electric generatio
n and distribution assets. If the spare part is considered a component, it is depreciated over its useful life after thepart is placed in service. If the spare part is deemed part of a composite asset, the part is depreciated over the composite useful life ev
en whenbeing held as a spare part.
Certain of the Company's subsidiaries op
erate under concession contracts. Certain estimates are utilized to determine depreciation expensefor the subsidiaries, including the useful l
ives of the property, plant and equipment and the amounts to be recovered at the end of the concessioncontract. The amounts to be recovered under these concession contracts are based o
n estimates that are inherently uncertain and actual amountsrecovered may differ from those estimates. These concession contracts are not within the scope of ASC 853—
Service Concession Arrangements . Intangible Assets Subject to Amortization 
— Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized ov er their useful lives which range from 1 – 50 yearsand are included in the
 Consolidated Balance Sheet line item Other intangible assets. The Company accounts for purchased emission al lowancesas intangible assets and records an expe
nse when they are utilized or sold. Granted emission allowances are valued at zero.Impairment of Long-lived Assets 
— When circumstances indicate the carrying amount of long-lived ass ets in a held-for-use asset group maynot be recoverable, the Company evaluates the assets for potentia
l impairment using internal projections of undiscounted cash flows resulting fromthe use and eventual disposal of the assets. Events or chan
ges in circumstances that may necessitate a recoverability evaluation include, but arenot limited to, adverse changes in the regulatory environme
nt, unfavorable changes in power prices or fuel costs, increased competition due toadditional capacity in the grid, techno
logical advancements, declining trends in demand, or an expectation it is more likely than not that the asset willbe disposed of before the end of its previously estimated usefu
l life. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, animpairment expense is recognized for the amount by which the carryin
g amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value (subject to the carryingamount not being reduced below fair val
ue for any individual long-lived asset that is determinable without undue cost and effort). An impairmentexpense for certain assets may be reduced by the establishment of a regulatory asset if recovery through a
pproved rates is probable.DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS 
— Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of lo ng-term debt are deferred and presented as a directreduction from the face amount of that debt and amortized over the related financing perio
d using the effective interest method. Debt issuance costsrelated to a line-of-credit or revolving credit facility are deferred and presente
d as an asset and amortized over the related financing period. Make-whole payments in connection with e
arly debt retirements are classified as cash flows used in financing activities.GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
— The Company evaluates goodwi ll and indefinite-lived intangible assets forimpairment on an annual basis and w
henever events or changes in circumstances necessitate an evaluation for impairment. The Company's annualimpairment testing date is October 1
. Goodwill 
— Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of the business ac quisition over the fair value of identifiable net assetsacquired. Goodwill resulting from an acquis
ition is assigned to the reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition.Generally, each AES business with a go
odwill balance constitutes a reporting unit as they are not similar to other businesses in a segment nor arethey reported to segment management together with other businesses.
Goodwill is evaluated for impairment either und
er the qualitative assessment option or the quantitative test option to determine the fair value ofthe reporting unit. If goodwill is determined to be impaired, an imp
airment loss measured at the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying amountexceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwil
l, is recorded.Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets 
— The Company's indefinite-lived i ntangible assets primarily include land-use rights and water rights.Indefinite-lived intangibl
e assets are evaluated for impairment either under the qualitative assessment option or the two-step quantitative test. If thecarrying amount of an intangible asset bein
g tested for impairment exceeds its fair value, the excess is recognized as impairment expense.st
137 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER
 ACCRUED LIABILITIES — Accounts payable consists of amounts due to trade creditors related to the Company's core business operations. Thes
e payables include amounts owed to vendors and suppliers for items such as energy purchased forresale, fuel, maintenance, inventory and other raw materials. Other accrued liab
ilities include items such as income taxes, regulatory liabilities, legalcontingencies and employe
e-related costs, including payroll, and benefits.REGULATORY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES 
— The Company recognizes assets and liab ilities that result from regulated ratemakingprocesses. Regulatory assets generally represent inc
urred costs which have been deferred due to the probable future recovery via customer rates.Generally, returns earned on regulatory assets are reflected in the Conso
lidated Statements of Operations within Interest Income . Regulatory liabilities generally repres
ent obligations to refund customers. Management continually assesses whether regulatory assets are probable of futurerecovery and regulatory liabilities are prob
able of future payment by considering factors such as applicable regulatory changes, recent rate ordersapplicable to other regulated entiti
es, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. If future recovery of costs previouslydeferred ceases to be probable, the related regulatory assets are written off and recog
nized in income from continuing operations.PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS 
— The Company recognizes in its Consoli dated Balance Sheets an asset or liabilityreflecting the funded status of pension and other postretirement pla
ns with current-year changes in actuarial gains or losses recognized in AOCL,except for those plans at certain of the Company's regulated utiliti
es that can recover portions of their pension and postretirement obligationsthrough future rates. All plan assets are recorded at fair value. AES follows the measureme
nt date provisions of the accounting guidance, whichrequire a year-end measurement date of plan assets and obl
igations for all defined benefit plans.INCOME TAXES 
— Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognize d for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between thefinancial statement carrying amounts of the existing assets and lia
bilities, and their respective income tax basis. The Company establishes avaluation allowance w
hen it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company's tax positions areevaluated under a more likely than not recogn
ition threshold and measurement analysis before they are recognized for financial statement reporting.Uncertain tax positions have been class
ified as noncurrent income tax liabilities unless expected to be paid within one year. The Company'spolicy for interest and penalties related to income tax expos
ures is to recognize interest and penalties as a component of the provision for incometaxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Company has elected to treat GILTI as an expense in the period in w
hich the tax is accrued. Accordingly, no deferred tax assets orliabilities are recorded related to GILTI.
The Company applies the flow-through metho
d to account for its investment tax credits.The Company's accounting pol
icy for releasing the income tax effects from AOCL occurs on a portfolio basis.ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS 
— The Company records the fair value of a liability for a legal ob ligation to retire an asset in the periodin which the obligation is inc
urred. When a new liability is recognized, the Company capitalizes the costs of the liability by increasing the carryingamount of the related long-lived asset. The liabi
lity is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the usefullife of the related asset. Upon settlement of the obligation, the Company e
liminates the liability and, based on the actual cost to retire, may incur again or loss.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION 
— A business's functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environme nt in which thebusiness operates and is general
ly the currency in which the business generates and expends cash. Subsidiaries and affiliates whose functionalcurrency is a currency other than the U.S. dollar translate their assets and liabiliti
es into U.S. dollars at the current exchange rates in effect at theend of the fiscal period. Adjustments arising from the translation of the balanc
e sheet of such subsidiaries are included in AOCL. The revenue andexpense accounts of such subsidiaries a
nd affiliates are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates for the period. Gains and losseson intercompany foreign currency transactions that are long-term in nature and wh
ich the Company does not intend to settle in the foreseeablefuture, are also recognized in AOCL. Gains and losses that arise from exchang
e rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency otherthan the functional currency are included in d
etermining net income. Accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments are reclassified fromAOCL to net income only when realized up
on sale or upon complete or
138 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019substantially complete liquid
ation of the investment in a foreign entity. The accumulated adjustments are included in carrying amounts in impairmentassessments where the Company has committed to a plan that will cause the acc
umulated adjustments to be reclassified to earnings.REVENUE RECOGNITION 
— Revenue is earned from the sale of electricity from our utilities,the production and sa le of electricity and capacityfrom our generation facilities, and development an
d construction of generation facilities. Revenue is recognized upon the transfer of control ofpromised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which w
e expect to be entitled in exchange for those goodsor services. Revenue is recorded net of any taxes assessed on and co
llected from customers, which are remitted to the governmental authorities.Utilities
 — Our utilities sell electricity directly to end-users, such as homes and businesses, and bill customers directly. The majority of our utilitycontracts have a single performance obligatio
n, as the promises to transfer energy, capacity, and other distribution and/or transmission services arenot distinct. Additionally, as the performance oblig
ation is satisfied over time as energy is delivered, and the same method is used to measureprogress, the performance obligation meets the criteria to be considered a seri
es. Utility revenue is classified as regulated on the ConsolidatedStatements of Operations.
In exchange for the right to sell or distribute electricity in a service territory, our utility businesses are subject to governme
nt regulation. Thisregulation sets the framework for the prices (“tariffs”) that our utilities are allowed to charge customers for electricity. Since tariffs are determined by
the regulator, the price that our utilities have the right to bill corresponds directly w
ith the value to the customer of the utility's performance completedin each period. The Company also has some month-to-month contracts. Reven
ue under these contracts is recognized using an output methodmeasured by the MWh delivered each month, which best depicts the transfer of goods or services to the customer, at the approved tariff.
The Company has businesses where it sel
ls and purchases power to and from ISOs and RTOs. Our utility businesses generally purchasepower to satisfy the demand of customers that is not contracted through separate PPAs. In these instances, the Company acco
unts for thesetransactions on a net hourly basis because the transactio
ns are settled on a net hourly basis. In limited situations, a utility customer may choose toreceive generation services from a third-party provider, in which case the Compa
ny may serve as a billing agent for the provider and recognizerevenue on a net basis.
Generation — 
Most of our generation fleet sells electricity under contracts to customers such as utilities, industrial users, and oth erintermediaries. Our generation contracts, based on specific facts and circumstances, can hav
e one or more performance obligations as the promiseto transfer energy, capacity, and other services may or may not be distinct depending on the nature of the market and terms of the contract. As the
performance obligations are general
ly satisfied over time and use the same method to measure progress, the performance obligations meet thecriteria to be considered a series. In measuring progress toward satisfaction of a performance ob
ligation, the Company applies the "right to invoice"practical expedient when avai
lable, and recognizes revenue in the amount to which the Company has a right to consideration from a customer thatcorresponds directly with the value of the performance completed to date. Reve
nue from generation businesses is classified as non-regulated on theConsolidated Statements of Operations.
Revenue from generation contracts is recognized usi
ng an output method, as energy and capacity delivered best depicts the transfer of goodsor services to the customer. Performance obligations to deliver energy are genera
lly satisfied when the MW is generated. Performance obligationsfor capacity and ancillary services (such as operations an
d maintenance and dispatch services) are satisfied over time as the Company standsready to perform under the terms of the contract. In certain contracts, if plant availability exceeds a contractual target, the Company may receive a
performance bonus payment, or if the plant availability falls b
elow a guaranteed minimum target, we may incur a non-availability penalty. Suchbonuses or penalties represent a form of variable consid
eration and are estimated and recognized when it is probable that there will not be asignificant reversal.
For contracts determined to have multiple performance obligatio
ns, we allocate revenue to each performance obligation based on its relativestandalone selling price us
ing a market or expected cost plus margin approach. Additionally, the Company allocates variable consideration to one ormore, but not all, distinct goods or services that form part of a single performance obligation when (1) the variab
le consideration relates specificallyto the efforts to transfer the distinct good or service and (2) the variable consideration depicts the amount to which the C
ompany expects to beentitled in exchange for transferring the promised good or service to the customer.

139 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019Certain generation contracts contain operatin
g leases where capacity payments are generally considered lease elements. In such cases, theallocation between the leas
e and non-lease elements is made at the inception of the lease following the guidance in ASC 842.In assessing whether variable quantiti
es are considered variable consideration or an option to acquire additional goods and services, theCompany evaluates the nature of the promise and the leg
ally enforceable rights in the contract. In some contracts, such as requirement contracts,the legally enforceable rights merely give the customer a right to purchas
e additional goods and services which are distinct. In these contracts, thecustomer's action results in a new obligation, an
d the variable quantities are considered an option.When energy or capacity is sold or purchased in the spot market or to ISOs, the Company assesses the facts and circumstances to determine
gross versus net presentation of spot revenues and purchases. General
ly, the nature of the performance obligation is to sell surplus energy orcapacity above contractual commitments, or to purchase energy or capacity to satisfy deficits. Generally, on an hourly b
asis, a generator is either anet seller or a net buyer in terms of the amount of energy or capacity transacted with the ISO. In these situations, the Company recognizes revenue
for the hours where the generator is a net seller and cost of sales for the hours where the generator is a net buyer.
The transaction price allocated to a construction performance ob
ligation is recognized as revenue over time as construction activity occurs,with revenue being fully recogniz
ed upon completion of construction. These contracts may include a difference in timing between revenuerecognition and the collection of cash rece
ipts, which may be collected over the term of the entire arrangement. The timing difference could result ina significant financing compone
nt for the construction performance obligation if determined to be a material component of the transaction price. TheCompany accounts for a significant financing comp
onent under the effective interest rate method, recognizing a long-term receivable for theexpected future payments related to the construction performance obligati
on in the Loan Receivable line item on the  Consolidated Balance Sheets.As payments are collected from the customer over the term of the contract, consideration related to the construction performance obligation is
bifurcated between the principal repayme
nt of the long-term receivable and the related interest income, recognized in the Consolidated Statementsof Operations.
Contract Balances
 — The timing of revenue recognition, billings, an d cash collections results in accounts receivable and contract liabilities.Accounts receivable represent uncond
itional rights to consideration and consist of both billed amounts and unbilled amounts typically resulting fromsales under long-term contracts when revenue recogniz
ed exceeds the amount billed to the customer. We bill both generation and utilitiescustomers on a contractually agreed-upon schedu
le, typically at periodic intervals (e.g., monthly). The calculation of revenue earned but not yetbilled is based on the number of days not bil
led in the month, the estimated amount of energy delivered during those days and the estimatedaverage price per customer class for that month.
Our contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue which is class
ified as current or noncurrent based on the timing of when we expect torecognize revenue. The current portion of our contract liabiliti
es is reported in Accrued and other liabilities  and the noncurrent portion is reported in Other noncurrent liabilities
 on the Consolidated Balan ce Sheets.Remaining Performance Obligations — 
The transaction price allocated to remaining p erformance obligations represents future considerationfor unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligati
ons at the end of the reporting period. The Company has elected to apply the optionaldisclosure exemptions under ASC 60
6. Therefore, the amount disclosed in Note 20—Revenue  excludes contracts with an original length of one yearor less, contracts for which we recognize revenue based on the amou
nt we have the right to invoice for services performed, and variableconsideration allocated entire
ly to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation when the consideration relates specifically to our efforts to satisfy theperformance obligation and dep
icts the amount to which we expect to be entitled. As such, consideration for energy is excluded from the amountdisclosed as the variable consid
eration relates to the amount of energy delivered and reflects the value the Company expects to receive for theenergy transferred. Estimates of revenue expected to be recognized in future perio
ds also exclude unexercised customer options to purchaseadditional goods or services that do not represent material rig
hts to the customer.LEASES 
— The Company has operating and financ e leases for energy production facilities, land, office space, transmission lines, vehicles andother operating equipment in which the C
ompany is the lessee. Operating leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on thebalance sheet, but are expensed on a straight-li
ne
140 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019basis over the lease term. The Company’s leases do not contai
n any material residual value guarantees, restrictive covenants or subleases.Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term while l
ease liabilities represent our obligation to makelease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and leas
e liabilities are recognized on commencement of the lease based on the presentvalue of lease payments over the lease term. Generally, the rate implicit in the lease is n
ot readily determinable; as such, we use the subsidiaries’incremental borrowing rate based on the information av
ailable at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. TheCompany determines discount rates based on its existin
g credit rates of its unsecured borrowings, which are then adjusted for the appropriate leaseterm and currency. The right-of-use asset also includes any lease payments made a
nd excludes lease incentives that are paid or payable to thelessee at commencement. The lease term includes the option to extend or terminate the le
ase if it is reasonably certain that the option will beexercised.
The Company has operating leases for certain ge
neration contracts that contain provisions to provide capacity to a customer, which is a stand-ready obligation to deliver energy w
hen required by the customer in which the Company is the lessor. Capacity payments are generally consideredlease elements as they cover the majority of available outp
ut from a facility. The allocation of contract payments between the lease and non-leaseelements is made at the inception of the lease. Fixed leas
e payments from such contracts are recognized as lease revenue on a straight-line basisover the lease term, whereas variable lease payments are recogn
ized when earned.The Company has sales-type leases for BESS in w
hich the Company is the lessor. These arrangements allow customers the ability todetermine when to charge and discharge the B
ESS, representing the transfer of control and constitutes the arrangement as a sales-type lease.Upon commencement of the lease, the book value of the lease
d asset is removed from the balance sheet and a net investment in sales-type leaseis recognized based on the present valu
e of fixed payments under the contract and the residual value of the underlying asset.SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION 
— The Company grants share-based compensation i n the form of stock options, restricted stock units,performance stock units, and performance cash units. The expense is based o
n the grant-date fair value of the equity or liability instrument issuedand is recognized on a straight-line bas
is over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures. The Company uses a Black-Scholes optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to its employees.
GENERAL AND ADMINIS
TRATIVE EXPENSES — General and administrative expenses incl ude corporate and other expenses related tocorporate staff functions and initiatives, primarily executive manageme
nt, finance, legal, human resources and information systems, which are notdirectly allocable to our business segme
nts. Additionally, all costs associated with corporate business development efforts are classified as generaland administrative expenses.
DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 
— Under the accounting standards for derivatives and he dging, the Company recognizes allcontracts that meet the definition of a derivative, except those designated as normal p
urchase or normal sale at inception, as either assets orliabilities in the Consol
idated Balance Sheets and measures those instruments at fair value. See Note 5—Fair Value  and Fair value  in this section for additional discussion reg
arding the determination of fair value.PPAs and fuel supply agreements are eval
uated to assess if they contain either a derivative or an embedded derivative requiring separatevaluation and accounting. Genera
lly, these agreements do not meet the definition of a derivative, often due to the inability to be net settled. On aquarterly basis, we evaluate the markets for commodities to be delivered und
er these agreements to determine if facts and circumstances havechanged such that the agreements could be net settled a
nd meet the definition of a derivative.The Company typically designates its deriv
ative instruments as cash flow hedges if they meet the criteria specified in ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging
. The Company enters into interest rate swap agreements in order to hedge the variab ility of expected future cash interest payments.Foreign currency contracts are used to reduce risks arising from the change in fair value of certain foreig
n currency denominated assets andliabilities. The objective of these practices is to minimiz
e the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on operating results. The Company also entersinto commodity contracts to economically hedge price variab
ility inherent in electricity sales arrangements. The objectives of the commoditycontracts are to minimize the impact of variability in spot electricity prices and stabilize estimate
d revenue streams. The Company does not usederivative instruments for speculative purposes.

141 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019For our hedges, changes in fair value are deferred in AOCL a
nd are recognized into earnings as the hedged transactions affect earnings. If aderivative is no longer highly effective, hed
ge accounting will be discontinued prospectively. For cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions, AESestimates the future cash flows of the forecasted transactions and evaluates the probab
ility of the occurrence and timing of such transactions.Changes in the fair value of derivatives not desi
gnated and qualifying as cash flow hedges are immediately recognized in earnings. Regardlessof when gains or losses on derivatives are recogn
ized in earnings, they are generally classified as interest expense for interest rate and cross-currency derivatives, foreign currency transaction gains or losses for foreign currency derivativ
es, and non-regulated revenue or non-regulated costof sales for commodity and other derivatives. Cash flows arising from derivatives are inclu
ded in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as anoperating activity given the nature of the underlyin
g risk being economically hedged and the lack of significant financing elements, except that cashflows on designated and qua
lifying hedges of variable-rate interest during construction are classified as an investing activity. The Company haselected not to offset net derivative positions in the financia
l statements.CREDIT LOSSES 
—  In accordance with ASC 326, the Company records an allowance for current expected credit losses (“CECL”) foraccounts and notes receivable, financi
ng receivables, contract assets, net investments in leases recognized as a lessor, held-to-maturity debtsecurities, financial guarantees related to the no
n-payment of a financial obligation, and off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for asinsurance. The CECL allowa
nce is based on the asset's amortized cost and reflects management's expected risk of credit losses over the remainingcontractual life of the asset. CECL allowances are estimated us
ing relevant information about the collectibility of cash flows and consider informationabout past events, current conditions, and reasonabl
e and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. See New Accounting Pronouncements 
below for further information regarding the impact on the Company's fina ncial statements upon adoption of ASC 326.The following table represents the rollforward of the al

(Topic 842)
ASC 842 was adopted by sPower on January 1, 2020. sPower was not requiredto adopt ASC 842 using the public adoption date, as s
Power is an equitymethod investee that meets the definition of a public business entity only by
virtue of the inclusion of its summarized financial information in the Company’s
SEC filings.
January 1, 2020The adoption of this standard resulted in a $4 million decrease
to accumulated deficit attributable
to the AES Corporation
stockholders’ equity.
ASC 326 
—  Financial Instruments — Credit LossesOn January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASC 32
6 Financial Instruments — Credit Losses  and its subsequent corresponding up dates (“ASC326”). The new standard updates the impairment model for financia
l assets measured at amortized cost, known as the Current Expected CreditLoss (“CECL”) model. For trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans, and oth
er instruments, entities are required to use anew forward-looking "expected loss" model that gen
erally results in the earlier recognition of an allowance for credit losses. For available-for-saledebt securities with unrealized losses, entiti
es measure credit losses as it was done under previous GAAP, except that unrealized losses due tocredit-related factors are now recognized as an allow
ance on the balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to earnings in the incomestatement.

The Mong Duong II power plant in Vietnam is the primary driver of changes i n credit reserves under the new standard. Thisplant is operated under a build, operate, an
d transfer (“BOT”) contract and will be transferred to the Vietnamese government after the completion ofa 25-year PPA. A loan receivable was recog
nized in 2018 upon the adoption of ASC 606 in order to account for the future expected payments forthe construction performance obligation portion of the BOT contract. As the payments for the construction performance obl
igation occur over a 25-year term, a significant financing element was determined to exist whic
h is accounted for under the effective interest rate method. Historically, theCompany has not incurred any losses on this arrangeme
nt, of which no directly comparable assets exist in the market. In order to determineexpected credit losses under ASC 326 arisi
ng from this $1.4 billion loan receivable as of January 1, 2020, the Company considered averagehistorical default and recovery rates on similarly rated sovereig
n bonds, which formed an initial basis for developing a probability of default, net ofexpected recoveries, to be applied as a key credit qua
lity indicator for this arrangement. A resulting estimated loss rate of 2.4% was applied to theweighted-average remaining l
ife of the loan receivable, after adjustments for certain asset-specific characteristics, including the Company’s statusas a large foreign direct investor in Vietnam, Mong Duong

ECL reserve of $34 million as an adjustment to Accumulated deficit  and Noncontrolling interests as of January 1, 2020. Argentina — 
Exposure to  CAMMESA, the administrator of the wholesale energy market in Argentina, is the driver of credit reserves inArgentina. As discussed in Note 7
— Financing Receivables, the Company has credit exposures through the FONINVEMEM Agreements, other agreements related to resolutions passed by the Argenti
ne government in which AES Argentina will receive compensation for investments in newgeneration plants and technol
ogies, as well as regular accounts receivable balances. The timing of collections depends on correspondingagreements and collectability of these receiva
bles are assessed on an ongoing basis.Collection of the principal and i
nterest on these receivables is subject to various business risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to,the continued operation of power pla
nts which generate cash for payments of these receivables, regulatory changes that could impact the timingand amount of collections, and economic con
ditions in Argentina. The Company monitors these risks, including the credit ratings of the Argentinegovernment, on a quarterly basis to assess the collectability of these receiv
ables. Historically, the Company has not incurred any credit-relatedlosses on these receivables. In order to determine expected credit loss
es under ASC 326, the Company considered historical default probabilitiesutilizing similarly rated sovereign bo
nds and historic recovery rates for Argentine government bond defaults. This information formed an initial basisfor developing a probability of defau
lt, net of expected recoveries, to be applied as a key credit quality indicator across the underlying financingreceivables. A resulting estimated weighte
d average loss rate of 41.2% was applied to the remaining balance of these receivables, after adjustmentsfor certain asset-specific characteristics, including AES Argenti
na’s role in providing critical energy infrastructure to Argentina, our history ofcollections on these receivables, an
d the average term that the receivables are expected to be outstanding. As a result of this analysis, theCompany recognized an open
ing CECL reserve of $29 million as an adjustment to Accumulated deficit  as of January 1, 2020. Other financial assets
 — Application of ASC 326 to the Company’s $1.5 billion of trade accounts receivable and $326 million of available-for-sale debt securities at January 1, 2020 did not result in any materia
l adjustments, primarily due to the short-term duration and high turnover of thesefinancial assets. Additionally, a larg
e portion of our trade accounts receivables and amounts reserved for doubtful accounts under legacy GAAParise from arrangements accounted for as an operating lease und
er ASC 842, which are excluded from the scope of ASC 326.As discussed in Note 7
— Financing Receivables, AES Andes recorded $33 million of nonc urrent receivables at December 31, 2020 pertainingto revenues recognized on regulated e
nergy contracts that were impacted by the Stabilization Fund created by the Chilean government in October2019. The Company expects to collect these noncurrent receiv
ables through the execution of sale agreements with third parties. However, given theinvestment grade rating of Chile and the history of zero credit losses for regulated customers, manag
ement determined that no incremental CECLreserves were required to be recognized as of January 1, 2020.

144 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019New Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Effective 
— The following table provides a brief description of recent accountingpronouncements that could have a material impact on the Comp
any’s consolidated financial statements once adopted. Accounting pronouncementsnot listed below were assessed and d
etermined to be either not applicable or are expected to have no material impact on the Company’sconsolidated financial statements.
New Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Effective
ASU Number and Name
Description Date of Adoption Effect on the financial statementsupon adoption
2021-08, Business Combinations
(Topic 805): Accounting for
Contract Assets and Contract
Liabilities from Contracts with
Customers
This update is to improve the accounting for acquired revenue contracts withcustomers in a business combination by addressing diversity in practice and
inconsistency related to the following: 1. Recognition of an acquired contract
liability 2. Payment terms and their effect on subsequent revenue recognized by
the acquirer. Early adoption of the amendments is permitted, including adoption
in an interim period. An entity that early adopts in an interim period should apply
the amendments (1) retrospectively to all business combinations for which the
acquisition date occurs on or after the beginning of the fiscal year that includes
the interim period of early application and (2) prospectively to all business
combinations that occur on or after the date of initial application.
For fiscal yearsbeginning after
December 15, 2022,
including interim
periods within those
fiscal years.
The Company is currentlyevaluating the impact of adopting
the standard on its consolidated
financial statements.
2021-05, Leases (Topic 842),
Lessors—Certain Leases with
Variable Lease Payments
The amendments in this update affect lessors with lease contracts that (1) havevariable lease payments that do not depend on a reference index or a rate and
(2) would have resulted in the recognition of a selling loss at lease
commencement if classified as sales-type or direct financing. Lessors should
classify and account for a lease with variable lease payments that do not depend
on a reference index or a rate as an operating lease if both of the 
followingcriteria are met: (a) The lease would have been classified as a sales-type lease
or a direct financing lease in accordance with the classification criteria in
paragraphs 842-10-25-2 through 25-3, (b) The lessor would have otherwise
recognized a day-one loss. This update could be applied either (1)
retrospectively to leases that commenced or were modified on or after the
adoption of Update 2016-02 or (2) prospectively to leases that commence or are
modified on or after the date that an entity first applies the
 amendments. Earlierapplication is permitted.
For fiscal yearsbeginning after
December 15, 2021,
including interim
periods within those
fiscal years.
The Company is currentlyevaluating the impact of adopting
the standard on its consolidated
financial statements. Upon
adoption, the Company expects
that the majority of our Battery
Storage lease arrangements will
qualify as operating leases under
the new guidance, which should
reduce the likelihood of
recognizing day-one losses on
these arrangements in the future.
Losses on these arrangements of
$13 million, $0, and $36 million
were recorded for the years
ended December 31, 2021, 2020,
and 2019, respectively.
2020-06, Debt - Debt with

(Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives
and Hedging-Contracts in Equity’s
Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40):
Accounting for Convertible
Instruments and Contracts in an
Equity’s Own Equity
The amendments in this update affect entities that issue convertible instrumentsand/or contracts indexed to and potentially settled in an entity’s own equity. The
new ASU eliminates the beneficial conversion and cash conversion accounting
models for convertible instruments. It also amends the accounting for certain
contracts in an entity’s own equity that are currently accounted for as derivatives
because of specific settlement provisions. In addition, the new guidance
modifies how particular convertible instruments and certain contracts that may
be settled in cash or shares impact the diluted EPS computation.
For fiscal yearsbeginning after
December 15, 2021,
including interim
periods within those
fiscal years.
The Company is currentlyevaluating the impact of adopting
the standard on its consolidated
financial statements.
2020-04 and 2021-01, Reference
Rate Reform (Topic 848):
Facilitation of the Effects of
Reference Rate Reform on
Financial Reporting
The amendments in these updates provide optional expedients and exceptionsfor applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions
that reference to LIBOR or another reference rate expected to
 be discontinuedby reference rate reform, and clarify that certain optional expedients and
exceptions in Topic 848 for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply
to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. These amendments
are effective for a limited period of time (March 12, 2020 - December 31, 2022).
Effective for all entitiesas of March 12, 2020
through December 31,

$ 606 $ 462 The Company's asset retirement obligations inc
lude active ash landfills, water treatment basins and the removal or dismantlement of certainplants and equipment. The Company uses the cost ap
proach to determine the initial value of ARO liabilities, which is estimated by discountingexpected cash outflows to their present value using market-base
d rates at the initial recording of the liabilities. Cash outflows are based on theapproximate future disposal costs as determined by market information, historical informatio
n or other management estimates. Subsequentdownward revisions of ARO liabil
ities are discounted using the market-based rates that existed when the liability was initially recognized. Theseinputs to the fair value of the ARO liabilities are consid
ered Level 3 inputs under the fair value hierarchy.During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Comp
any increased the asset retirement obligations and corresponding assets at AES CleanEnergy and Chile by $93 milli
on and $36 million, respectively. The increase at AES Clean Energy is mostly due to the initial recognition of assetretirement obligations as a result of the New York Wind acquisiti
on. The increase at Chile is primarily due to shortened useful lives of the Ventanasand Angamos coal plants, additio
nal liabilities incurred due to the development of the Andes Solar 2b plant, and an upward revision of estimatedcash flows at the Los Cururos plant.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Comp
any increased the asset retirement obligations and corresponding assets at Chile andAES Hawaii, by $17 million a
nd $12 million, respectively, and decreased the asset retirement obligation at DPL by $13 million. The increase at Chileis mostly due to the initial recognition of the ARO at the Andes Sol
ar 2b plant. The increase at AES Hawaii reflects the shortened useful life of thecoal plant resulting from the passage of Senate Bil
l 2629, which prohibits issuing or renewing permits for coal power plants after December 31, 2022and calls for ceasing all coal burni
ng for electricity generation by that date. The decrease at DPL is attributable to the sale of the Hutchings facility inDecember 2020.
5. FAIR VALUE
The fair value of current financial assets and liabi
lities, debt service reserves, and other deposits approximate their reported carrying amounts.The estimated fair values of the Company's assets and liab
ilities have been determined using available market information. Because these amountsare estimates and based on hypothetical transactio
ns to sell assets or transfer liabilities, the use of different market assumptions and/or estimationmethodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amou
nts.Valuation Techniques 
—  The fair value measurement accounting guidance describes three main approaches to measuring the fair value ofassets and liabilities: (1) market approach, (2) income approach, and (3) cost approac
h. The market approach uses prices and other relevantinformation generated from market transactions involving identic
al or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuationtechniques to convert future amounts to a single present value amou
nt. The measurement is based on current market expectations of the return onthose future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently b
e required to replace an asset. The Company measures itsinvestments and derivatives at fair value on a recurring basis. Add
itionally, in connection with annual or event-driven impairment evaluations, certainnonfinancial assets and lia
bilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These include long-lived tangible assets (i.e., property, plantand equipment), goodwill, and i
ntangible assets (e.g., sales concessions, land use rights and water rights, etc.). In general, the Companydetermines the fair value of investments and derivatives using the market appro
ach and the income approach, respectively. In the nonrecurringmeasurements of nonfinancial assets and lia
bilities, all three approaches are considered; however, the value estimated under the income approachis often the most representative of fair value.

147 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019Investments 
— The Company's investments measured at fair value general ly consist of marketable debt and equity securities. Equity securitiesare either measured at fair value using quoted market prices or based on comp
arisons to market data obtained for similar assets. Debt securitiesprimarily consist of unsecured debentures and certificates of dep
osit held by our Brazilian subsidiaries. Returns and pricing on these instruments aregenerally indexed to the market interest rates in Brazil. Debt securities are measure
d at fair value based on comparisons to market data obtained forsimilar assets.
Derivatives 
— Derivatives are measured at fair value using quoted market prices or the income ap proach utilizing volatilities, spot and forwardbenchmark interest rates (such as LIBOR and EURIBOR), foreign exchange rates, credit data, and commodity prices, as app
licable. Whensignificant inputs are not observable, the Compa
ny uses relevant techniques to determine the inputs, such as regression analysis or prices forsimilarly traded instruments available in the market.
The Company's methodology to fair value its derivativ
es is to start with any observable inputs; however, in certain instances the publishedforward rates or prices may not extend through the remaining term of the contract, and management must make assumptions to extrapolate the
curve, which necessitates the use of unobservable i
nputs, such as proxy commodity prices or historical settlements to forecast forward prices.Specifically, where there is limited forward curve data with respect to foreign exc
hange contracts beyond the traded points, the Company utilizes theinterest rate differential approach to construct the remaining portion of the forward curve. Similarly, in certain i
nstances, the spread that reflects thecredit or nonperformance risk is unobservable, requiring the us
e of proxy yield curves of similar credit quality.To determine the fair value of a derivative, cash flows are discounted us
ing the relevant spot benchmark interest rate. The Company thenmakes a credit valuation adjustment ("CVA"), as applicable, by further discou
nting the cash flows for nonperformance or credit risk based on theobservable or estimated debt spread of the Company's subs
idiary or its counterparty and the tenor of the respective derivative instrument. The CVAfor potential future scenarios in which the derivative is in a
n asset position is based on the counterparty's credit ratings, credit default swap spreads,and debt spreads, as available. The CV
A for potential future scenarios in which the derivative is in a liability position is based on the ParentCompany's or the subsidiary's current debt spread. In the absence of read
ily obtainable credit information, the Parent Company's or the subsidiary'sestimated credit rating (based on applying a stand
ard industry model to historical financial information and then considering other relevantinformation) and spreads of comparably rated entities or the respective country's de
bt spreads are used as a proxy. All derivative instruments areanalyzed individua
lly and are subject to unique risk exposures.The fair value hierarchy of an asset or a liability is based o
n the level of significance of the input assumptions. An input assumption isconsidered significant if it affects the fair value by at least 10%. Assets and liab
ilities are classified as Level 3 when the use of unobservable inputs issignificant. When the use of unobservable in
puts is insignificant, assets and liabilities are classified as Level 2. Transfers between Level 3 and Level2 result from changes in significance of unobservab
le inputs used to calculate the CVA.Debt 
— Recourse and non-recourse debt are carried at amortized cost. The fair value of recourse debt is estimated b ased on quoted marketprices. The fair value of non-recourse debt is estimated based upo
n interest rates and other features of the loan. In general, the carrying amount ofvariable rate debt is a close approximation of its fair value. For fixed rate loans, the fair valu
e is estimated using quoted market prices or discountedcash flow ("DCF") analyses. The fair value of recourse and non-recourse debt excl
udes accrued interest at the valuation date. The fair value wasdetermined using availabl
e market information as of December 31, 2021. The Company is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect thefair value amounts subsequent to December 31, 2021.
Nonrecurring measurements 
—  For nonrecurring measurements derived using the income approach, fair value is generally determined usingvaluation models based on the princ
iples of DCF. The income approach is most often used in the impairment evaluation of long-lived tangibleassets, equity method investments, goodwill, and intan
gible assets. Where the use of market observable data is limited or not available for certaininput assumptions, the Company develops its ow
n estimates using a variety of techniques such as regression analysis and extrapolations.Depending on the complexity of a valu
ation, an independent valuation firm may be engaged to assist management in the valuation process.For nonrecurring measurements derived using the market approach, recent market transactions inv
olving the sale of identical or similar assetsare considered. The use of this approach is limited bec
ause it is often difficult to
148 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019identify sale transactions of identical or similar assets. This appro
ach is used in impairment evaluations of certain intangible assets. Otherwise, it isused to corroborate the fair value determined under the income ap
proach.For nonrecurring measurements derived using the cost approac
h, fair value is typically based upon a replacement cost approach. Thisapproach involves a considera
ble amount of judgment, which is why its use is limited to the measurement of long-lived tangible assets. Like themarket approach, this approach is also used to corroborate the fair value determin
ed under the income approach.Fair Value Considerations 
— In determining fair value, the Company considers the source of observab le market data inputs, liquidity of theinstrument, the credit risk of the counterparty, and the risk of the Company's or its counterparty's nonperformance. The conditions and criteria us
edto assess these factors are:
Sources of market assumptions 
— The Company derives most of its market assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g., Bloomberg and Reuters). To determine fair value where market data is not readily avail
able, management uses comparable market sources and empiricalevidence to develop its own estimates of market assumptions.
Market liquidity 
— The Company evaluates market liquidity base d on whether the financial or physical instrument, or the underlying asset, istraded in an active or inactive market. An active market exists if the prices are fully transparent to market participants, can be measured by market
bid and ask quotes, the market has a relatively large proportion of tradin
g volume as compared to the Company's current trading volume, and themarket has a significant number of market participants that will allow the market to rapidly absorb the q
uantity of assets traded without significantlyaffecting the market price. Another factor the Company considers when determining w
hether a market is active or inactive is the presence ofgovernment or regulatory controls over pricing that could make it difficult to establish a market-base
d price when entering into a transaction.Nonperformance risk 
— Nonperformance risk refers to the risk that an obligation will not be fulfille d and affects the value at which a liability istransferred or an asset is sold. Nonperformance risk includes, but may not be limited to, the Company's or its counterparty's credit an
d settlementrisk. Nonperformance risk adjustments are dependent on credit spreads, letters of credit, collateral, other arrang
ements available, and the nature ofmaster netting arrangements. The Company is party to various interest rate swaps and options, foreign currency o
ptions and forwards, andderivatives and embedded derivativ
es, which subject the Company to nonperformance risk. The financial and physical instruments held at thesubsidiary level are generally n
on-recourse to the Parent Company.Nonperformance risk on the investments held by the Company is inc
orporated in the fair value derived from quoted market data to mark theinvestments to fair value.
Recurring Measurements
 — The following table presents, by level withi n the fair value hierarchy as described in Note 1—General and Summary of Signi
ficant Accounting Policies, the Company's financial assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis as ofthe dates indicated (in millions). For the Company's inv
estments in marketable debt securities, the security classes presented were determinedbased on the nature and risk of the security and are consistent with how the C
ompany manages, monitors, and measures its marketable securities:

7. FINANCING RECEIVABLES
Receivables with contractual maturities of greater than one ye
ar are considered financing receivables. The following table presents financingreceivables by country as of the dates indicated (in milli
ons). As the Company applied the modified retrospective method of adoption for ASC 326effective January 1, 2020, CECL reserves are included i
n the receivable balance as of December 31, 2021. See Note 1—General and Summary of Significant Accounting Poli
cies for fur ther information.December 31, 2021

Collection of the principal and i
nterest on these receivables is subject to various business risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to,the continued operation of power pla
nts which generate cash for payments of these receivables, regulatory changes that could impact the timingand amount of collections, and economic con
ditions in Argentina. The Company monitors these risks, including the credit ratings of the Argentinegovernment, on a quarterly basis to assess the collectability of these receiv
ables. The Company accrues interest on these receivables once therecognition criteria have been met. The Company's co
llection estimates are based on assumptions that it believes to be reasonable, but areinherently uncertain. Actual future cash flows could d
iffer from these estimates. The decrease in Argentina financing receivables was primarily dueto planned collections and u
nfavorable FX impacts.FONINVEMEM Agreements —
 As a result of energy market reforms in 2004 and 2010, AES Argentina entered into three agreements with theArgentine government, referred to as the FONINVEMEM Agreements, to contribute a portion of their accounts receivabl
e into a fund for financingthe construction of combined cycle and gas-fired plants. These rece
ivables accrue interest and are collected in monthly installments over 10 yearsonce the related plan
t begins operations. (1)(1)

154 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019The FONINVEMEM receivables are denominated i
n Argentine pesos, but indexed to USD, which represents a foreign currency derivative. Dueto differences between spot rates, used to remeasure the receivables, and disc
ounted forward rates, used to value the foreign currency derivative,these two items will not perfectly offset over the life of the receivable. Once settled, the foreign currency derivative wil
l offset the accumulatedunrealized foreign currency losses resultin
g from the devaluation of the FONINVEMEM receivable. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the amountof the foreign currency-related derivative assets associated with the FONINVEMEM fina
ncing receivables that were excluded from the table abovehad a fair value of $108 million and $
146 million, respectively.The receivables under the FONINVEMEM Agreements have b
een actively collected since the related plants commenced operations in 2010and 2016. In assessing the collectabi
lity of the receivables under these agreements, the Company also considers historic collection evidence inaccordance with the agreements.
Other Agreemen
ts — Other agreements primarily consist of resolutions passed by the Argentine government in which AES Argentina willreceive compensation for investments in new generati
on plants and technologies. The timing of collections depend on corresponding agreementsand collectability of these receivabl
es are assessed on an ongoing basis.Chile
AES Andes has recorded receivabl
es pertaining to revenues recognized on regulated energy contracts that were impacted by the StabilizationFund created by the Chilean government in October 20
19, in conjunction with the Tariff Stabilization Law. Historically, the government updated theprices for these contracts every six months to reflect the indexation the contracts have to exchange rates and commodities prices. The Sta
bilizationFund does not allow the pass-through of these contractua
l indexation updates to customers beyond the pricing in effect at July 1, 2019, until newlower-cost renewable contracts are incorporated into prici
ng in 2023. Consequently, costs incurred in excess of the July 1, 2019 price will beaccumulated and borne by generators.
On December 31, 2020, AES Andes executed an a
greement for the sale of receivables generated pursuant the Tariff Stabilization Law. As aresult of the agreement, as of December 31, 2021, $34 million of current receivables a
nd $9 million of noncurrent receivables were recorded inAccounts receivable
 and Other noncurrent assets , respectively, pertaining to the Stabilization Fun d. Additionally, $8 million of payment deferralsgranted to mining customers as part of our green blend agreements were recorded as fin
ancing receivables included in Other noncurrent assets  at December 31, 2021.

Uplight
 — In July 2021, the Company closed on a transaction involv ing existing and new shareholders of Uplight. As part of the transaction, theCompany contributed $37 million to Up
light; however, AES’s ownership interest in Uplight decreased from 32.3% to 29.6% primarily due to largercontributions from other investors. The transaction was accounted for as a partial dispos
ition in which AES recognized a loss of $25 million in Gain (loss) on disposal and sale of business i
nterests, mainly as a result of the settlement of share based awards at Uplight as well as the expe nsesassociated with the transaction.
In October 2021, the Company contributed an addition
al $23 million to Uplight. AES' ownership interest decreased to 29.4% as a result ofequity granted to retained executives at a company acqu
ired by Uplight. As the Company still does not control Uplight after the transaction, itcontinues to be accounted for as an equity method investment an
d is reported as part of Corporate and Other.Fluence — 
In June 2021, Fluence issued new sh ares to the Qatar Investment Authority (“QIA”) for $125 million, which following the completionof the transaction, represented a 13.6% ownership interest in Flue
nce. As a result of the transaction, which AES has accounted for as a partialdisposition, AES’ ownershi
p interest in Fluence decreased from 50% to 43.2% and the Company recognized a gain of $60 million in Gain (loss) on disposal and sale of bu
siness interests. On November 1, 2021, Fluence completed its IPO of 35,650,000 of its Class A common stock at a price of $28 per share, incl
uding theexercise of the underwriters’ option. Fluence receive
d approximately $936 million in proceeds, after expenses, as a result of the transaction. AES’ownership interest in Fluence decreas
ed to 34.2%. The Company recognized a gain of $325 million in Gain (loss) on disposal and sale of busin essinterests. 
As the Company still does not control Fluence after the transaction, it continu es to be accounted for as an equity method investment and isreported as part of Corporate and Other.
Grupo Energía Gas Panamá —
 In April 2021, Grupo Energía Gas Panamá, a joint venture between A ES and InterEnergy Power & GasLimited, completed the acquisition of a combine
d cycle natural gas development project. AES holds a 49% ownership interest in the affiliate and asof December 31, 2021, the Company contributed $44 mill
ion to the joint venture. As the Company does not control the joint venture, it is accountedfor as an equity method investment and is reported in the MCAC SBU reportabl
e segment.sPower — 
In February 2021, the Company substantially complete d the merger of the sPower and AES Renewable Holdings developmentplatforms to form AES Clean Energy Development, a consolid
ated entity, which will serve as the development vehicle for all future renewableprojects in the U.S. Since the sPower development pl
atform was carved-out of AES’ existing equity method investment, this transaction resulted in a$102 million decrease in the carrying va
lue of the sPower investment and the Company recognized a gain of $214 million in Other income . In December 2021, AES acquired an add
itional 25% ownership in specifically identified projects of the sPower development platform. As aresult, the Company recognized a gain of $35 mill
ion in Other income. Subsequent to the transaction, AES has a 75% own ership interest inspecifically identified projects of sPow
er through its ownership of AES Clean Energy Development, and 50% ownership interest in the sPower equitymethod investment. See Note 25
— Acquisitions for further information. As the Company still does not control sPower after the transaction, it continues to be accounted for as an equity method investment an
d is reported in the US and Utilities SBU reportable segment.Guacolda —
 In September 2020, Guacolda management reviewe d the recoverability of the Guacolda asset group and determined theundiscounted cash flows did not exce
ed the carrying amount. Impairment indicators were identified primarily as a result of inability to re-contractGuacolda’s generation after expiration of its existin
g PPAs driven by lower energy prices in Chile and reduced forecasted cash flows resulting fromdecarbonization initiatives of the Ch
ilean Government. Guacolda recognized a long-lived asset impairment at the investee level, which negativelyimpacted the Company's 
Net equity in losses of affiliates  by $127 million. As a result, the Company’s basis in its investment in Guac olda wasreduced to zero and the equity method of accounting was sus
pended.
156 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019In February 2021, AES Andes entered into an agre
ement to sell its 50% ownership interest in Guacolda for $34 million. On July 20, 2021, theCompany completed the sale, resulting in a pre-tax gai
n on sale of $34 million, recorded in Gain (loss) on disposal and sale of busin ess interests. Prior to its sale, the Guacolda equity method investment was reported in the South Americ
a SBU reportable segment.OPGC —
 In March 2020, an other-than-temporary impairment was identified at OPGC primarily due to the estimated market value of the Company's investment and the economic slow
down. A calculation of the fair value of the Company’s investment in OPGC was required to evaluatewhether there was a loss in the carrying value of the investment. Based on man
agement’s estimate of fair value of $152 million, the Companyrecognized an other-than-temporary impairment of $43 million.
In June 2020, the Company agreed to sell its entire 49% stake in OPGC resulti
ng in an additional other-than-temporary impairment of$158 million. Total other-than-temporary impairment for the six months ended June 3

imited obligations and commitments, most of which will only be effective or will beterminated upon the occurrence of future events. In the normal course of business, the Parent Company has e
ntered into various agreements,mainly guarantees and letters of credit, to provide financial or performance ass
urance to third parties on behalf of AES businesses. Theseagreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthi
ness otherwise achieved by a business on a stand-alone basis, therebyfacilitating the availability of sufficient credit to accompl
ish their intended business purposes. Most of the contingent obligations relate to futureperformance commitments which the Company or its businesses expect to fulfill withi

Environmental 
— The Company periodically reviews its ob ligations as they relate to compliance with environmental laws, including siterestoration and remediation. For the periods ended D
ecember 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized liabilities of $4 million and $5 million,respectively, for projected environmental remediation costs. Due to the unc
ertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediationactivities, future costs of compliance or remediation could be hig
her or lower than the amount currently accrued. Moreover, where no liability hasbeen recognized, it is reasonably poss
ible that the Company may be required to incur remediation costs or make expenditures in amounts that couldbe material but could not be estimated as of December 31, 2021. In aggreg
ate, the Company estimates the range of potential losses related toenvironmental

164 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019matters, where estimable, to be up to $11 million. The amounts considered reas
onably possible do not include amounts accrued as discussedabove.
Litigation 
—  The Company is involved in certain claims, suits and legal proceedings in the normal course of business. The Company accruesfor litigation and claims when it is probabl
e that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company hasrecognized aggregate liab
ilities for all claims of approximately $23 million and $28 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Theseamounts are reported on the Consolidated Ba
lance Sheets within Accrued and other liabilities  and Other noncurrent liabilities . A significant portion of these accrued liabilities relate to regul
atory matters and commercial disputes in international jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that theseaccrued liabilities will b
e adequate to cover all existing and future claims or that we will have the liquidity to pay such claims as they arise.Where no accrued liability has been reco
gnized, it is reasonably possible that some matters could be decided unfavorably to the Company andcould require the Company to pay damages or make expe
nditures in amounts that could be material but could not be estimated as of December 31,2021. The material contingencies wh
ere a loss is reasonably possible primarily include disputes with offtakers, suppliers and EPC contractors;alleged breaches of contract; alleged vi
olation of laws and regulations; income tax and non-income tax matters with tax authorities; and regulatorymatters. In aggregate, the Company estimates the range of potential losses, where estimable, relate
d to these reasonably possible materialcontingencies to be between $2
55 million and $898 million. The amounts considered reasonably possible do not include the amounts accrued, asdiscussed above. Income tax-related material continge

 — In December 2020, ANEEL published a regulation establishing the terms and conditions for compensation to Tietêfor the non-hydrological risk charged to hydro generators throug
h the incorrect application of the GSF mechanism from 2013 until 2018. Inaccordance with the regulation, this compensati
on will be in the form of a concession extension period of approximately 2.7 years. As a result, thepreviously recognized conting
ent liabilities related to GSF payments were updated to reflect the Company's best estimate for the fair value ofcompensation to be received from the concession extensi
on offered in conjunction with the regulation. This compensation was estimated to have afair value of $184 million, and was recorded as a reversa
l of Non-Regulated  Cost of Sales on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. The concessi
on extension also met the criteria for recognition as a definite-lived intangible asset, which wasamortized from the date of the agreement until the end of the new concession perio
d. The value of the concession extension was based on apreliminary time-value equivalent calc
ulation made by the CCEE and subsequent adjustments requested by Tietê, which was determined to be fairvalue. In March 2021, the CCEE’s final calculati
on of fair value was $190 million and the Company recognized an additional reversal of Non- Regulated
 Cost of Sales of $6 million. Both the concession extension p eriod and its equivalent asset value are subject to a final agreement betweenANEEL and AES.

en the lease and non-lease elements is made atthe inception of the lease. Lease payments from such contracts are recognized as l
ease revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease term,whereas variable lease payments are recog

g a sales-type lease. Upon commencement of the lease, the book value of the leased asset isremoved from the balance sheet and a net investment in sales-type leas
e is recognized based on the present value of fixed payments under thecontract and the residual value of the underlyin
g asset. Due to the variable nature of lease payments under these contracts, the Company recordedlosses at commencement of sales-type leases of $13 million for the year ende

Defined Contribution Plans 
—  The Company sponsors four defined contribution plans ("the DC Plans"). Two plans cover U.S. non-unionemployees; one for Parent Company and certain US an
d Utilities SBU business employees, and one for DPL employees. The remaining two plansinclude union and no
n-union employees at AES Indiana and union employees at DPL. The DC Plans are qualified under section 401 of the InternalRevenue Code. Most U.S. employees of the Company are eli
gible to participate in the appropriate plan except for those employees who are coveredby a collective bargaining agre
ement, unless such agreement specifically provides that the employee is considered an eligible employee under aplan. Within the DC Plans, the Company provides matchi
ng contributions in addition to other non-matching contributions. Participants are fullyvested in their own contributions. The Company's co
ntributions vest over various time periods ranging from immediate up to five years. For the yearsended December 31, 2021, 2020 an
d 2019, costs for defined contribution plans were approximately $26 million, $21 million and $19 million,respectively.
Defined Benefit Plans — 
Certain of the Company's subsidiaries hav e defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of theirrespective employees ("the DB Plans"). Pension ben
efits are based on years of credited service, age of the participant, and average earnings. Ofthe 32 active DB Plans as of December 31, 2021, five are at U.S. subsidiari
es and the remaining plans are at foreign subsidiaries.

168 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019The measurement of pension obligatio
ns, costs, and liabilities is dependent on a variety of assumptions. These assumptions include estimatesof the present value of projected future pension payments to all pl
an participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future eventssuch as salary increases and demographic ex
perience. These assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions.The assumptions used in develop
ing the required estimates include the following key factors: discount rates, salary growth, retirement rates,inflation, expected return on plan assets, and mortality rates. The effects of actual results differing from the Company's assumptio
ns areaccumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, genera
lly affect the Company's recognized expense in such future periods.Unrecognized gains or losses are amortized us
ing the “corridor approach,” under which the net gain or loss in excess of 10% of the greater of theprojected benefit obligation or the market-related val
ue of the assets, if applicable, is amortized.Sensitivity of the Company's pension fund
ed status to the indicated increase or decrease in the discount rate and long-term rate of return onplan assets assumptions is shown belo
w. Note that these sensitivities may be asymmetric and are specific to the base conditions at year-end 2021.They also may not be additive, so the impact of changing multip

ds for AES Indiana's TDSIC andreplacement generation projects. The Company a
nd CDPQ made capital contributions on a proportional share basis; therefore, the capital call didnot change CDPQ or AES' ownership i
nterests in IPALCO.Colon
 — On September 13, 2021, the Company acquired the remaining 4 9.9% minority ownership interest in Colon, reducing the value of theColon temporary equity to zero. See Note 17—
Equity  for fur ther information.AES Clean Energy Development
 — On February 1, 2021, the Company substantially completed the merger of the sPower and A ESRenewable Holdi
ngs development platforms to form AES Clean Energy Development, which will serve as the development vehicle for all futurerenewable projects in the U.S. As part of the transaction, AlMCo, our existing partner in the sPo
wer equity method investment, received a 25%minority ownership interest in the newly formed entity along w
ith certain partnership rights, though not currently in effect, that would enable AIMCo toexit in the future. As a result, the minority ownership interest is considered temporary equity. AIMCo made capital co
ntributions of $240 millionduring the year ended December 31, 2021.
During the second quarter of 2021, the Company recorded meas
urement period adjustments to the estimated fair values of the sPower andAES Renewable Hol
dings development platforms and the value of the partnership rights initially recorded in the first quarter of 2021, which resultedin an $81 million increase in the va
lue of the temporary equity. These measurement period adjustments primarily relate to higher expecteddeveloper profits and a higher growth rate, reflective of additio
nal information that became available regarding market participants’ views of thevalue of early-stage renewable deve
lopment projects as of the date of acquisition. The temporary equity will be adjusted for earnings or lossesallocated to the noncontrolling i
nterest under ASC 810. Any subsequent changes in the redemption value of the exit rights will be recognized againstpermanent equity in accordance with ASC 4
80-10-S99, as it is probable that the shares will become redeemable. See Note 25— Acquisitions for further info
rmation.AES Indiana 
— AES Indiana had $60 millio n of cumulative preferred stock outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020, which represents fiveseries of preferred stock. The total annual dividend requireme
nts were approximately $3 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Certain series ofthe preferred stock were redeemable solely at the option of the issuer at prices betwe
en $100 and $118 per share. Holders of the preferred stockare entitled to elect a majority of AES Indiana's board of directors if AES Indi
ana has not paid dividends to its preferred stockholders for fourconsecutive quarters. Based on the preferred stockholders' ab
ility to elect a majority of AES Indiana's board of directors in this circumstance, theredemption of the preferred shares is considered to be not solely with
in the control of the issuer and the preferred stock is considered temporaryequity.

Equity Units
In March 2021, the Company issued 10,430,500 Eq
uity Units with a total notional value of $1,043 million. Each Equity Unit has a stated amountof $100 and was initially issue
d as a Corporate Unit, consisting of a forward stock purchase contract (“2024 Purchase Contracts”) and a 10%undivided beneficia
l ownership interest in one share of 0% Series A Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, issued without par and witha liquidation preference of $1,000 p
er share (“Series A Preferred Stock”).Upon reconsideration of the nature of the Equity Units, the Compa
ny re-evaluated its accounting assessment and concluded that the EquityUnits should be accounted for as one unit of accou
nt based on the economic linkage between the 2024 Purchase Contracts and the Series APreferred Stock, as well as the Company's assessment of the applicab
le accounting guidance relating to combining freestanding instruments. TheEquity Units represent mandatorily convertible preferred stock. Accordin
gly, the shares associated with the combined instrument are reflected indiluted earnings per share using the if-conv
erted method.In the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company also corrected the classification of certain amounts in the Co
nsolidated Balance Sheet andStatement of Changes in Equity to reflect the 2024 Purchase Co
ntracts and Series A Preferred Stock as one unit of account. The corrections haveno impact on the Company's net earnings, total assets, cash flows, or segment information.
In conjunction with the issuance of the Equity Un
its, the Company received approximately $1 billion in proceeds, net of underwriting costs andcommissions, before offering expenses. The proceeds for the issuance of 1,04
3,050 shares are attributed to the Series A Preferred Stock for $825million, $205 million for the present value of the qu
arterly payments due to holders of the 2024 Purchase Contracts ("Contract AdjustmentPayments"), and a beneficial conversion feature of $13 mill
ion. The proceeds will be used for the development of the AES renewable businesses,U.S. utility businesses, LNG infrastructure, and for other developments determined by manag
ement.The Series A Preferred Stock will initially not be
ar any dividends and the liquidation preference of the convertible preferred stock will notaccrete. The Series A Preferred Stock has no maturity date and will remain outstandi
ng unless converted by holders or redeemed by the Company.Holders of the shares of the convertible preferred stock will have limited voti
ng rights.The Series A Preferred Stock is pledged as collatera
l to support holders’ purchase obligations under the 2024 Purchase Contracts and will beremarketed. In connection with any successful remarketing, the Company may increase the d
ividend rate, increase the conversion rate, and modifythe earliest redemption date for the convertible preferred stock. After any successful remarketing in connecti
on with which the dividend rate on theconvertible preferred stock is increased, the Company will p
ay cumulative dividends on the convertible preferred stock, if declared by the board ofdirectors, quarterly in arrears from the applicable remarketing settlement date.
Holders of Corporate Units may create Treasury Units or Cash Settled Units from their Corporate Units as provide
d in the Purchase ContractAgreement by substituting Treasury securities or cash, respectively, for the Convertible Preferred Stock comprisi
ng a part of the Corporate Units.The Company may not redeem the Series A Preferred Stock prior to March 22, 2024. At the election of the Company, on or after March 22,
2024, the Company may redeem for cash, all or any portion of the outstanding shares of the Seri
es A Preferred Stock at a redemption price equal to100% of the liquidation preference, plus a
ny accumulated and unpaid dividends.The 2024 Purchase Contracts obligate the h
olders to purchase, on February 15, 2024, for a price of $100 in cash, a maximum number of57,215,465 shares of the Company’s common stock (subject to customary anti-dilutio
n adjustments). The 2024 Purchase Contract holders mayelect to settle their obligation early, in cash. The Series A Preferred Stock is pl
edged as collateral to guarantee the holders’ obligations to purchasecommon stock under the terms of the 2024 Purchase Contracts. The initial settlement rate determining the number of shares that each h
older mustpurchase will not exceed the maximum settlement rate of 3.864, determined over a market value avera
ging period preceding February 15, 2024.
172 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019The settlement rate will be calculated using a
n initial reference price of $25.88, equal to the last reported sale price of the Company’s commonstock on March 4, 2021. If the applicable market value of the Company’s common stock is less than or equa
l to the reference price, the settlementrate will be the maximum settlement rate; and if the applicable market value of common stock is greater than the reference price, the settlement rate
will be a number of shares of the Company’s common stock equal to $10
0 divided by the applicable market value. Upon successful remarketing ofthe Series A Preferred Stock ("Remarketed Series A Preferred Stock"), the Company expects to receive additiona
l cash proceeds of $1 billion andissue shares of Remarketed Series A Preferred Stock.

21. The $205 million present value of theContract Adjustment Payments at inception reduces the Series A Preferred Stock. As each q
uarterly Contract Adjustment Payment is made, therelated liability is reduced and the d
ifference between the cash payment and the present value will accrete to interest expense, approximately $5million over the three-year term.
The holders can settle the 2024 Purchase Co
ntracts early, for cash, subject to certain exceptions and conditions in the prospectus supplement.Upon early settlement of any 2024 Purchase Contracts, the Company w

iverable.Equity Transactions with Noncontrolling Interests

18. SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
The segment reporting structure uses the Company's management reporting structure as its foundati
on to reflect how the Company managesthe businesses internally and is main
ly organized by geographic regions which provides a socio-political-economic understanding of our business.The management reporting structure is organized by four SBUs led by o
ur President and Chief Executive Officer: US and Utilities, South America,MCAC, and Eurasia SBUs. Using the accounti
ng guidance on segment reporting, the Company determined that its four operating segments arealigned with its four reportable segments correspond
ing to its SBUs. In January 2022, we internally announced a reorganization as a part of ourongoing strategy to align our business to meet our customers' nee
ds and deliver on our major strategic objectives. The Company is currentlyevaluating the impact this reorganization w
ill have on our segment reporting structure.Corporate and O
ther — Included in "Corporate and Other" are the results of the AES self-insurance company and certai n equity affiliates,corporate overhead costs which are not directly associated w
ith the operations of our four reportable segments, and certain intercompany chargessuch as self-insurance premiums which are fully elimin
ated in consolidation.The Company uses Adjusted PTC as its primary segment performance measure. Adj
usted PTC, a non-GAAP measure, is defined by theCompany as pre-tax income from continuing operations attributab
le to The AES Corporation excluding gains or losses of the consolidated entity dueto (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactio
ns and equity securities; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains,losses, benefits and costs associated with dispos
itions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, and gains and lossesrecognized at commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; (e) gains, losses an
d costs due to the early retirement of debt;and (f) net gains at Angamos, one of our businesses in the South America S
BU, associated with the early contract terminations with MineraEscondida and Minera Spenc
e. Adjusted PTC also includes net equity in earnings of affiliates on an after-tax basis adjusted for the same gains orlosses excluded from consolidated entiti
es. The Company has concluded Adjusted PTC better reflects the underlying business performance of theCompany and is the most relevant measure considered in the C
ompany's internal evaluation of the financial performance of itssegments. Additionally, given its large numb
er of businesses and complexity, the Company concluded that Adjusted PTC is a more transparentmeasure that better assists investors in determining which business
es have the greatest impact on the Company's results.    Revenue and Adjusted PTC are pres
ented before inter-segment eliminations, which includes the effect of intercompany transactions with othersegments except for interest, charges for certain management fees, and the write-off of intercompany balances, as applic
able. All intra-segmentactivity has been eliminated within the se
gment. Inter-segment activity has been eliminated within the total consolidated results.

al to 100% of the marketprice at the date the option is granted. Stock options issued in 2
019, 2020, and 2021 have a three-year vesting schedule and vest in one-thirdincrements over the three-year period. The stock options have a contractual term of 10 years. In all circumstances, stock options granted by AE
S donot entitle the holder the right, or obligate AES, to settle the stock option in cash or other assets of AES.
Performance Stock Units 
— In 2019, 2020, and 2021, the Company issued P SUs to officers under its long-term compensation plan. PSUsare stock units which include performance conditi
ons. Performance conditions are based on the Company's Proportional Free Cash Flow targets for2019. For 2020 and 2021, performance conditi
ons are based on the Company’s Parent Free Cash Flow target. The performance conditionsdetermine the vesting and final share equiv
alent per PSU and can result in earning an award payout range of 0% to 200%, depending on theachievement. The Company believes it is prob
able that the performance condition will be met and will continue to be evaluated throughout theperformance period. In all circumstances, PSUs granted by AES do not entitl
e the holder the right, or obligate AES, to settle the stock units in cashor other assets of AES.
Performance Cash Units
 — In 2019, 2020, and 2021, the Company issued PC Us to its officers under its long-term compensation plan. Thevalue of the 2019 units is depende
nt on the market condition of total stockholder return on AES common stock as compared to the total stockholderreturn of the Standard and Poor's 500 Utilities Sector Index, Stand
ard and Poor's 500 Index, and MSCI Emerging Market Index over a three-yearmeasurement period. The value for the 2020 and 202
1 units is dependent on the market condition of total stockholder return on AES common stockas compared to the total stockholder return of the Standard and Poor's 500 Util
ities Sector Index, Standard and Poor's 500 Index, and MSCIEmerging Markets Latin America Index over a three-year measurement period. Since PC
Us are settled in cash, they qualify for liability accountingand periodic measurement is required.

 — During the fourth quarter of 2021, due to an expired PPA and volatile spot prices in the ERCOT market, managementconcluded that the carrying value of the long-liv
ed assets of Buffalo Gap I, II, and III wind generation facilities may not be recoverable. As such, theCompany performed an impairment analysis and determin
ed that the fair value of each asset group, using the income approach, was zero forBuffalo Gap I, II and III. As a result, the Company recognized pre-tax asset impairment expense of $29 million, $73 milli
on, and $91 million at BuffaloGap I, II, and III, respectively. Buffalo Gap is reported in the US and Utilities SBU reportable segment.
Ventanas and Angamos
 — In August 2020, AES Andes reached an agreement with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence to early terminatetwo PPAs of the Angamos coal-fired plant in Chil
e, further accelerating AES Andes’ decarbonization strategy. AES Andes also announced itsintention to accelerate the retirement of the Ventanas 1 and Venta
nas 2 coal-fired plants. Management will no longer be pursuing a contractingstrategy for these assets and the plants will primarily be utilized as pe
aker plants and for grid stability. Due to these developments, the Companyperformed an impairment analysis and determined that the carrying amou
nts of these asset groups were not recoverable. The Angamos asset groupwas determined to have a fair value of $306 millio
n, using the income approach. As a result, the Company recognized pre-tax asset impairmentexpense of $564 million and $
213 million at Angamos and Ventanas 1 & 2, respectively.In July 2021, AES Andes entered into an agre
ement committing to accelerate the retirement of the Ventanas 3, Ventanas 4, Angamos 1, andAngamos 2 coal-fired plants in Chile. Du
e to these strategic developments, the Company performed impairment analyses as of June 30, 2021, anddetermined that the carrying amounts of the asset groups were not recoverable. The Venta
nas 3 & 4 and Angamos asset groups were determinedto have fair values of $12 million and $86 mil
lion, respectively, using the income approach. As a result, the Company recognized pre-tax assetimpairment expense of $649 million an
d $155 million, respectively. Ventanas and Angamos are reported in the South America SBU reportablesegment.
Mountain View I &
 II — In April 2021, the Company approved plans to execute a rep owering project for the Mountain View I & II wind facilityand signed two new PPAs for the energy and ca
pacity related to the repowered asset. As the repowering will result in decommissioning the majorityof the existing wind turbines in advance of their de
preciable lives, the execution of the new PPAs was identified as an impairment indicator. Theasset group was determined to have a fair value of $11 milli
on using the income approach. As a result, the Company recognized pre-tax assetimpairment expense of $67 million. Mountain V
iew I & II is reported in the US and Utilities SBU reportable segment.Puerto Rico
 — New factors arose in the first quarter of 2021 associated with the economic costs and operation al and reputational risks ofdisposal of coal combustion residua
ls off island. In addition, new legislative initiatives surrounding the prohibition of coal generation assets in PuertoRico were introduced. Collectively, these factors alo
ng with management’s decision on how to best achieve our stated decarbonization goalsresulted in an indicator of impairment at our asset group in Puerto Rico. As such, mana
gement performed a recoverability test in accordance withASC 360 and concluded that Pu
erto Rico’s undiscounted cash flows did not exceed the carrying value of the asset group. The fair value of the assetgroup was determined to be $73 million, resulti
ng in pre-tax impairment expense of $475 million. Puerto Rico is reported in the US and Utilities SBUreportable segment.
Estrella del Mar I — 
In August 2020, the Estrella del Mar I power barge was disconn ected from the Panama grid. Upon disconnection, theCompany concluded that the barge was no l
onger part of the AES Panama asset
182 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019group and performed an impairment analysis. The Compa
ny determined that the carrying amount of the asset was not recoverable and recognizedasset impairment expense of $30 million. In September 202
1, the Company recognized additional asset impairment expense of $11 million due to achange in the estimated market value of the power barge. See Note 24
—Held-for-Sale and Dispositions  for further information. Estrella del Mar I is reported in the MCAC SBU reportable segment.
Hawaii — 
During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company tested the recoverability of its long-liv ed coal-fired asset in Hawaii. Uncertaintyaround the ability to contract the asset upon expiration of its existing P
PA resulted in management's decision to reassess the economic useful life ofthe generation facility. A decrease in the useful life w
as identified as an impairment indicator and the Company determined that the carrying amountwas not recoverable. The asset group, consisting of property, plant and e
quipment and intangible assets, was determined to have a fair valueof $103 million using the income ap
proach. As a result, the Company recognized asset impairment expense of $60 million as of December 31, 2019.In July 2020, the Hawaii State Legislature p
assed Senate Bill 2629 which will prohibit AES Hawaii from generating electricity from coal afterDecember 31, 2022. Therefore, management further reassessed the economic usefu
l life of the generation facility and a decrease in the useful lifewas identified as an impairment indicator. The Comp
any performed an impairment analysis and determined that the carrying amount of the assetgroup was not recoverable. As a result, the Company recognize
d additional asset impairment expense of $38 million during the third quarter of2020. The Company announce
d in November 2020 its intention to retire the generation facility in 2022. Hawaii is reported in the US and UtilitiesSBU reportable segment.
Kilroot and Ballylumford — 
In April 2019, the Company entered into an agreeme nt to sell its entire 100% interest in the Kilroot coal and oil-firedplant and energy storage facility and the Bal
lylumford gas-fired plant in the United Kingdom. Upon meeting the held-for-sale criteria, the Companyperformed an impairment analysis and determined that the carrying val
ue of the asset group of $232 million was greater than its fair value less coststo sell of $114 million. As a result, the Company recognize
d asset impairment expense of $115 million. The Company completed the sale of Kilrootand Ballylumford in 
June 2019. See Note 24— Held-for-Sale and Dispositions for further information. Prior to their sale, Kilroot and Ballylumford were reported in the Eurasia SBU reportable segment.

As of December 31, 2021, the Company had federal net operati
ng loss carryforwards for tax return purposes of approximately $1.9 billion, ofwhich approximately $540 milli
on expire in years 2034 to 2036 and $1.4 billion carry forward indefinitely. The Company also had federal generalbusiness tax credit carryforwards of approximately $68 million, of which $
14 million expire in years 2022 to 2032 and $54 million expire in years2035 to 2041. Additionally, the Comp

nitely reinvested earnings in accordance with the relevantaccounting guidance for income taxes. Sho
uld the earnings be remitted as dividends, the Company may be subject to additional foreign withholdingand state income taxes. Under the TCJA, future distributions from foreign subsidiaries w
ill generally be subject to a federal dividends receiveddeduction in the U.S. As of December 31, 2021, the cumulative amou

185 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019We are potentially subject to income tax audits in numerous juris
dictions in the U.S. and internationally until the applicable statute of limitationsexpires. Tax audits by their nature are often complex and can require severa
l years to complete. The following is a summary of tax years potentiallysubject to examination in the significant tax and b

2017-2021 As of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the total amount of unreco
gnized tax benefits was $122 million, $458 million and $465 million,respectively. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that wou
ld benefit the effective tax rate as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is$122 million, $439 millio
n and $448 million, respectively, of which $4 million, $33 million, and $33 million, respectively, would be in the form of taxattributes that would warrant a full valuation allo
wance. Further, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefit that would benefit the effective tax rateas of 2021 would be reduced by approx
imately $34 million of tax expense related to remeasurement from 35% to 21%.The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits anticip
ated to result in a net decrease to unrecognized tax benefits within 12 months ofDecember 31, 2021 is estimated to be between zero and $
10 million, primarily relating to statute of limitation lapses and tax exam settlements.The following is a reconciliati

(1) (4) (3) Balance at December 31
$ 122 $ 458 $ 465 The 2021 settlement amount of $377 million ab
ove primarily relates to effective settlement of historic unrecognized tax benefits as a result ofthe exam closure of the Company’s U.S. 2017 tax return, the focus of which was on the TCJA one-time transition tax assess
ed on cumulativeforeign earnings and profits. This amount is based on the pre-TCJ
A income tax rate of 35% though the actual impact to the Company’s income taxexpense is an income tax benefit computed at 21%.
The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are currently un
der examination by the relevant taxing authorities for various tax years. TheCompany regularly assesses the potential o
utcome of these examinations in each of the taxing jurisdictions when determining the adequacy of theamount of unrecognized tax benefit recorded. While it is often difficult to predict the fina
l outcome or the timing of resolution of any particularuncertain tax position, we believe we h
ave appropriately accrued for our uncertain tax benefits. However, audit outcomes and the timing of auditsettlements and future events that would impact our previously recorded unrec
ognized tax benefits and the range of anticipated increases ordecreases in unrecognized tax ben
efits are subject to significant uncertainty. It is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or futureexaminations may exceed our provision for current unrecogn
ized tax benefits in amounts that could be material, but cannot be estimated as ofDecember 31, 2021. Our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period cou
ld therefore be materially impacted.

t — In February 2021, the Company substantially completed the merger of the sPow er and AES RenewableHoldings development pl
atforms to form AES Clean Energy Development, which will serve as the development vehicle for all future renewableprojects in the U.S. As part of the transaction, AES acquired an addition
al 25% ownership interest in the sPower development platform from AIMCo,our existing partner in the sPower equity method investment, in excha
nge for a 25% ownership interest in specifically identified development entitiesof AES Renewable Hold
ings, certain future exit rights in the new partnership, and $7 million of cash.The sPower development platform was carved-out of AES’ existi
ng equity method investment. AES’ basis in the portion of assets transferredwas $102 million, and the contributio
n to AES Clean Energy Development resulted in a corresponding decrease in the carrying value of the sPowerinvestment. See Note 8
— Investments in and Advances to Affiliates for further information.During the first quarter of 2021, the sPower development assets transferred were remeasured at their acquis
ition-date preliminary fair values,resulting in the recognition of a $36 milli

nd liabilities assumed.
190 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019During the second quarter of 2021, the Company recorded meas
urement period adjustments as result of additional facts and circumstancesthat existed as of the date of the acquisition but were not yet known as of the time of the valuation performed in the first quarter of 2021. These
measurement period adjustments primarily relate to higher expecte
d developer profits and a higher growth rate, reflective of additional informationthat became available regarding market particip
ants’ views of the value of early-stage renewable development projects as of the date of acquisition.As a result, the estimated acquisition-date carrying value an
d fair values of the sPower development assets transferred were increased, whichresulted in the recognition of an additio
nal $178 million gain, for an updated gain of $214 million. Furthermore, the estimated goodwill as of theacquisition date was reduced to $45 mil
lion, as a result of adjustments to the fair value of the consideration paid and updates to the fair values ofseparately identifiable intan
gible assets. The Company finalized the purchase price allocation in the third quarter of 2021, which did not result in anymaterial measurement period adjustments.
Subsequent to the closing of the transaction, AES ho
lds a 75% ownership interest in AES Clean Energy Development. AIMCo holds theremaining 25% minority interest along with certain partnersh
ip rights, though currently not in effect, that would enable AIMCo to exit in the future.AIMCo’s minority interest is recorded as temporary equity in 
Redeemable stock of subsidiaries  on the Consolidated Balan ce Sheet. See Note16

Great Cove Solar— 
In January 2021 and May 2021, AES Clea n Energy Development, LLC completed the acquisitions of Great Cove I and II,respectively. The fair value of the initial considerati
on paid to acquire Great Cove I and Great Cove II was $13 million and $24 million, which includedcontingent consideration lia
bilities of $6 million and $22 million, respectively. These acquisitions were accounted for as asset acquisitions of variableinterest entities that did not meet the definition of a business; therefore, the assets acquired a
nd liabilities assumed were recorded at their fairvalues, which equaled the fair valu
e of the consideration. During the third quarter of 2021, the contingent liabilities which related primarily to certainprice adjustment features were remeasured, resulting in conting
ent consideration assets of $2 million and $12 million for Great Cove I and GreatCove II, respectively. This remeasurement resulted in a gain of $32 millio
n recorded in Other income  in the Consolidated Statement of Operations during the third quarter of 2021. In October 2021, the Company amended the agre
ement, resulting in the reclassification of the previously contingentconsideration assets to 
Prepaid Expenses . In December 2021, the Company acquired Community Energy, LLC (as further describe d above), andsuch remaining prepaid amounts were written off to 
Other income  in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Great Cove Solar is reported in the US and Utilities SBU

ng capital adjustments. At closing, the Company made an initial cash payment of $44 million. The remainder was paid inthe second and third quarter of 2021. The transaction was accou
nted for as an asset acquisition; therefore, the total amount of consideration, plustransaction costs, was allocated to the individua
l assets and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. Any differences arising from post-closing adjustments will be all
ocated accordingly. Ventus is reported in the South America SBU reportable segment.Penonome I
 — In May 2020, AES Panama completed the acquisition of the Penonome I wind farm from Goldwind International for $80 million.The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisitio

Basic and diluted earnings p
er share are based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and potential common stockoutstanding during the period. Potenti
al common stock, for purposes of determining diluted earnings per share, includes the effects of dilutive RSUs,stock options, and equity units. The effect of such potential common stock is computed using the treasury stock method for RSUs an
d stock options,and is computed using the if-converted method for equity units.
The following table is a reconcil
iation of the numerator and denominator of the basic and diluted earnings per share computation for incomefrom continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 20
21, 2020 and 2019, where income represents the numerator and weighted-averageshares represent the denominator.

n of diluted earnings per share excluded 5 million outstanding stock awards and 40million shares underlying our March 202
1 Equity Units because their impact would be anti-dilutive given the loss from continuing operations. Theseshares could potentially dilute b
asic earnings per share in the future. Had the Company generated income, 4 million and 33 million potential sharesof common stock related to the stock awards and the Equity Units, respectively, would have b

As described in Note 17
— Equity, the Company issued 10,430,500 Equity Un its in March 2021 with a total notional value of $1,043 million.Each Equity Unit has a stated amount of $100 and was i
nitially issued as a Corporate Unit, consisting of a 2024 Purchase Contract and a 10%undivided beneficia
l ownership interest in one share of Series A Preferred Stock. Prior to February 15, 2024, the Series A Preferred Stock may beconverted at the option of the holder only in connecti
on with a fundamental change. On and after February 15, 2024, the Series A Preferred Stockmay be converted freely at the option of the holder. Upon conversion, the Comp
any will deliver to the holder with respect to each share of Series APreferred Stock being converted (i) a share of our Series B Preferred Stock, or, solely with respect to conversions in con

PS.27. RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
AES is a diversified power generatio
n and utility company organized into four market-oriented SBUs. See additional discussion of theCompany's principal markets in Note 18—
Segments and Geographic Information . Within our four SBUs, we have two primary lines of business: generation and utilities. The gen
eration line of business uses a wide range of fuels and technologies to generate electricity such as coal, gas, hydro,wind, solar, and biomass. Our utilities business comprises bus
inesses that transmit, distribute, and in certain circumstances, generate power. Inaddition, the Company has operations i
n the renewables area. These efforts include projects primarily in wind, solar, and energy storage.Operating and Economic Risks 
— The Company operates in several develo ping economies where macroeconomic conditions are typicallymore volatile than developed eco
nomies. Deteriorating market conditions and evolving industry expectations to transition away from fossil fuelsources for generation expose the Company to

192 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019the risk of decreased earnings and cash flows due to, among oth
er factors, adverse fluctuations in the commodities and foreign currency spotmarkets, and potential changes in the estimated useful liv
es of our thermal plants. Additionally, credit markets around the globe continue to tightentheir standards, which could impact our ability to finance gro
wth projects through access to capital markets. Currently, the Company has aninvestment grade rating from both Standard & Poor's and Fitch of BBB-, and a bel
ow-investment grade rating from Moody's of Ba1. A downgrade inour current investment grade ratings could affect the Company's ability to financ
e new and/or existing development projects at competitive interestrates. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $943 millio
n of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.During 2021, 68% of our revenue was generate
d outside the U.S. and a significant portion of our international operations is conducted indeveloping countries. We continue to inv
est in several developing countries to expand our existing platform and operations. International operations,particularly the operation, financing, and d
evelopment of projects in developing countries, entail significant risks and uncertainties, including, withoutlimitation:
•
economic, social, and political instability in any particular country or region;•
inability to economically hedge energy prices;•
volatility in commodity prices;•
adverse changes in currency exchange rates;•
government restrictions on converting currencies or repatriating funds;•
unexpected changes in foreign laws, regulatory framework, or in trade, monetary or fiscal policies;•
high inflation and monetary fluctuations;•
restrictions on imports of solar panels, wind turbines, coal, oil, gas, or other raw materials required by our generation businesses to operate;•
threatened or consummated expropriation or nationalization of our assets by foreign governments;•
unwillingness of governments, government agencies, similar organizations, or other counterparties to honor their commitments;•
unwillingness of governments, government agencies, courts, or similar bodies to enforce contracts that are economically advantageous tosubsidiaries of the Company and econ
omically unfavorable to counterparties, against such counterparties, whether such counterparties aregovernments or private parties;
•
inability to obtain access to fair and equitable political, regulatory, administrative, and legal systems;•
adverse changes in government tax policy;•
potentially adverse tax consequences of operating in multiple jurisdictions;•
difficulties in enforcing our contractual rights, enforcing judgments, or obtaining a just result in local jurisdictions; and•
inability to obtain financing on expected terms.Any of these factors, individually or in combination w
ith others, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, andfinancial condition. In additio
n, our Latin American operations experience volatility in revenue and earnings which have caused and are expected tocause significant volatility in our results of operatio
ns and cash flows. The volatility is caused by regulatory and economic difficulties, politicalinstability, indexation of certain PPAs to fuel prices, an
d currency fluctuations being experienced in many of these countries. This volatility reducesthe predictability and enhances the u
ncertainty associated with cash flows from these businesses.Our inability to predict, influence or respond appropri
ately to changes in law or regulatory schemes, including any inability to obtain reasonableincreases in tariffs or tariff adjustments for increased expenses, could adversely impact our results of operatio
ns or our ability to meet publiclyannounced projections or ana
lysts' expectations. Furthermore, changes in laws or regulations or changes in the application or interpretation ofregulatory provisions in jurisdictions w
here we operate, particularly our utility businesses where electricity tariffs are subject to regulatory review orapproval, could adversely affect our business, incl
uding, but not limited to:•
changes in the determination, definition, or classification of costs to be included as reimbursable or pass-through costs;
193 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019•
changes in the definition or determination of controllable or noncontrollable costs;•
adverse changes in tax law;•
changes in the definition of events which may or may not qualify as changes in economic equilibrium;•
changes in the timing of tariff increases;•
other changes in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions; or•
changes in environmental regulations, including regulations relating to GHG emissions in any of our businesses.Any of the above events may result in lower margins for the affected businesses, which ca
n adversely affect our results of operations.COVID-19 Pandemic 
— The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted global economic activity, including electricity and energyconsumption, and caused significa
nt volatility in financial markets.The magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown at this timeand may have material and adverse effects on our results of operations, financi
al condition and cash flows in future periods.Alto Maipo
 — On August 27, 2021, Alto Maipo updated its creditors with respect to the construction budget and long-term business plan forthe project, which considers different scenarios for spot prices, decarboniz
ation initiatives, and hydrological conditions, among other significantvariables. Under some of these scenarios, Alto Maipo may experie
nce reduced future cash flows, which would limit its ability to repay debt. AltoMaipo’s management initiated neg
otiations with its creditors to restructure its obligations and achieve a sustainable long-term capital structure forAlto Maipo. On November 17, 2021, Alto Maipo SpA commenced a reorg
anization proceeding in accordance with Chapter 11 of the U.S. BankruptcyCode, through a voluntary petition. Conseq
uently, after the Chapter 11 filing, the Company is no longer considered to have control over Alto Maipo,which resulted in its deconsolid
ation. The Company recognized an after-tax loss of approximately $1.2 billion, net of noncontrolling interests, in theConsolidated Statement of Operations in the fourth quarter of 2021, associ
ated with the loss of control attributable to the former controlling interest.Alto Maipo is party to a restructuring support agreement to which holders of more than 78% of the outstandin
g senior indebtedness are party,and which contemplates a plan of reorgan
ization in which AES Andes will own all of the equity of the reorganized company. If Alto Maipo is unableto renegotiate the terms of its financial arrangements with its creditors and is unable to meet its obli
gations under those arrangements as they comedue, the creditors may enforce their rights under the credit agreements. These finance agreements are no
n-recourse with respect to The AESCorporation.
Foreign Currency Risks 
— AES operates businesses in many foreign cou ntries and such operations could be impacted by significantfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Fluctuatio
ns in currency exchange rate between the USD and the following currencies could createsignificant fluctuations in earnings a
nd cash flows: the Argentine peso, the Brazilian real, the Chilean peso, the Colombian peso, the Dominicanpeso, the Euro, the Indian rupee, and the Mexican peso.
Argentina
 — In September 2019, currency controls were established by the Argentin e government in order to control the devaluation of theArgentine peso and keep Argenti
ne central bank reserves at acceptable levels. Restrictions on the flow of capital have limited the availability ofinternational credit, and economic cond
itions in Argentina have further deteriorated, triggering additional devaluation of the Argentine peso and adeterioration of the country’s risk profile.
Concentrations 
— Due to the geographical diversity of its operations, the Compa ny does not have any significant concentration of customersor sources of fuel supply. Several of the Company's generatio
n businesses rely on PPAs with one or a limited number of customers for the majorityof, and in some cases all of, the relevant businesses' output over the term of the PPAs. However, no sin
gle customer accounted for 10% or more oftotal revenue in 2021, 2020 or 2019.
The cash flows and results of operations of our businesses d
epend on the credit quality of our customers and the continued ability of ourcustomers and suppliers to meet their obligations und
er PPAs and fuel supply agreements. If a substantial portion of the Company's long-term PPAsand/or fuel supply were modified or terminated, the Company wo
uld be adversely affected to the extent that it would be unable to replace suchcontracts at equally favorable terms.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company maintains disclosure controls a
nd procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in thereports that the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amen
ded (the "Exchange Act") is recorded, processed,summarized and reported within the time periods specifie
d in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated andcommunicated to the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisio
ns regarding required disclosures.The Company carried out the evaluation requ
ired by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b), under the supervision and with the participation of ourmanagement, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of our “disclosure co
ntrols and procedures” (as defined in the Exchange ActRules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based upo
n this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that as of December 31, 2021, our disclosure controlsand procedures were effective.
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management of the Company is responsible for establis
hing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined inRule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company
's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonableassurance regarding the reliabil
ity of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAPand includes those polici
es and procedures that:•
pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets ofthe Company;
•
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance withGAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are be
ing made only in accordance with authorizations of management anddirectors of the Company; and
•
provide reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect onthe financial statements are prevented or detected timely.
Management, including our CEO and CFO, does not exp
ect that our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A controlsystem, no matter how well designed and operated, can provi
de only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control systemare met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be
considered relative to their costs. In addition, any evaluati
on of the effectiveness of controls is subject to risks that those internal controls maybecome inadequate in future periods b
ecause of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or proceduresdeteriorates.
In February 2021, the Company substantially complete
d the merger of the sPower and AES Renewable Holdings development platforms toform AES Clean Energy Development (“Clean E
nergy”). As a result, assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the merger have been included inAES’ Consolidated Ba
lance Sheet as of December 31, 2021. Clean Energy’s total assets and total revenue represented 4% and 1% of AES’consolidated total assets and revenues, respectiv
ely, as of December 31, 2021. Clean Energy’s net loss of $69 million for the period February 1,2021 through December 31, 2021 was inc
luded in AES’ Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. LegacysPower entities continue to be accounted for as an eq
uity method investment. As permitted by SEC guidance, newly acquired Clean Energybusinesses have been exclu
ded from management’s formal evaluation of the effectiveness of AES’ disclosure controls and procedures due to thetiming of the acquisitions.
Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over fina
ncial reporting as of December 31, 2021. In making this assessment,management used the criteria established in Interna
l Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of theTreadway Commission ("COSO") in 2013. Based on this assessment, management be
lieves that the Company maintained effective internal controlover financial reporting as of December 31, 2021.
The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financ
ial reporting as of December 31, 2021, has been audited by Ernst &Young LLP, an indepen
dent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited The AES Corporation
’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in InternalControl 
— Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSOcriteria). In our opinion, The AES Corporation (the Company) maintai
ned, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting asof December 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.
As indicated in the accompanying Item 9A,

er financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the acquired businesses as part ofthe merger of the sPower and AES Renewable H
oldings development platforms to form AES Clean Energy Development (Clean Energy), which isincluded in the 2021 conso
lidated financial statements of the Company and constituted 4% and 1% of total assets and revenue, respectively, as ofDecember 31, 2021. Clean Energy’s net loss of $6
9 million for the period February 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021 was included in theCompany’s consolidated statement of operatio
ns for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company alsodid not include an evaluati
on of the internal control over financial reporting of Clean Energy.We also have audited, in accordance with the stan
dards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), theconsolidated balance sh
eets of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations,comprehensive income (loss), changes in equ

isted in the Index at Item 15(a), and our report dated February 28, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinionthereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsib
le for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of theeffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting i
ncluded in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financ ialReporting
. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Compa ny’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a publicaccounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be i
ndependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federalsecurities laws and the applicab
le rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in accordance with the stand
ards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtainreasonable assurance about wh
ether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audit included obtaining a
n understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testingand evaluating the design a
nd operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as weconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our au
dit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control
 Over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial rep
orting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financialreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purp
oses in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Acompany’s internal control over financial rep
orting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, inreasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactio
ns and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance thattransactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in acc
ordance with generally accepted accounting principles,and that receipts and expenditures of the company are bei
ng made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of thecompany; and (3) provide reasonable assuranc
e regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of thecompany’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

199 | 2021 Annual ReportBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over fina
ncial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of anyevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inad
equate because of changes in conditions, or thatthe degree of compliance with the polici
es or procedures may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLP
