Item 1. Business
The
 Boeing Company, together with its subsidiaries (herein referred to as “Boeing,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our”), is one of the world’s majoraerospace firms.
We are organized based on the products and services w
e offer. We operate in four reportable segments:•
Commercial Airplanes (BCA);•
Defense, Space & Security (BDS);•
Global Services (BGS);•
Boeing Capital (BCC).Commercial Airplanes Segment
This
 segment  develops,  produces  and  markets  commercial  jet  aircraft  and  provides  fleet  support  services,  principally  to  the  commercial  airlineindustry
 worldwide. We are a leading producer of commercial aircraft and offer a family of commercial jetliners designed to meet a broad spectrumof
 global passenger and cargo requirements of airlines. This family of commercial jet aircraft in production includes the 737 narrow-body model andthe 747, 767, 777 and 787 wide-bo
dy models. Development continues on the 777X program and certain 737 MAX derivatives.Defense, Space & Security Segment
This
 segment engages in the research, development, production and modification of manned and unmanned military aircraft and weapons systemsfor
 strike,  surveillance  and  mobility,  including  fighter  and  trainer  aircraft;  vertical  lift,  including  rotorcraft  and  tilt-rotor  aircraft;  and  commercialderivative
 aircraft,  including  anti-submarine  and  tanker  aircraft.  In  addition,  this  segment  engages  in  the  research,  development,  production  andmodification
 of  the  following  products  and  related  services:  strategic  defense  and  intelligence  systems,  including  strategic  missile  and  defensesystems,
 command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR), cyber and information solutions,and intelligence systems; satellite systems, includi
ng government and commercial satellites and space exploration.BDS'
 primary  customer  is  the  United  States  Department  of  Defense  (U.S.  DoD).  Revenues  from  the  U.S.  DoD,  including  foreign  military  salesthrough
 the  U.S.  government,  accounted  for  approximately  83%  of  its  2020  revenues.  Other  significant  BDS  customers  include  the  NationalAeronautics and Space Administratio
n (NASA) and customers in international defense, civil and commercial satellite markets.This
 segment's primary products include the following fixed-wing military aircraft: F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46ATanker,
 and  T-7A  Red  Hawk.  This  segment  produces  rotorcraft  and  rotary-wing  programs,  such  as  CH-47  Chinook,  AH-64  Apache,  and  V-22Osprey.
 Unmanned vehicles include the MQ-25, QF-16, and Insitu’s Scan Eagle aircraft. In addition, this segment's products include space andmissile
 systems  including:  government  and  commercial  satellites,  NASA’s  Space  Launch  System  (SLS),  the  International  Space  Station,Commercial Crew, missile defense and weap
ons programs, and Joint Direct Attack Munition, as well as the United Launch Alliance joint venture.1

Table of ContentsGlobal Services Segment
This
 segment provides services to our commercial and defense customers worldwide. BGS sustains aerospace platforms and systems with a fullspectrum
 of products and services, including supply chain and logistics management, engineering, maintenance and modifications, upgrades andconversions,
 spare  parts,  pilot  and  maintenance  training  systems  and  services,  technical  and  maintenance  documents,  and  data  analytics  anddigital services.
Boeing Capital Segment
BCC
 seeks to ensure that Boeing customers have the financing they need to buy and take delivery of their Boeing product, while managing overallfinancing
 exposure. BCC’s portfolio consists of equipment under operating leases, sales-type/finance leases, notes and other receivables, assetsheld for sale or re-lease and investments.
Intellectual Property
We own numerous patents and have
 licenses for the use of patents owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture. In additionto
 owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and from third parties. For example, the U.S. governmenthas
 licenses in our patents that are developed in performance of government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventionscovered
 by such patents for government purposes. Unpatented research, development and engineering skills, as well as certain trademarks, tradesecrets,
 and  other  intellectual  property  rights,  also  make  an  important  contribution  to  our  business.  While  our  intellectual  property  rights  in  theaggregate
 are  important  to  the  operation  of  each  of  our  businesses,  we  do  not  believe  that  our  business  would  be  materially  affected  by  theexpiration of any particular intellectual pro
perty right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement.Human Capital
The
 COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact lives and businesses around the world. We have taken proactive steps to help protect the health andsafety
 of our employees and maintain business continuity. A vast majority of our office workers continue to telecommute. Within our production andoffice
 areas we have established a number of safety protocols, including face covering and physical distance requirements,  enhanced cleaning,encouraging
 daily self-health checks, voluntary temperature screening stations, and access to virtual primary care physicians at no cost. We havealso
 implemented a coronavirus hotline with direct access to our Health Services group to report COVID-19 tests due to illness or exposure andpositive
 COVID-19 tests. As part of that reporting process, we have developed a robust contact tracing program to identify employees who were inclose
 contact with the ill employee in the workplace. We are also actively planning for the time when COVID-19 vaccines will be available for ouremployees,
 including  reaching  out  to  county  public  health  departments  to  learn  more  about  their  plans  to  distribute  vaccines  and  monitoringinformation
 from  vaccine  manufacturers  about  when  vaccines  will  be  available.  All  of  the  actions  above  are  overseen  by  Boeing’s  CrisisManagement Working Group, a multi-functional, multi-disciplin
e team tasked with integrating all aspects of Boeing’s COVID-19 response. Additionally,
 we  are  adapting  to  the  market  impacts  of  COVID-19  and  positioning  the  company  for  the  future.  One  of  these  measures  includesreducing
 the size of our workforce. As of December 31, 2020, Boeing’s total workforce was approximately 141,000, with 11% located outside of theU.S. We expect to reduce the size of our workforce in 2021 through additiona
l workforce actions as well as natural attrition. 2

Table of ContentsAs of December 31,
 2020, our workforce is composed of approximately 47,000 union members. Our principal collective bargaining agreements werewith the following unions:

e company. Guided by our values, we are committed to creating a company where everyoneis
 included and respected, and where we support each other in reaching our full potential. We are committed to diverse representation across alllevels of our
 workforce to reflect the vibrant and thriving diversity of the communities in which we live and work. We also support Business ResourceGroups
 open to all employees that focus on gender, race & ethnicity, generations, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability or veteran status.These
 groups  help  foster  inclusion  among  all  teammates,  build  awareness,  recruit  and  retain  a  diverse  workforce  and  support  the  company  insuccessfully
 operating  in  a  global,  multicultural  business  environment.  We  are  committed  to  increased  transparency  and  will  publicly  share  ourdiversity met
rics annually, beginning in 2021.To
 attract and retain the best-qualified talent, we offer competitive benefits, including market-competitive compensation, healthcare, paid time off,parental
 leave, retirement benefits, tuition assistance, employee skills development, leadership development, and rotation programs. In 2020, ourvoluntary
 resignation rate was approximately 3%. Additionally, we hired approximately 8,000 new employees in 2020 for critical skills and had anoffer acceptance rate of 82%.
Employees
 are encouraged to provide feedback about their experience through ongoing employee engagement activities. Boeing actively listens toits employees via surveys ranging 
from pre-hire to exiting the company. These voluntary surveys provide aggregate trend reports for the company toaddress in
 real time and ensure Boeing maintains an employee-focused experience and culture. We also invest in rewarding performance and haveestablished a multi-level recogniti
on program for the purpose of acknowledging the achievements of excellent individual or team performance.We
 are committed to supporting our employees continuous development of professional, technical and leadership skills through access to digitallearning
 resources  and  through  partnerships  with  leading  professional/technical  societies  and  organizations  around  the  world.  For  2020,  Boeingemployees
 consumed  approximately  4  million  hours  of  learning.  We  offer  the  ability  for  our  people  to  pursue  degree  programs,  professionalcertificates
 and individual courses in strategic fields of study from more than 300 accredited colleges and universities, online and across the globethrough our tuition assistance program. Over 12,000 Boeing emp
loyees leverage these programs every year.Safety,
 quality and integrity are at the core of how Boeing operates. We aspire to achieve zero workplace injuries and provide a safe, open andaccountable
 work  environment  for  our  employees.  We  provide  several  channels  for  all  employees  to  speak  up,  ask  for  guidance,  and  reportconcerns related
3

Table of Contentsto ethics or safety violations. We address employee concerns and take ap
propriate actions that uphold our Boeing values.Competition
The
 commercial  jet  aircraft  market  and  the  airline  industry  remain  extremely  competitive.  We  face  aggressive  international  competitors  who  areintent
 on  increasing  their  market  share,  such  as  Airbus  and  other  entrants  from  Russia,  China  and  Japan.  We  are  focused  on  improving  ourprocesses
 and continuing cost reduction efforts. We intend to continue to compete with other airplane manufacturers by providing customers withgreater value products.
BDS
 faces  strong  competition  in  all  market  segments,  primarily  from  Lockheed  Martin  Corporation,  Northrop  Grumman  Corporation,  RaytheonTechnologies
 Corporation, General Dynamics Corporation and SpaceX. Non-U.S. companies such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group continue tobuild
 a strategic presence in the U.S. market by strengthening their North American operations and partnering with U.S. defense companies. Inaddition,
 certain competitors have occasionally formed teams with other competitors to address specific customer requirements. BDS expects thetrend of strong competition to continue into 2021.
The
 commercial  and  defense  services  markets  are  extremely  challenging  and  are  made  up  of  many  of  the  same  strong  U.S.  and  non-U.S.competitors
 facing BCA and BDS along with other competitors in those markets. BGS leverages our extensive services network offering productsand
 services which span the life cycle of our defense and commercial airplane programs: training, fleet services and logistics, maintenance andengineering,
 modifications  and  upgrades  -  as  well  as  the  daily  cycle  of  gate-to-gate  operations.  BGS  expects  the  market  to  remain  highlycompetitive in 2021, and intends to grow market share by leverag
ing a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity.Regulatory Matters
Our
 businesses are heavily regulated in most of our markets. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but notlimited
 to  all  of  the  branches  of  the  U.S.  military,  NASA,  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  and  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security.Similar government authorities exist in our non-U.S. markets.
Government Contracts.
 The  U.S. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, as wellas
 for default based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If any of our U.S. government contracts were to be terminated forconvenience,
 we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of ourgovernment
 contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted andcould require us to pay the difference between the orig
inal contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted fromthe original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us li
able for damages resulting from the default.Commercial
 Aircraft. In  the U.S., our commercial aircraft products are required to comply with FAA regulations governing production and qualitysystems,
 airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. Outside the U.S., similar requirements existfor
 airworthiness, installation and operational approvals. These requirements are generally administered by the national aviation authorities of eachcountry and, in the case of Europe, coordinated by the Europe
an Union Aviation Safety Agency.Environmental.
 We  are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including thedischarge, treatment, storage, disposal and
4

Table of Contentsremediation
 of  hazardous  substances  and  wastes.  We  continually  assess  our  compliance  status  and  management  of  environmental  matters  toensure
 our  operations  are  in  compliance  with  all  applicable  environmental  laws  and  regulations.  Investigation,  remediation,  and  operation  andmaintenance
 costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. These costsoften
 are  allowable  costs  under  our  contracts  with  the  U.S.  government.  It  is  reasonably  possible  that  costs  incurred  to  ensure  continuedenvironme
ntal compliance could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if additional work requirementsor
 more  stringent  clean-up  standards  are  imposed  by  regulators,  new  areas  of  soil,  air  and  groundwater  contamination  are  discovered  and/orexpansions of work scope are prompted by the results of investigatio
ns.A Potentially Responsibl
e Party (PRP) has joint and several liability under existing U.S. environmental laws. Where we have been designated a PRPby
 the Environmental Protection Agency or a state environmental agency, we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the full costof
 remediating contamination at our facilities or former facilities or at third-party sites. If we were required to fully fund the remediation of a site forwhich
 we were originally assigned a partial share, the statutory framework would allow us to pursue rights to contribution from other PRPs. Foradditional information relating to env
ironmental contingencies, see Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Non-U.S.
 Sales. Our  non-U.S.  sales  are  subject  to  both  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  governmental  regulations  and  procurement  policies  and  practices,including
 regulations relating to import-export control, tariffs, investment, exchange controls, anti-corruption, and repatriation of earnings. Non-U.S.sales are also subject to varying currency, political an
d economic risks.Raw Materials, Parts, and Subassemblies
We
 are  highly  dependent  on  the  availability  of  essential  materials,  parts  and  subassemblies  from  our  suppliers  and  subcontractors.  The  mostimportant
 raw materials required for our aerospace products are aluminum (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions), titanium (sheet, plate, forgingsand
 extrusions) and composites (including carbon and boron). Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification ofthe sources could take a year or
 more. Many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basiswith a number of companies.
Suppliers
We
 are dependent upon the ability of a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance specifications, qualitystandards
 and delivery schedules at our anticipated costs. While we maintain an extensive qualification and performance surveillance system tocontrol
 risk  associated  with  such  reliance  on  third  parties,  failure  of  suppliers  or  subcontractors  to  meet  commitments  could  adversely  affectproduction
 schedules  and  program/contract  profitability,  thereby  jeopardizing  our  ability  to  fulfill  commitments  to  our  customers.  We  are  alsodependent on the availab
ility of energy sources, such as electricity, at affordable prices.Seasonality
No material portion of our business is considered to be se
asonal.Executive Officers of the Registrant

Table of ContentsItem 1A. Risk Factors
An
 investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ materiallyfrom
 our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the informationcontained in this report.
Risks Related to COVID-19
We
 face significant risks related to the spread of the COVID-19 virus and developments surrounding the global pandemic have had, andwill
 continue  to  have,  significant  effects  on  our  business,  financial  condition,  results  of  operations,  and  cash  flows.  We  also  facesignificant
 risks related to the global economic downturn and severe reduction in commercial air traffic caused by the pandemic. Theserisks
 include materially reduced demand for our products and services, increased instability in our supply chain, and challenges to theongoing
 viability  of  some  of  our  customers.  We  may  face  similar  risks  in  connection  with  any  future  public  health  crises,  includingresurgences in the spread of COVID-19.
The
 COVID-19 pandemic has subjected our business, operations, financial performance, cash flows and financial condition to a number of risks,including, but not limited to those discussed b
elow.Operations-related
 risks: As  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  we  are  facing  increased  operational  challenges  from  the  need  to  protectemployee
 health and safety. These challenges have included, and may in the future include production site shutdowns, and workplace disruptionsand restrictions on the movement of people, raw materials and goods, both at our ow
n facilities and those of our customers and suppliers.For example, during the second quarter of 2020, we temporarily suspended operation
s in Puget Sound, South Carolina, and Philadelphia, as well asat
 several other key production sites. We had not previously experienced a complete suspension of our operations at these production sites. Whilewe
 have resumed operations at all of our production sites we cannot predict whether or where further production disruptions could be required orwhat
 the ongoing impact of COVID-19-related operating restrictions will be. For example, we continue to experience additional operating costs dueto
 social distancing requirements and other factors related to COVID-19 restrictions. We cannot predict the impact that future production disruptionsmay
 have on our business, operations, financial performance and financial condition. We continue to monitor federal, state, and municipal healthauthorities
 for  new  or  modified  guidance  and  requirements  concerning  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  and  we  may  be  required  to  impose  additionaloperational
 restrictions and/or suspend operations at key production sites based on these requirements and recommendations and/or workplacedisruptions caused by COVID-19.
Many
 of our suppliers also were required to suspend operations during the second quarter of 2020, and they may experience additional disruptionsin
 2021.  Any  such  disruptions  could  have  severe  adverse  impacts  on  our  production  costs,  delivery  schedule  and/or  ability  to  meet  customercommitments.
Any
 prolonged suspension of operations or delayed recovery in our operations, and/or any similar suspension of operations or delayed recovery atone
 or more of our key suppliers, or the failure of any of our key suppliers, would result in further challenges to our business, leading to a furthermaterial adverse effect on our business, financial cond
ition, results of operations, and cash flows.Liquidity
 risks: The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  also  had  a  significant  impact  on  our  liquidity  and  overall  debt  levels.  During  the  year  endedDecember
 31, 2020, net cash used by operating activities was $18.4 billion. At December 31, 2020, cash and short-term investments totaled $25.6billion.
 Our debt balance totaled $63.6 billion at December 31, 2020, up from $27.3 billion at December 31, 2019. We expect negative operatingcash flows in future quarters until deliveries begi
n to return to historical levels, and if7

Table of Contentsthe
 pace  and  scope  of  the  recovery  are  worse  than  we  currently  contemplate,  we  may  need  to  obtain  additional  financing  in  order  to  fund  ouroperations
 and  obligations.  If  we  were  to  need  to  obtain  additional  financing,  uncertainty  related  to  COVID-19  and  its  impact  on  us  and  theaerospace
 industry, as well as continued uncertainty with respect to our credit rating could limit our access to credit markets and we may havedifficulty obtain
ing financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, certain of our customers may also be unable to make timely payments tous.
 Factors that could limit our access to additional liquidity include further disruptions in the global capital markets and/or additional declines in ourfinancia
l performance, outlook or credit ratings. The occurrence of any or all of these events could adversely affect our ability to fund our operationsand/or
 meet outstanding debt obligations and contractual commitments. In addition, further downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affectour
 cost  of  funds  and  related  margins,  liquidity,  competitive  position  and  access  to  capital  markets,  and  a  significant  downgrade  could  have  anadverse impact on our businesses.
Customer-related risks:
 Commercial  air traffic has fallen dramatically due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This trend has impacted passenger trafficmost
 severely. Near-term cargo traffic has also fallen, but to a lesser extent as global trade has begun to recover. Most airlines have significantlyreduced their capacity, and many
 could implement further reductions in the near future. Many airlines are also implementing significant reductions instaffing.
 These capacity changes are causing, and are expected to continue to cause, negative impacts to our customers’ revenue, earnings, andcash
 flow, and in some cases may threaten the future viability of some of our customers, potentially causing defaults within our customer financingportfolio,
 which  was  $2.0  billion  as  of  December  31,  2020  and/or  requiring  us  to  remarket  aircraft  that  have  already  been  produced  and/or  arecurrently
 in backlog. If we are unable to successfully remarket these aircraft and/or the narrow-body and wide-body markets do not recover as soonas
 we  are  currently  assuming,  or  if  we  are  required  to  further  reduce  production  rates  and/or  contract  the  accounting  quantity  on  any  of  ourcommercial
 programs, we could experience material reductions in earnings and/or be required to recognize a reach-forward loss on one or more ofour programs. For
 example, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we recognized a reach-forward loss on the 777X program in part due to impacts related tothe
 COVID-19  pandemic.  In  addition,  if  737 MAX aircraft  in one or  more  jurisdictions  remain  grounded for  an extended period  of  time,  we mayexperience
 additional reductions to backlog and/or significant order cancellations. Additionally, we may experience fewer new orders and increasedcancellations
 across  all  of  our  commercial  airplane  programs  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  associated  impacts  on  demand.  Ourcustomers may
 also lack sufficient liquidity to purchase new aircraft due to impacts from the pandemic. We are also observing a significant increasein
 the  number  of  requests  for  payment  deferrals,  contract  modifications,  lease  restructurings  and  similar  actions,  and  these  trends  may  lead  toadditional
 charges, impairments and other adverse financial impacts in our business over time. In addition, to the extent that customers have validrights to cancel undelivered aircraft, we may be required to refund pre-del
ivery payments, putting additional constraints on our liquidity.In
 addition  to  the  near-term  impact,  there  is  risk  that  the  industry  implements  longer-term  strategies  involving  reduced  capacity,  shifting  routepatterns,
 and mitigation strategies related to impacts from COVID-19 and the risk of future public health crises. In addition, airlines may experiencereduced demand due to reluctance by the flying p
ublic to travel due to travel restrictions and/or social distancing requirements.As
 a result, there is significant uncertainty with respect to when commercial air traffic levels will begin to recover, and whether and at what pointcapacity
 will  return  to  and/or  exceed  pre-COVID-19  levels.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  also  has  increased,  and  its  aftermath  is  also  expected  tocontinue to increase, uncerta
inty with respect to global trade volumes, which could put negative pressure on cargo traffic levels. Any of these factorswould
 have a significant impact on the demand for both single-aisle and wide-body commercial aircraft, as well as for the services we provide tocommercial
 airlines.  In  addition,  a lengthy period  of  reduced industry-wide  demand for  commercial  aircraft  would put additional  pressure  on oursuppliers, resulting in increased procureme
nt costs and/or additional supply chain disruption. To8

 extent that the COVID-19 pandemic or its aftermath further impacts demand for our products and services or impairs the viability of some of ourcustomers
 and/or suppliers, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected, and those impacts could bematerial.
Other
 risks: The  magnitude  and  duration  of  the  global  COVID-19  pandemic  is  uncertain  and  continues  to  adversely  affect  our  business  andoperating
 and financial results. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2020, due in part to the prolonged adverse impact of the pandemic on ourearnings,
 we  recorded  an  increase  of  $2.5  billion  to  the  valuation  allowance  associated  with  deferred  income  tax  assets.  The  pandemic  also  isexpected
 to heighten many of the other risks described below. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic may also affect our operating and financial resultsin a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not expect to present significant risks to our operations or fina
ncial results.Risks Related to Our Business and Operations
We
 are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties related to the 737 MAX. These risks include uncertainties regarding the timing andconditions
 of 737 MAX regulatory approvals, in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, lower than planned production rates and/or delivery rates,increased
 considerations  to customers, increased supplier costs and supply chain health, changes to the assumptions and estimatesmade
 in our financial statements regarding the 737 program, and potential outcomes of various 737 MAX-related legal proceedings andgovernment investigations.
On March 13,
 2019, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an order to suspend operations of all 737 MAX aircraft in the U.S. and by U.S.aircraft operators follow
ing two fatal 737 MAX accidents. Non-U.S. civil aviation authorities issued directives to the same effect. Deliveries of the 737MAX
 were suspended until December 2020. The grounding has reduced revenues, operating margins, and cash flows, and will continue to do sountil
 production rates return to pre-grounding levels. In connection with the effort to return the 737 MAX to service, we developed software updatesfor
 the 737 MAX, together with an associated pilot training and supplementary education program. We continue to work with certain non-U.S. civilaviation
 authorities to complete remaining steps toward certification and readiness for return to service worldwide. Any delays in certification in oneor
 more jurisdictions and/or the ramp-up of deliveries or other liabilities associated with the accidents or grounding could have a material adverseeffect
 on our financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows. In addition, multiple legal actions have been filed against us related to the737
 MAX. We also are fully cooperating with U.S. government investigations related to the accidents and the 737 MAX, including investigations bythe Securities
 and Exchange Commission. In January 2021, we entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the U.S. Department of Justicethat
 resolves the Department of Justice’s previously disclosed investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX airplane by the FAA.We expensed $744
 in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to this agreement. Any further adverse impacts related to any such litigation or investigationcould have a further material impact on our financial positi
on, results of operations and/or cash flows.During
 2019, we announced plans to reduce, and ultimately  to suspend 737 production.  Impacts  related to these actions significantly  increasedcosts
 to produce aircraft included in the current accounting quantity and have resulted in reduced 737 program and overall BCA segment operatingmargins. We
 have also made significant assumptions regarding estimated costs expected to be incurred in 2021 that should be included in programinventory
 and those estimated costs that will be expensed when incurred as abnormal production costs. If we are unable to return the 737 MAXaircraft to
 service in one or more jurisdictions or deliver 737 aircraft to customers on the schedule and/or at a pace consistent with our expectations,we
 will incur significant additional costs and/or delay the planned ramp-up of 737 production. These delays would also result in significant additionaldisruption to the 737 production system and further delay efforts to restore and/or implement previously p
lanned increases in the 7379

 rate.  Cash  flows  continue  to  be  negatively  impacted  by  delayed  payments  from  customers,  higher  costs  and  inventory  levels,  andpayments
 made  to  customers  in  connection  with  disruption  to  their  operations.  In  addition,  we  have  experienced  claims  and  assertions  fromcustomers
 in connection with the grounding, and we recorded an earnings charge of $8,259 million, net of insurance recoveries of $500 million, in2019,
 in connection with an estimate of potential concessions and other considerations to customers for disruptions related to the grounding andassociated delivery delays.
Any
 further delays in regulatory approval of the 737 MAX in one or more jurisdictions, further disruptions to suppliers and/or the long-term health ofthe
 production  system,  supplier  claims  or  assertions,  or  changes  to  estimated  concessions  or  other  considerations  we  expect  to  provide  tocustomers
 could  have a  material  adverse  effect  on our  financial  position,  results  of  operations,  and/or  cash  flows.  In  the  event  of  unanticipatedadditio
nal training requirements in one or more jurisdictions, delays in regulatory approval, and/or delays in our ability to resume deliveries to one ormore
 customers,  we  may  be  required  to  take  actions  with  longer-term  impact,  such  as  further  changes  to  our  production  plans,  employmentreductions and/or the expenditure of significa
nt resources to support our supply chain and/or customers.We
 have made significant estimates with respect to the 737 program regarding the number of units to be produced, the period during which thoseunits
 are likely to be produced, and the units’ expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routinewarranty
 costs.  In  addition  to  the  estimated  timing  of  the  resumption  of  deliveries,  we  have  made  assumptions  regarding  outcomes  of  accidentinvestigations
 and other government inquiries, timing of future 737 production rate increases, timing and sequence of future deliveries, supply chainhealth
 as  we  implement  our  production  plans,  as  well  as  outcomes  of  negotiations  with  customers.  Any  changes  in  these  estimates  and/orassumptions
 with respect to the 737 program could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows. Foradditional
 information,  see  our  discussion  under  “Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis-Critical  Accounting  Policies  and  Estimates-737  MAXGrounding” on pages 55 - 56.
In
 addition to the impact of COVID-19 described above, our Commercial Airplanes and Global Services businesses depend heavily oncommercial airlines, and are subject to unique risks.
Market
 conditions  have  a  significant  impact  on  demand  for  our  commercial  aircraft  and  related  services. The  commercial  aircraft  market  ispredominantly
 driven  by  long-term  trends  in  airline  passenger  and  cargo  traffic.  The  principal  factors  underlying  long-term  traffic  growth  aresustained
 economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further influencedby
 airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological advances, price andother
 competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, epidemics and environmental regulations. Traditionally, the airline industry has been cyclical andvery
 competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost competitive. Significant deterioration in theglobal economic environment, the airline
 industry generally, or the financial stability of one or more of our major customers could result in fewer neworders
 for aircraft or services, or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual orders and/or payments to us, which could resultin
 lower  revenues,  profitability  and  cash  flows  and  a  reduction  in  our  contractual  backlog.  In  addition,  because  our  commercial  aircraft  backlogconsists
 of  aircraft  scheduled  for  delivery  over  a  period  of  several  years,  any  of  these  macroeconomic,  industry  or  customer  impacts  couldunexpectedly affect deliveries over a long p
eriod.We enter into
 firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses which could subject us to losses if we have cost overrunsor if
 increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft  sales contracts are often entered into years before the aircraftare
 delivered. In order to help account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing generally consists of afixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas
10

Table of Contentsderived
 from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our revenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalationformulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of our control. Escalati
on factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes inescalation amounts can significantly imp
act revenues and operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business.We
 derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines. We  can make no assurance that any customer willexercise
 purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us. In addition, fleet decisions,airline
 consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues andlimit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.
Our
 Commercial Airplanes business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy production system, achieve planned production ratetargets, successfully develop new aircraft or new derivative aircraft, and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standards.
The
 commercial aircraft business is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with U.S and non-U.S. suppliers, highly-skilled
 labor from thousands of employees and other partners, and stringent regulatory requirements, including the risk of evolving standards forcommercial
 aircraft certification, and performance and reliability standards. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft programs and/or derivatives,such
 as the 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing, production, and certification schedules. The 737 programhas also experienced significant disruption due to the grounding of
 the 737 MAX and associated suspension of 737 MAX production for part of 2020.As
 a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy regulatory and customer requirements, and achieve or maintain, as applicable, programprofitability
 is  subject  to  significant  risks.  For  example,  a  number  of  our  customers  may  have  contractual  remedies,  including  rights  to  rejectindividual
 airplane deliveries if the actual delivery date is significantly later than the contractual delivery date. Delays on the 737 MAX and 777Xprograms
 have resulted in, and may continue to result in, customers having the right to terminate orders and or substitute orders for other Boeingaircraft.
We
 must  minimize  disruption  caused  by  production  changes  and  achieve  productivity  improvements  in  order  to  meet  customer  demand  andmaintain
 our  profitability. We  have  previously  announced  plans  to  adjust  production  rates  on  several  of  our  commercial  aircraft  programs.  Wecontinue
 to engage in significant ongoing development, testing and production of the 777X aircraft. In addition, we continue to seek opportunities toreduce
 the  costs  of  building  our  aircraft,  including  working  with  our  suppliers  to  reduce  supplier  costs,  identifying  and  implementing  productivityimprovements,
 and  optimizing  how  we  manage  inventory.  If  production  rate  changes  at  any  of  our  commercial  aircraft  assembly  facilities  aredelayed
 or create significant disruption to our production system, or if our suppliers cannot timely deliver components to us at the cost and ratesnecessary
 to achieve our targets, we may be unable to meet delivery schedules and/or the financial performance of one or more of our programsmay suffer.
Operational
 challenges  impacting  the  production  system  for  one  or  more  of  our  commercial  aircraft  programs  could  result  in  production  delaysand/or
 failure  to  meet  customer  demand  for  new  aircraft,  either  of  which  would  negatively  impact  our  revenues  and  operating  margins. Our commercial
 aircraft production system is extremely complex. Operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, failure to meetinternal
 performance  plans,  or  delays  or  failures  to  achieve  required  regulatory  approval,  could  result  in  significant  out-of-sequence  work  andincreased
 production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers, impacts to aircraft performance and/or increased warranty or fleet supportcosts.
 For example, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we expanded the scope of production inspections on the 787 program, and those inspections andassociated rework are delaying sched
uled deliveries and resulting in additional 787 aircraft in inventory.11

Table of ContentsIf our
 commercial airplanes fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirements, we could face additional costs and/or lower revenues. Developing and
 manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatoryagencies, can be costly and technolo
gically challenging. These challenges are particularly significant with newer aircraft programs. Any failure of anyBoeing aircraft to satisfy performance or reliability requirements could result in d
isruption to our operations, higher costs and/or lower revenues.Changes
 in levels of U.S. government defense spending or overall acquisition priorities could negatively impact our financial positionand results of operations.
We derive a substantial portion of
 our revenue from the U.S. government, primarily from defense related programs with the U.S. DoD. Levels of U.S.defense
 spending are very difficult to predict and may be impacted by numerous factors such as the evolving nature of the national security threatenvironme
nt, U.S. national security strategy, U.S. foreign policy, the domestic political environment, macroeconomic conditions and the ability of theU.S. government to enact relevant legislation such as auth
orization and appropriations bills.Although
 FY21 appropriations have been enacted, long-term uncertainty remains with respect to overall levels of defense spending beyond FY21,and
 it is likely that U.S. government discretionary spending, including defense spending, will continue to be subject to pressure. In addition, thetimeliness
 of future appropriations for government departments and agencies remains a recurrent risk. A lapse in appropriations for governmentdepartment or agencies would result in a full or partial g
overnment shutdown, which could impact the Company’s operations. Alternatively, Congressmay
 fund government  departments  and agencies with  one or more  Continuing Resolutions;  however,  this could restrict  the  execution  of  certainprogram activities and delay new programs or competitions.
There
 continues  to  be  uncertainty  with  respect  to  future  acquisition  priorities  and  program-level  appropriations  for  the  U.S.  DoD  and  othergovernment
 agencies (including NASA), including tension between modernization investments, sustainment investments, and investments in newtechnologies
 or emergent capabilities. Future investment priority changes or budget cuts, including changes associated with the authorizations andappropriations
 process could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs, or future program opportunities.Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Company’s operatio
ns, financial position and/or cash flows.In
 addition, as a result of the significant ongoing uncertainty with respect to both U.S. defense spending and the evolving nature of the nationalsecurity
 threat environment, we also expect the U.S. DoD to continue to emphasize affordability, innovation, cybersecurity, and delivery of technicaldata
 and software in its procurement processes. If we can no longer adjust successfully to these changing acquisition policies our revenues andmarket share could be impacted.

Table of ContentsOur
 ability to deliver products and services that satisfy customer requirements is heavily dependent on the performance and financialstability of our subcontractors and suppliers, as well as on the availability of raw materials and o
ther components.We rely on other companies including U.S. and n
on-U.S. subcontractors and suppliers to provide and produce raw materials, integrated componentsand
 sub-assemblies,  and production commodities  and to perform  some of the services that we provide to our customers.  If one or more  of oursuppliers
 or  subcontractors  experiences  financial  difficulties,  delivery  delays  or  other  performance  problems,  we  may  be  unable  to  meetcommitments
 to our customers or incur additional costs. In addition, if one or more of the raw materials on which we depend (such as aluminum,titanium
 or composites) becomes unavailable or is available only at very high prices, we may be unable to deliver one or more of our products in atimely
 fashion  or  at  budgeted  costs.  In  some  instances,  we  depend  upon  a  single  source  of  supply.  Any  service  disruption  from  one  of  thesesuppliers,
 either due to circumstances beyond the supplier’s control, such as geopolitical developments, or as a result of performance problems orfinancial difficulties, could have a materia
l adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers or increase our operating costs.Competition within our markets and with respect to the products we sell
 may reduce our future contracts and sales.The
 markets  in  which  we  operate  are  highly  competitive  and  one  or  more  of  our  competitors  may  have  more  extensive  or  more  specializedengineering,
 manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas. In our Commercial Airplanes business, we anticipate increasingcompetition among non-U.S. aircraft manufacturers
 of commercial jet aircraft. In our BDS business, we anticipate that the effects of defense industryconsolidation,
 shifting  acquisition  and  budget  priorities,  and  continued  cost  pressure  at  our  U.S.  DoD  and  non-U.S.  customers  will  intensifycompetition
 for  many  of  our  BDS products.  Our  BGS  segment  faces  competition  from  many  of  the  same  strong  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  competitorsfacing
 BCA and BDS. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. There can beno assurance that we will be
 able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will notresult in reduced revenues and market share.
We derive a significant portion of our revenues from non-U.S. sales and are subject to the risks of doing business in other countr
ies.In
 2020, non-U.S. customers, which includes foreign military sales (FMS), accounted for approximately 37% of our revenues. We expect that non-U.S.
 sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, we are subject to risks of doingbusiness internationally
, including:•
changes in regulatory requirements; •
changes in the global trade enviro nment, including disputes with authorities in non-U.S. jurisdictions, including international trade authorities,that could impact sales and/or delivery of products and services outsi
de the U.S. and/or impose costs on our customers in the form of tariffs,duties, or penalties attributable to the importation of Boein
g products and services;•
U.S.  and non-U.S. government policies, including requirements to expend a portion of program funds locally and governmental industrialcooperation or participation requirements;
•
fluctuations in international currency excha nge rates;•
volatility  in international political and economic environments and changes in non-U.S. national priorities and budgets, which can lead todelays or fluctuations in orders;
•
the complexity and necessity of using non-U.S. representatives a nd consultants;13

Table of Contents•
the  uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases, including the availability of financing from the Export-Import Bankof the United States;
•
uncertainties and restrictions concerning the ava ilability of funding credit or guarantees;•
imposition of domestic and international taxes, exp ort controls, tariffs, embargoes, sanctions and other trade restrictions;•
the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise sprea d over many countries;•
compliance with a variety of non-U.S. laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activ ities of U.S. companies abroad; and•
unforeseen developments and con ditions, including terrorism, war, epidemics and international tensions and conflicts.While
 the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations in the future. Forexample,
 since 2018, the U.S. and China have imposed tariffs on each other’s imports. China is a very significant market for commercial airplanesand
 represents a significant component of our commercial airplanes backlog. In addition, the U.S. and European Union (EU) have been engaged intwo
 long-running disputes at the World Trade Organization (WTO) relating to large civil aircraft, including one that has resulted in the imposition oftariffs
 on certain of our products. Impacts from these or future potential tariffs, or deterioration in trade relations between the U.S. and one or moreother countries, could have a material adverse impact on our revenu
es, operating earnings, and/or cash flows.We
 use estimates in accounting for many contracts and programs. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financialresults.
Contract and program accounting require judgme
nt relative to assessing risks, estimating revenues and costs and making assumptions for scheduleand
 technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts and programs, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion iscomplicated and subject to many variables.
 Assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract or program becausecosts
 also include expected increases in wages and employee benefits, material prices and allocated fixed costs. Incentives or penalties related toperformance
 on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assessanticipated
 performance. Supplier claims and assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profit rates. Estimates of futureaward fees are also included in sal
es and profit rates.With
 respect  to  each  of  our  commercial  aircraft  programs,  inventoriable  production  costs  (including  overhead),  program  tooling  and  other  non-recurring
 costs and routine warranty costs are accumulated and charged as cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. Aprogram
 consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort fordelivery
 under existing and anticipated contracts limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates. To establish the relationship ofsales
 to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period overwhich
 the units can reasonably be expected to be produced and (c) the units’ expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and othernon-recurring
 costs, and routine warranty costs for the total program. Several factors determine accounting quantity, including firm orders, letters ofintent
 from prospective customers and market studies. Changes to customer or model mix, production costs and rates, learning curve, changes toprice
 escalation indices, costs of derivative aircraft, supplier performance, customer and supplier negotiations/settlements, supplier claims and/orcertification
 issues can impact these estimates. In addition, on development programs such as the 777X, we are subject to risks with respect to thetiming
 and conditions of aircraft certification, including potential gaps between when aircraft are certified in various jurisdictions, and our estimateswith
14

Table of Contentsrespect
 to  timing  of  future  certifications  could  have  an  impact  on  overall  program  status.  Any  such  change  in  estimates  relating  to  programaccounting may adversely affect future financial performance.
Because
 of the  significance  of  the judgments  and estimation  processes  described  above,  materially  different  sales  and profit  amounts  could berecorded if
 we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances orestimates
 may adversely affect future period financial performance. For additional information on our accounting policies for recognizing sales andprofits, see our
 discussion under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Critical Accounting Policies – Contract Accounting/Program Accounting”on pages 53 – 55 and Note 1 to our Consol
idated Financial Statements on pages 68 – 81 of this Form 10-K.We may not realize the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures/strategic alliances or divestitures.
As
 part of our business strategy, we may merge with or acquire businesses and/or form joint ventures and strategic alliances. Whether we realizethe
 anticipated benefits from these acquisitions and related activities depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate the operations of the acquiredbusiness, the performanc
e of the underlying product and service portfolio, and the performance of the management team and other personnel of theacquired
 operations.  Accordingly,  our  financial  results  could  be  adversely  affected  by  unanticipated  performance  issues,  legacy  liabilities,transaction-related
 charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets, credit guarantees, partnerperformance
 and indemnifications. Consolidations of joint ventures could also impact our reported results of operations or financial position. Whilewe
 believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there is no assurance that thesetransactions
 will be successful.  We also may make strategic divestitures  from time to time. These transactions  may result in continued financialinvolvement
 in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Nonperformance bythose divested businesses could affect our future financi
al results through additional payment obligations, higher costs or asset write-downs.Risks Related to Our Contracts
We conduct a significant portion of our business pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which are subject to un
ique risks.In
 2020, 51% of our revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which include FMS through the U.S. government.  Businessconducted pursuant to such contracts is subject to extensive procurement regul
ations and other unique risks.Our sales to the U.S. government are subject to extensive procurement regulations, and cha
nges to those regulations could increase our costs. New procurement
 regulations,  or  changes  to  existing  requirements,  could  increase  our  compliance  costs  or  otherwise  have  a  material  impact  on  theoperating
 margins of our BDS and BGS businesses. These requirements may result in increased compliance costs, and we could be subject toadditional
 costs  in  the  form  of  withheld  payments  and/or  reduced  future  business  if  we  fail  to  comply  with  these  requirements  in  the  future.Compliance
 costs attributable to current and potential future procurement regulations such as these could negatively impact our financial conditionand operating results.
The
 U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate one or more of our contracts. The  U.S. government contracting party may modify, curtail orterminate
 its contracts and subcontracts with us, without prior notice and either at its convenience or for default based on performance. In addition,funding pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as p
art of the U.S.15

Table of ContentsCongressional
 appropriations process due to fiscal constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Furtheruncertainty
 with respect to ongoing programs  could also result  in the event that the U.S. government  finances  its operations  through temporaryfunding
 measures such as “continuing resolutions” rather than full-year appropriations. Any loss or anticipated loss or reduction of expected fundingand/or
 modification,  curtailment,  or  termination  of  one  or  more  large  programs  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  earnings,  cash  flowand/or financial position.
We
 are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under U.S.government
 contracts. U.S.  government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency,routinely
 audit  government  contractors.  These  agencies  review  our  performance  under  contracts,  cost  structure  and  compliance  with  applicablelaws,
 regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found tobe
 misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must berefunded.
 Any  inadequacies  in  our  systems  and  policies  could  result  in  withholds  on  billed  receivables,  penalties  and  reduced  future  business.Furthermore,
 if  any  audit,  inquiry  or  investigation  uncovers  improper  or  illegal  activities,  we  could  be  subject  to  civil  and  criminal  penalties  andadministrative
 sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment fromdoing
 business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if suchallegations are later determined to be false.
We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns.
Our
 BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 69% and 72% of their 2020 revenues from fixed-price contracts. While fixed-pricecontracts
 enable us to benefit from performance improvements, cost reductions and efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced marginsor
 incurring  losses if we are  unable to achieve estimated  costs  and revenues.  If  our estimated  costs  exceed our estimated  price,  we recognizereach-forwar
d losses which can significantly affect our reported results. For example in 2020, we recorded additional reach-forward losses of $1,320million
 on the KC-46A Tanker contract reflecting $551 million of costs associated with the agreement signed in April 2020 with the U.S. Air Force todevelop
 and  integrate  a  new  Remote  Vision  System,  and  the  remaining  costs  reflect  production  inefficiencies  including  impacts  of  COVID-19disruption.
 New  programs  could  also  have  risk  for  reach-forward  loss  upon  contract  award  and  during  the  period  of  contract  performance.  Forexample,
 in 2018, in connection with winning the T-7A Red Hawk and MQ-25 competitions,  we recorded a loss of $400 million associated withoptions
 for  346  T-7A  Red  Hawk  aircraft  and  a  loss  of  $291  million  related  to  the  MQ-25  Engineering,  Manufacturing  and  Development  (EMD)contract.
 The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the process of estimating costs and revenues on fixed-price contracts inherentlyrisky.
 Fixed-price contracts often contain price incentives and penalties tied to performance which can be difficult to estimate and have significantimpacts on margins. In addition, some of our contracts have specific provisions relatin
g to cost, schedule and performance.Fixed-price
 development  contracts  are  generally  subject  to  more  uncertainty  than  fixed-price  production  contracts.  Many  of  these  developmentprograms
 have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays andhigher
 costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. Examples of significant BDSfixed-price
 development  contracts  include  Commercial  Crew,  KC-46A  Tanker,  T-7A  Red  Hawk,  VC-25B  Presidential  Aircraft,  MQ-25,  andcommercial and military satellites.

Table of ContentsWe enter into cost-type contracts which also carry risks.
Our
 BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 31% and 28% of their 2020 revenues from cost-type contracting arrangements.Some
 of these are development programs that have complex design and technical challenges. These cost-type programs typically have award orincentiv
e fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily inreduced
 fees,  lower  profit  rates  or  program  cancellation  if  cost,  schedule  or  technical  performance  issues  arise.  Programs  whose  contracts  areprimarily cost-type include Ground-based Midcourse Defe
nse (GMD), Proprietary and SLS programs.We enter into contracts that include in-orbit incentive payments that subject us to r
isks.Contracts in the
 commercial satellite industry and certain government satellite contracts include in-orbit incentive payments. These in-orbit paymentsmay
 be paid over time after final satellite acceptance or paid in full prior to final satellite acceptance. In both cases, the in-orbit incentive payment isat
 risk if the satellite does not perform  to specifications  for up to 15 years after acceptance.  The net present value of in-orbit incentive fees weultimately
 expect  to  realize  is  recognized  as  revenue  in  the  construction  period.  If  the  satellite  fails  to  meet  contractual  performance  criteria,customers
 will  not  be  obligated  to  continue  making  in-orbit  payments  and/or  we  may  be  required  to  provide  refunds  to  the  customer  and  incursignificant charges.
Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Business Disruptions
Unauthorized access to our or our customers’ information and systems could negatively impact our business.
We
 face certain security threats, including threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and systems. We maintain an extensivenetwork
 of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight in order to address thesethreats.
 While  these  measures  are  designed  to  prevent,  detect  and  respond  to  unauthorized  activity  in  our  systems,  certain  types  of  attacks,including
 cyber-attacks, could result in significant financial or information losses and/or reputational harm. In addition, we manage information andinformation
 technology systems for certain customers. Many of these customers face similar security threats. If we cannot prevent the unauthorizedaccess,
 release and/or corruption of our customers’ confidential, classified or personally identifiable information, our reputation could be damaged,and/or we could face financial losses.
Business disruptions could seriously affect our future sales and financial condition or increase our costs and expenses.
Our
 business may be impacted by disruptions including threats to physical security, information technology or cyber-attacks or failures, damagingweather
 or other acts of nature and pandemics or other public health crises. Any of these disruptions could affect our internal operations or ourability
 to deliver products and services to our customers. Any significant production delays, or any destruction, manipulation or improper use of ourdata, information systems or networks could impact our sales, increase our expenses and/or have an adverse effect on the reputation of Boeing and
of our products and services.

Table of ContentsRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters
The
 outcome  of  litigation  and  of  government  inquiries  and  investigations  involving  our  business  is  unpredictable  and  an  adversedecision in any such matter could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.
We
 are involved in a number of litigation matters. These matters may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used tobenefit
 our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of any of theselawsuits,
 or future lawsuits, could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to extensiveregulation
 under  the  laws  of  the  United  States  and  its  various  states,  as  well  as  other  jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate.  As  a  result,  we  aresometimes
 subject to government inquiries and investigations of our business due, among other things, to our business relationships with the U.S.government,
 the heavily regulated nature of our industry, and in the case of environmental proceedings, our current or past ownership of certainproperty.
 Any  such  inquiry  or  investigation  could  potentially  result  in  an  adverse  ruling  against  us,  which  could  have  a  material  impact  on  ourfinancial position and results of operati
ons.Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.
We
 are subject to various U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations related to environmental protection, including the discharge,treatment,
 storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, finesand
 civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if we were to violate or become liable underenvironmental
 laws or regulations. In some cases, we may be subject to such costs due to environmental impacts attributable to our current or pastmanufacturing
 operations  or  the  operations  of  companies  we  have  acquired.  In  other  cases,  we  may  become  subject  to  such  costs  due  to  anindemnification
 agreement  between  us  and  a  third  party  relating  to  such  environmental  liabilities.  In  addition,  new  laws  and  regulations,  morestringent
 enforcement  of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new remediationrequirements
 could result in additional costs. For additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see Note 13 to our ConsolidatedFinancial Statements.
Risks Related to Financing and Liquidity
We
 may be unable to obtain debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments at competitive rates, on commercially reasonableterms or in sufficient amounts.
We
 depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments. In addition, our debt balances have increasedsignificantly
 since 2019, driven primarily by impacts related to the 737 MAX grounding and the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect to continue toactively
 manage our liquidity. Our increased debt balance has also resulted in downgrades to our credit ratings. As of December 31, 2020, our debttotaled
 $63.6  billion  of  which  approximately  $20.4  billion  of  principal  payments  on  outstanding  debt  become  due  over  the  next  three  years.  Inaddition,
 as of December 31, 2020, our airplane financing commitments totaled $11,512 million. If we require additional funding in order to pay offexisting
 debt,  address  further  impacts  to  our  business  related  to  the  737  MAX,  COVID-19,  or  broader  market  developments,  fund  outstandingfinancing
 commitments or meet other business requirements, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. These risks will be particularly acute if weare
 subject to further credit rating downgrades. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficultyaccessing
 public and private markets for debt. These factors include disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in ourfinancial performance, outlook or credit ratings, includi
ng impacts described above related to the18

Table of ContentsCOVID-19
 pandemic  and/or  associated  changes  in  demand  for  our  products  and  services.  The  occurrence  of  any  or  all  of  these  events  mayadversely affect our ability to fund our operations and contractual or fina
ncing commitments.Substantial
 pension and other postretirement benefit obligations have a material impact on our earnings, shareholders’ equity and cashflows from operations, and could have significant adverse impacts in future periods.
Many
 of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amountsrequired
 under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and discretionary contributions to improve the plans' funded status. The extent offuture
 contributions  depends  heavily  on  market  factors  such  as  the  discount  rate  and  the  actual  return  on  plan  assets.  We  estimate  futurecontributions
 to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions could have a significant effecton
 future contributions as well as on our annual pension costs and/or result in a significant change to shareholders' equity. For U.S. governmentcontracts, we allocate pension costs to individua
l contracts based on U.S. Cost Accounting Standards which can also affect contract profitability. Wealso
 provide  other  postretirement  benefits  to  certain  of  our  employees,  consisting  principally  of  health  care  coverage  for  eligible  retirees  andqualifying
 dependents. Our estimates of future costs associated with these benefits are also subject to assumptions, including estimates of the levelof
 medical  cost  increases.  For  a  discussion  regarding  how  our  financial  statements  can  be  affected  by  pension  and  other  postretirement  planaccounting
 policies, see “Management's Discussion and Analysis-Critical Accounting Policies-Pension Plans” on pages 57 - 58 of this Form 10-K.Although
 under  Generally  Accepted  Accounting  Principles  in  the  United  States  of  America  (GAAP)  the  timing  of  periodic  pension  and  otherpostretirement
 benefit expense and plan contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likelyaffect the amount of cash or stock we would contribute to our plans.
Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures.
We
 are  exposed  to  liabilities  that  are  unique  to  the  products  and  services  we  provide.  We  maintain  insurance  for  certain  risks  and,  in  somecircumstances,
 we  may  receive  indemnification  from  the  U.S.  government.  The  amount  of  our  insurance  coverage  may  not  cover  all  claims  orliabilities
 and we may be forced to bear substantial costs. For example, liabilities arising from the use of certain of our products, such as aircrafttechnologies,
 space systems, spacecraft, satellites, missile systems, weapons, cyber security, border security systems, anti-terrorism technologies,and/or
 air traffic management systems may not be insurable on commercially reasonable terms. While some of these products are shielded fromliability
 within  the  U.S.  under  the  SAFETY  Act  provisions  of  the  2002  Homeland  Security  Act,  no  such  protection  is  available  outside  the  U.S.,potentially
 resulting in significant liabilities. The amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover these or other claims orliabilities.
A
 significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in certain types of Boeing aircraft,which exposes us to concentration risks.
A
 significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in distinct geographic regions. Our portfolio isalso
 concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft, and among customers that webelieve
 have less than investment-grade credit. If one or more customers holding a significant portion of our portfolio assets experiences financialdifficulties
 or otherwise defaults on or does not renew its leases with us at their expiration, and we are unable to redeploy the aircraft on reasonableterms, or if the types of
19

Table of Contentsaircraft
 that are concentrated in our portfolio suffer greater than expected declines in value, our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position couldbe materially adversely affected.
Risks Related to Labor
Some of our and our suppliers’ workforces are represented by labor unions, which may lead to work stoppages.
Approximately 47,000 employees, which constitute 33% of
 our total workforce, were union represented as of December 31, 2020. We experienced awork
 stoppage in 2008 when a labor strike halted commercial aircraft and certain BDS program production. We may experience additional workstoppages
 in the future, which could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict how stable our relationships, currently with 10 U.S. labororganizations
 and  12  non-U.S.  labor  organizations,  will  be  or  whether  we  will  be  able  to  meet  the  unions’  requirements  without  impacting  ourfinancial
 condition.  The  unions  may  also  limit  our  flexibility  in  dealing  with  our  workforce.  Union  actions  at  suppliers  can  also  affect  us.  Workstoppages
 and instability in our union relationships could delay the production and/or development of our products, which could strain relationshipswith customers and cause a loss of revenues which wou
ld adversely affect our operations.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Overview
We are a
 global market leader in the design, development, manufacture, sale, service and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites,missile
 defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for theworldwide
 commercial  airline  industry  and  one  of  the  largest  defense  contractors  in  the  U.S.  While  our  principal  operations  are  in  the  U.S.,  weconduct operations in an expand
ing number of countries and rely on an extensive network of non-U.S. partners, key suppliers and subcontractors.Our
 strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses – Commercial Airplanes (BCA), Defense, Space & Security (BDS), andGlobal Services
 (BGS) – supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital (BCC). Taken together, these core businesses have historically generatedsubstantial
 earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services. We focus on producing the products and providing theservices that the market
 demands, and continue to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality to provide a fair return for our shareholders. BCAis committed to being the leader in commercial aviation by offering airplanes and services that deliver superior des
ign, safety, efficiency and value tocustomers
 around  the  world.  BDS  integrates  its  resources  in  defense,  intelligence,  communications,  security,  space  and  services  to  delivercapability-driven
 solutions  to  customers  at  reduced  costs.  Our  BDS  strategy  is  to  leverage  our  core  businesses  to  capture  key  next-generationprograms
 while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity. BGSprovides
 support  for  commercial  and  defense  through  innovative,  comprehensive,  and  cost-competitive  product  and  service  solutions.  BCCfacilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financin
g solutions for our Boeing customers.Business Environment and Trends
The
 global outbreak of COVID-19 and the residual impacts of the 737 MAX grounding continue to have significant adverse impacts on our businessand
 are expected to continue to negatively impact revenue, earnings and operating cash flow in future quarters. They are also having a significantimpact
 on our liquidity - see Liquidity Matters in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of liquidity and additionalactions we are taking in response to these chall
enges.The
 COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented shock to demand for air travel, creating a tremendous challenge for our customers, ourbusiness
 and  the  entire  commercial  aerospace  manufacturing  and  services  sector.  Global  economic  growth,  a  primary  driver  for  air  travel,  isexpected
 to have declined to between -4% and -5% in 2020. The latest International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecast projected full-year2020
 passenger  traffic  to  be  down  more  than  60%  compared  to  2019  as  global  economic  activity  slows  due  to  COVID-19,  and  governmentsseverely
 restricted travel to contain the spread of the virus. The recovery remains slow and uneven as travel restrictions and varying regional travelprotocols
 continue to impact air travel. Generally, we expect domestic travel to recover faster than international travel. As a result, we expect thenarrow-body
 market to recover faster than the wide-body market. Also, the pace of the commercial market recovery will be heavily dependent onCOVID-19
 infection  rates,  progress  on  testing,  government  travel  restrictions,  and  timing  and  availability  of  a  vaccine.  Air  cargo  traffic  levelscontracted
 this  year  due  to  weak  global  trade  growth  and  capacity  limitations  given  the  large  impact  that  COVID-19  has  had  on  internationalpassenger operations, which also carry cargo. Deman
d for dedicated freighters is developing better relative to cargo traffic trends.24

Table of ContentsAirline
 financial performance, which also plays a role in the demand for new capacity, has been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.According
 to IATA, net losses in 2020 for the airline industry are expected to be approximately $118 billion, compared to net profits of $26 billion in2019.
 Our customers are taking actions to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the market by preserving liquidity. This comes in manyforms
 such as deferrals of advances and other payments to suppliers, deferrals of deliveries, reduced spending on services, and, in some cases,cancellation
 of orders. We face a challenging environment in the near to medium term as airlines adjust to reduced traffic which in turn will lowerdemand for commercial aerospace products and services. The current environme
nt is also affecting the financial viability of some airlines.We
 currently expect it will take approximately three years for world-wide travel to return to 2019 levels and a few years beyond that for the industryto
 return to long-term trend growth of approximately 5%. To balance the supply and demand given the COVID-19 shock and to preserve our long-term
 potential and competitiveness, we have reduced the production rates of several of our BCA programs. These rate decisions are based on ourongoing
 assessments  of  the  demand  environment  and  availability  of  aircraft  financing.  There  is  significant  uncertainty  with  respect  to  whencommercial air traffic levels will recover, and whether, and at what point, capacity wi
ll return to and/or exceed pre-COVID-19 levels. During the fourthquarter
 of 2020, we made adjustments to our estimates regarding timing of 777X entry into service and market demand. We now anticipate that thefirst 777X delivery will occur in late 2023. We will cl
osely monitor the key factors that affect backlog and future demand including customers’ evolvingfleet plans, the wide-body replaceme
nt cycle and the cargo market. We will maintain a disciplined rate management process, and make adjustmentsas
 appropriate in the future. Notwithstanding the changes we have made to production rates, risk remains that further reductions will be required.Additionally,
 if  we  are  unable  to  make  timely  deliveries  of  the  large  number  of  aircraft  in  inventory  as  of  December  31,  2020,  future  revenues,earnings and cash flows will be a
dversely impacted.The
 long-term outlook for the industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand: economic growth, increasing propensityto
 travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. The shockfrom
 COVID-19  has  reduced  the  near  to  medium  term  demand,  but  our  Commercial  Market  Outlook  forecast  projects  a  4%  growth  rate  forpasseng
er and cargo traffic over a 20 year period. Based on long-term global economic growth projections of 2.5% average annual GDP growth, weproject
 demand  for  approximately  43,000  new  airplanes  over  the  next  20  years.  The  industry  remains  vulnerable  to  exogenous  developmentsincluding
 fuel  price  spikes,  credit  market  shocks,  acts  of  terrorism,  natural  disasters,  conflicts,  epidemics,  pandemics  and  increased  globalenvironmental regulations.
Deliveries
 of the 737 MAX resumed in the fourth quarter of 2020, when the FAA rescinded the order that grounded 737 MAX aircraft in the U.S.Orders to suspend operations of 737 MAX aircraft
 from certain non-U.S. civil aviation authorities, including the Civil Aviation Administration of China,are
 still in effect. The grounding has had a significant adverse impact on our operations and creates significant uncertainty. We are focused onsafely returning the 737 MAX to service for all of our customers.
At
 BGS, we are seeing a direct impact on our commercial supply chain business as fewer flights and more aircraft retirements result in a decreaseddemand for our parts
 and logistics offerings. Additionally, our commercial customers are curtailing discretionary spending, such as modifications andupgrades and
 focusing on required maintenance. Similar to BCA, we expect a multi-year recovery period for the commercial services business. Thedemand outlook for our government services business, whic
h in 2019 accounted for just under half of BGS revenue, remains stable.At
 BDS,  we  continue  to  see  a  healthy  market  with  solid  demand  for  our  major  platforms  and  programs  both  domestically  and  internationally.However, we experienced near-term production impacts assoc
iated with our temporary suspension of operations at various locations in 2020 .25

Table of ContentsIn
 March and April of 2020, as a result of COVID-19, we temporarily suspended operations at multiple locations including the Puget Sound area,South
 Carolina  and  Philadelphia.  Operations  in  Puget  Sound  and  Philadelphia  resumed  during  the  week  of  April  20,  while  operations  in  SouthCarolina
 resumed beginning on May 3. We have implemented procedures to promote employee safety in our facilities, including more frequent andenhanced cleaning a
nd adjusted schedules and work flows to support physical distancing. These actions have resulted, and will continue to result, inincreased
 operating costs. In addition, a number of our suppliers have suspended or otherwise reduced their operations, and we are experiencingsome
 supply chain shortages. Our suppliers are also experiencing liquidity pressures and disruptions to their operations as a result of COVID-19.We
 also continue to have large numbers of employees working from home. These measures and disruptions have reduced overall productivity andadversely impacted our financial positi
on, results of operations, and cash flows in 2020. We expect further adverse impacts in future quarters.In
 July  2020,  we  announced  our  business  transformation  efforts  to  assess  our  business  across  five  key  pillars  –  infrastructure,  overhead  andorganization,
 portfolio and investments, supply chain health and operational excellence. We continue to make progress across all five key pillars aswe
 utilize a lower production rate environment to transform and improve our business processes. Within the infrastructure pillar we are assessingour
 overall  facility  requirements  in  light  of  reduced  demand  in  our  commercial  businesses  and  remote  and  virtual  work  opportunities  for  largenumbers
 of  our  workforce.  The  consolidation  of  the  787  production  in  South  Carolina  is  an  example  of  this.  We  also  anticipate  a  reduction  ofapproximately
 30%  in  office  space  needs  compared  to  our  current  capacity.  During  2020,  we  made  certain  reductions  to  our  footprint  and  areplanning
 to  implement  further  reductions  over  the  next  few  years.  However,  as  we  consolidate  our  footprint,  we  may  incur  near  term  adverseimpacts
 to earnings.  The overhead and organization  pillar is focused  on our cost  structure  and how we are organized so we can right size ourworkforce
 and  simplify  and  reduce  management  layers  and  bureaucracy.  During  2020,  we  recorded  severance  costs  for  approximately  26,000employee
s, of which approximately 18,000 have left the Company as of December 31, 2020, and the remainder are expected to leave in 2021. Theportfolio
 and investments pillar includes aligning our portfolio and investments to focus on our core business and the changes in market conditions.Through our
 portfolio and investment prioritization, we reduced research and development and capital expenditures during 2020 by $1.3 billion fromthe
 prior year. The supply chain pillar is focused on supply chain health and stability, reducing indirect procurement spend and streamlining ourtransportation,
 logistics  and  warehousing  approach.  We  reduced  indirect  spend  in  2020,  by  reducing  expenditures  in  areas  such  as  freight  andlogistics,
 purchased services and others. The operational excellence pillar is focused on improving performance, enhancing quality and reducingrework. For
 example, our information technology teams are evaluating opportunities to form or expand strategic partnerships with vendors that allowus
 to simplify and optimize our operations, and reduce overall costs. These activities are not intended to constrain our capacity, but to enable theCompany to
 emerge stronger and be more resilient when the market recovers. We expect that successful execution of these measures will improvenear term liquidity and long term cost competitiveness.

 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to increased losses at BCA and decreased earnings atBGS
 and BDS. BCA loss from operations increased by $7,190 million. The loss in 2020 primarily reflects a reach-forward loss recorded in the fourthquarter
 of $6,493 million on the 777X program. The reach-forward loss reflects a number of factors, including an updated assessment of globalcertification
 requirements informed by continued discussions with regulators and resulting in a management decision to make modifications to theaircraft’s
 design,  an  updated  assessment  of  COVID-19  impacts  on  market  demand,  and  discussions  with  our  customers  with  respect  to  aircraftdelivery
 timing.  These  factors  resulted  in  adjustments  to  production  rates  and  the  program  accounting  quantity,  increased  change  incorporationcosts,
 and  associated  customer  and  supply  chain  impacts.  The  loss  in  2020  also  reflects  the  absence  of  MAX  deliveries  during  the  first  threequarters
 of the year, lower wide-body deliveries and lower program margins resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and 787 production issues,abnormal production costs, 737NG frame fitting component repair costs, severance costs and 73
7 MAX customer considerations.The
 loss in 2019 primarily reflects the absence of 737 MAX deliveries in the second, third and fourth quarters, and charges of $8,259 million forestimated
 737  MAX  customer  considerations.  BDS  earnings  decreased  by  $1,076  million  in  2020  compared  with  2019,  primarily  due  to  higherunfavorable
 cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, including charges of $1,320 million on KC-46A Tanker and $168 million on VC-25B in 2020,offset by $489 million of charges on Commercial Crew in 20

 earnings were also driven by lower gains on property sales compared to 2019. BGS earnings from operations decreased by $2,247 million in2020 compared with
 2019 primarily due to lower commercial services revenue, as well as asset impairments and severance costs resulting from theCOVID-19
 market  environment.  We  expect  the  impacts  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  to  continue  to  reduce  earnings  in  future  quarters  until  thecommercial airline industry recovers.
Loss
 from  operations  was $1,975 million in 2019 compared  with earnings from  operations  of $11,987 million in 2018. The decrease  of $13,962million
 is primarily due to a loss from operations at BCA of $6,657 million in 2019 compared to earnings from operations of $7,830 million in 2018,partially
 offset  by  higher  earnings  at  BDS  and  BGS  in  2019  compared  with  2018.  BCA  results  decreased  by  $14,487  million  due  to  lower  737deliveries
 and the earnings charges for estimated 737 MAX grounding customer considerations of $8,259 million, net of insurance recoveries. BDSearnings
 from  operations  increased  by  $923  million  primarily  due  to  lower  charges  in  2019  for  development  programs.  BGS  earnings  fromoperations increased by $161 mill
ion primarily due to higher revenues, which was partially offset by less favorable performance and mix.During
 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recorded reach-forward losses on the KC-46A Tanker program of $1,320 million, $148 million, and $736 million,respectively.
Core operating loss increased by $10,760 million in 2020 compared with
 2019 primarily due to higher losses at BCA and lower earnings at BGS andBDS.

Cost
 of sales, for both products and services, consists primarily of raw materials, parts, sub-assemblies, labor, overhead and subcontracting costs.Our
 BCA  segment  predominantly  uses  program  accounting  to  account  for  cost  of  sales.  Under  program  accounting,  cost  of  sales  for  eachcommercial airplan
e program equals the product of (i) revenue recognized in connection with customer deliveries and (ii) the estimated cost of salespercentage
 applicable  to  the  total  remaining  program.  For  long-term  contracts,  the  amount  reported  as  cost  of  sales  is  recognized  as  incurred.Substantially
 all contracts at our BDS segment and certain contracts at our BGS segment are long-term contracts with the U.S. government andother customers that generally extend over several years. Cost of sales for commercial spare parts is recorded at average cost.

 backlog of unfilled orders  excludes purchase  options,  announced orders  for  which definitive  contracts  have not been executed,  andunobligated
 U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The decrease in contractual backlog during 2020 was primarily due to a reduction fororders
 that in our assessment no longer meet the accounting requirements of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606 for inclusion in backlogprimarily
 due to 737 MAX and 777X, deliveries in excess of new orders, aircraft order cancellations and changes in projected price escalation. Weare
 experiencing  fewer  new  737  MAX  orders  than  we  were  receiving  prior  to  the  grounding.  If  737  MAX  aircraft  remain  grounded  in  certainjurisdictions
 for an extended period of time and/or if entry into service of the 777X, 737 MAX 7 and/or 737 MAX 10 is further delayed, we mayexperience additional red
uctions to backlog and/or significant order cancellations. Additionally, we may continue to experience fewer new orders andincreased cancellations across al
l of our commercial airplane programs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated impacts on demand.Unobligated
 backlog  includes  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  government  definitive  contracts  for  which  funding  has  not  been  authorized.  The  decrease  inunobligated
 backlog  in  2020  was  primarily  due  to  reclassifications  to  contractual  backlog  related  to  BGS  and  BDS  contracts,  partially  offset  bycontract awards.

Table of ContentsAdditional Considerations
Global Trade 
We continually monitor the global trade environment in response to geopolitical econom ic developments, as well as changes in tariffs,trade agreements, or sanctions that may impact the company.
The
 global economy is currently experiencing significant adverse impacts due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including a decline in overall trade ingeneral
 and in aerospace in particular. There is a great deal of uncertainty regarding the duration, scale, and localization of these impacts to theglobal
 economy and governments are enacting a wide range of responses to mitigate the unfolding economic impacts. We are closely monitoringthe
 current  impact  and  potential  future  economic  consequences  of  COVID-19  to  the  global  economy,  the  aerospace  sector,  and  our  Company.These adverse economic impacts have resulted in few
er orders than previously anticipated for our commercial aircraft.China
 is  a  very  significant  market  for  commercial  airplanes  and  represents  a  significant  component  of  our  commercial  airplanes  backlog. Since2018,
 the  U.S.  and  China  imposed  an  escalating  series  of  tariffs  on  each  other’s  imports.  Certain  aircraft  parts  and  components  that  Boeingprocures
 are  subject  to  these  tariffs.  The  U.S.  and  China  entered  into  a  Phase  I  agreement  in  January  2020.  However,  implementation  of  thisagreement
 is incomplete and overall diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China have deteriorated. We continue monitoring developments forpotential adverse impacts to the Company.
Beginning
 in June 2018, the U.S. Government has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. In response to these tariffs, several major U.S.trading
 partners  have  imposed,  or  announced  their  intention  to  impose,  tariffs  on  U.S.  goods.  In  May  2019,  the  U.S.  Government,  Mexico  andCanada
 reached an agreement to end the steel and aluminum tariffs  between these countries.  Implementation  of the U.S./Mexico/Canada  FreeTrade
 Agreement  (USMCA)  will  also  result  in  lower  tariffs.  We  continue  to  monitor  the  potential  for  any  extra  costs  that  may  result  from  theremaining global tariffs.
The
 U.S.  Government  continues  to  impose  and/or  consider  imposing  sanctions  on  certain  businesses  and  individuals  in  Russia.  Although  ouroperations
 or  sales  in  Russia  have  not  been  impacted  to  date,  we  continue  to  monitor  additional  sanctions  that  may  be  imposed  by  the  U.S.Government and any responses from Russia that could affect our supply chain, bus
iness partners or customers.The
 U.S. and European Union (EU) have been engaged in two long-running disputes at the World Trade Organization (WTO) relating to large civilaircraft.
 As part  of  those disputes,  in October  2019,  the  WTO  authorized  the U.S.  to  impose approximately  $7.50  billion in annual tariffs  on EUproducts in connecti
on with the EU’s provision of eight instances of launch aid subsidies to Airbus. The U.S. is currently imposing 15% tariffs on newAirbus airplanes imported into the U.S. as well as fusel
ages that Airbus manufactures in Europe and imports into the U.S. In October 2020, the WTOauthorized
 the EU to impose approximately  $3.99 billion in annual tariffs  on U.S. products  in connection with a tax incentive used by Boeing inWashingto
n state that has since been repealed. The EU is currently imposing 15% tariffs on Boeing airplanes imported into the EU. We will continueto
 assess and work with our customers on the possible impact of these tariffs, as deliveries to European customers are expected to increase in2021.

 Industry  Environment See  Overview to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  for adiscussion of the impacts of COVID-19 on the airline industry enviro
nment.Industry Competitiveness
 The  industry continues to adjust to the unprecedented COVID-19 shock and subsequent economic impact, governmentrestrictions, and new regulatio
ns. The commercial airplane market and the airline industry both remain extremely competitive. While the impacts andresponses
 have  varied  globally,  the  reduction  of  demand  and  disruption  in  production  has  adversely  impacted  most  manufacturers  in  thecommercial airplane industry.
Continued
 access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately80% of Commercial Airplanes’ total backlog, in d
ollar terms, is with non-U.S. airlines. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent onincreasing
 their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. The grounding of the737
 MAX and the associated  suspension of 737 MAX deliveries  significantly  reduced our market  share with respect  to deliveries  of single aisleaircraft
 in 2019 and 2020 and may provide competitors  with an opportunity to obtain more orders and increase market share. With governmentsupport,
 Airbus has historically  invested  heavily  to  create  a family  of products  to compete  with  ours.  After  the  acquisition  of  a majority  share  ofBombardier’s
 C Series (now A220) in 2018, Airbus continues to expand in the 100-150 seat transcontinental market. Other competitors are also indifferent phases
 of developing commercial jet aircraft. Some of these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government-provided financialsupport,
 including  “launch  aid,”  which  greatly  reduces  the  cost  and  commercial  risks  associated  with  airplane  development  activities.  This  hasenabled
 the development of airplanes without broad commercial viability; others to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible; andmany
 offered for sale below market-based prices. Competitors continue to make improvements in efficiency, which may result in funding productdevelopment,
 gaining  market  share  and  improving  earnings.  This  market  environment  has  resulted  in  intense  pressures  on  pricing  and  othercompetitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming ye
ars.We
 are focused on improving our products and services and continuing our business transformation efforts, which enhances our ability to competeand
 positions  us  for  market  recovery.  We  are  also  focused  on  taking  actions  to  ensure  that  Boeing  is  not  harmed  by  unfair  subsidization  ofcompetitors.

 cost, $498 million of 737 MAX customer considerations, $336 million related to 737NG frame fitting component repair costs and $270million
 of abnormal production costs in the first half of 2020 from the temporary suspension of operations in response to COVID-19, partially offsetby
 lower research and development spending. Lower 787 margins reflecting a reduction in the accounting quantity in the first quarter of 2020 alsocontributed
 to lower earnings. The 2019 loss primarily reflects the absence of 737 MAX deliveries in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2019and charges of $8,259 million for estimated 737 MAX customer consi
derations.BCA
 loss from operations was $6,657 million in 2019 compared with earnings from operations of $7,830 million in 2018. The decrease of $14,487million is primarily due to lower 737 del
iveries and earnings charges related to the 737 MAX.The
 737 MAX grounding and the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have a significant adverse impact on future earnings and margins until 737MAX deliveries ramp up and wide-body d
eliveries return to historical levels.Backlog
Our
 total backlog represents the estimated transaction prices on unsatisfied and partially satisfied performance obligations to our customers wherewe
 believe it is probable that we will collect the consideration due and where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required toperform.
 Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customer receiving approvalfrom
 its board of directors, shareholders or government or completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or haveexpired
 prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Backlog excludes options and BCC orders. A numberof our customers may
 have contractual remedies, including rights to reject individual airplane deliveries if the actual delivery date is significantly laterthan
 the  contractual  delivery  date.  We  address  customer  claims  and  requests  for  other  contractual  relief  as  they  arise.  The  value  of  orders  inbacklog
 is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers and is reported in accordance with the requirements of Topic606.
BCA
 total backlog of $281,588 million at December 31, 2020 decreased from $376,593 million at December 31, 2019, reflecting a reduction fororders that in our assessment no longer meet
 the accounting requirements of ASC 606 for inclusion in backlog, aircraft order cancellations, changesin
 projected price escalation and deliveries in excess of new orders. Aircraft order cancellations during the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled$34,618
 million and primarily relate to 737 MAX aircraft. The ASC 606 adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $54,450 millionand
 primarily  relate  to  737  MAX  aircraft  and  777X  aircraft.  The  ASC  606  adjustments  include  aircraft  orders  where  a  customer  controlledcontingency
 now exists, as well as orders where we can no longer assert that the customer is committed to perform or that it is probable that thecustomer
 will pay the full amount of consideration when it is due. If 737 MAX aircraft remain grounded in certain jurisdictions for an extended periodof
 time  and/or  if  entry  into  service  of  the  777X,  737  MAX  7 and/or  737  MAX  10 is  further  delayed,  we  may  experience  additional  reductions  tobacklog
 and/or significant order cancellations. Additionally, we may continue to experience fewer new orders and increased cancellations across allof our commercial airplane programs as a result the COVID-19 pandemic and ass
ociated impacts on demand.Accounting
 Quantity The  accounting  quantity  is  our  estimate  of  the  quantity  of  airplanes  that  will  be  produced  for  delivery  under  existing  andanticipated
 contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenueand cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize o
n sales of individual airplanes throughout aprogram’s
 life.  Estimation  of  each  program’s  accounting  quantity  takes  into  account  several  factors  that  are  indicative  of  the  demand  for  thatprogram, including firm orders,
36

Table of Contentsletters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly.
The
 accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to beunder
 contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantitymust be considered.
The
 following table provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of December 31. Cumulative firm orders representthe
 cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders. Firm orders include military derivative aircraft that are notincluded
 in program accounting quantities. All revenues and costs associated with military derivative aircraft production are reported in the BDSsegment.

737 Program
 We  reduced the program accounting quantity from 10,400 at December 31, 2019 to 10,000 at March 31, 2020. This reflects a slowerthan
 previously  planned production  rate  ramp-up  caused  by commercial  airline  industry  uncertainty  due to the  impact  of  COVID-19.  See furtherdiscussion of the 737 MAX Grounding and COVID-1
9 Impacts and Product Warranties in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 747 Program
 We  are currently producing at a rate of 0.5 aircraft per month. We will complete production of the 747 in 2022. We believe that endingproduction of the 747 will not have a material impact on o
ur financial position, results of operations or cash flows.767
 Program The  accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 12 units during 2020 due to the program's normal progress of obtainingadditional
 orders and delivering airplanes. The 767 assembly line includes the commercial program and a derivative to support the tanker program.We are currently producing at a rate of 3 aircraft per month.
37

Table of Contents777
 and 777X Programs The  accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 10 units during 2020 due to the program’s normal progress ofobtaining
 additional orders and delivering airplanes. The production rate expectation for the combined 777/777X program remains at 2 per month in2021.
In
 2013, we launched the 777X-8 and 777X-9, which feature new composite wings, new engines and folding wing-tips. The first flight of the 777Xwas completed during the first quarter of 2020.
During
 the first three quarters of 2020, we made adjustments to our estimates regarding timing of 777X entry into service and market demand. Aspreviously
 disclosed,  market  uncertainties  driven  primarily  by  the  impacts  of  COVID-19  resulted  in  lower  planned  production  rates  and  createdsignificant
 pressure on the 777X program’s revenue and cost estimates. While the 777X program did not have a reach-forward loss as of the thirdquarter
 of 2020 based on our assessment of the probable range of initial accounting quantities and other factors at that time, we noted that futurelevels
 of  777X  profitability  would  be  subject  to  a  number  of  factors,  including  continued  market  uncertainty,  the  impacts  of  COVID-19  on  ourproduction
 system  as  well  as  on  our  supply  chain  and  customers,  subsequent  production  rate  reductions  for  both  777X  and  other  commercialprograms, and potential risks associated with the testing program and the timin
g of 777X certification.We
 now anticipate that the first 777X delivery will occur in late 2023. We also recorded a $6.5 billion reach-forward loss on the 777X program in thefourth
 quarter of 2020. The revised schedule and the reach-forward loss reflect a number of factors, including an updated assessment of globalcertification
 requirements informed by continued discussions with regulators and resulting in a management decision to make modifications to theaircraft’s
 design,  an  updated  assessment  of  COVID-19  impacts  on  market  demand,  and  discussions  with  our  customers  with  respect  to  aircraftdelivery
 timing.  These  factors  resulted  in  adjustments  to  production  rates  and  the  program  accounting  quantity,  increased  change  incorporationcosts, and associated customer and supply chain impacts.
The
 timing  of  the  certification  will  ultimately  be  determined  by  the  regulators,  and  further  determinations  with  respect  to  anticipated  certificationrequirements could result in additiona
l delays in entry into service and/or additional cost increases.The level of
 profitability on the 777X program will be subject to a number of factors. These factors include continued market uncertainty, the impactsof
 COVID-19 on our production system as well as impacts on our supply chain and customers, further production rate adjustments for the 777X orother
 commercial aircraft programs, contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risks associated with the testing program and the timing ofaircraft certification. One or more of these factors could result in additional reach-forward losses on the 777
X program in future periods.787
 Program During  2020,  we  experienced  significant  reductions  in  deliveries  due  to  the  impacts  of  COVID-19  on  our  customers  as  well  asproduction
 issues and associated rework. The 787 program delivered four airplanes during the fourth quarter of 2020 and has a large number ofundelivered
 airplanes in inventory at December 31, 2020. We expanded the scope of production inspections during the fourth quarter of 2020, andthose
 inspections and associated rework are delaying scheduled deliveries and resulting in additional 787 aircraft in inventory. At December 31,2020,
 we had approximately  80 787 aircraft  in inventory.  We expect  deliveries  to  resume  at a slow pace in early 2021, with the majority  of theaircraft
 in inventory expected to be delivered by the end of 2021. We continue to work with customers to facilitate deliveries. We are implementingchanges
 in the production process designed to ensure that newly-built airplanes meet our specifications and do not require further inspections. Pre-COVID-19,
 we were producing at a rate of 14 per month and had planned to adjust the 787 production rate to 12 per month in late 2020 and to 10per
 month in early 2021. Due to the impacts of COVID-19 on customer demand, we now plan to reduce to 5 per month in 2021. As a result of theplanned
 production rate changes, we reduced the accounting quantity for the 787 program by 100 units during the first quarter of 2020. The 787program has near breakeven gross margins due to the
38

Table of Contentsreductions
 in the production rates and the reduction in the program accounting quantity. If we are required to further reduce the accounting quantityand/or
 production rates, experience further delivery delays, or experience other factors that could result in lower margins, the program could recorda
 reach-forward loss in future periods. We made the decision during the third quarter of 2020 to consolidate 787 production in South Carolina in2021, which did not have a signific
ant financial impact on the program.Fleet Support
 We  provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation.Collecti
vely known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational lifeof
 the  airplane.  They  include  flight  and  maintenance  training,  field  service  support,  engineering  services,  information  services  and  systems  andtechnical
 data  and  documents.  The  costs  for  fleet  support  are  expensed  as  incurred  and  have  historically  been  approximately  1%  of  totalconsolidated costs of products and services.

We
 launched the 737 MAX 7 in August 2011 and the 737 MAX 10 in June 2017. We launched the 777X in November 2013. We now anticipate thatthe
 first 737 MAX 10 and 777X delivery will occur in 2023. This schedule reflects a number of factors, including an updated assessment of globalcertification
 requirements informed by continued discussions with regulators and resulting in a management decision to make modifications to theaircraft’s design.
Additional Considerations
The
 development  and  ongoing  production  of  commercial  aircraft  is  extremely  complex,  involving  extensive  coordination  and  integration  withsuppliers
 and highly-skilled labor from employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well asthose
 of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, suchas the 777X and
 737 MAX derivatives, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. Thesechallenges
 include increased global regulatory scrutiny of all development aircraft in the wake of the 737 MAX accidents. As a result, our ability todeliver
 aircraft  on  time,  satisfy  performance  and  reliability  standards  and  achieve  or  maintain,  as  applicable,  program  profitability  is  subject  tosignificant
 risks. Factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or is determined to have reach-forwardlosses)
 include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to priceescalation
 factors due to changes in the inflation rate or other economic indicators, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft,capital
 expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation,achieving
 anticipated cost reductions, the addition of regulatory requirements in connection with certification in one or more jurisdictions, flight testand
 certification  schedules,  costs,  schedule  and  demand  for  new  airplanes  and  derivatives  and  status  of  customer  claims,  supplier  claims  orassertions
 and  other  contractual  negotiations.  While  we  believe  the  cost  and  revenue  estimates  incorporated  in  the  consolidated  financialstatements are appropriate, the technical complexity of our airplane pro
grams creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become39

 or  scheduled  delivery  dates  could  be  extended,  which  could  trigger  termination  provisions,  order  cancellations  or  other  financiallysignificant exposure.
Defense, Space & Security
Business Environment and Trends
United States Government Defense Environment Overview
The
 Omnibus appropriations acts for FY21, enacted in December 2020, provided FY21 appropriations for government departments and agencies,including the United States Dep
artment of Defense (U.S. DoD), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Federal AviationAdministration.
The
 enacted FY21 appropriations included funding for Boeing’s major programs, such as the F/A-18 Super Hornet, F-15EX, CH-47 Chinook, AH-64Apache,
 V-22 Osprey, KC-46A Tanker, P-8 Poseidon and Space Launch System. However, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to futureprogram-level
 appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other government agencies, including NASA. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes,including
 changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process, could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existingcontracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial positi
on and/or cash flows.Non-U.S. Defense
 Environment Overview The non-U.S.  market continues to be driven by complex and evolving security challenges and the needto
 modernize aging equipment and inventories. BDS expects that it will continue to have a wide range of opportunities across Asia, Europe and theMiddle East given the diverse regiona

BDS
 revenues in 2020 increased by $162 million compared with 2019 reflecting higher revenues from fighter aircraft, Space Launch System, B-52upgrades,
 proprietary and MQ-25, partially offset by reduced volume in missile defense. These net increases were offset by the unfavorable impactof
 cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which was $312 million higher than the comparable period in the prior year, largely due to the KC-46ATanker charges during 2020.
BDS
 revenues in 2019 decreased by $205 million compared with 2018 primarily due to timing associated with non-U.S. contract awards for fightersand
 the final C-17 sale occurring in 2018; in addition, the unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments was $163 million higherthan
 the prior year, reflecting increased unfavorable adjustments on the Commercial Crew contract and less favorable performance. These werepartially offset by increases from new programs, includin
g E-7 early warning aircraft, VC-25B, T-7A Red Hawk, and MQ-25, as well as from satellitesand weapons.
Earnings From Operations
BDS
 earnings  from  operations  in  2020  decreased  by  $1,076  million  compared  with  2019  primarily  due  to  the  unfavorable  impact  of  cumulativecontract
 catch-up adjustments, which was $828 million higher than the prior year, largely due to charges of $1,320 million on KC-46A Tanker and$168
 million on VC-25B, offset by $489 million in charges on Commercial Crew in the prior period. The lower earnings in 2020 also reflect lowergains
 on  property  sales  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2019.  These  current  period  decreases  were  partially  offset  by  the  volume  increasesdescribed above.
The
 KC-46A Tanker reach-forward loss of $1,320 million reflects $551 million of costs associated with the agreement signed in April 2020 with theU.S.
 Air Force to develop and integrate a new Remote Vision System, and the remaining costs reflect production inefficiencies including impacts ofCOVID-19 disruption. The $168 million reac
h-forward loss on VC-25B recorded in the first quarter was associated41

 engineering  inefficiencies  from  the  COVID-19  environment.  We  believe  these  inefficiencies  will  result  in  staffing  challenges,  scheduleinefficiencies, and higher costs in the upcomi
ng phases of the program.BDS
 earnings from operations in 2019 increased by $923 million compared with 2018 primarily due to the absence of $691 million related to losseson
 the T-7A Red Hawk and MQ-25 contracts. The unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2019 was $62 million lowerthan
 the  prior  year.  In  2019,  BDS  recorded  charges  of  $489  million  related  to  Commercial  Crew  and  $148  million  related  to  KC-46A  Tankercompared with $736 
million in 2018.BDS

Total
 backlog of $60,847 million at December 31, 2020 was $2,844 million lower than December 31, 2019 due to the timing of awards and revenuerecognized.
Additional Considerations
Our BDS
 business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs havecost-type
 contracting  arrangements.  In  these  cases,  the  associated  financial  risks  are  primarily  in  reduced  fees,  lower  profit  rates  or  programcancellation
 if  cost,  schedule  or  technical  performance  issues  arise.  Examples  of  these  programs  include  Ground-based  Midcourse  Defense,Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.
Some
 of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis, and BDS customers are increasingly seeking fixed-price proposals fornew
 programs. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, MQ-25, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-25B, and
 commercial and military satellites. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period ofcontract
 performance. Many development programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we mayexperience
 schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either ofwhich
 could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe thecost
 and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk asadditional
 completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, theloss
 of  satellite  in-orbit  incentive  payments,  or  other  financially  significant  exposure.  These  programs  have  risk  for  reach-forward  losses  if  ourestimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues.
Global Services
Business Environment and Trends
The aerospace markets we serve include parts distribution, lo
gistics, and other inventory services; maintenance, engineering, and upgrades; trainingand professional services; and
 information services. Prior to COVID-19, we had expected the market to grow by around 3.5% annually, however thepandemic
 is having a direct impact on our commercial services business. See Overview to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of FinancialCondition and Results of Operations for a discussi
on of the impacts of COVID-19 on the airline industry environment.Over
 the long-term, as the size of the worldwide commercial airline fleet continues to grow, so does demand for aftermarket services designed toincrease efficiency and extend the economic l

 Airlines are using data analytics to plan flight operations and predictive maintenance to improve their productivity and efficiency. Airlinescontinue
 to  look for  opportunities  to  reduce  the  size  and  cost  of  their  spare  parts  inventory,  frequently  outsourcing  spares  management  to  thirdparties.
The
 demand outlook for our government services business has remained stable in 2020. Government services market segments are growing onpace with related fleets, but vary based on the utilization and age of the aircraft. The U.S. government services market is the
 single largest individualmarket,
 comprising over 50 percent of the government services markets served. Over the next decade, we expect U.S. growth to remain flat andnon-U.S.
 fleets, led by Middle East and Asia Pacific customers, to add rotorcraft and commercial derivative aircraft at the fastest rates. We expectless
 than  20  percent  of  the  worldwide  fleet  of  military  aircraft  to  be  retired  and  replaced  over  the  next  ten  years,  driving  increased  demand  forservices to maintain aging aircraft and enhance a
ircraft capability.BGS’

 total  backlog  of  $20,632 million  at  December  31,  2020 decreased  by 10% from  $22,902  million at  December  31, 2019,  primarily  due to  areduction for commercial orders that, in our assessment, no longer meet the accounting requirements of ASC 6

Business Environment and Trends
BCC’s
 gross customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2020 totaled $1,974 million. A substantial portion of BCC’s portfolio isrelated to
 customers that we believe have less than investment-grade credit. BCC’s portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeingaircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft.
BCC
 provided customer financing of $14 million and $419 million during 2020 and 2019. While we may be required to fund a number of new aircraftdeliveries
 in 2021 and/or provide refinancing for existing bridge debt, we expect alternative financing will be available at reasonable prices frombroad and globally diverse
 sources.Aircraft
 values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 7,300 western-builtcommercial
 jet  aircraft  (29.4%  of  current  world  fleet)  were  parked  at  the  end of  2020,  including both  in-production  and out-of-production  aircrafttypes.
 Of  these  parked  aircraft,  a  larger  portion  are  expected  to  be  retired  compared  to  the  pre-COVID-19  period,  which  directly  impacts  theCompany
 in  terms  of  number  of  new  aircraft  deliveries  and  financing  opportunities,  the  ability  of  existing  customers  to  meet  current  paymentobligat
ions and the value of aircraft in its portfolio. We continue to work closely with our customers to mitigate the risk. At the end of 2019 and 2018,8.5%
 and 6.7% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft,particularly
 types  with  relatively  few  operators,  are  placed  out  of  service.  See  Overview  to  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  FinancialCondition and Results of Operations for a discussi
on of the impacts of COVID-19 on the airline industry environment.44

 segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease, interest income from financing receivables andnotes,
 and other income. BCC’s revenues in 2020 increased by $17 million compared with 2019 primarily due to gains on re-lease of assets. BCC’srevenues in 2019 decreased by $3

BCC’s
 earnings from operations are presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses, asset impairment expense, depreciationon leased equipment and other operatin

 Activities Net  cash used by operating activities was $18.4 billion during 2020, compared with net cash used by operating activities of$2.4
 billion  during  2019  and  net  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  of  $15.3  billion  in  2018.  The  decrease  in  operating  cash  flows  in  2020  isprimarily driven by
 our net loss in 2020 and changes in working capital, partially offset by an increase in non-cash items. Non-cash items include the$6.5
 billion reach-forward loss on the 777X program in 2020, which was recorded as a reduction to inventory. The year-over-year increase in non-cash
 items also reflects higher inventory write-downs and higher allowances for expected credit losses in 2020. The changes in working capitalreflect increases in commercial airplane inventory du
e to the large number of undelivered aircraft in 2019 resulting from the 737 MAX grounding, andin
 2020  due  to  the  737  MAX  grounding,  787  production  issues  and  COVID-19  impacts.  Cash  used  by  Advances  and  progress  billings  was$1.1
 billion in 2020, as compared with $0.7 billion provided by Advances and progress billings in 2019. The changes in working capital in 2020 alsoreflect lower accounts payable due to reductions i
n commercial purchases from suppliers and lower supply chain financing. Compensation paymentsto
 737 MAX customers totaled $2.2 billion during 2020 and $1.2 billion during 2019. The accrued liability for 737 MAX customer considerations atDecember 31, 2019 resulted in a
 $7.4 billion favorable change to working capital in 2019. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the 737 MAXgrounding are expected to continue to hav
e a significant negative impact on our operating cash flows during 2021.The
 decrease  in  operating  cash  flows  in  2019  compared  to  2018  primarily  reflected  the  impacts  of  the  737  MAX  grounding  resulting  in  lowerearnings,
 higher inventory and lower advances and progress payments. In addition, compensation payments to 737 MAX customers of $1.2 billionfor
 disruption to their operations also reduced 2019 cash from operating activities. Cash used to fund inventory was $12.4 billion during 2019 as wecontinue
d to produce aircraft while deliveries were suspended. Cash provided by Advances and progress billings was $0.7 billion in 2019, comparedwith $2.6 billion in 2018.
Payables
 to suppliers who elected to participate in supply chain financing programs declined by $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020,and increased by $2.6 billio
n and $0.6 billion for the same period in 2019 and 2018. Supply chain financing is not material to our overall liquidity. Thedecline
 for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to reductions in commercial purchases from suppliers. The increase for the yearsended
 December  31,  2019  and  2018  reflects  a  combination  of  higher  purchases,  an  extension  of  payment  terms  with  certain  suppliers,  andincreased utilization of our supply cha
in financing programs.46

Table of ContentsInvesting Activities
 Cash  used by investing activities during 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $18.4 billion, $1.5 billion and $4.6 billion. The increase incash outflows in
 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily due to $17.4 billion of higher net contributions to investments. The reduction in cash outflows in2019
 compared with 2018 is primarily due to acquisitions completed in the second half of 2018 and the timing of investments. Acquisitions net ofcash acquired were
 $0.5 billion in 2019, primarily related to the acquisition of KLX. Proceeds from dispositions was $0.5 billion in 2019 as a result ofthe
 divestiture of two businesses. Capital expenditures totaled $1.3 billion in 2020, compared with $1.8 billion in 2019 and $1.7 billion 2018. Weexpect capital
 expenditures in 2021 to be relatively consistent with 2020. Net contributions to investments were $17.3 billion in 2020, compared withnet proceeds from investments of $0.1 billion in 2019 an
d $0.3 billion in 2018.Financing
 Activities Cash  provided by financing activities was $35.0 billion during 2020, compared with cash provided by financing activities of$5.7
 billion in 2019 and cash used by financing activities of $11.7 billion in 2018. The increase of $29.3 billion compared with 2019 primarily reflectshigher
 net  borrowings,  lower  share  repurchases,  and  lower  dividend  payments.  Cash  provided  by  financing  activities  increased  $17.5  billioncompared
 with  2018  primarily  due  to  higher  net  borrowings  and  lower  share  repurchases,  partially  offset  by  higher  dividend  payments  in  2019.During
 the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, new borrowings net of repayments were $36.3 billion compared with $13.2 billion and $1.4billio
n in the same period in 2019 and 2018. The increase in 2020 is primarily due to $29.9 billion of fixed rate senior notes issued in 2020 and $13.8billion
 of new borrowings under a two-year delayed draw term loan agreement entered into in the first quarter of 2020. For further discussion seeLiquidity Matters in Note 1 to our Consolidated Fin
ancial Statements.At
 December  31,  2020  and  2019  the  recorded  balance  of  debt  was  $63.6  billion  and  $27.3  billion,  of  which  $1.7  billion  and  $7.3  billion  wereclassified
 as short-term. This included $1.6 billion and $2.0 billion of debt attributable to BCC at December 31, 2020 and 2019, of which $0.9 billionand $0.5 billion were classifi
ed as short-term.During
 the year ended December 31, 2020, we did not repurchase any shares through our open market share repurchase program compared torepurchases
 of 6.9 million and 26.1 million shares in 2019 and 2018 totaling $2.7 billion and $9.0 billion. Share repurchases under this plan hadbeen
 suspended since April 2019. In March 2020, the Board of Directors terminated its prior authorization to repurchase shares of the Company'soutstanding
 common stock. We had 0.6 million, 0.6 million, and 0.7 million shares transferred to us from employee tax withholdings in 2020, 2019,and
 2018, respectively. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 we paid dividends of $1.2 billion compared with $4.6 billion and $3.9billion
 in the same period in 2019 and 2018. In March 2020, the Company announced that our dividend will be suspended until further notice. InDecember
 2018  we  increased  our  quarterly  dividend  from  $1.71  to  $2.055,  which  resulted  in  $684  million  of  higher  dividend  payments  in  2019compared with 2018.
Capital Resources
 The  impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and 737 MAX grounding are having a significant negative impact on our liquidity andongoing operations
 and creating significant uncertainty. We have and are continuing to take significant actions to manage and preserve our liquidity.For further discussion see Liquidity Matters in Note 1 to our Consolid
ated Financial Statements.At December 31, 2020, we had $7.8 billion of cash and $17.8 billion of short term investments. At December 31, 2020, we had $9.5 billio
n of unusedborrowing
 capacity on revolving credit line agreements. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support ourgeneral
 corporate  borrowing  needs.  The  $9.5  billion  of  unused  borrowing  capacity  includes  a  $3.1  billion  364-day  revolving  credit  facility,  whichexpires in
 October 2021. We had no commercial paper borrowings at December 31, 2020, compared to commercial paper borrowings of $6.1 billionand $1.9 billion at December 31, 201
9 and 2018, which were supported by unused commitments under the revolving credit agreement.47

Table of ContentsOur debt balances have
 increased significantly since 2019, and we are continuing to actively manage our liquidity. Scheduled principal payments fordebt for the next five years are as follows:
2021
2022 2023 2024 2025 Debt
$1,630 $14,976 $3,776 $2,001 $4,301 Our
 increased debt balance has also resulted in downgrades to our credit ratings. We expect to be able to access capital markets when we requireadditional
 funding  in  order  to  pay  off  existing  debt,  address  further  impacts  to  our  business  related  to  market  developments,  fund  outstandingfinancing
 commitments, or meet other business requirements. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to havegreater
 difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or adecline
 in  our  financial  performance,  outlook  or  credit  ratings,  including  impacts  described  above  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and/orassociated
 changes  in  demand  for  our  products  and  services.  These  risks  will  be  particularly  acute  if  we  are  subject  to  further  credit  ratingdowngrades.
 The  occurrence  of  any  or  all  of  these  events  may  adversely  affect  our  ability  to  fund  our  operations  and  financing  or  contractualcommitments.
Any
 future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants. At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance withthe
 covenants  for  our  debt  and  credit  facilities.  The  most  restrictive  covenants  include  a  limitation  on  mortgage  debt  and  sale  and  leasebacktransactions
 as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as apercentage of total capital (as defined). When consideri
ng debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity.Customer financing commitments totaled
 $11.5 billion and $13.4 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The decrease primarily relates to financingcommitment
 amendments and expirations. We anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments aswe
 continue  to  work  with  third  party  financiers  to  provide  alternative  financing  to  customers.  Historically,  we  have  not  been  required  to  fundsignificant
 amounts of outstanding commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts thanhistorically required.
At
 December 31, 2020 and 2019, our pension plans were $13.7 billion and $15.9 billion underfunded as measured under GAAP. On an EmployeeRetirement
 Income Security Act (ERISA) basis our plans are more than 100% funded at December 31, 2020. We do not expect to make significantcontributions to our pension plans in 2
021. We may be required to make higher contributions to our pension plans in future years.In
 the fourth quarter of 2020, we contributed $3 billion of our common stock to our pension fund. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we also began usingour
 common stock in lieu of cash to fund Company contributions to our 401(k) plans for the foreseeable future, which we estimate will conserveapproximately
 $1 billion of cash over the next 12 months. Under this approach, common stock is contributed to our 401(k) plans following each payperiod.
 We  expect  this  measure  to  further  enable  the  Company  to  conserve  cash.  We  have  retained  an  independent  fiduciary  to  manage  andliquidate stock contributed to these plans at its discretion.

 Obligations Purchase  obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify afixed,
 minimum  or  range  of  quantities;  specify  a  fixed,  minimum,  variable,  or  indexed  price  provision;  and  specify  approximate  timing  of  thetransaction.

Purchase
 Obligations  Not  Recorded  on  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Financial  Position Purchase  obligations  not  recorded  on  theConsolidated
 Statements of Financial Position include agreements for inventory procurement, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts,property,
 plant  and  equipment,  customer  financing  equipment,  and  other  miscellaneous  production  related  obligations.  The  most  significantobligation
 relates  to  inventory  procurement  contracts.  We  have  entered  into  certain  significant  inventory  procurement  contracts  that  specifydeterminable
 prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. Theseagreements require suppliers and vend
ors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need forsuch
 arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portionof
 these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customersfor
 penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for programand
 contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included ourbest estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the tabl

Industrial Participation Agreements
 We have  entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. tofacilitate
 economic flow back and/or technology or skills transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement ofgoods
 and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our local operations there, placement of direct work or vendor orders forsupplies,
 opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitmentsmay
 be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. In certain cases, penalties couldbe
 imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2020, we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2020, wehave
 outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $26.4 billion that extend through 2034. Purchase order commitments associated withindustrial
 participation agreements are included in purchase obligations in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitmentfrom us, a non-U.S. supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, qual

Table of ContentsOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We
 are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 14 to ourConsolidated Financial State
ments.Non-GAAP Measures
Core Operating Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings Per Share
Our
 Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America(GAAP)
 which we supplement with certain non-GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or asa
 substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review ourfinancial
 statements  and  publicly-filed  reports  in  their  entirety  and  not  to  rely  on  any  single  financial  measure.  Core  operating  earnings,  coreoperatin
g margin and core earnings per share exclude the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents thedifference
 between the FAS pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Coreearnings
 per share excludes both the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment and non-operating pension and postretirement expenses. Non-operatingpension
 and postretirement expenses represent the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service cost. Pension costs, comprisingservice
 and  prior  service  costs  computed  in  accordance  with  GAAP  are  allocated  to  BCA  and  certain  BGS  businesses  supporting  commercialcustomers.
 Pension  costs  allocated  to  BDS  and  BGS  businesses  supporting  government  customers  are  computed  in  accordance  with  U.S.Government
 Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costsare
 allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generallybased on benefits paid.
The
 Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment recognized in (loss)/earnings from operations during 2020 was a benefit of $1,024 million, largelyconsistent with a benefit of $1,071 million in 2
019 and $1,005 million in 2018. The non-operating pension expense included in Other income, net wasa
 benefit of $340 million in 2020, $374 million in 2019 and $143 million in 2018. The benefits in 2020, 2019, and 2018 reflect expected returns inexcess of interest cost and amortization of actuarial losses. 
For further discussion of pension and other postretirem
ent costs see the Management’s Discussion and Analysis on pages 30 - 31 of this Form 10-Kand
 see Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earningsper
 share  for  purposes  of  evaluating  and  forecasting  underlying  business  performance.  Management  believes  these  core  earnings  measuresprovide
 investors additional insights into operational performance as unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit cost, primarily representcosts driven by market factors and costs not allocable to U.S. government contracts.

Accounting for long-term contracts
Substantially
 all contracts at BDS and certain contracts at BGS are long-term contracts. Our long-term contracts typically represent a single distinctperformance
 obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or services and the significant serviceof integration that we provide.
Accounting
 for long-term contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales, costs, and profit for each performance obligation.Cost
 of sales is recognized as incurred and revenue is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reportedas cost of sales.
Due
 to the size, duration and nature of many of our long-term contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicatedand subject
 to many variables. Total sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regardingcontract
 options,  change  orders,  incentive  and  award  provisions  associated  with  technical  performance,  and  price  adjustment  clauses  (such  asinflation
 or index-based clauses). The majority of these long-term contracts are with the U.S. government where the price is generally based onestimated
 cost  to  produce  the  product  or  service  plus  profit.  Federal  Acquisition  Regulations  provide  guidance  on  the  types  of  cost  that  will  bereimbursed
 in  establishing  contract  price.  Total  cost  estimates  are  largely  based  on  negotiated  or  estimated  purchase  contract  terms,  historicalperformance trends,
 business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical andschedule
 risk,  internal  and  subcontractor  performance  trends,  business  volume  assumptions,  COVID-19  disruptions,  asset  utilization,  andanticipated labor agreements.
Revenue and
 cost estimates for all significant long-term contract performance obligations are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in theseestimates
 could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the performance obligation’s inception to date revenues, cost of salesand
 profit, in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or anadjustment to
 a reach-forward loss, which would be recorded immediately in earnings. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 netunfavorab
le cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all long-term contracts decreased Earnings from operations by$942
 million, $111 million and $190 million, respectively. The cumulative catch-up adjustments in 2020 were primarily due to reach-forward lossesincurred on the KC-46A Tanker program.
Due
 to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different earnings could be recorded if weused different
 assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance,or
 circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin for all long-term contractperformance
 obligations for all of 2020 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income forthe year by approximately $330 million. In addition, a number of our fixed price development contracts are in a
 reach-forward loss position. Changesto estimated losses are recorded immediately in earnings.
Program Accounting
Program
 accounting  requires  the  demonstrated  ability  to  reliably  estimate  the  relationship  of  sales  to  costs  for  the  defined  program  accountingquantity.
 A  program  consists  of  the  estimated  number  of  units  (accounting  quantity)  of  a  product  to  be  produced  in  a  continuing,  long-termproduction
 effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to makereasonably dependab
le estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and53

Table of Contentsanticipated
 contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage forthe total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplan
es delivered and accepted by the customer.Factors
 that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured partcosts,
 major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs. Estimation of the accountingquantity for
 each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, lettersof
 intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and salesprice for all unsold units within 
the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales pricesfor
 all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. Cost estimates arebased
 largely  on  negotiated  and  anticipated  contracts  with  suppliers,  historical  performance  trends,  and  business  base  and  other  economicprojections.
 Factors  that  influence  these  estimates  include  production  rates,  internal  and  subcontractor  performance  trends,  customer  and/orsupplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticip
ated labor agreements, COVID-19 disruptions, and inflationary or deflationary trends.To
 ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. This includesreassessing
 the accounting quantity. Changes in estimates of program margins are normally recognized on a prospective basis; however, whenestimated costs
 to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded inthe current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered u
nits in the accounting quantity.The
 program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non-recurring and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program.Because of the higher unit production costs experi
enced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling andother
 non-recurring costs, new commercial aircraft programs, typically have lower initial margins than established programs and a higher risk forreach-forward
 loss. Actual costs incurred for earlier units in excess of the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity areincluded
 within  program  inventory  as  deferred  production  costs.  Deferred  production,  unamortized  tooling  and  other  non-recurring  costs  areexpected
 to be fully recovered when all units in the accounting quantity  are delivered as the expected unit cost  for later  deliveries  is below theestimated average cost as learning curve and other improvements are real
ized.We
 now anticipate that the first 777X delivery will occur in late 2023. We also recorded a $6.5 billion reach-forward loss on the 777X program in thefourth
 quarter of 2020. The revised schedule and the reach-forward loss reflect a number of factors, including an updated assessment of globalcertification
 requirements informed by continued discussions with regulators and resulting in a management decision to make modifications to theaircraft’s
 design,  an  updated  assessment  of  COVID-19  impacts  on  market  demand,  and  discussions  with  our  customers  with  respect  to  aircraftdelivery
 timing.  These  factors  resulted  in  adjustments  to  production  rates  and  the  program  accounting  quantity,  increased  change  incorporationcosts, and associated customer and supply chain impacts.
Absent
 changes in the estimated revenues or costs, deliveries which are expected to begin in 2023 will be recorded at zero margin. Reductions tothe
 estimated loss in subsequent periods are spread over all undelivered units in the accounting quantity, whereas increases to the estimated lossare
 recorded immediately. The level of profitability on the 777X program will be subject to a number of factors. These factors include continuedmarket
 uncertainty, the impacts of COVID-19 on our production system as well as impacts on our supply chain and customers, further productionrate
 adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs, contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risks associated with thetesting program and the timing of aircraft certification. One or more of these factors
54

Table of Contentscould result in additional reach-forward l
osses on the 777X program in future periods which may be material.Due
 to the impacts of COVID-19 on our customers as well as production issues and associated rework, the 787 program has near breakeven grossmargins
 at  December  31,  2020.  The  margins  reflect  reductions  in  the  production  rate  and  program  accounting  quantity  during  2020.  If  we  arerequired
 to  further  reduce  the  accounting  quantity  and/or  production  rates  or  experience  higher  than  anticipated  costs  or  delays  addressingproductio
n issues and associated rework, or other factors that could result in lower margins, the program could record a reach-forward loss in futureperiods which may be material.
The 747
 and 767 programs also have near breakeven gross margins at December 31, 2020. If we are unable to mitigate risks associated with theseprograms,
 or if our assumptions with respect to items such as pricing, cost, accounting quantity or future production rates were to change, we couldbe required to record reach-forward losses in future periods which may be materia
l.737 MAX Grounding
In
 2019,  following  two  fatal  737  MAX  accidents,  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  and  non-U.S.  civil  aviation  authorities  issued  orderssuspending
 commercial operations of 737 MAX aircraft. Deliveries of the 737 MAX were suspended following these orders. Deliveries resumed inlate 2020 following rescissio
n by the FAA of its grounding order.Multiple
 legal  actions  have  been  filed  against  us  as  a  result  of  the  accidents.  In  addition,  we  are  fully  cooperating  with  U.S.  governmentinvestigations
 related  to  the  accidents  and  the  737  MAX  program,  including  an  investigation  by  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  theoutcome of which may
 be material. On January 6, 2021, we entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice thatresolves
 the Department of Justice’s previously disclosed investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX airplane by the FAA. Otherthan
 with respect to the U.S. Department of Justice, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, not covered by available insurance thatmay result given the current status of the lawsuits, investigations and inqu
iries related to the 737 MAX.In
 the preparation of our financial statements,  we have made assumptions regarding outcomes of accident investigations and other governmentinquiries,
 timing and conditions of return to service, the timing of future 737 production rate increases, supplier readiness to support production ratechanges,
 timing and sequence of future customer deliveries as well as outcomes of negotiations with customers impacted by the grounding. Wehave also made significant assumptions reg
arding estimated costs expected to be incurred in 2021 that should be included in program inventory andthose
 costs that should be expensed when incurred as abnormal production costs. While these assumptions reflect our best estimate at this time,they are highly uncertain and signific
antly affect the estimates inherent in our financial statements.In
 December 2020, we delivered 27 aircraft, in compliance with the FAA regulatory requirements. We have assumed that the remaining non-U.S.regulatory approvals will occur
 and enable deliveries during the first half of 2021. We have approximately 425 airplanes in inventory as of December31,
 2020.  A  number  of  customers  have  requested  to  defer  deliveries  or  to  cancel  orders  for  737  MAX  aircraft,  and  we  are  remarketing  and/ordelayin
g deliveries of certain aircraft included within inventory. We now expect to deliver about half of the 737 MAX aircraft in inventory by the end of2021.
 In the event that we are unable to resume aircraft deliveries in non-U.S. jurisdictions consistent with our assumptions of regulatory approvaltiming, our expectation of delivery timing could be impacte
d.Due to the grounding and associated suspension of
 737 MAX deliveries, we temporarily suspended 737 MAX production beginning in January 2020.We resumed early stages of 737 MAX production in May 2020 and co
ntinued to produce at low rates through the end of 2020.55

Table of ContentsIn
 addition, we reduced the number of aircraft included in the accounting quantity by 400 units in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of reductions toplanned
 production rates due to COVID-19 driven market uncertainties. As we are producing at abnormally low production rates in 2020 and 2021,we
 expect  to  incur  approximately  $5.0  billion  of  abnormal  production  costs  that  are  being  expensed  as  incurred.  The  slowdown  in  the  plannedproduction
 rate ramp-up increased expected abnormal costs however this increase was offset by adjustments to the determination of the normalproduction
 level due to COVID-19 impacts on customer demand, as well as cost reduction activities, including significant reductions in employmentlevels. We expensed approximately $2.6 bi
llion of abnormal production costs during the year ended December 31, 2020.In
 addition to impacts related to the 737 MAX accidents and subsequent grounding, the 737 program continues to be significantly impacted by theCOVID-19 pandemic and its effect
 on aircraft demand. These impacts have resulted in lower production and delivery rate assumptions. We currentlyexpect
 to  gradually  increase  the  production  rate  to  31  per  month  by  early  2022.  We  currently  assume  that  we  will  implement  further  gradualproduction rate increases in subsequent periods based on
 market demand. The ongoing impacts of COVID-19 on market demand have also createdsignificant
 uncertainty around the timing of deliveries of 737 MAX aircraft in inventory. We may need to recognize additional costs associated withremarketing and/or reconfiguring aircraft in inventory, which may reduce reven
ue and/or earnings in future periods.We
 are working with our customers to minimize the impact to their operations from grounded and undelivered aircraft. We continue to reassess theliability
 for  estimated  potential  concessions  and  other  considerations  to  customers  on  a  quarterly  basis.  This  reassessment  includes  updatingestimates to
 reflect revisions to return to service, delivery and production rate assumptions driven by timing of regulatory approvals, as well as latestinformation
 based on engagements with 737 MAX customers. The remaining liability of $5.5 billion at December 31, 2020 represents our currentbest
 estimate of future concessions and other considerations to customers, and is necessarily based on a series of assumptions. It is subject tochange in future quarters as negotiations with customers mature and timing a
nd conditions of return to service are better understood.Our assumptions reflect
 our current best estimate, but actual timing and conditions of return to service and resumption of deliveries could differ fromthis
 estimate, the effect of which could be material. We are unable at this time to reasonably estimate potential future additional financial impacts ora
 range of loss, if any, due to continued uncertainties related to the timing and conditions of return to service, uncertainties related to the impacts ofCOVID-19
 on  our  operations,  supply  chain  and  customers,  future  changes  to  the  production  rate,  supply  chain  impacts,  and/or  the  results  ofnegotiations
 with  particular  customers.  Any  such  impacts,  including  any  changes  in  our  estimates,  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  ourfinancia
l position, results of operations, and/or cash flows. For example, we expect that, in the event that we are unable to resume aircraft deliveriesin
 non-U.S. jurisdictions consistent with our assumptions, the continued absence of revenue, earnings, and cash flows associated with 737 MAXdeliveries would
 continue to have a material impact on our operating results. In the event that future production rate increases occur at a slower rateor
 take longer than we are currently assuming we expect that the growth in inventory and other cash flow impacts associated with production woulddecrease.
 However, while any prolonged production suspension or delays in planned production rate increases could mitigate the impact on ourliquidity,
 it could significantly increase the overall expected costs to produce aircraft included in the accounting quantity, which would reduce 737program margins and/or increase abnormal production costs in the future.
Goodwill Impairments
We
 test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or quantitative test. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, weevaluate economic,
 industry and company-specific factors as an initial step in assessing the fair value of operations. If we determine it is more likelythan
56

Table of Contentsnot
 that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, then a quantitative test is performed; otherwise, nofurther testing is
 required. For operations where the quantitative test is used, we compare the carrying value of net assets to the estimated fair valueof the related operations. If
 the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, the shortfall up to the carrying value of the goodwill representsthe amount of
 goodwill impairment.We
 generally  estimate  the  fair  values  of  the  related  operations  using  a  combination  of  discounted  cash  flows  and  market-based  valuationmethodologies
 such as comparable public company trading values. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales,operating
 costs, and changes in working capital. These forecasts reflect existing firm orders, expected future orders, expected production rates anddelivery
 profiles, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly changethe
 amount  of  impairment  recorded,  if  any.  The  cash  flow  forecasts  are  adjusted  by  an  appropriate  discount  rate  derived  from  our  marketcapitalization
 plus  a  suitable  control  premium  at  the  date  of  evaluation.  Therefore,  changes  in  the  stock  price  may  also  affect  the  amount  ofimpairment recorded, if any.
We completed our annual assessment of goodwi
ll as of April 1, 2020 and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill.As
 a  result  of  the  continuing  significant  adverse  impacts  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  on  our  Commercial  Airplanes  and  Commercial  Servicesbusinesses,
 we  concluded  it  is  a  triggering  event  for  testing  whether  goodwill  recorded  by  our  Commercial  Airplanes  and  Commercial  Servicesreporting
 units  is  impaired.  At  December  31,  2020,  Commercial  Airplanes  has  $1,316  million  of  goodwill  and  Commercial  Services  has  $3,087million.
 We  performed  a  quantitative  test  and  determined  the  fair  values  of  our  Commercial  Airplane  and  Commercial  Services  reporting  unitssubstantially
 exceeded their carrying values as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we also estimated the fair values of our otherreporting units significantly exceede
d their corresponding carrying values.We
 will continue to monitor the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in future quarters. Changes in our forecasts, discount rates, or decreases in thevalue of our common stock could cause book values to excee
d their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods.Pension Plans
Many
 of  our  employees  have  earned  benefits  under  defined  benefit  pension  plans.  Nonunion  and  the  majority  of  union  employees  that  hadparticipat
ed in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Additional unionemployees
 transitioned  to  company-funded  defined  contribution  retirement  savings  plans effective  January  1,  2019.  Accounting  rules  require  anannual measurement of
 our projected obligation and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discountrate
 and the expected long-term rate of asset return. Future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes cansignificantly affect our future annual expense, projecte
d benefit obligation and Shareholders’ equity.57

Table of ContentsThe
 projected  benefit  obligation  is  sensitive  to  discount  rates.  The  projected  benefit  obligation  would  decrease  by  $2,591  million  or  increase  by$2,930
 million  if  the  discount  rate  increased  or  decreased  by  25  basis  points.  A  25  basis  point  change  in  the  discount  rate  would  not  have  asignificant
 impact on pension cost. However, net periodic pension cost is sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. Adecrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return
 would have increased or decreased 2020 net periodic pensioncost by $145 million.
Deferred Income Taxes – Valuation Allowance
The
 Company has deferred income tax assets of $11,600 million at December 31, 2020, that can be used in future years to offset taxable incomeand
 reduce income taxes payable. The Company has deferred income tax liabilities of $9,430 million at December 31, 2020, that will partially offsetdeferred
 income tax assets and result in higher taxable income in future years and increase income taxes payable. Tax law determines whetherfuture
 reversals of temporary differences will result in taxable and deductible amounts that offset each other in future years. The particular years inwhich
 temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts generally are determined by the timing of the recovery of the related asset orsettlement of the related liability. The deferred income tax assets and lia
bilities relate primarily to U.S. federal and state tax jurisdictions.On
 a quarterly basis, we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income andreduce
 the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not(defined as a likelihood of more than 50%) that all or a portion of such ass
ets will not be realized.This
 assessment,  which  is  completed  on  a  taxing  jurisdiction  basis,  takes  into  account  both  positive  and  negative  evidence.  A  recent  history  offinancial
 reporting losses is heavily weighted as a source of objectively verifiable negative evidence. Cumulative pre-tax losses in the three-yearperiod
 ending with the current quarter is considered to be significant negative evidence regarding future profitability. If cumulative pre-tax lossesadjusted for
 non-recurring items result in positive normalized earnings that would be considered an objectively verifiable source of positive evidenceof
 the ability of the company to generate positive earnings in the future. When there is a recent history of operating losses and negative normalizedearnings
 and a return  to operating  profitability  has not yet  been demonstrated,  we cannot rely on projections  of future  earnings for  purposes  ofassessing
 recoverability of our deferred tax assets. In such cases, we use systematic and logical methods to estimate when deferred tax liabilitieswill
 reverse and generate taxable income and when deferred tax assets will reverse and generate tax deductions. The selection of methodologiesand
 assessment  of  when  temporary  differences  will  result  in  taxable  or  deductible  amounts  involves  significant  management  judgment  and  isinherently
 complex and subjective. We believe that the methodologies we use are reasonable and can be replicated on a consistent basis in futureperiods.
As
 described above, a recent history of financial reporting losses is heavily weighted as a source of objectively verifiable negative evidence of theCompany’s
 ability  to  generate  future  taxable  income  to  recover  deferred  tax  assets.  During  2019  and  2020  the  Company  generated  significantlosses
 and  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020  the  Company  reached  a  three-year  cumulative  pre-tax  loss  position.  We  expect  cumulative  three-yearlosses
 to grow in 2021 as record earnings in 2018 are replaced by 2021 results. We also normalized earnings and other comprehensive income forcertain
 non-recurring items and expect to reach a three-year cumulative loss position in 2021 as record earnings in 2018 are replaced with 2021results.
 For  purposes  of  assessing  the  recoverability  of  deferred  tax  assets,  the  Company  determined  that  it  could  not  include  future  projectedearnings in the analysis due to recent history of losses.
Deferred tax liabiliti
es represent the assumed source of future taxable income and the majority are assumed to generate taxable amounts during thenext five years.
 Deferred tax assets include amounts58

Table of Contentsrelated
 to  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefits  that  are  assumed  to  generate  significant  deductible  amounts  beyond  five  years. TheCompany’s
 valuation  allowance  of  $3,094  million  at  December  31,  2020  primarily  relates  to  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefit  obligationdeferred
 tax assets that are assumed to reverse beyond the period in which reversals of deferred tax liabilities are assumed to occur. Because thepension
 and  other  postretirement  benefit  obligations  are  recorded  to  both  continuing  operations  and  other  comprehensive  income  (OCI),  theCompany
 recorded  a  portion  of  the  fourth  quarter  increase  in  the  valuation  allowance  to  income  tax  expense  in  continuing  operations  ($2,513million) and a por
tion to OCI ($196 million).If
 the Company continues to generate losses and negative normalized earnings in future periods, additional valuation allowances may have to berecorded with correspon
ding adverse impacts on earnings and/or OCI. When income generation returns to more normal levels we can expect to seethe allowance reverse and increase rep
orted earnings and/or OCI.For additional information regarding i
ncome taxes, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Interest Rate Risk
We have financial instruments that
 are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed- and floating-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assetsand
 liabilities.  The  investors  in  our  fixed-rate  debt  obligations  do  not  generally  have  the  right  to  demand  we  pay  off  these  obligations  prior  tomaturity.
 Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt. In the first quarter of 2020, we entered into a$13.8
 billion two-year delayed draw floating-rate term loan credit agreement. An increase or decrease of 100 basis points in interest rates on thisfloating-rate
 debt would increase or decrease our pre-tax earnings by $138 million over the next 12 months. Historically, we have not experiencedmaterial gains or losses on our customer financing assets and l
iabilities due to interest rate changes.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
We
 are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We useforeign
 currency  forward  contracts  to  hedge  the  price  risk  associated  with  firmly  committed  and  forecasted  foreign  denominated  payments  andreceipts
 related  to  our  ongoing  business.  Foreign  currency  forward  contracts  are  sensitive  to  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  AtDecember
 31,  2020,  a  10%  increase  or  decrease  in  the  exchange  rate  in  our  portfolio  of  foreign  currency  contracts  would  have  increased  ordecreased
 our unrealized losses by $245 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations,such unrealized losses
 or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactionsbeing hedge
d. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk.Commodity Price Risk
We
 are subject to commodity price risk relating to commodity purchase contracts for items used in production that are subject to changes in themarket
 price.  We  use  commodity  swaps  and  commodity  purchase  contracts  to  hedge  against  these  potentially  unfavorable  price  changes.  Ourcommodity
 purchase  contracts  and  derivatives  are  both  sensitive  to  changes  in  the  market  price.  At  December  31,  2020,  a  10%  increase  ordecrease
 in the market price in our commodity derivatives would have increased or decreased our unrealized losses by $38 million. Consistent withthe use of these contracts

 neutralize the effect of market price fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively,in
 the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these commodity purchase contracts and the offsettingswaps do not create material market risk.

Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
The
 Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report have been prepared by management of The Boeing Company (herein referred to as“Boeing,” the “Company,” “we,”
 “us,” or “our”). These statements include the accounts of all majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entitiesthat
 are required to be consolidated. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions  have been eliminated. As described in Note 22, weoperate
 in four reportable segments: Commercial Airplanes (BCA); Defense, Space & Security (BDS), Global Services (BGS), and Boeing Capital(BCC).
 Effective at the beginning of 2020, certain programs were realigned between our BDS segment and Unallocated items, eliminations andother. Amounts in prior periods have been reclassifie
d to conform to the current year presentation.Liquidity Matters
The
 global outbreak of COVID-19 and the grounding of the 737 MAX airplane are having a significant adverse impact on our business and areexpected
 to continue to negatively impact revenue, earnings and operating cash flow in future quarters. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused anunprecedented
 shock  to  demand  for  air  travel,  creating  a  tremendous  challenge  for  our  customers,  our  business  and  the  entire  aerospacemanufacturing
 and services sector. We currently expect it will take approximately three years for travel to return to 2019 levels and a few yearsbeyond
 that for the industry to return to long-term trend growth. There is significant uncertainty with respect to when commercial air traffic levels willrecover, and whether and at what point capacity will return to and/or exce
ed pre-COVID-19 levels.During 2020, net cash used by operating activ
ities was $18.4 billion, and we expect negative operating cash flows in future quarters until commercialdeliveries
 ramp up. In the first quarter of 2020, we entered into and fully drew on a $13.8 billion two-year delayed draw term loan credit agreement(delayed draw term loan facility). In
 the second quarter of 2020, we issued $25 billion of fixed rate senior notes that mature between 2023 and 2060.In
 the fourth quarter of 2020, we issued $4.9 billion of fixed rate senior notes that mature between 2024 and 2031. As a result, our cash and short-term investment balance was $25.6 billion a
nd our debt balance was $63.6 billion at December 31, 2020.The
 major credit rating agencies downgraded our short term and long term credit ratings during 2020, and there is risk for further downgrades. AtDecember
 31, 2020, our debt balance includes no commercial paper borrowings compared to $6.1 billion at December 31, 2019. In the currentenvironment, we may have limited future access to the commercial paper market. In addition, we have term notes of $1.5 bill
ion maturing in 2021.At December 31,
 2020, trade payables included $3.8 billion payable to suppliers who have elected to participate in supply chain financing programs.While
 access to supply chain financing has been reduced due to our current credit ratings and debt levels, we do not believe that these or futurechanges in the availabil
ity of supply chain financing will have a significant impact on our liquidity.At
 December 31, 2020, we had $9.5 billion of unused borrowing capacity on revolving credit agreements. We anticipate that these credit lines willprimarily
 serve  as  back-up  liquidity  to  support  our  general  corporate  borrowing  needs.  Our  borrowing  capacity  includes  a  $3.1  billion  364-dayrevolving credit facility, which is set to expire in October 2021.
68

Table of ContentsIn
 addition to our debt issuances, we have taken a number of actions to improve liquidity. During the first quarter of 2020, our Board of Directorsterminated its
 prior authorization to repurchase shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock and suspended the declaration and/or paymentof
 dividends  until  further  notice.  We  have  also  reduced  production  rates  in  our  commercial  business  to  reflect  the  impact  of  COVID-19  on  theindustry.
 We  are  executing  on  our  plans  to  reduce  our  workforce  through  a  combination  of  voluntary  and  involuntary  layoffs  and  naturalturnover. During 2020,
 we recorded severance costs for approximately 26,000 employees, of which approximately 18,000 have left the Company asof
 December 31, 2020, and the remainder are expected to leave in 2021. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we began using our common stock in lieu ofcash to fund Company contributions to our 401(k) plans. In December 202
0, we awarded most of our employees a one-time stock grant that will vestin three years in lieu of merit increases. We expect these actions to further enable the Company to cons
erve cash.We
 are also working with our customers and supply chain to accelerate receipts and conserve cash. For example, the United States Department ofDefense
 (U.S. DoD) has taken steps to work with its industry partners to increase liquidity in the form of increased progress payment rates andreductions
 in withholds among other initiatives. We are also deferring certain tax payments pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and EconomicSecurity (CARES) Act.
We have reduced discretionary spendin
g, including reducing or deferring research and development and capital expenditures.In
 July  2020,  we  announced  our  business  transformation  efforts  to  assess  our  business  across  five  key  pillars  –  infrastructure,  overhead  andorganization,
 portfolio and investments, supply chain health and operational excellence. Within the infrastructure pillar we are assessing our overallfacility
 requirements in light of reduced demand in our commercial businesses and remote and virtual work opportunities for large numbers of ourworkforce. We also anticipate a
 reduction in office space needs compared to our current capacity. However, as we consolidate our footprint, we mayincur near term
 adverse impacts to earnings. The overhead and organization pillar is focused on our cost structure and how we are organized so wecan right
 size our workforce and simplify and reduce management layers and bureaucracy. The portfolio and investments pillar includes aligning ourportfolio
 and investments to focus on our core business and the changes in market conditions. The supply chain pillar is focused on supply chainhealth
 and stability, reducing indirect procurement spend and streamlining our transportation, logistics and warehousing approach. The operationalexcellence
 pillar is focused on improving performance, enhancing quality and reducing rework. These activities are not intended to constrain ourcapacity, but to enable the Company to emerge stronger and be more resili
ent when the market recovers.Based
 on  our  current  best  estimates  of  market  demand,  planned  production  rates,  timing  of  cash  receipts  and  expenditures,  our  ability  tosuccessful
ly implement further actions to improve liquidity as well as our ability to access additional liquidity, if needed, we believe it is probable thatwe will be able to fund our operations for the foreseea
ble future.Use of Estimates
The
 preparation of financial statements  in conformity  with U.S. generally accepted accounting  principles  (GAAP) requires  management to makeestimates
 and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date ofthe
 financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We believe that the accounting estimatesand assumptions are appropriate given the
 increased uncertainties surrounding the severity and duration of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic,however actual results could differ from those estimates.

Table of ContentsOperating Cycle
For
 classification of certain current assets and liabilities, we use the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle, which isgenerally longer than one year.
Standards Issued and Implemented
In
 the  first  quarter  of  2020,  we  adopted  ASU  2016-13,  Financial  Instruments  -  Credit  Losses  (Topic  326):  Measurement  of  Credit  Losses  onFinancial
 Instruments, using a modified retrospective method, which resulted in the recognition of allowances for credit losses on our ConsolidatedStatement
 of  Financial  Position  as  of  January  1,  2020  and  a  $162  cumulative-effect  adjustment  to  retained  earnings  to  align  our  credit  lossmethodology
 with the new standard. The standard replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology under Topic 310 with a methodology thatreflects
 expected credit losses and requires the use of a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivables, loans, and certainother financial assets. See Notes 5, 6, 9 and 14 for additiona
l disclosures.In the first quarter of 2020, we also adopted ASU 2017-04, Intangib
les-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.The
 standard  simplifies  the  quantitative  impairment  test  from  a  two-step  process  to  a  one-step  process.  The  quantitative  test  is  performed  bycomparing the carrying value of net assets to the estimated fair value of the related operatio
ns. If the fair value is determined to be less than carryingvalue,
 the  shortfall  up  to  the  carrying  value  of  the  goodwill  represents  the  amount  of  goodwill  impairment.  The  standard  continues  to  permit  acompany to test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessme
nt or using the quantitative test.Revenue and Related Cost Recognition
Commercial
 aircraft contracts The  majority of our BCA segment revenue is derived from commercial aircraft contracts. For each contract, wedetermine
 the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received. We allocate the transaction price to each commercial aircraftperformance
 obligation  based  on  relative  standalone  selling  prices  adjusted  by  an  escalation  formula  as  specified  in  the  customer  agreement.Revenue
 is recognized for each commercial aircraft performance obligation at the point in time when the aircraft is completed and accepted by thecustomer. We use program accounting to determine the amount reported as cost of sales.
In
 certain situations, where an aircraft  is still in our possession, and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  (known as a bill-and-holdarrangement), revenue will be recognized w
hen all specific requirements for transfer of control under a bill-and-hold arrangement have been met.Payments for commercial aircraft sales are received in accordance with the customer agreement, which generally includ
es a deposit upon order andadditional
 payments in accordance with a payment schedule, with the balance being due immediately prior to or at aircraft delivery. Advances andprogress
 billings  (contract  liabilities)  are  normal  and  customary  for  commercial  aircraft  contracts  and  not  considered  a  significant  financingcomponent as they are intended to protect us from the other party failing to adequately compl
ete some or all of its obligations under the contract.Long-term contracts
 Substantially  all contracts at BDS and certain contracts at BGS are long-term contracts with the U.S. government and othercustomers
 that generally extend over several years. Products sales under long-term contracts primarily include fighter jets, rotorcraft, cybersecurityproducts,
 surveillance  suites,  advanced  weapons,  missile  defense,  military  derivative  aircraft,  satellite  systems,  and  modification  of  commercialpassenger
 aircraft to cargo freighters. Services sales under long-term contracts primarily include support and maintenance agreements associatedwith our commercial and defense products and space travel o
n Commercial Crew.70

Table of ContentsFor
 each long-term contract, we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received. We allocate the transactionprice
 to each distinct performance obligation to deliver a good or service, or a collection of goods and/or services, based on the relative standaloneselling
 prices. A long-term contract will typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelatednature
 of the underlying goods and/or services and the significant service of integration that we provide. While the scope and price on certain long-term
 contracts  may  be  modified  over  their  life,  the  transaction  price  is  based  on  current  rights  and  obligations  under  the  contract  and  does  notinclude
 potential modifications until they are agreed upon with the customer. When applicable, a cumulative adjustment or separate recognition forthe
 additional scope and price may result. Long-term contracts can be negotiated with a fixed price or a price in which we are reimbursed for costsincurred
 plus  an  agreed  upon  profit.  The  Federal  Acquisition  Regulations  provide  guidance  on  the  types  of  cost  that  will  be  reimbursed  inestablishing
 the price for contracts with the U.S. government. Certain long-term contracts include in the transaction price variable consideration,such
 as incentive and award fees, if specified targets are achieved. The amount included in the transaction price represents the expected value,based on a weighted probab
ility, or the most likely amount.Long-term contract revenue is
 recognized over the contract term (over time) as the work progresses, either as products are produced or as servicesare
 rendered. We generally recognize revenue over time as we perform on long-term contracts because of continuous transfer of control to thecustomer.
 For U.S. government contracts, this continuous transfer of control to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that allow thecustomer
 to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any work inprocess.
 Similarly,  for  non-U.S.  government  contracts,  the  customer  typically  controls  the  work  in  process  as  evidenced  either  by  contractualtermination
 clauses or by our rights to payment of the transaction price associated with work performed to date on products or services that do nothave an alternative use to the Company.
The
 accounting for long-term contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating total sales, costs and profit for each performance obligation.Cost of
 sales is recognized as incurred. The amount reported as revenues is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit tothe
 amount  reported  as  cost  of  sales.  Recognizing  revenue  as  costs  are  incurred  provides  an  objective  measure  of  progress  on  the  long-termcontract and thereby best depicts the extent of transfer of control to the customer.
Changes
 in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effect on operating income are recognized using a cumulative catch-up adjustmentwhich recognizes in the current period the cumulativ
e effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a long-term contract’s percentage-of-completion.
 When the current estimates of total sales and costs for a long-term contract indicate a loss, a provision for the entire reach-forwardloss on the long-term contract is recognized.
Net
 cumulative catch-up adjustments to prior years' revenue and earnings, including certain reach-forward losses, across all long-term contractswere as follows:
2020
2019 2018 (Decrease)/Increase to Revenue
($359) $54 $137 Increase to Loss/decrease to Earnings from operations
($942) ($111) ($190) Decrease to Diluted EPS
($1.37) ($0.06) ($0.29) Signific
ant adjustments during the three years ended December 31, 2020 included reach-forward losses of $953, $148 and $736 on KC-46A Tankerrecorded during 2020, 2019, and 20

 to  the  significance  of  judgment  in  the  estimation  process,  changes  in  underlying  assumptions/estimates,  supplier  performance,  orcircumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future perio
ds.Payments
 under  long-term  contracts  may  be  received  before  or  after  revenue  is  recognized.  The  U.S.  government  customer  typically  withholdspayment
 of  a  small  portion  of  the  contract  price  until  contract  completion.  Therefore,  long-term  contracts  typically  generate  Unbilled  receivables(contract
 assets) but may generate Advances and progress billings (contract liabilities). Long-term contract Unbilled receivables and Advances andprogress
 billings are not considered a significant financing component because they are intended to protect either the customer or the Company inthe event that some or all of the obligations under the contract are not completed.
Commercial
 spare  parts  contracts Certain  contracts  at  our  BGS  segment  include  sales  of  commercial  spare  parts.  For  each  contract,  wedetermine
 the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received. The spare parts have discrete unit prices that represent fairvalue.
 We  generally  consider  each  spare  part  to  be  a  separate  performance  obligation.  Revenue  is  recognized  for  each  commercial  spare  partperformance obligation at
 the point in time of delivery to the customer. We may provide our customers with a right to return a commercial spare partwhere
 a customer may receive a full or partial refund, a credit applied to amounts owed, a different product in exchange, or any combination ofthese
 items. We consider the potential for customer returns in the estimated transaction price. The amount reported as cost of sales is recorded ataverage cost. Payments for commercial spare parts sales are typically received shortly after delivery.
Other service revenue contracts
 Certain contracts  at our BGS segment are for sales of services to commercial customers including maintenance,training,
 data analytics and information-based services. We recognize revenue for these service performance obligations over time as the servicesare
 rendered. The method of measuring progress (such as straight-line or billable amount) varies depending upon which method best depicts thetransfer of control to the customer based on the type of service performed. Cost of sales is recorded as incurred.
Concession
 Sharing  Arrangements We  account  for  sales  concessions  to  our  customers  in  consideration  of  their  purchase  of  products  andservices
 as a reduction of the transaction price and the revenue that is recognized for the related performance obligations. The sales concessionsincurred
 may be partially reimbursed by certain suppliers in accordance with concession sharing arrangements. We record these reimbursements,which are presumed to represent reductions in the price of the vendor’s pro
ducts or services, as a reduction in Cost of products.Unbilled
 Receivables and Advances and Progress Billings Unbilled  receivables (contract assets) arise when the Company recognizes revenuefor amounts which cannot yet be billed under terms of
 the contract with the customer. Advances and progress billings (contract liabilities) arise whenthe Company receives payments from customers in advance of recognizing revenue. The amount of Unbilled receivables or Advances and progress
billings is determined for each contract.
Financial
 Services  Revenue We  record  financial  services  revenue  associated  with  sales-type/finance  leases,  operating  leases,  and  notesreceivable.
Lease
 and financing revenue arrangements are included in Sales of services on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For sales-type/financeleases,
 we record financing receivables at lease inception. A financing receivable is recorded at the aggregate of future minimum lease payments,estimated residual value of the
 leased equipment, and deferred incremental direct costs less unearned income. Income is recognized over the life ofthe lease to approximate a
 level rate of return on the net investment. Income recognition is generally suspended for financing receivables at the datefull
 recovery of income and principal becomes not probable. Income is recognized when financing receivables become contractually current andperformance is demonstrated by the customer
.  Residual72

Table of Contentsvalues, which are
 reviewed periodically, represent the estimated amount we expect to receive at lease termination from the disposition of the leasedequipment.
 Actual  residual  values  realized  could  differ  from  these  estimates.  Declines  in  estimated  residual  value  that  are  deemed  other-than-temporary are recognized in the period in which the d
eclines occur.For
 operating leases, revenue on leased aircraft and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Operating leaseassets,
 included in Customer financing, are recorded at cost and depreciated over the period that we project we will hold the asset to an estimatedresidual
 value,  using  the  straight-line  method.  We  periodically  review  our  estimates  of  residual  value  and  recognize  forecasted  changes  byprospectively adjusting
 depreciation expense.For
 notes receivable, notes are recorded net of any unamortized discounts and deferred incremental direct costs. Interest income and amortizationof any discounts are recorded ratably over the related term of the note.
Reinsurance
 Revenue Our  wholly-owned  insurance  subsidiary,  Astro  Ltd.,  participates  in  a  reinsurance  pool  for  workers’  compensation.  Themember
 agreements and practices of the reinsurance pool minimize any participating members’ individual risk. Reinsurance revenues were $129,$151
 and $145 during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Reinsurance costs related to premiums and claims paid to the reinsurance pool were$136,
 $150  and  $136  during  2020,  2019  and  2018,  respectively.  Revenues  and  costs  are  presented  net  in  Cost  of  sales  in  the  ConsolidatedStatements of Operations.
Fleet Support
We
 provide  assistance  and  support  to  facilitate  efficient  and  safe  aircraft  operation  to  the  operators  of  all  our  commercial  airplane  models.Collectively
 known as fleet support, these activities and support services include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineeringsupport,
 and technical data and documents. Fleet support activity begins prior to aircraft delivery as the customer receives training, manuals, andtechnical
 consulting support. This activity continues throughout the aircraft’s operational life. Services provided after delivery include field servicesupport,
 consulting on maintenance, repair, and operational issues brought forth by the customer or regulators, updating manuals and engineeringdata,
 and the issuance of service bulletins that impact the entire model’s fleet. Field service support involves our personnel located at customerfacilities providing and coordi
nating fleet support activities and requests. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred as Cost of services.Research and Development
Research
 and  development  includes  costs  incurred  for  experimentation,  design,  and  testing,  as  well  as  bid  and  proposal  efforts  related  togovernment produ
cts and services which are expensed as incurred unless the costs are related to certain contractual arrangements with customers.Costs
 that are incurred pursuant to such contractual arrangements are recorded over the period that revenue is recognized, consistent with ourcontract
 accounting  policy.  We  have  certain  research  and  development  arrangements  that  meet  the  requirement  for  best  efforts  research  anddevelopment
 accounting. Accordingly, the amounts funded by the customer are recognized as an offset to our research and development expenserather
 than as contract revenues. Research and development expense included bid and proposal costs of $224, $214 and $234 in 2020, 2019 and2018, respectively.
Share-Based Compensation
We provide various forms of
 share-based compensation to our employees. For awards settled in shares, we measure compensation expense basedon the grant-date fair value net of estimated forfeitures. For awards settled in cash, or that may be settled in cash, we measure compensation
73

Table of Contentsexpense
 based on the fair value at each reporting date net of estimated forfeitures. The expense is recognized over the requisite service period,which is generally the vesting perio
d of the award.Income Taxes
Provisions
 for U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. income taxes are calculated on reported (Loss)/earnings before income taxes based oncurrent
 tax law and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determiningdeferred
 tax assets and liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income andexpense
 are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. Significant judgment is required indetermining income tax provisions and eva
luating tax positions.The
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of taxpositions
 taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured forfinancial
 statement purposes and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such taxpositions
 changes,  the  change  in  estimate  is  recorded  in  the  period  in  which  the  determination  is  made.  Tax-related  interest  and  penalties  areclassified as a component of Income tax benefit/(expense).
We
 also  assess  the  likelihood  that  we  will  be  able  to  recover  our  deferred  tax  assets  against  future  sources  of  taxable  income  and  reduce  thecarrying amounts
 of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or aportion
 of such assets will not be realized. Changes in our estimates and judgments regarding realization of deferred tax assets may result in anincrease or decrease to our tax expense and/or other comprehensiv
e income, which would be recorded in the period in which the change occurs.Postretirement Plans
Many
 of  our  employees  have  earned  benefits  under  defined  benefit  pension  plans.  Nonunion  and  the  majority  of  union  employees  that  hadparticipat
ed in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Additional unionemployees
 transitioned to company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plans effective January 1, 2019. We also provide postretirementbenefit
 plans other than pensions, consisting principally of health care coverage to eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Benefits under thepension
 and other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of service and, for some pension plans, benefitsare
 also based on the employee’s annual earnings. The net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans is determined using theprojected unit credit method and several actuarial ass
umptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the long-term rate of asset return,and
 medical  trend  (rate  of  growth  for  medical  costs).  A  portion  of  the  service  cost  component  of  net  periodic  pension  and  other  postretirementincome
 or expense is not recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs, and reflected ininventory
 at the end of a reporting period. Actuarial gains and losses, which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions, arereflected
 in Shareholders’ equity (net of taxes). If actuarial gains and losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities weamortize
 them over the average expected future lifetime of participants. The funded status of our pension and postretirement plans is reflected onthe Consolidated Statements of Financia
l Position.Postemployment Plans
We record a liability for postemployment benefits, such as severance or job traini
ng, when payment is probable, the amount is reasonably estimable,and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumul
ated.74

Table of ContentsEnvironmental Remediation
We
 are  subject  to  federal  and  state  requirements  for  protection  of  the  environment,  including  those  for  discharge  of  hazardous  materials  andremediation
 of  contaminated  sites.  We  routinely  assess,  based  on  in-depth  studies,  expert  analyses  and  legal  reviews,  our  contingencies,obligations,
 and commitments  for remediation  of contaminated  sites,  including assessments  of ranges and probabilities of recoveries  from  otherresponsible
 parties and/or insurance carriers. Our policy is to accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to environmentalremediation
 sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The amount of the liability isbased
 on  our  best  estimate  or  the  low  end  of  a  range  of  reasonably  possible  exposure  for  investigation,  cleanup,  and  monitoring  costs  to  beincurred.
 Estimated remediation costs are not discounted to present value as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. We may beable
 to recover a portion of the remediation costs from insurers or other third parties. Such recoveries are recorded when realization of the claim forrecovery is deemed probable.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash
 and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments, such as commercial paper, time deposits, and other money market instruments,which
 have original maturities of three months or less. We aggregate our cash balances by bank where conditions for right of set-off are met, andreclassify
 any negative balances, consisting mainly of uncleared checks, to Accounts payable. Negative balances reclassified to Accounts payablewere $74 and $101 at December 31, 2020 a
nd 2019.Inventories
Inventoried
 costs  on  commercial  aircraft  programs  and  long-term  contracts  include  direct  engineering,  production  and  tooling  and  other  non-recurring
 costs,  and  applicable  overhead,  which  includes  fringe  benefits,  production  related  indirect  and  plant  management  salaries  and  plantservices, not in excess of
 estimated net realizable value. To the extent a material amount of such costs are related to an abnormal event or are fixedcosts
 not appropriately attributable to our programs or contracts, they are expensed in the current period rather than inventoried. Inventoried costsinclude
 amounts relating to programs and contracts with long-term production cycles, a portion of which is not expected to be realized within oneyear. Included in inventory for federal government contracts is an allocati
on of allowable costs related to manufacturing process reengineering.Commercial aircraft programs
 inventory includes deferred production costs and supplier advances. Deferred production costs represent actual costsincurred for
 production of early units that exceed the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity. Higher production costsare
 experienced at the beginning of a new or derivative airplane program. Units produced early in a program require substantially more effort (laborand
 other  resources)  than  units  produced  later  in  a  program  because  of  volume  efficiencies  and  the  effects  of  learning.  We  expect  that  thesedeferred
 costs will be fully recovered when all units included in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries isbelow
 the estimated average cost of all units in the program. Supplier advances represent payments for parts we have contracted to receive fromsuppliers in the future. As parts are received, supplier advances are amortize
d to work in process.The
 determination of net realizable value of long-term contract costs is based upon quarterly reviews that estimate costs to be incurred to completeall
 contract requirements. When actual contract costs and the estimate to complete exceed total estimated contract revenues, a loss provision isrecorded.
 The determination of net realizable value of commercial aircraft program costs is based upon quarterly program reviews that estimaterevenue
 and  cost  to  be  incurred  to  complete  the  program  accounting  quantity.  When  estimated  costs  to  complete  exceed  estimated  programrevenues to go, a program loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss o
n all undelivered units in the accounting quantity.75

Table of ContentsUsed
 aircraft purchased by the Commercial Airplanes segment and general stock materials are stated at cost not in excess of net realizable value.See ‘Aircraft Valuation’ within this
 Note for a discussion of our valuation of used aircraft. Spare parts inventory is stated at lower of average unit costor
 net realizable value. We review our commercial spare parts and general stock materials quarterly to identify impaired inventory, including excessor obsolete inventory,
 based on historical sales trends, expected production usage, and the size and age of the aircraft fleet using the part. Impairedinventories are charged to Cost of products in the period the impairment occurs.
Included
 in inventory for commercial aircraft programs are amounts paid or credited in cash, or other consideration to certain airline customers, thatare
 referred to as early issue sales consideration. Early issue sales consideration is recognized as a reduction to revenue when the delivery of theaircraft under contract
 occurs. If an airline customer does not perform and take delivery of the contracted aircraft, we believe that we would have theability
 to recover amounts paid. However, to the extent early issue sales consideration exceeds advances and is not considered to be otherwiserecoverable, it would be written off in the current period.
Precontract Costs
We
 may, from time to time, incur costs in excess of the amounts required for existing contracts. If we determine the costs are probable of recoveryfrom
 future  orders,  then  we  capitalize  the  precontract  costs  we  incur,  excluding  start-up  costs  which  are  expensed  as  incurred.  Capitalizedprecontract
 costs  are  included  in  Inventories  in  the  accompanying  Consolidated  Statements  of  Financial  Position.  Should  future  orders  notmaterialize or we determine the costs are no longer probabl
e of recovery, the capitalized costs would be written off.Property, Plant and Equipment
Property,
 plant  and  equipment  are  recorded  at  cost,  including  applicable  construction-period  interest,  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  aredepreciat
ed principally over the following estimated useful lives: new buildings and land improvements, from 10 to 40 years; and new machinery andequipment, from
 4 to 20 years. The principal methods of depreciation are as follows: buildings and land improvements, 150% declining balance; andmachinery
 and equipment, sum-of-the-years’ digits. Capitalized internal use software is included in Other assets and amortized using the straightline method over 5
 years. Capitalized software as a service is included in Other assets and amortized using the straight line method over the term ofthe
 hosting arrangement which is typically no greater than 10 years. We periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable livesassigned to long-lived assets, inclu
ding assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition.Long-lived
 assets  held  for  sale  are  stated  at  the  lower  of  cost  or  fair  value  less  cost  to  sell.  Long-lived  assets  held  for  use  are  subject  to  animpairment
 assessment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carryingvalue
 is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference betweenthe carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.
Leases 
We  determine  if  an  arrangement  is,  or  contains,  a  lease  at  the  inception  date.  Operating  leases  are  included  in  Other  assets,  with  therelated
 liabilities  included  in  Accrued  liabilities  and  Other  long-term  liabilities.  Assets  under  finance  leases,  which  primarily  represent  computerequipme
nt, are included in Property, plant and equipment, net, with the related liabilities included in Short-term debt and current portion of long-termdebt and Long-term debt on the Consolidate
d Statements of Financial Position.Operating
 lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make leasepayments
 arising from the lease. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimatedpresent
76

Table of Contentsvalue of
 lease payments over the lease term. We use our estimated incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments.Variable
 components of the lease payments such as fair market value adjustments, utilities, and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred andnot included in
 determining the present value. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that wewill exercise that option. Lease expens
e is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.We have lease agreements with lease and n
on-lease components which are accounted for as a single lease component.Asset Retirement Obligations
We
 record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liability’s fair value can be reasonably estimated, including certain asbestos removal,asset decommissioning and contractual le
ase restoration obligations. Recorded amounts are not material.We
 also  have  known  conditional  asset  retirement  obligations,  such  as  certain  asbestos  remediation  and  asset  decommissioning  activities  to  beperformed in
 the future, that are not reasonably estimable due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation.Accordingly,
 these obligations have not been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. A liability for these obligations will be recorded inthe
 period when sufficient information regarding timing and method of settlement becomes available to make a reasonable estimate of the liability’sfair
 value. In addition, there may be conditional asset retirement obligations that we have not yet discovered (e.g. asbestos may exist in certainbuildings
 but we have not become aware of it through the normal course of business), and therefore, these obligations also have not been includedin the Consolidated Financial
 Statements.Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangibles
Goodwill
 and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized,  but are tested for impairment  annually and when an eventoccurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. Our annual testing date is April 1.
We
 test  goodwill  for  impairment  by  performing  a  qualitative  assessment  or  using  a  quantitative  test.  If  we  choose  to  perform  a  qualitativeassessment and determine it
 is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, thequantitative
 test is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the quantitative test is used, we compare thecarrying
 value of net assets to the estimated fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, theshortfall up to the carrying value of the goodwill represe
nts the amount of goodwill impairment.Indefinite-lived
 intangibles  consist  of  a  brand  and  trade  name  and  in-process  research  and  development  (IPR&D)  acquired  in  businesscombinations.
 IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. IPR&Dis
 reclassified to finite-lived acquired intangible assets when a project is completed, and then amortized on a straight-line basis over the asset’sestimated
 useful life. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing the carrying values to current projections of related discounted cashflows. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flo
ws represents the amount of the impairment.Our
 finite-lived acquired intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: developed technology,from 4
 to 14 years; product know-how, from 6 to 30 years; customer base, from 3 to 17 years; distribution rights, from 3 to 27 years; and other, from1
 to 32 years. We evaluate the potential impairment of finite-lived acquired intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicatethat the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying
77

Table of Contentsvalue
 is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference betweenthe carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.
Investments
Time deposits are held-to-maturity investments that are carried at cost.
Available-for-sale
 debt securities include commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Available-for-saledebt
 securities  are  recorded  at  fair  value,  and  unrealized  gains  and  losses  are  recorded,  net  of  tax,  as  a  component  of  accumulated  othercomprehensive
 income. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are recognized based on the specific identification method.Available-for-sale debt securities are assesse
d for impairment quarterly.The
 equity method of accounting is used to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control,over
 an investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of an investee of between20% and 50%. The cumulative earnings ap
proach is used for cash flow classification of distributions received from equity method investments.Other
 Equity  investments  are  recorded  at  fair  value,  with  gains  and  losses  recorded  through  net  earnings.  Equity  investments  without  readilydeterminable
 fair  value  are  measured  at  cost,  less  impairments,  plus  or  minus  observable  price  changes.  Equity  investments  without  readilydeterminable fair value are assessed for impairment quarterly.
We
 classify  investment  income  and  loss  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations  based  on  whether  the  investment  is  operating  or  non-operatin
g in nature. Operating investments align strategically and are integrated with our operations. Earnings from operating investments, includingour
 share of income or loss from equity method investments, dividend income from other equity investments, and any impairments or gain/loss onthe disposition of these
 investments, are recorded in Income from operating investments, net. Non-operating investments are those we hold for non-strategic
 purposes. Earnings from non-operating investments, including interest and dividends on marketable securities, and any impairments orgain/loss on the disposition of these inv
estments are recorded in Other income/(loss), net.Derivatives
All
 derivative instruments are recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent of holding them.We
 use derivative instruments to principally manage a variety of market risks. For our cash flow hedges, the derivative’s gain or loss is initiallyreported
 in comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecastedtransaction
 affects  earnings.  We  have  agreements  to  purchase  and  sell  aluminum  to  address  long-term  strategic  sourcing  objectives  andinternational
 business  requirements.  These  agreements  are  derivatives  for  accounting  purposes  but  are  not  designated  for  hedge  accountingtreatment.
 We also hold certain derivative instruments for economic purposes that are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. For thesealuminum
 agreements  and  for  other  derivative  instruments  not  designated  for  hedge  accounting  treatment,  the  changes  in  their  fair  value  arerecorded in earnings immediately.
Allowances for losses on certain financial assets
We
 establish allowances for credit losses on accounts receivable, unbilled receivables, customer financing receivables, and certain other financialassets.
 The adequacy  of these  allowances are  assessed  quarterly  through  consideration  of  factors  including, but  not limited  to,  customer  creditratings, bankruptcy filings, published or estimated credit defa
ult rates, age of the receivable, expected loss rates78

Table of Contentsand
 collateral  exposures.  We  assign  internal  credit  ratings  for  all  customers  and  determine  the  creditworthiness  of  each  customer  based  uponpublicly
 available information and information obtained directly from our customers. Our rating categories are comparable to those used by majorcredit rating agencies.
Aircraft Valuation
Used
 aircraft under trade-in commitments and aircraft under repurchase commitments In  conjunction with signing a definitive agreement forthe
 sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in usedaircraft
 at a specified price upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. Additionally, we have entered into contingent repurchase commitments with certaincustomers
 wherein we agree to repurchase the Sale Aircraft at a specified price, generally 10 to 15 years after delivery of the Sale Aircraft. Ourrepurchase
 of the Sale Aircraft is contingent upon a future, mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft. If we execute anagreement
 for  the  sale  of  additional  new  aircraft,  and  if  the  customer  exercises  its  right  to  sell  the  Sale  Aircraft  to  us,  a  contingent  repurchasecommitment would become a
 trade-in commitment. Our historical experience is that contingent repurchase commitments infrequently become trade-in commitments.
Exposure related to trade-in commitments may take the form of:
(1)
adjustments to revenue for the difference between the contractual trade-in price in the definitive agreement and our best estimate of thefair value of the trade-in aircraft as of the date of such agreement, which would be recogniz
ed upon delivery of the Sale Aircraft, and/or(2)
charges  to  cost  of  products  for  adverse  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  trade-in  aircraft  that  occur  subsequent  to  signing  of  a  definitiveagreement
 for Sale Aircraft but prior to the purchase of the used trade-in aircraft. Estimates based on current aircraft values would beincluded in Accrued liabilitie
s.The
 fair value of trade-in aircraft is determined using aircraft-specific data such as model, age and condition, market conditions for specific aircraftand
 similar  models,  and  multiple  valuation  sources.  This  process  uses  our  assessment  of  the  market  for  each  trade-in  aircraft,  which  in  mostinstances
 begins years before the return of the aircraft. There are several possible markets in which we continually pursue opportunities to placeused
 aircraft. These markets include, but are not limited to, the resale market, which could potentially include the cost of long-term storage; theleasing
 market,  with  the  potential  for  refurbishment  costs  to  meet  the  leasing  customer’s  requirements;  or  the  scrap  market.  Trade-in  aircraftvaluation
 varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft. On a quarterly basis, we update our valuationanalysis
 based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into a market or using current published third-party aircraft valuationsbased on the type and age of the aircraft, adjusted for individu
al attributes and known conditions.Used aircraft
 acquired by the Commercial Airplanes segment are included in Inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value as it is our intentto
 sell these assets. To mitigate costs and enhance marketability, aircraft may be placed on operating lease. While on operating lease, the assetsare included in Customer financing.
Customer
 financing Customer  financing includes operating lease equipment, notes receivable, and sales-type/finance leases. Sales-type/financeleases are treated as receivables, and allo
wances for losses are established as necessary.We
 assess  the  fair  value  of  the  assets  we  own,  including  equipment  under  operating  leases,  assets  held  for  sale  or  re-lease,  and  collateralunderlying receivables, to determine if their fair values are l
ess79

Table of Contentsthan
 the  related  assets’  carrying  values.  Differences  between  carrying  values  and  fair  values  of  sales-type/finance  leases  and  notes  and  otherreceivables, as determined by collateral val
ue, are considered in determining the allowance for losses on receivables.We
 use a median calculated from published collateral values from multiple third-party aircraft value publications based on the type and age of theaircraft
 to determine the fair value of aircraft. Under certain circumstances,  we apply judgment based on the attributes  of the specific aircraft orequipment,
 usually  when  the  features  or  use  of  the  aircraft  vary  significantly  from  the  more  generic  aircraft  attributes  covered  by  outsidepublications.
Impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for sale or re-lease
 We  evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease orassets
 held for sale or re-lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may beless
 than the carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow, including our intentions for howlong
 we will hold an asset subject to operating lease before it is sold, the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset,periods
 in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic lifeof the asset. We record assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.
When
 we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value overthe fair value of the asset.
Allowance
 for losses on customer financing receivables We  record the potential impairment of customer financing receivables in a valuationaccount, the
 balance of which is an accounting estimate of expected but unconfirmed losses. The allowance for losses on receivables relates to twocomponents of receivables: (a) receivables that are evaluate
d individually for impairment and (b) all other receivables.We
 determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is expected that we will be unable to collect amounts dueaccording
 to  the  original contractual terms  of  the  receivable agreement,  without regard  to  any  subsequent restructurings.  Factors  considered inassessing
 collectability include, but are not limited to, a customer’s extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. Wedetermine
 a specific impairment allowance based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of therelated collateral we would exp
ect to realize.We
 review the adequacy of the allowance attributable  to the remaining receivables (after  excluding receivables subject to a specific impairmentallowa
nce) by assessing both the collateral exposure and the applicable cumulative default rate. Collateral exposure for a particular receivable is theexcess
 of the carrying value of the receivable over the fair value of the related collateral. A receivable with an estimated fair value in excess of thecarrying
 value is considered to have no collateral exposure. The applicable cumulative default rate is determined using two components: customercredit
 ratings and weighted average remaining contract term. Internally assigned credit ratings, our credit quality indicator, are determined for eachcustomer in the portfolio. Those ratings are updated based up
on public information and information obtained directly from our customers.We
 have entered into agreements with certain customers that would entitle us to look beyond the specific collateral underlying the receivable forpurposes
 of determining the collateral exposure as described above. Should the proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral asset resultingfrom
 a default condition be insufficient to cover the carrying value of our receivable (creating a shortfall condition), these agreements would, forexample,
 permit us to take the actions necessary to sell or retain certain other assets in which the customer has an equity interest and use theproceeds to cover the shortfall.

Table of ContentsEach quarter we review customer
 credit ratings, published historical credit default rates for different rating categories, and multiple third-party aircraftvalue
 publications as a basis to validate the reasonableness of the allowance for losses on receivables. There can be no assurance that actualresults
 will not differ from estimates or that the consideration of these factors in the future will not result in an increase or decrease to the allowancefor losses on receivables.
Warranties
In conjunction with certain product sales, we provide warranties that cover factors such as non-conformance to specifications and defects in material
and
 design. The majority of our warranties are issued by our Commercial Airplanes segment. Generally, aircraft sales are accompanied by a 3 to 4-year
 standard warranty for systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us or manufactured to certain standards underour
 authorization. These warranties are included in the programs’ estimate at completion. On occasion we have made commitments beyond thestandard
 warranty obligation to correct fleet-wide major issues of a particular model, resulting in additional accrued warranty expense. Warrantiesissued
 by our BDS segment principally relate to sales of military aircraft and weapons systems. These sales are generally accompanied by a sixmonth
 to  two-year  warranty  period  and  cover  systems,  accessories,  equipment,  parts,  and  software  manufactured  by  us  to  certain  contractualspecifications.
 Estimated costs related to standard warranties are recorded in the period in which the related product delivery occurs. The warrantyliabil
ity recorded at each balance sheet date reflects the estimated number of months of warranty coverage outstanding for products delivered timesthe
 average of historical monthly warranty payments, as well as additional amounts for certain major warranty issues that exceed a normal claimslevel. Estimated costs of these additional warranty issues are cons
idered changes to the initial liability estimate.We
 provide  guarantees  to  certain  commercial  airplane  customers  which  include  compensation  provisions  for  failure  to  meet  specified  aircraftperformance
 targets. We account for these performance guarantees as warranties. The estimated liability for these warranties is based on knownand
 anticipated operational characteristics and forecasted customer operation of the aircraft relative to contractually specified performance targets,and
 anticipated settlements when contractual remedies are not specified. Estimated payments are recorded as a reduction of revenue at delivery ofthe
 related  aircraft.  We  have  agreements  that  require  certain  suppliers  to  compensate  us  for  amounts  paid  to  customers  for  failure  of  suppliedequipment
 to meet specified performance targets. Claims against suppliers under these agreements are included in Inventories and recorded as areduction
 in  Cost  of  products  at  delivery  of  the  related  aircraft.  These  performance  warranties  and  claims  against  suppliers  are  included  in  theprograms’ estimate at completion.
Supplier Penalties
We
 record an accrual for supplier penalties when an event occurs that makes it probable that a supplier penalty will be incurred and the amount isreasonably estimable. Until an event occurs, we fully a
nticipate accepting all products procured under production-related contracts.Guarantees
We
 record a liability in Accrued liabilities for the fair value of guarantees. For credit guarantees, the liability is equal to the present value of theexpected loss. We determine the expected loss by multiplyin
g the creditor’s default rate by the guarantee amount reduced by the expected recovery,if applicable. At inception of a guarante
e, and adjusted each quarter, we also recognize a liability for the expected contingent loss.81

Table of ContentsNote 3 – Earnings Per Share
Basic
 and diluted earnings per share are computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method that determines earningsper
 share  for  common  shares  and  participating  securities.  The  undistributed  earnings  are  allocated  between  common  shares  and  participatingsecurities
 as if all earnings had been distributed during the period. Participating securities and common shares have equal rights to undistributedearnings.
Basic
 earnings  per  share  is  calculated  by  taking  net  earnings,  less  earnings  available  to  participating  securities,  divided  by  the  basic  weightedaverage common shares outstanding.
Diluted
 earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities, divided by the diluted weightedaverage common shares outstanding.
The elements used in the computation of basic and d
iluted earnings per share were as follows:(In millions - except per share amounts)

   On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was enacted, which includes a five year net operatingloss

($924) $270 The
 Company’s deferred income tax assets of $11,600 can be used in future years to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable. TheCompany’
s deferred income tax liabilities of $9,430 will partially offset deferred income tax assets and result in higher taxable income in future yearsand
 increase  income  taxes  payable.  Tax  law  determines  whether  future  reversals  of  temporary  differences  will  result  in  taxable  and  deductibleamounts
 that offset each other in future years. The particular years in which temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts generallyare
 determined by the timing of the recovery of the related asset or settlement of the related liability. The deferred income tax assets and liabilitiesrelate
 primarily  to  U.S.  federal  and  state  tax  jurisdictions.  From  a  U.S.  federal  tax  perspective  the  Company  does  not  have  any  significant  netoperating
 loss carryforwards nor does it have any significant federal tax credits that are at risk of expiring. The Company generated taxable incomein
 2018 and 2019 and expects to have a tax net operating loss in 2020 that will be carried back to prior years when the tax rate was 35% due to theCARES Act benefit as described above.
During
 2019  and  2020  the  Company  generated  significant  pre-tax  losses  and  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020  the  Company  reached  a  three-yearcumulative pre-tax loss position. We
 also normalized earnings and other comprehensive income for certain non-recurring items including certain 737MAX
 expenses,  an  agreement  with  the  Department  of  Justice,  severance  costs  and  remeasurement  gains  and  losses  from  the  annualremeasurement
 of  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefit  obligations.  On  a  normalized  basis  the  Company  expects  to  reach  a  three-yearcumulative loss position in 2021 as record e
arnings in 2018 are replaced by 2021 results. For purposes of assessing the recoverability of deferred(1)(
1)     86

Table of Contentstax assets, the Company determined that it could not include future projected e
arnings in the analysis due to recent history of losses.As
 of December 31, 2020 the Company has recorded valuation allowances of $3,094 primarily  for certain federal deferred tax assets,  state netoperating
 loss carryforwards, and state tax credits. To measure the valuation allowance, the Company estimated in what year each of its deferredtax
 assets and liabilities would reverse using systematic and logical methods to determine the reversal patterns. Based on these methods, deferredtax liabilities are assumed to reverse
 and generate taxable income over the next 5 to 10 years while deferred tax assets related to pension and otherpostretirement
 benefit  obligations  are  assumed  to  reverse  and  generate  tax  deductions  over  the  next  15  to  20  years.  The  valuation  allowanceprimarily
 results from not having sufficient income from deferred tax liability reversals in the appropriate future periods to support the realization ofdeferred
 tax  assets.  Because  the  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefit  obligations  are  recorded  to  both  continuing  operations  and  othercomprehensive
 income (OCI), the Company recorded a portion of the fourth quarter increase in the valuation allowance to income tax expense incontinui
ng operations ($2,513) and a portion to OCI ($196). If the Company continues to generate losses and negative normalized earnings in futureperiods,
 additional  valuation  allowances  may  have  to  be  recorded  with  corresponding  adverse  impacts  on  earnings  and/or  OCI.  When  incomegeneration returns to more normal levels we can expect to see the allo
wance reverse and increase reported earnings and/or OCI.The
 TCJA one-time repatriation tax and Global Intangible Low Tax Income liabilities effectively taxed the undistributed earnings previously deferredfrom
 U.S. income taxes. We have not provided for foreign withholding tax on the undistributed earnings from our non-U.S. subsidiaries becausesuch
 earnings  are  considered  to  be  indefinitely  reinvested.  If  such  earnings  were  to  be  distributed,  any  foreign  withholding  tax  would  not  besignificant.
As
 of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the amounts accrued for the payment of income tax-related interest and penalties included in the ConsolidatedStatements

 supply agreement that terminates on March 31, 2021. The inventory balance was $17 and $176 at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Seeindemnifications to ULA in Note 14.
Commercial
 spare parts, used aircraft, general stock materials and other includes capitalized precontract costs of $733 at December 31, 2020 and$711 at December 31, 2019 primarily related to KC-46A Ta
nker and Commercial Crew. See Note 13.Commercial Aircraft Programs
The increase in
 commercial aircraft programs inventory during 2020 reflects the large number of undelivered aircraft due to the 737 MAX grounding,lower
 wide-body deliveries driven by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and 787 production issues and associated rework, partially offset by areach-forward
 loss  of  $6,493  on the  777X  program.  At  December  31,  2020,  commercial  aircraft  programs  inventory  includes  approximately  425undelivered 737 MAX aircraft and 80 und
elivered 787 aircraft.We are currently remarketing certain aircraft and may have to
 remarket additional aircraft in future periods. If we are unable to successfully remarketthe
 aircraft, determine further production rates reductions are necessary, and/or contract the program accounting quantities, future earnings may bereduced and/or additional reach-forward l
osses may have to be recorded.At
 December  31,  2020  and  2019,  commercial  aircraft  programs  inventory  included  the  following  amounts  related  to  the  737  program:  deferredproduction
 costs of $2,159 and $1,313 and unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs of $480 and $521. At December 31, 2020, $2,560 of737
 deferred production costs, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be recovered from units included in the programaccounti
ng quantity that have firm orders and $79 is expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that representexpected future orders.
At
 December 31, 2020 and 2019, commercial aircraft programs inventory included the following amounts related to the 777X program: unamortizedtooling
 and other non-recurring costs of $3,295 and $2,914. During the fourth quarter of 2020 we determined that estimated costs to complete the777X
 program  plus costs  already  included in 777X inventory  exceed  estimated  revenues  from  the program.  The resulting  reach-forward  loss  of$6,493
 was recorded as a reduction to deferred production costs. As a result, 777X deferred production costs were immaterial at December 31,2020.
 The level of profitability on the 777X program will be subject to a number of factors. These factors include continued market uncertainty, theimpacts
 of COVID-19 on our production system as well as impacts on our supply chain and customers, further production rate adjustments for the777X
 or other commercial aircraft programs, contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risks associated with the testing program and thetiming of aircraft certification. One or more of these factors could result in additional reach-forward losses on the 777
X program in future periods.89

Table of ContentsAt
 December  31,  2020  and  2019,  commercial  aircraft  programs  inventory  included  the  following  amounts  related  to  the  787  program:  deferredproduction
 costs of $14,976 and $18,716, $1,865 and $2,202 of supplier advances, and $1,863 and $2,092 of unamortized tooling and other non-recurring
 costs. At December 31, 2020, $12,165 of 787 deferred production costs, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expectedto
 be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that have firm orders and $4,674 is expected to be recovered from unitsincluded in the program accounting q

Unbilled
 receivables decreased from $9,043 at December 31, 2019 to $7,995 at December 31, 2020, primarily driven by an increase in billings atBDS and BGS, as well as an increase in al

Certain
 commercial airplane customers are experiencing liquidity issues and seeking additional capital. Should these customers fail to address theirliquidity
 issues,  accounts  receivable,  unbilled  receivables  and  certain  inventory  could  become  impaired.  In  addition  we  would  have  to  removecontracts related to these customers from backlog and remarket any undelivered aircraft.

Table of ContentsWe
 evaluate the collectability of customer financing receivables at commencement and on a recurring basis. If a customer financing receivable isdeemed
 uncollectible, the customer is categorized as non-accrual status. When a customer is in non-accrual status at commencement, sales-typelease
 revenue is deferred until substantially all cash has been received or the customer is removed from non-accrual status. If a customer statuschanges
 to  non-accrual  after  commencement  or  is  a  direct  finance  lease  and  sufficient  collateral  is  available,  we  recognize  contractual  interestincome as payments are 
received to the extent payments exceed past due principal payments. If there is not sufficient collateral, then revenue is notrecognized
 until payments exceed the principal balance. Receivables in non-accrual status as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were$380 and $388. Interest income received for the twelve and three months e
nded December 31, 2020 was $34 and $8.The
 adequacy of the allowance for losses is assessed quarterly. Four primary factors influencing the level of our allowance for losses on customerfinancing
 receivables  are  customer  credit  ratings,  default  rates,  expected  loss  rate  and  collateral  values,  which  may  be  adversely  affected  byimpacts
 that  COVID-19  has  on  our  customers.  We  assign  internal  credit  ratings  for  all  customers  and  determine  the  creditworthiness  of  eachcustomer
 based upon publicly available information and information obtained directly from our customers. Our rating categories are comparable tothose used by the major credit rating agencies.
Our
 allowance for losses on receivables decreased from $8 to $5 on January 1, 2020 upon adoption of ASU 2016-13. See Note 6 – Allowances forLosses on Financial Assets.

bles.Customer Financing Exposure
Customer
 financing is collateralized by security in the related asset. The value of the collateral is closely tied to commercial airline performance andoverall
 market conditions and may be subject to reduced valuation with market decline. Certain collateral values are being adversely impacted bythe changes in market conditions driven
 by the COVID-19 pandemic. Declines in collateral values could result in asset impairments, reduced financelease
 income, and an increase in the allowance for losses. Our customer financing collateral is concentrated in out-of-production aircraft and 747-8aircraft. Generally, out-of-production aircraft have experienced greater collateral va
lue declines than in-production aircraft.92

In
 2019,  following  two  fatal  737  MAX  accidents,  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  and  non-U.S.  civil  aviation  authorities  issued  orderssuspending
 commercial operations of 737 MAX aircraft. Deliveries of the 737 MAX were suspended following these orders. Deliveries in the U.S.resumed in late 2020 following resciss
ion by the FAA of its grounding order.Multiple
 legal  actions  have  been  filed  against  us  as  a  result  of  the  accidents.  In  addition,  we  are  fully  cooperating  with  U.S.  governmentinvestigations
 related  to  the  accidents  and  the  737  MAX  program,  including  an  investigation  by  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  theoutcome of which may be material. Other than as described below with respect to the U.S. Department of Justice, we cann

ly estimate a range of loss, if any, not covered by available insurance that may result given the current status of the lawsuits, investigationsand inquiries related to the 737 MAX.
On
 January  6,  2021,  we  entered  into  a  Deferred  Prosecution  Agreement  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  that  resolves  the  Department  ofJustice’s
 previously disclosed investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX airplane by the FAA. Under the terms of the DeferredProsecution
 Agreement, we agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging the Company with one count of conspiracy to defraud the UnitedStates,
 based on the conduct of two former 737 MAX program technical pilots; the criminal information will be dismissed after three years, providedthat
 we comply with our obligations under the agreement. The Deferred Prosecution Agreement requires that we make payments totaling $2.51billio
n, which consist of (a) a $243.6 million criminal monetary penalty; (b) $500 million in additional compensation to the heirs and/or beneficiaries ofthose
 who died in the Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 accidents; and (c) $1.77 billion to the Company’s airline customers forharm
 incurred as a result of the grounding of the 737 MAX, offset in part by payments already made and the remainder satisfied through paymentsto
 be made prior to the termination of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. The agreement also requires that we review our compliance programand
 undertake continuous improvement efforts with respect to it, and implement enhanced compliance reporting and internal controls mechanisms.Of
 the payments described above, $1.77 billion has been included in amounts reserved in prior quarters for 737 MAX customer considerations. Weexpensed $743.6 million i
n the fourth quarter of 2020 related to this agreement.During
 the fourth quarter of 2020, the FAA rescinded the order that grounded 737 MAX aircraft and issued an Airworthiness Directive specifyingrequirements
 that must be met before U.S. carriers can resume service, including installing software enhancements, completing wire separationmodification,
 conducting pilot training and performing maintenance steps to prepare parked aircraft to fly again. The FAA also issued a ContinuedAirworthiness
 Notification to the International Community, and published the 737 MAX training requirements. The FAA must approve 737 MAX pilottraining
 program  revisions  for  each  U.S.  airline  operating  the  aircraft  and  has  indicated  its  intent  to  retain  its  authority  to  issue  airworthinesscertificates
 and export  certificates  of  airworthiness  for  all new 737 MAX aircraft  manufactured  subsequent  to  the grounding  order.  The BrazilianNational
 Civil Aviation Agency approved return of operations in the fourth quarter of 2020, and Transport Canada and the European Union AviationSafety Agency (EASA)
 approved return of operations in the first quarter of 2021.In
 December  2020,  we  delivered  27  aircraft,  in  compliance  with  the  FAA  regulatory  requirements  described  above.  We  have  assumed  that  theremaining
 non-U.S.  regulatory  approvals  will  occur  and  enable  deliveries  during  the  first  half  of  2021.  We  have  approximately  425  airplanes  ininventory as
 of December 31, 2020. A number of customers have requested to defer deliveries or to cancel orders for 737 MAX aircraft, and we areremarketing
 and/or delaying deliveries of certain aircraft included within inventory. We now expect to deliver about half of the 737 MAX aircraft ininventory
 by the end of 2021. In the event that we are unable to resume aircraft deliveries in non-U.S. jurisdictions consistent with our assumptionsof regulatory approval timing, our expectation of delivery timing co
uld be impacted.Due to the grounding and associated suspension of
 737 MAX deliveries, we temporarily suspended 737 MAX production beginning in January 2020.We resumed early stages of 737 MAX production in May 2020 and co
ntinued to produce at low rates through the end of 2020.In
 addition, we reduced the number of aircraft included in the accounting quantity by 400 units in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of reductions toplanned
 production rates due to COVID-19 driven market uncertainties. As we are producing at abnormally low production rates in 2020 and 2021,we
 expect  to  incur  approximately  $5  billion  of  abnormal  production  costs  that  are  being  expensed  as  incurred.  The  slowdown  in  the  plannedproduction
 rate ramp-up increased expected abnormal costs, however this increase was offset by adjustments to the determination of the normalproduction level due to COVID-19 impacts on customer demand, as we
ll as cost reduction activities, including significant97

Table of Contentsreductions in employment levels. We expensed $
2,567 of abnormal production costs during the year ended December 31, 2020.In
 addition to impacts related to the 737 MAX accidents and subsequent grounding, the 737 program continues to be significantly impacted by theCOVID-19 pandemic and its effect
 on aircraft demand. These impacts have resulted in lower production and delivery rate assumptions. We currentlyexpect
 to  gradually  increase  the  production  rate  to  31  per  month  by  early  2022.  We  currently  assume  that  we  will  implement  further  gradualproduction rate increases in subsequent periods based on
 market demand. The ongoing impacts of COVID-19 on market demand have also createdsignificant
 uncertainty around the timing of deliveries of 737 MAX aircraft in inventory. We may need to recognize additional costs associated withremarketing and/or reconfiguring aircraft in inventory, which may reduce reven
ue and/or earnings in future periods.We
 have also recorded additional expenses of $416 and $328 due to the 737 MAX grounding during 2020 and 2019, which include costs related tostorage, inventory impairment, pilot training, and software updates.

 are working with our customers to minimize the impact to their operations from grounded and undelivered aircraft. We continue to reassess theliability
 for  estimated  potential  concessions  and  other  considerations  to  customers  on  a  quarterly  basis.  This  reassessment  includes  updatingestimates to
 reflect revisions to return to service, delivery and production rate assumptions driven by timing of regulatory approvals, as well as latestinformation
 based on engagements with 737 MAX customers.  The liability represents  our current  best estimate of future concessions and otherconsiderations
 to customers, and is necessarily based on a series of assumptions. It is subject to change in future quarters as negotiations withcustomers
 mature and timing and conditions of return to service are better understood. The liability balance of $5.5 billion at December 31, 2020include
s $2.3 billion expected to be liquidated by lower customer delivery payments, $0.6 billion expected to be paid in cash and $0.1 billion in otherconcessions.
 Of the cash payments to customers, we expect to pay $0.3 billion in 2021 and $0.3 billion in 2022. The type of consideration to beprovided for the remaining $2.5 billio
n will depend on the outcomes of negotiations with customers.The
 737 MAX remains grounded in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions. The civil aviation authorities in those jurisdictions will determine the timing andconditions
 of  return  to  service.  Our  assumptions  reflect  our  current  best  estimate,  but  actual  timing  and  conditions  of  return  to  service  andresumption
 of deliveries could differ from this estimate, the effect of which could be material. We are unable at this time to reasonably estimatepotential
 future additional financial impacts or a range of loss, if any, due to continued uncertainties related to the timing and conditions of return toservice,
 uncertainties related to the impacts of COVID-19 on our operations, supply chain and customers, future changes to the production rate,supply
 chain impacts, and/or the results of negotiations with particular customers. Any such impacts, including any changes in our estimates, couldhave a material adverse effect on our financial positio
n, results of operations, and/or cash flows. For example, we expect that, in the event98

Table of Contentsthat
 we  are  unable  to  resume  aircraft  deliveries  in  non-U.S.  jurisdictions  consistent  with  our  assumptions,  the  continued  absence  of  revenue,earnings,
 and cash flows associated with 737 MAX deliveries would continue to have a material impact on our operating results. In the event thatfuture
 production rate increases occur at a slower rate or take longer than we are currently assuming, we expect that the growth in inventory andother
 cash flow impacts  associated  with production  would decrease.  However,  while any prolonged production  suspension or delays in plannedproduction
 rate  increases  could  mitigate  the  impact  on  our  liquidity,  it  could  significantly  increase  the  overall  expected  costs  to  produce  aircraftincluded in the accounting q
uantity, which would reduce 737 program margins and/or increase abnormal production costs in the future.Commercial
 air traffic has fallen dramatically due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While this trend has impacted passenger traffic most severely, near-term
 cargo traffic has also fallen significantly due to the global economic downturn and the reduction in cargo capacity on passenger airplanes.Airlines
 have  significantly  reduced  their  capacity,  and  many  could  implement  further  reductions  in  the  near  future.  Many  airlines  are  alsoimplement
ing significant reductions in staffing. These capacity changes are causing, and are expected to continue to cause, negative impacts to ourcustomers’
 revenue, earnings, and cash flow, and in some cases may threaten the future viability of some of our customers, potentially causingdefaults
 within  our  customer  financing  portfolio  and/or  requiring  us  to  remarket  aircraft  that  have  already  been  produced  and/or  are  currently  inbacklog.
 If 737 MAX aircraft remain grounded for an extended period of time in non-U.S. jurisdictions, we may experience additional reductions tobacklog
 and/or  significant  order  cancellations.  Additionally,  we  may  experience  fewer  new  orders  and  increased  cancellations  across  all  of  ourcommercial
 airplane programs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated impacts on demand. Our customers may also lack sufficientliquidity
 to purchase new aircraft due to impacts from the pandemic. We are also observing a significant increase in the number of requests forpayment
 deferrals,  contract  modifications,  lease  restructurings  and  similar  actions,  and  these  trends  may  lead  to  additional  earnings  charges,impairments
 and other  adverse  financial impacts  in our business over  time.  In addition,  to the extent  that  customers  have valid rights  to cancelundelivered aircraft, we may be
 required to refund pre-delivery payments, putting additional constraints on our liquidity. There is risk that the industryimplements
 longer-term strategies involving reduced capacity, shifting route patterns, and mitigation strategies related to impacts from COVID-19and the risk of future public health crises. In addition, airlines may exp
erience reduced demand due to reluctance by the flying public to travel.As
 a result, there is significant uncertainty with respect to when commercial air traffic levels will begin to recover, and whether and at what pointcapacity
 will  return  to  and/or  exceed  pre-COVID-19  levels.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  also  has  increased,  and  its  aftermath  is  also  expected  tocontinue
 to increase, uncertainty with respect to global trade volumes, putting significant negative pressure on cargo traffic. Any of these factorswould
 have a significant impact on the demand for both single-aisle and wide-body commercial aircraft, as well as for the services we provide tocommercial
 airlines.  In  addition,  a lengthy period  of  reduced industry-wide  demand for  commercial  aircraft  would put additional  pressure  on oursuppliers,
 resulting  in  increased  procurement  costs  and/or  additional  supply  chain  disruption.  To  the  extent  that  the  COVID-19  pandemic  or  itsaftermath
 further impacts demand for our products and services or impairs the viability of some of our customers and/or suppliers, our financialcondition, results of operations, and cash flows coul
d be adversely affected, and those impacts could be material.99

 increase in the product warranty reserve during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is primarily driven by charges related to “pickleforks”
 on 737NG aircraft. During 2019, we detected cracks in the "pickle forks", a frame fitting component of the structure connecting the wings tothe
 fuselages  of  737NG  aircraft.  We  notified  the  FAA,  which  issued  a  directive  requiring  that  certain  737NG  airplanes  be  inspected.  We  haveestimated
 the number of aircraft that will have to be repaired in the future and provisioned for the estimated costs of completing the repairs. Werecognized
 charges  of  $135  in  2019  for  current  and  projected  future  aircraft  repairs.  During  the  first  quarter  of  2020,  we  recognized  additionalcharges
 of $336 based on revised engineering and fleet utilization estimates as well as updated repair cost estimates. We cannot estimate a rangeof
 reasonably possible losses, if any, in excess of amounts recognized due to the ongoing nature of the inspections and repairs and pending thecompletion of investigations into the cause of the con
dition.Commercial Aircraft Commitments
In
 conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certaincustomers that give them the right to trade in used
100

Table of Contentsaircraft
 at a specified price upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. The probability that trade-in commitments will be exercised is determined by usingboth
 quantitative  information  from  valuation  sources  and  qualitative  information  from  other  sources.  The  probability  of  exercise  is  assessedquarterly,
 or  as  events  trigger  a  change,  and  takes  into  consideration  the  current  economic  and  airline  industry  environments.  Trade-incommitments,
 which can be terminated by mutual consent with the customer, may be exercised only during the period specified in the agreement,and require advance notice by the customer.
Trade-in
 commitment agreements at December 31, 2020 have expiration dates from 2021 through 2028. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, totalcontractual
 trade-in  commitments  were  $950  and $1,407.  As  of  December  31,  2020  and 2019,  we  estimated  that  it  was  probable  we would  beobligated
 to  perform  on  certain  of  these  commitments  with  net  amounts  payable  to  customers  totaling  $599  and  $711  and  the  fair  value  of  therelated trade-in aircraft was $580 and $678.
Financing Commitments
Financing
 commitments related to aircraft on order, including options and those proposed in sales campaigns, and refinancing of delivered aircraft,totaled
 $11,512  and  $13,377  as  of  December  31,  2020  and  2019.  The  estimated  earliest  potential  funding  dates  for  these  commitments  as  ofDecember 31, 2020 are as follows:

As

 that no reserve for future potential losses is required for these financing commitments based upon the terms, such as collateralizationand interest rates, under which funding woul
d be provided.Funding Commitments
We have commitments to make additional capital contributions of $2
43 to joint ventures over the next seven years.Standby Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds
We
 have  entered  into  standby  letters  of  credit  and  surety  bonds  with  financial  institutions  primarily  relating  to  the  guarantee  of  our  futureperformance
 on  certain  contracts.  Contingent  liabilities  on  outstanding  letters  of  credit  agreements  and  surety  bonds  aggregated  approximately$4,238 and $3,769 as of December 31, 2020 a

McDonnell
 Douglas Corporation insured its executives with Company Owned Life Insurance (COLI), which are life insurance policies with a cashsurrender
 value. Although we do not use COLI currently, these obligations from the merger with McDonnell Douglas are still a commitment at thistime. We have loans in place to cover costs paid or incurred to carry the underlying life i
nsurance policies. As of101

Table of ContentsDecember 31,
 2020 and 2019, the cash surrender value was $395 and $448 and the total loans were $382 and $431. As we have the right to offsetthe
 loans against the cash surrender value of the policies, we present the net asset in Other assets on the Consolidated Statements of FinancialPosition as of Dece
mber 31, 2020 and 2019.United States Government Defense Environment Overview
The
 Omnibus appropriations acts for FY21, enacted in December 2020, provided FY21 appropriations for government departments and agencies,including the United States Dep
artment of Defense (U.S. DoD), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Federal AviationAdministration.
The
 enacted FY21 appropriations included funding for Boeing’s major programs, such as the F/A-18 Super Hornet, F-15EX, CH-47 Chinook, AH-64Apache,
 V-22 Osprey, KC-46A Tanker, P-8 Poseidon and Space Launch System. However, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to futureprogram-level
 appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other government agencies, including NASA. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes,including
 changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process, could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existingcontracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial positi
on and/or cash flows.BDS Fixed-Price Development Contracts
Fixed-price
 development work is inherently uncertain and subject to significant variability in estimates of the cost and time required to complete thework.
 BDS fixed-price contracts with significant development work include Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, MQ-25, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-25B,and
 commercial  and  military  satellites.  The  operational  and  technical  complexities  of  these  contracts  create  financial  risk,  which  could  triggertermination
 provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. Changes to cost and revenue estimates could result in lowermargins
 or material charges for reach-forward losses. For example, we have recorded an increase in the reach-forward loss of $1,320 on KC-46ATanker
 in 2020. The KC-46A Tanker reach-forward loss reflects $551 of costs associated with the agreement signed in April 2020 with the U.S. AirForce
 (USAF) to develop and integrate a new Remote Vision System, and the remaining costs reflect production inefficiencies including impacts ofCOVID-19
 disruption. Moreover, our fixed-price development programs remain subject to additional reach-forward losses if we experience furtherproduction, technical or quality issues, sched
ule delays, or increased costs.KC-46A Tanker
In
 2011,  we  were  awarded  a  contract  from  the  U.S.  Air  Force  (USAF)  to  design,  develop,  manufacture  and  deliver  four  next  generation  aerialrefueling
 tankers.  This  Engineering,  Manufacturing  and  Development  (EMD)  contract  is  a  fixed-price  incentive  fee  contract  and  involves  highlycomplex
 designs and systems integration. Since 2016, the USAF has authorized five low rate initial production (LRIP) lots for a total of 67 aircraft.The EMD contract and authorized LRIP lots are valued at approx
imately $15 billion as of December 31, 2020.At
 December 31, 2020, we had approximately $463 of capitalized precontract costs and $1,281 of potential termination liabilities to suppliers. Thesevalues were primarily related to 12 aircraft in lot 6 and 15 aircraft in lot 7 for which we receive
d contract awards in January 2021.Recoverable Costs on Government Contracts
Our
 final incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and review for allowability by the U.S. government, which can result in payment demandsrelated to
 costs they believe should be disallowed. We work with the U.S. government to assess the merits of claims and where appropriate reservefor

 In  conjunction with our sales of Electron Dynamic Devices, Inc. and Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power businesses and ourBCA
 facilities in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma, we agreed to indemnify, for an indefinite period, the buyers for costs relatingto pre-closing environm
ental conditions and certain other items. We are unable to assess the potential number of future claims that may be assertedunder
 these indemnifications, nor the amounts thereof (if any). As a result, we cannot estimate the maximum potential amount of future paymentsunder these
 indemnities and therefore, no liability has been recorded. To the extent that claims have been made under these indemnities and/or areprobable and reasonably estima
ble, liabilities associated with these indemnities are included in the environmental liability disclosure in Note 13.Credit Guarantees
 We have issued c redit guarantees where we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event that the originallessee
 or  debtor  does not  make  payments  or  perform  certain  specified  services.  Generally,  these  guarantees  have been extended  on behalf  ofguaranteed
 parties  with  less  than  investment-grade  credit  and  are  collateralized  by certain  assets.  Current  outstanding  credit  guarantees  expirethrough 2036.
Industrial Revenue Bonds
Industrial
 Revenue Bonds (IRB) issued by St. Louis County were used to finance the purchase and/or construction of real and personal property atour
 St. Louis site. Tax benefits associated with IRBs include a twelve-year property tax abatement and sales tax exemption from St. Louis County.We
 record  these  properties  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Financial  Position.  We  have  also  purchased  the  IRBs  and  therefore  are  thebondholders
 as well as the borrower/lessee of the properties purchased with the IRB proceeds. The liabilities and IRB assets are equal and arereported net in the Consolidated Statements of Financ

Many
 of  our  employees  have  earned  benefits  under  defined  benefit  pension  plans.  Nonunion  and  the  majority  of  union  employees  that  hadparticipat
ed in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Additional unionemployees transitioned to company-funded d
efined contribution retirement savings plans effective January 1, 2019.We fund our major pension plans through trusts. Pension assets are pl
aced in trust solely for the benefit of the plans’ participants, and are structuredto
 maintain liquidity that is sufficient to pay benefit obligations as well as to keep pace over the long-term with the growth of obligations for futurebenefit payments.
We
 also have other postretirement benefits (OPB) other than pensions which consist principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees andqualifying
 dependents, and to a lesser extent, life insurance to certain groups of retirees. Retiree health care is provided principally until age 65 forapproximately
 two-thirds of those participants who are eligible for health care coverage. Certain employee groups, including employees covered bymost
 United Auto Workers bargaining agreements, are provided lifetime health care coverage. The funded status of the plans is measured as thedifference
 between the plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation (PBO). We have recognized the aggregate of all overfundedplans
 in Other assets, and the aggregate of all underfunded plans in either Accrued retiree health care or Accrued pension plan liability, net. Theportion of
 the amount by which the actuarial present value of benefits included in the PBO exceeds the fair value of plan assets, payable in the next12 months, is reflected in Accrued liabilities.

The
 following assumptions, which are the weighted average for all plans, are used to calculate the benefit obligation at December 31 of each yearand the net periodic benefit cost for the subsequent year.

4.30  %4.30 % 5.30 % Interest crediting rates for cash balance plans
5.00  %5.15 % 5.15 % The
 discount rate for each plan is determined based on the plans’ expected future benefit payments using a yield curve developed from high qualitybonds that
 are rated as Aa or better by at least half of the four rating agencies utilized as of the measurement date. The yield curve is fitted to yieldsdeveloped
 from bonds at various maturity points. Bonds with the ten percent highest and the ten percent lowest yields are omitted. The presentvalue of each plan’s benefits is calcu
lated by applying the discount rates to projected benefit cash flows.The pension fund’s expected return on plan assets
 assumption is derived from a review of actual historical returns achieved by the pension trust andanticipated
 future long-term performance of individual asset classes. While consideration is given to historical returns, the assumption represents along-term,
 prospective  return.  The  expected  return  on  plan  assets  component  of  the  net  periodic  benefit  cost  for  the  upcoming  plan  year  isdetermine
d based on the expected return on plan assets assumption and the market-related value of plan assets (MRVA). Since our adoption of theaccounti
ng standard for pensions in 1987, we have determined the MRVA based on a five-year moving average of plan assets. As of December 31,2020, the MRVA was approximately $6,805 less tha
n the fair market value of assets.Assumed health care cost trend rates were as follows:

Table of ContentsPlan Assets
Investment Strategy
 The overall  objective of our pension assets is to earn a rate of return over time to satisfy the benefit obligations of the pensionplans
 and to maintain sufficient liquidity to pay benefits and address other cash requirements of the pension fund. Specific investment objectives forour
 long-term  investment  strategy  include  reducing  the  volatility  of  pension  assets  relative  to  pension  liabilities,  achieving  a  competitive  totalinvestment
 return, achieving diversification between and within asset classes and managing other risks. Investment objectives for each asset classare determined based on specific risks and investment op
portunities identified.We
 periodically update our long-term, strategic asset allocations. We use various analytics to determine the optimal asset mix and consider planliability
 characteristics, liquidity characteristics, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. We identify investmentbenchmarks
 to evaluate performance for the asset classes in the strategic asset allocation that are market-based and investable where possible.Actual allocations to
 each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy changes, market value fluctuations, the lengthof
 time it takes to fully implement investment allocation positions, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. Short-term investments andexchange-traded
 derivatives are used to rebalance the actual asset allocation to the target asset allocation. The asset allocation is monitored andrebalanced frequently. The actual and target al
locations by asset class for the pension assets at December 31 were as follows:Actual Allocations

 income securities are invested primarily in a diversified portfolio of long duration instruments as well as Emerging Market, Structured, HighYield and
 Private Debt. Global equity securities are invested in a diversified portfolio of U.S. and non-U.S. companies, across various industries andmarket capitalizations.
Private
 equity investment vehicles are primarily limited partnerships (LPs) that mainly invest in U.S. and non-U.S. leveraged buyout, venture capitaland
 special situation strategies. Real estate and real assets include global private investments that may be held through investments in a limitedpartnershi
p (LP) or other fund structures and publicly traded investments (such as Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in the case of real estate).Real estate includes, but is
 not limited to, investments in office, retail, apartment and industrial properties. Real assets include, but are not limited to,investments in natural resources (such as energy, farmland and timber), commodities and infrastructure.
Hedge
 fund investments  seek to capitalize on inefficiencies  identified across and within different  asset classes or markets.  Hedge fund strategytypes include, but are not limited to directional, event driven, relativ
e value, long-short and multi-strategy.Investment
 managers are retained for explicit investment  roles specified by contractual  investment  guidelines. Certain investment  managers areauthorized
 to use derivatives, such as equity or bond futures, swaps, options and currency futures or forwards. Derivatives are used to achieve thedesired market exposure of a security or an index, transfer value-added performance betw
een asset classes,110

n November 2020, the Company contributed $3,000 of our common stock to the pension fund. An independent fiduciary was retained to manageand liquidate the stock over time at its discretion. Plan assets inclu
ded $3,298 and $0 of our common stock as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.Risk Management
 In  managing the pension assets, we review and manage risk associated with funded status risk, interest rate risk, market risk,counterparty
 risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. Liability matching and asset class diversification are central to our risk management approachand
 are  integral  to  the  overall  investment  strategy.  Further,  asset  classes  are  constructed  to  achieve  diversification  by  investment  strategy,  byinvestment manager, by industry or
 sector and by holding. Investment manager guidelines for publicly traded assets are specified and are monitoredregularly
 through  the  custodian.  Credit  parameters  for  counterparties  have  been  established  for  managers  permitted  to  trade  over-the-counterderivatives.
 Valuation  is  governed  through  several  types  of  procedures,  including  reviews  of  manager  valuation  policies,  custodian  valuationprocesses, pricing vendor practices, pricing reconcil
iation, and periodic, security-specific valuation testing.111

Table of ContentsFair Value Measurements
 The  following table presents our plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The fairvalue
 hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based onquoted
 prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and Level 3includes fair values estimated using sig
nificant unobservable inputs.December 31, 2020

 income  securities  are  primarily  valued  upon  a  market  approach,  using  matrix  pricing  and  considering  a  security’s  relationship  to  othersecurities
 for which quoted prices in an active market may be available, or an income approach, converting future cash flows to a single presentvalue amount. Inputs used in developi
ng fair value estimates include reported trades, broker quotes, benchmark yields, and base spreads.Common/collective/pooled
 funds  are  typically  common  or  collective  trusts  valued  at  their  net  asset  values  (NAVs)  that  are  calculated  by  theinvestment
 manager or sponsor of the fund and have daily or monthly liquidity. Derivatives included in the table above are over-the-counter and areprimarily
 valued using an income  approach  with  inputs  that  include benchmark  yields,  swap curves,  cash  flow  analysis,  rating  agency  data  andinterdealer
 broker rates. Exchange-traded derivative positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settleddaily and therefore reflected in the payables a
nd receivables portion of the table.Cash
 equivalents and other short-term investments (which are used to pay benefits) are held in a separate account which consists of a commingledfund
 (with daily liquidity) and separately held short-term securities and cash equivalents. All of the investments in this cash vehicle are valued dailyusing
 a  market  approach  with  inputs  that  include  quoted  market  prices  for  similar  instruments.  In  the  event  a  market  price  is  not  available  forinstruments
 with  an  original  maturity  of  one  year  or  less,  amortized  cost  is  used  as  a  proxy  for  fair  value.  Common  and  preferred  stock  equitysecurities are primarily valued using a market approach b
ased on the quoted market prices of identical instruments.Private
 equity  and  private  debt  NAV  valuations  are  based  on  the  valuation  of  the  underlying  investments,  which  include  inputs  such  as  cost,operating
 results, discounted future cash flows and market based comparable data. For those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis(primarily LPs) we use NAVs, adjusted for subsequent cash flows a
nd significant events.Real
 estate and real asset NAV valuations are based on valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, discountedfuture
 cash  flows,  independent  appraisals  and  market  based  comparable  data.  For  those  investments  reported  on  a  one-quarter  lagged  basis(primarily
 LPs) NAVs are adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events. Publicly traded REITs and infrastructure stocks are valuedusing
 a market approach based on quoted market prices of identical instruments. Exchange-traded commodities futures positions are reported inaccordance with changes in dai
ly variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table.Hedge
 fund  NAVs  are  generally  based  on  the  valuation  of  the  underlying  investments.  This  is  primarily  done  by  applying  a  market  or  incomevaluation methodology dep
ending on the specific type of security or instrument held.Investments
 in private equity, private debt, real estate, real assets, and hedge funds are primarily calculated and reported by the General Partner(GP),
 fund manager or third party administrator. Additionally, some investments in fixed income and equity are made via commingled vehicles andare
 valued in a similar fashion. Pension assets invested in commingled and limited partnership structures rely on the NAV of these investments asthe practical expedient for the valuations.

 Required  pension contributions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), as well as rules governing funding ofour
 non-US pension plans, are not expected to be significant in 2021. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we contributed $3,000 in common stock tothe pension fund. We do not expect to make discretionary contributions to our pe

 the plans are terminated within five years thereafter, the assets in the plan first will be used to provide the level of retirement benefits requiredby
 ERISA, and then any surplus will be used to fund a trust to continue present and future payments under the postretirement medical and lifeinsurance benefits in our group insuranc

 we terminate certain pension plans under conditions in which the plan’s assets exceed that plan’s obligations, the U.S. government will beentitled to a fair allocation of any of the plan’s assets base
d on plan contributions that were reimbursed under U.S. government contracts.Defined Contribution Plans
We
 provide certain defined contribution plans to all eligible employees. The principal plans are the Company-sponsored 401(k) plans. The expensefor these defined contribution plans was $1,3
51, $1,533 and $1,480 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.Note 17 – Share-Based Compensation and Other Compensation Arrangements
Share-Based Compensation
Our
 2003 Incentive Stock Plan, as amended and restated, permits awards of incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights,restricted
 stock or units, performance shares, performance restricted stock or units, performance units and other stock and cash-based awards toour
 employees, officers, directors, consultants, and independent contractors. The aggregate number of shares of our stock authorized for issuanceunder the plan is 87,000,000.
Shares
 issued as a result of stock option exercises or conversion of stock unit awards will be funded out of treasury shares, except to the extentthere
 are insufficient treasury shares, in which case new shares will be issued. We believe we currently have adequate treasury shares to satisfythese issuances during 2021.

 group  of  peer  companies  over  a  three-year  period.  The  award  payout  can  range  from  0%  to  200%  of  the  initial  PBRSU  grant.  The  PBRSUsgranted
 under this program will vest at the payout amount and settle in common stock (on a one-for-one basis) on the third anniversary of the grantdate.
 If an executive terminates employment because of retirement, layoff, disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary) remains eligible underthe
 award and, if the award is earned, will receive a proration of stock units based on active employment during the three-year service period. In allother cases, the PBRSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate.

Cash Flow Hedges
Our
 cash flow hedges include foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swaps and commodity purchase contracts. We use foreign currencyforward
 contracts  to  manage  currency  risk  associated  with  certain  transactions,  specifically  forecasted  sales  and  purchases  made  in  foreigncurrencies.
 Our  foreign  currency  contracts  hedge  forecasted  transactions  through  2025.  We  use  commodity  derivatives,  such  as  fixed-pricepurchase
 commitments and swaps to hedge against potentially unfavorable price changes for items used in production. Our commodity contractshedge forecasted transactions through 2029.

Table of ContentsNote 20 – Fair Value Measurements
The
 fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determinedbased
 on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, andLevel 3 includes fair values estimated
 using significant unobservable inputs. The following table presents our assets and liabilities that are measuredat fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized usi

 include foreign currency and commodity contracts. Our foreign currency forward contracts are valued using an income approach basedon
 the present value of the forward rate less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an incomeapproach based on the present value of the commodity in
dex prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount.Certain
 assets  have  been  measured  at  fair  value  on  a  nonrecurring  basis  using  significant  unobservable  inputs  (Level  3).  The  following  tablepresents

Table of ContentsInvestments, Property, plant and equipment, Other assets and Acquired intangi
ble assets were primarily valued using an income approach based onthe
 discounted cash flows associated with the underlying assets. The fair value of the impaired customer financing assets includes operating leaseequipment
 and investments in sales type-leases/finance leases, and is derived by calculating a median collateral value from a consistent group ofthird
 party aircraft value publications. The values provided by the third party aircraft publications are derived from their knowledge of market tradesand
 other market  factors.  Management  reviews  the publications  quarterly  to assess the continued appropriateness  and consistency  with markettrends.
 Under certain circumstances, we adjust values based on the attributes and condition of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when thefeatures
 or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by third party publications, or on the expected netsales price for the aircraft.
For
 Level 3 assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the year ended December 31, 2020, the following table presentsthe fair value of those assets as of the measurement date, valuation techniques a

(20,964) (23,119) (23,081) ($38) The fair values of
 notes receivable are estimated with discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates currently offered on loans with similar termsto borrowers of similar credit quality. The
 fair value of our debt that is traded in the secondary market is classified as Level 2 and is based on currentmarket yields. For
 our debt that is not traded in the secondary market, the fair value is classified as Level 2 and is based on our indicative borrowingcost
 derived  from  dealer  quotes  or  discounted  cash  flows.  The  fair  values  of  our  debt  classified  as  Level  3  are  based  on  discounted  cash  flowmodels
 using the implied yield from similar securities. With regard to other financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, it is not practicable toestimate
 the fair value of our indemnifications and financing commitments because the amount and timing of those arrangements are uncertain.Items not
 included in the above disclosures include cash, restricted cash, time deposits and other deposits, commercial paper, money market funds,Accounts
 receivable, Unbilled receivables, Other current assets, Accounts payable and long-term payables. The carrying values of those items, asreflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, approximate their fair value at
 December 31, 2020 and 2019. The fair value of assetsand liabilities whose carryin
g value approximates fair value is determined using Level 2 inputs, with the exception of cash (Level 1).Note 21 – Legal Proceedings
Various legal proceedin
gs, claims and investigations related to products, contracts, employment and other matters are pending against us.In
 addition, we are subject to various U.S. government inquiries and investigations from which civil, criminal or administrative proceedings couldresult or have resulted in the past. Such proceedings inv
olve or could involve claims by the government for fines, penalties, compensatory and trebledamages, restitution and/or forfeitures.
 Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or subdivisions, can alsobe
 suspended  or  debarred  from  government  contracts,  or  lose its  export  privileges,  based on the  results  of  investigations.  Except  as describedbelow,
 we believe, based upon current information, that the outcome of any such legal proceeding, claim, or government dispute and investigationwill
 not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Where it is reasonably possible that we will incur lossesin
 excess of recorded amounts in connection with any of the matters set forth below, we will disclose either the amount or range of reasonablypossibl
e losses in excess of such amounts or, where no such amount or range can be reasonably estimated, the reasons why no such estimate canbe made.
Multiple legal actions
 have been filed against us as a result of the October 29, 2018 accident of Lion Air Flight 610 and the March 10, 2019 accidentof
 Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. Further, we are subject to, and cooperating with ongoing governmental and regulatory investigations and inquiriesrelating
 to the accidents and the 737 MAX, including an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the outcome of which may bematerial.
 Other than with respect to the agreement described below with the U.S. Department of Justice, we cannot reasonably estimate a range ofloss,
 if any, not covered by available insurance that may result given the current status of the pending lawsuits, investigations, and inquiries relatedto the 737 MAX.

Table of ContentsOn
 January  6,  2021,  we  entered  into  a  Deferred  Prosecution  Agreement  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  that  resolves  the  Department  ofJustice’s
 previously disclosed investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX airplane by the Federal Aviation Administration. Underthe
 terms  of  the  Deferred  Prosecution  Agreement,  we  agreed  to  the  filing  of  a  criminal  information  charging  the  Company  with  one  count  ofconspiracy
 to defraud the United States, based on the conduct of two former 737 MAX program technical pilots; the criminal information will bedismissed
 after three years, provided that we comply with our obligations under the agreement. The Deferred Prosecution Agreement requires thatwe make
 payments totaling $2.51 billion, which consist of (a) a $243.6 million criminal monetary penalty; (b) $500 million in additional compensationto
 the heirs and/or beneficiaries of those who died in the Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 accidents; and (c) $1.77 billion to theCompany’s
 airline  customers  for  harm  incurred  as  a  result  of  the  grounding  of  the  737  MAX,  offset  in  part  by  payments  already  made  and  theremainder satisfied through payments
 to be made prior to the termination of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. The agreement also requires thatwe review
 our compliance program and undertake continuous improvement efforts with respect to it, and implement enhanced compliance reportingand
 internal controls mechanisms. Of the payments described above, $1.77 billion has been included in amounts reserved in prior quarters for 737MAX
 customer  considerations.  We  incurred  earnings  charges  equal  to  the  remaining  $743.6  million  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020  related  to  thisagreement.
During 2019,
 we entered into agreements with Embraer S.A. (Embraer) to establish joint ventures that included the commercial aircraft and servicesoperations
 of Embraer, of which we were expected to acquire an 80 percent ownership stake for $4,200, as well as a joint venture to promote anddevelop
 new markets for the C-390 Millennium. In 2020, we exercised our contractual right to terminate these agreements based on Embraer’sfailure
 to  meet  certain  required  closing  conditions.  Embraer  has  disputed  our  right  to  terminate  the  agreements,  and  the  dispute  is  currently  inarbitration. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, that may result from the arbitration.
Note 22 – Segment and Revenue Information
Effective
 at  the  beginning  of  2020,  certain  programs  were  realigned  between  our  BDS  segment  and  Unallocated  items,  eliminations  and  other.Business segment data for 2019 and 2018 h
as been adjusted to reflect the realignment.Our
 primary  profitability  measurements  to  review  a  segment’s  operating  results  are  Earnings/(loss)  from  operations  and  operating  margins.  Weoperate
 in four reportable segments: BCA, BDS, BGS, and BCC. All other activities fall within Unallocated items, eliminations and other. See page67 for the Summary of Business Segment Data, which is an integral part of this note.
BCA
 develops,  produces  and  markets  commercial  jet  aircraft  principally  to  the  commercial  airline  industry  worldwide.  Revenue  on  commercialaircraft contracts is recognized at the point in time when an aircraft is completed and accepte
d by the customer.BDS
 engages in the research, development, production and modification of the following products and related services: manned and unmannedmilitary
 aircraft  and  weapons  systems,  surveillance  and  engagement,  strategic  defense  and  intelligence  systems,  satellite  systems  and  spaceexploration. BDS revenue is genera
lly recognized over the contract term (over time) as costs are incurred.BGS
 provides  parts,  maintenance,  modifications,  logistics  support,  training,  data  analytics  and  information-based  services  to  commercial  andgovernment customers
 worldwide. BGS segment revenue and costs include certain products and services provided to other segments. Revenue oncommercial
 spare parts contracts is recognized at the point in time when a spare part is delivered to the customer. Revenue on other contracts isgenerally recognized over the contract term (over time) as costs are incurred.

g CompanyOpinion on the Financial Statements
We
 have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the "Company") as ofDecember
 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of thethree
 years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, thefinancia
l statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the resultsof
 its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principlesgenerally accepted in the United States of America.
We
 have  also  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)  (PCAOB),  theCompany's
 internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  December  31,  2020,  based  on  criteria  established  in Internal  Control  —  IntegratedFramework
 (2013) issued  by the Committee  of Sponsoring Organizations  of the Treadway  Commission  and our  report  dated February  1, 2021,expressed an unqualified o
pinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.Basis for Opinion
These
 financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  Company'sfinancial
 statements  based on our audits.  We are a public accounting  firm  registered  with the PCAOB and are required  to be independent withrespect to
 the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and ExchangeCommission and the PCAOB.
We
 conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtainreasonable
 assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits includedperforming
 procedures  to  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  financial  statements,  whether  due  to  error  or  fraud,  and  performingprocedures
 that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures inthe financial statements. Our audits also included evaluati
ng the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as wellas evaluating the overall presentatio
n of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit Matters
The
 critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicatedor required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financia
l statements and(2)
 involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way ouropinion
 on  the  financial  statements,  taken  as  a  whole,  and  we  are  not,  by  communicating  the  critical  audit  matters  below,  providing  separateopinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to wh

Table of ContentsCost Estimates for Fixed-Price Development Contracts – Refer to Notes 1 and 13 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
As
 more  fully  described  in  Notes  1  and  13  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the  Company  recognizes  revenue  over  time  for  long-termcontracts as
 goods are produced or services are rendered. The Company uses costs incurred as the method for determining progress, and revenueis
 recognized based on costs incurred to date plus an estimate of margin at completion. The process of estimating margin at completion involvesestimating
 the costs to complete production of goods or rendering of services and comparing those costs to the estimated final revenue amount.Fixed-pric
e development contracts are inherently uncertain in that revenue is fixed while the estimates of costs required to complete these contractsare
 subject to significant variability. Due to the technical performance requirements in many of these contracts, changes to cost estimates couldoccur, resulting in lower margins or material reach-forward losses.
Given
 the complexity of certain of the Company’s fixed-price development contracts, including the KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew, and UnitedStates
 Air Force VC-25B Presidential Aircraft contracts, the limited amount of historical data available in certain instances and significant judgmentsnecessary to
 estimate future costs at completion, auditing these estimates involved extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment andrequired audit professionals with spec
ialized industry experience.How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our auditing procedures related to the cost estimates for the KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew, and Un
ited States Air Force VC-25B PresidentialAircraft fixed-price development contracts included the follo
wing, among others:•
We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods used in developing its estimates.•
We evaluated the reasonableness of judgments made and significant assumptions used by management relating to key estimates, includingthe range and probability of possibl
e outcomes.•
We performed inquiries of the Company’s project managers and others directly involved with the contracts to evaluate project status andproject challenges which may affect total estimated costs to complete. We also observed the pro
ject work site when key estimates related totangible or physical progress of the project.
•
We tested the accuracy and completeness of the data used in developing key estimates. We developed independent expectations of likelyoutcomes using, in part, the program’s data and compared our expectations to mana
gement’s estimates.•
We tested the effectiveness of controls over the review of judgments made and significant assumptions used to develop key estimates,including controls over the data used in d
eveloping the estimates and the mathematical extrapolation of such data.•
We performed retrospective reviews, comparing actual performance to estimated performance and the related financial statement impact,when evaluating the thorough
ness and precision of management’s estimation process and effectiveness of related internal controls.133

Table of ContentsProgram Accounting Estimates for the 777X Program – Refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The
 introduction of new aircraft programs involves increased risk associated with meeting development, certification and production schedules. TheCompany uses program accounti
ng in order to compute cost of sales and margin for each commercial airplane sold. The use of program accountingrequires
 estimating  and  demonstrating  customer  demand  for  the  number  of  units  included  in  the  program  (program  accounting  quantity)  andestimating
 the sales and costs over the expected life of each program. In particular, estimating the initial program accounting quantity and revenuefor
 unsold units within the program accounting quantity involves measurement uncertainty resulting in a range of possible outcomes. Additionally,the
 level of effort to meet regulatory requirements and achieve certification may be challenging to predict, resulting in delays in the timing of entryinto
 service  and corresponding  increases  in estimated  costs.  Changes to  the program  accounting  quantity  or  revenue and cost  estimates  couldoccur,
 resulting  in  lower  margins  or  material  reach-forward  losses.  Auditing  the  estimated  revenues  and  costs  for  the  777X  program  involvedextensive
 audit effort and required professionals with specialized industry experience given the high degree of complexity and subjectivity related tomanagement’s estimates.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our auditing procedures over the estimated revenues and costs for the 777X pro
gram accounting quantity included the following, among others:•
We inquired of the Company’s management, including individuals responsible for sales and pricing, to evaluate the status of current salescampaigns, short and long-term market demand, and status of negotiations with in
dividual sold firm customers.•
We compared management’s estimate of market demand to external industry sources of expected demand.•
We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods and significant assumptions used in developing its estimatesrelated to the initial program accounting qua
ntity and revenue for unsold units.•
We  evaluated  management’s  ability  to  estimate  program  revenue  by  comparison  to  historical  estimates  and  actual  results  on  similarprograms.
•
We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods used in developing its cost estimates.•
Performed inquiries of those directly involved with the certification of the aircraft to evaluate project status and challenges which may affecttotal estimated costs to certify the aircraft.
•
We tested the effectiveness of controls including those over the data used in developing the estimates, the mathematical extrapolation ofsuch data, and management’s judgment regardi
ng the range of possible outcomes relating to the specific estimates.134

Table of ContentsLiabilities related to the 737 MAX Grounding – Refer to Notes 13 and 21 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
In
 2019,  following  two  fatal  737  MAX  accidents,  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  and  non-U.S.  civil  aviation  authorities  issued  orderssuspending
 commercial operations of 737 MAX aircraft (the “737 MAX Grounding”). Deliveries resumed in the U.S. in late 2020 following rescissionby
 the FAA of its grounding order. The 737 MAX remains grounded in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions. In addition, multiple legal actions have beenfiled against
 the Company following the fatal accidents and various governmental and regulatory investigations and inquiries continue relating to theaccidents and the 737 MAX aircraft.
During
 2019, the Company recorded an initial liability in connection with estimated payments, concessions and other in-kind consideration it intendsto
 provide  to  customers  for  disruptions  related  to  the  737  MAX  Grounding  and  associated  delivery  delays.  This  liability  totaled  $5.5  billion  atDecember
 31,  2020  and  is  reflected  in  the  financial  statements  in  Accrued  liabilities.  This  represents  the  Company’s  best  estimate  of  futureconcessi
ons and other consideration to its customers, and is necessarily based on individual negotiations with customers and the substance of suchnegotiations.
Significant judgment is involve
d in management’s ability to assess and reasonably estimate potential additional financial statement effects or a rangeof
 loss,  if  any,  resulting  from  the  outcome  of  737  MAX-related  litigation  and  the  results  of  the  various  ongoing  governmental  and  regulatoryinvestigations and inquiri
es related to the 737 MAX.The
 subjectivity of the liability associated with providing consideration to customers resulting from the 737 MAX Grounding and the complexity ofassessing the
 outcome of the ongoing litigation and investigations related to the 737 MAX required a high degree of auditor judgment and increasedaudit effort.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our auditing procedures associated with li
abilities related to the 737 MAX Grounding included the following, among others:•
We inquired of management to understand developments with the 737 MAX Grounding, including the status of regulatory approval for returnto service in various foreign jurisdictions and the status of consi
deration negotiations with individual customers.•
We obtained written representations from management concerning its intent to provide consideration to customers and the extent of thatconsideration.
•
We  tested  the  effectiveness  of  controls  related  to  nonrecurring  items  and  loss  contingencies  associated  with  litigation,  claims  andassessments.
•
We evaluated the significant assumptions used by management to estimate the liability for customer consideration, including the timing andconditions
 of 737 MAX return to service in various foreign jurisdictions, and, where possible, we corroborated the significant assumptionswith management outside of the accounting an
d finance organizations.•
We reviewed the terms of customer contracts and correspondence with customers concerning potential consideration as a result of the 737MAX Grounding.
135

Table of Contents•
We evaluated the terms of settlement agreements with customers for the allocation of value provided between consideration as a result ofthe 737 MAX Grounding and for consideration rel
ated to the impact of current economic conditions resulting from COVID-19.•
We evaluated delivery documents for 737 MAX deliveries for incremental value provided at delivery as potential consideration as a result ofthe 737 MAX G
rounding.•
We inquired of internal and external legal counsel to understand developments related to contractual obligations to customers, litigation andother claims relating to the 737 MAX Grounding and progress
ion in potential settlement discussions.•
We read minutes of meetings of the Board of Directors and its committees for evidence of unrecorded loss contingencies.•
We evaluated the Company’s disclosures for consistency with our knowledge of matters related to the 737 MAX Grounding.Income Taxes – Realizability of Deferred Tax Assets– Refer to Notes 1 and 4 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
As
 more fully described in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes deferred income taxes for differencesbetween
 the financial statement carrying amount and tax basis of assets and liabilities, measured using enacted statutory rates in effect for theyears
 in which the basis differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to offset deferred tax assets if, based upon theavailable
 evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Future realization of deferred tax assetsdepends
 on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character. Sources of taxable income typically include future reversals ofdeferred
 tax liabilities, future taxable income exclusive of reversals of deferred tax liabilities, and tax planning strategies. During 2020 the Companydetermine
d that it is not more likely than not that sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character will be generated in the future to realize all ofits deferred tax assets; therefore, a valuation allowance has bee
n recorded.We identified the Company’s determination that it is not more likely tha
n not that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to realize allof
 its deferred tax assets as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments and estimates made related to the timing of future reversalsof
 deferred tax assets and liabilities. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involveour income tax specialists, when performing audit proced
ures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s methodologies and estimates.How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our auditing procedures related to the timing of future reversals of deferred tax assets and liabi
lities included the following, among others:•
With the assistance of our income tax specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the methods, significant assumptions, and judgmentsused by management to determine whether it was more likely than not that the Compa
ny would be able to realize its deferred tax assets.•
We tested the Company’s methodologies for scheduling the reversal of existing taxable and deductible temporary differences.136

Table of Contents•
We evaluated whether the estimates considered when determining future taxable income were consistent with the evidence obtained inother areas of the audit.
•
We  tested  the  effectiveness  of  controls  over  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities,  including  management’s  controls  over  determining  thepattern of the reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities.

 over Financial ReportingA
 company’s  internal  control  over  financial reporting  is a process  designed to  provide  reasonable assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financialreporting
 and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  Acompany’s
 internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, inreasonab
le detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance thattransactions
 are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,and
 that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors  of thecompany;
 and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use,  or  disposition  of  thecompany’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
