As Representatives of the several Underwriters named in Schedule I hereto
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a corporation organized under the laws of the State of California (the “Company”), proposes to sell to the
several underwriters named in Schedule I hereto (the “Underwriters”), for whom you (the “Representatives”) are acting as representatives,
$850,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.100% first mortgage bonds due 2029 (the “2029 Mortgage Bonds”), $1,150,000,000 aggregate principal
amount of 6.400% first mortgage bonds due 2033 (the “2033 Mortgage Bonds”) and $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.750% first
mortgage bonds due 2053 (the “New 2053 Mortgage Bonds,” together with the 2029 Mortgage Bonds and the 2033 Mortgage Bonds, the “Securities”),
certain terms of which are set forth on Schedule II.
The 2029 Mortgage Bonds and the 2033 Mortgage Bonds are to be issued under an indenture, dated as of June 19, 2020 (the “Base Indenture”),
between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the “Trustee”), as amended and supplemented as of the
Closing Date (as defined below), and as further supplemented by the twentieth supplemental indenture, to be dated as of June 5, 2023, (the “Twentieth
Supplemental Indenture”), between the Company and Trustee.
The New 2053 Mortgage Bonds are to be issued under the Base Indenture between the Company and the Trustee, as amended and supplemented
as of January 6, 2023, and as further supplemented by the eighteenth supplemental indenture, dated as of January 6, 2023 (the “Eighteenth
Supplemental Indenture” and, together with the Base Indenture, as amended and supplemented as of the Closing Date, and the Twentieth
Supplemental Indenture, the “Indenture”).
On January 6, 2023, the Company issued $750,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of the 6.750% First Mortgage Bonds due 2053 (the
“Existing 2053 Mortgage Bonds” and together with the New 2053 Mortgage Bonds, the “2053 Mortgage Bonds”). The New 2053 Mortgage Bonds
constitute additional “bonds” of the same series as the Existing 2053 Mortgage Bonds for purposes of the Indenture. Except as otherwise described in
the Final Prospectus, the New 2053 Mortgage Bonds will have identical terms (other than the issue date and public offering price) to the Existing 2053
Mortgage Bonds and will be treated as a single class of securities for all purposes under the Indenture.
Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to
refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 which were filed under the Exchange Act on or
before the Effective Date of the Registration Statement or the issue date of the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as
the case may be, and any reference herein to the terms “amend,” “amendment” or “supplement” with respect to the Registration Statement, the Base
Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any document under the Exchange
Act after the Effective Date of the Registration Statement or the issue date of the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus,
as the case may be, deemed to be incorporated therein by reference. Certain terms used herein are defined in Section 21 hereof.

424(b), one or more preliminary prospectus supplements relating to the Securities, each of which has previously been furnished to you. The Company
will file with the Commission a final prospectus supplement relating to the Securities in accordance with Rule 424(b) after the Execution Time. As filed,
such final prospectus supplement shall contain all information required by the Act and the rules thereunder, and, except to the extent the Representatives
shall agree in writing to a modification, shall be in all substantive respects in the form furnished to you prior to the Execution Time or, to the extent not
completed at the Execution Time, shall contain only such specific additional information and other changes (beyond that contained in the Base
Prospectus and any Preliminary Prospectus) as the Company has advised you, prior to the Execution Time, will be included or made therein. The

pursuant to Rule 424(b) and on the Closing Date, the Final Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) will not include any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading; provided, however, that the Company makes no representations or warranties as to (i) that part of the Registration Statement
which shall constitute the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee or (ii) the information

apply to statements in or omissions from the Disclosure Package and any such Road Show based upon and in conformity with written information
furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such
information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 8 hereof.
(d) (i) At the time of filing the Registration Statement, (ii) at the time of the most recent amendment thereto for the purposes of complying with
Section 10(a)(3) of the Act (whether such amendment was by post-effective amendment, incorporated report filed pursuant to Sections 13 or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act or form of prospectus), (iii) at the time the Company or any person acting on its behalf (within the meaning, for this clause only, of Rule
163(c)) made any offer relating to the Securities in reliance on the exemption in Rule 163, and (iv) at the Execution Time (with such date being used as
the determination date for purposes of this clause (iv)), the Company was or is (as the case may be) a Well-Known Seasoned Issuer.
(e) (i) At the earliest time after the filing of the Registration Statement that the Company or another offering participant made a bona fide offer

purposes of this clause (ii)), the Company was not and is not an Ineligible Issuer, without taking account of any determination by the Commission

(hh) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to any contract, agreement or understanding with any person (other than this

Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus and are permitted by the Indenture and (ii) except for such defects in title as are not
reasonably likely to, individually or in the aggregate, materially interfere with the use made or to be made of such property by the Company or
materially impair the liens of the Indenture or have a material adverse effect on (x) the condition (financial or other), results of operations or business of
the Company or (y) the authority or the ability of the Company to enter into or perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Indenture or the
Securities.
(kk) The Base Indenture was effective to create, as of July 1, 2020 in favor of the Trustee, for the benefit of itself and the holders of the Bonds, a
legal, valid and enforceable lien on and security interest in all of the Company’s right, title and interest in and to the Mortgaged Property (as such term is
defined in the Indenture) described in the instruments recorded as provided in Schedule IV-2; and when such Base Indenture and memoranda of
indenture supplements were filed or recorded in the proper real estate filing or recording offices as provided in Schedule IV-2, and all relevant mortgage
taxes and recording charges were duly paid, such lien was perfected in favor of the Trustee (for the benefit of the Secured Parties) in such Mortgaged
Property and, to the extent applicable, subject to Section 9-315 of the Uniform Commercial Code, the proceeds thereof, in each case prior and superior
in right to the Lien of any other person, except for Permitted Liens (as such term is defined in the
 
9
Indenture). The Eighteenth Supplemental Indenture was effective to create, as of the date thereof, in favor of the Trustee, for the benefit of itself and the
holders of the 2053 Mortgage Bonds and the other Bonds a legal, valid and enforceable lien on and security interest in all of the Company’s right, title
and interest in and to the Mortgaged Property (as such term is defined in the Base Indenture) described in the Eighteenth Supplemental Indenture; and as
such Eighteenth Supplemental Indenture (or memorandum thereof) has been filed or recorded in the proper real estate filing or recording offices, and all
relevant mortgage taxes and recording charges are duly paid, the Trustee (for the benefit of the Secured Parties) has a perfected Lien on, and security
interest in, all right, title, and interest of the Company in such Mortgaged Property and, to the extent applicable, subject to Section 9-315 of the Uniform
Commercial Code, the proceeds thereof, in each case prior and superior in right to the Lien of any other person, except for Permitted Liens (as such term
is defined in the Indenture). The Twentieth Supplemental Indenture will be effective to create, as of the Closing Date, in favor of the Trustee, for the
benefit of itself and the holders of the Securities and the other Bonds a legal, valid and enforceable lien on and security interest in all of the Company’s
right, title and interest in and to the Mortgaged Property (as such term is defined in the Base Indenture) described in the Twentieth Supplemental
Indenture; and when on or following the Closing Date such Twentieth Supplemental Indenture (or memorandum thereof) is filed or recorded in the
proper real estate filing or recording offices, and all relevant mortgage taxes and recording charges are duly paid, the Trustee (for the benefit of the
Secured Parties) shall have a perfected Lien on, and security interest in, all right, title, and interest of the Company in such Mortgaged Property and, to
the extent applicable, subject to Section 9-315 of the Uniform Commercial Code, the proceeds thereof, in each case prior and superior in right to the
Lien of any other person, except for Permitted Liens (as such term is defined in the Indenture).
(ll) Other than the financing statements filed and the Base Indenture and memoranda of indenture supplements recorded on or following June 19,
2020 in favor of the Trustee (which financing statements are identified on Schedule IV-1 hereto and the recording information for the Base Indenture
and memoranda of indenture supplements is identified on Schedule IV-2 hereto), no effective mortgage, financing statement, fixture filing or other
instrument similar in effect under any applicable law covering all or any part of the property subject to the liens of the Indenture is on file in any filing or
recording office except for financing statements filed in connection with Permitted Liens (as defined in the Indenture).
(mm) [Reserved].
(nn) The Company carries, or is covered by, insurance in such amounts and covering such risks as is adequate for the conduct of its businesses and
the value of its properties and as is customary for companies engaged in similar businesses in similar industries. The Company (i) has not received
notice from any insurer or agent of such insurer that substantial capital improvements or other material expenditures will have to be made in order to
continue such insurance and (ii) has no reason to believe that it will not be able to renew its existing insurance coverage as and when such coverage
expires or to obtain similar coverage from similar insurers at a cost that is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Agreement shall be deemed a representation and warranty by the Company, as to matters covered thereby, to each Underwriter.

the Company or as provided in Section 9 hereof (such date and time of delivery and payment for the Securities being herein called the “Closing Date”).
Delivery of the Securities shall be made to the Representatives for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters against payment by the several

4. Offering by Underwriters. It is understood that the several Underwriters propose to, and they hereby represent that they will, offer the Securities for
sale to the public as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus.
5. Agreements. The Company agrees with the several Underwriters that:
(a) Prior to the termination of the offering of the Securities, the Company will not file any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement
(including the Final Prospectus or any Preliminary Prospectus) to the Base Prospectus unless the Company has furnished you a copy for your review
prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which you reasonably object in a timely manner. The Company will
cause the Final Prospectus, properly completed, and any supplement thereto to be filed in a form approved by the Representatives with the Commission
pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed and will provide evidence satisfactory to the Representatives of
such timely filing. The Company will promptly advise the Representatives (i) when the Final Prospectus, and any supplement thereto, shall have been
filed (if required) with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b), (ii) when, prior to termination of the offering of the Securities, any amendment to the
Registration Statement shall have been filed or become effective, (iii) of any request by the Commission or its staff for any amendment of the
Registration Statement, or for any supplement to the Final Prospectus or for any additional information, (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any
stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any notice objecting to its use, any order preventing or suspending the use of
any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for the
purpose of suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free
Writing Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, and (v) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification
of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company will use its reasonable
best efforts to prevent (i) the issuance of such stop order or other order referred to in the
 
11
preceding sentence, or (ii) the occurrence of (A) any suspension of the effectiveness, or objection to the use, of the Registration Statement or (B) any
prevention or suspension of the use of the preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Final Prospectus and, upon such issuance,
occurrence or notice of objection, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal of such stop order or relief from such occurrence or objection, including,
if necessary, by filing an amendment to the Registration Statement or a new registration statement and using its reasonable best efforts to have such
amendment or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable.
(b) The Company shall prepare a final term sheet for the Securities, containing solely descriptions of the respective final terms and offering of the
Securities, in the form approved by you and attached as Schedule II hereto, and file such term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) within the time required by
such Rule.
(c) If, at any time prior to the filing of the Final Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b), any event occurs as a result of which the Disclosure Package
would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made or the circumstances then prevailing not misleading, the Company will (i) notify promptly the
Representatives so that any use of the Disclosure Package may cease until it is amended or supplemented; (ii) amend or supplement the Disclosure
Package to correct such statement or omission; and (iii) supply any amendment or supplement to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request.
(d) If, at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and prior to the completion of the distribution of the Securities, any
event occurs as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus would conflict with the information in the Registration Statement, Disclosure
Package or the Final Prospectus or would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made or the circumstances then prevailing not misleading, the Company will
(i) notify promptly the Representatives so that any use of such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus may cease until it is amended or supplemented; (ii) amend
or supplement such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to correct such statement or omission; and (iii) supply any amendment or supplement to you in such
quantities as you may reasonably request.
(e) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act (including in circumstances where such
requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made at such time not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement, file a new registration statement or
supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, including in connection with use or
delivery of the Final Prospectus, the Company promptly will (i) notify the Representatives of any such event, (ii) prepare and file with the Commission,
subject to the second sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 5, an amendment or supplement or new registration statement which will correct such
statement or omission or effect such compliance, (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to have any amendment to the Registration Statement or new
registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable in order to avoid any disruption in use of the Final Prospectus and (iv) supply any
supplemented Final Prospectus to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request.
 
12
(f) As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Representatives an earnings statement or
statements of the Company and its subsidiaries which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158.
(g) The Company will furnish to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, signed copies of the Registration
Statement (including exhibits thereto) and to each other Underwriter a copy of the Registration Statement (without exhibits thereto) and, so long as
delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied
pursuant to Rule 172), as many copies of each Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and any supplement
thereto as the Representatives may reasonably request. The Company will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to
the offering.
(h) The Company will arrange, if necessary, for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the
Representatives may designate and will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities; provided that in
no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would
subject it to service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Securities, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so
subject.
(i) The Company agrees that, unless it has or shall have obtained the prior written consent of the Representatives, and each Underwriter, severally
and not jointly, agrees with the Company that, unless it has or shall have obtained, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Company, it has
not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise
constitute a “free writing prospectus” (as defined in Rule 405) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company
under Rule 433, other than the free writing prospectuses containing the information contained in the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to
Section 5(b) hereto, or one or more free writing prospectuses through customary Bloomberg distribution that do not contain substantive changes from or
additions to the information contained in the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto; provided that the prior written consent
of the parties hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule III hereto or term sheet,
substantially in the form of Schedule II hereto, and any Road Show. The Company consents to the use by any Underwriter of a free writing prospectus
that (a) is not an “issuer free writing prospectus” as defined in Rule 433, and (b) contains only (i) information describing the preliminary terms of the
Securities or the offering or (ii) information permitted by Rule 134. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representatives or the
Company is hereinafter referred to as a “Permitted Free Writing Prospectus.” The Company agrees that (x) it has treated and will treat, as the case
may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and (y) it has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with
the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission,
legending and record keeping and that it will not take any action that would result in any Underwriter or the Company being required to file with the
Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) a Free Writing Prospectus prepared by or on behalf of such Underwriter that such Underwriter would not otherwise
have been required to so file.
(j) The Company will not take any action that would result in an Underwriter or the Company being required to file with the Commission pursuant
to Rule 433(d) a Free Writing Prospectus prepared by or on behalf of the Underwriters that the Underwriters otherwise would not have been required to
file thereunder.
 
13
(k) During the period from the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of the
Representatives, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction which is designed to, or might reasonably be
expected to, result in the disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) by the
Company or any controlled affiliate of the Company), directly or indirectly, or confidentially submit or file (or participate in the filing of) a registration
statement with the Commission in respect of, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within
the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company (other than the Securities) or publicly
announce an intention to effect any such transaction; provided that the prior written consent of the Representatives shall not be required for issuances of
commercial paper or other debt securities with scheduled maturities of less than one year.
(l) The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause
or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale
of the Securities.
(m) The Company agrees to pay the costs and expenses relating to the following matters: (i) the preparation, printing or reproduction and filing

Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and each amendment or supplement to any of them; (ii) the printing (or reproduction) and delivery
(including postage, air freight charges and charges for counting and packaging) of such copies of the Registration Statement, each Preliminary
Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and all amendments or supplements to any of them, as may, in each case, be
reasonably requested for use in connection with the offering and sale of the Securities; (iii) the preparation, printing, authentication, issuance and
delivery of certificates for the Securities, and any stamp or transfer taxes in connection with the original issuance and sale of the Securities; (iv) the
printing (or reproduction) and delivery of this Agreement, any blue sky memorandum (the cost of such memorandum not to exceed $15,000) and all
other agreements or documents printed (or reproduced) and delivered in connection with the offering of the Securities; (v) any registration or
qualification of the Securities for offer and sale under the securities or blue sky laws of the several states (including filing fees and the reasonable fees
and expenses of counsel for the Underwriters relating to such registration and qualification); (vi) any filings required to be made with the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (including filing fees and the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Underwriters relating to such filings);
(vii) the costs and expenses of the Company relating to investor presentations on any Road Show undertaken in connection with the marketing of the
offering of the Securities; (viii) the fees and expenses of the Trustee, including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Trustee in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby; (ix) all fees and expenses associated with the grant or perfection of the security interests and liens to be obtained
pursuant to the Indenture, including, without limitation, the preparation of the Indenture and the other documents required thereunder in connection
therewith (other than the fees and expenses of counsel for the Underwriters related thereto); (x) the recording of the Base Indenture and any
supplemental indenture in the real estate mortgage records in the applicable county recording offices of the State of California; (xi) the fees and

property subject to the liens of the Indenture, in each case free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims (i) except for such liens,
encumbrances, equities or claims as are described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus or are permitted by the Indenture and (ii) except for
such defects in title as are not reasonably likely to, individually or in the aggregate, materially interfere with the use made or to be made of such
property by the Company, materially impair the liens of the Indenture or have a material adverse effect on (x) the condition (financial or other), results
of operations or business of the Company or (y) the authority or the ability of the Company to enter into or perform its obligations under this Agreement,
the Indenture or the Securities.
(o) Promptly following the Closing Date, the Company shall cause the Twentieth Supplemental Indenture and other supplemental indentures (or
notices, memoranda or financing statements or amendments thereto as may be recorded or filed to place third parties on notice thereof) to be recorded
and filed and re-recorded and re-filed in such manner and in such places, as may be required by law in order to fully preserve and protect the security of
the holders of the Securities and the other Bonds.

meaning of Rule 405 under the Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become
subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in the Registration Statement or in any subsequent amendment thereof or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact contained in the Base Prospectus, any
 
17
Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, the Final Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, any
Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Road Show, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or the omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and
agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with
investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to
the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission
or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any
Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by or
on behalf of any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 8(b). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability
which the Company may otherwise have.
(b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who
signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same
extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter
furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the
foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company
acknowledges that the statements set forth (i) in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities, (ii) under the heading
“Underwriting (Conflicts of Interest),” (A) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances and (B) the paragraph related to short sales,
stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information
furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free
Writing Prospectus or any Road Show.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will,
if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the
commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless
and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and
defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification
obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party’s choice at the
indemnifying party’s expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party
shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth
below); provided, however, that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party’s
election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel
(including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel
chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential
defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying
 
18
party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which
are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to
the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying
party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. It is understood that the indemnifying
party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one
separate counsel (in addition to one local counsel) for all such indemnified parties. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of
the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or
proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential
parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all
liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include any statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure
to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. No indemnifying party will be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with the consent of the indemnifying party or if there be a final
judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any
loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an
indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and
liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending the same) (collectively “Losses”) to
which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by
the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; provided, however, that in no case shall any
Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount
in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided
by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally
shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand
and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting
expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in
each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any
untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by
the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations
referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess
of the amount by which the
 
19
underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder as set forth on the cover page of the Final
Prospectus exceeds (y) the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
(within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act
and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who
controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration
Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and
conditions of this paragraph (d).
9. Default by an Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be
purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their
obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the
principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite
the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided,
however, that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to
purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule I hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right
to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such non-defaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the
Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any
Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives
shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may
be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any non-defaulting
Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
10. Termination. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior
to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such delivery and payment: (a) (i) trading in the common stock of PG&E
Corporation shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, (ii) trading in any series of the preferred stock of the
Company shall have been suspended by the Commission or the NYSE American LLC, (iii) (A) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock
Exchange shall have been suspended or limited, (B) minimum prices shall have been established on either of such exchanges, or (C) there shall have
been a material disruption in the clearance or settlement of securities generally on either of such exchanges which makes it, in the sole judgment of the
Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by this Agreement, the Disclosure
Package or the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto), (b) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by
Federal, California or New York State authorities, (c) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States
of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis which makes it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or
 
20
inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by this Agreement, the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus
(exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto) or (d) there shall have been such a material adverse change in general economic, political or
financial conditions or the financial markets in the United States which makes it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable
to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by this Agreement, the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus (exclusive
of any amendment or supplement thereto).
11. Representations and Indemnities to Survive. The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the
Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons
referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the
termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

(b) the Underwriters are acting as principal and not as an agent or fiduciary of the Company and (c) the Company’s engagement of the Underwriters in

Company agrees that it is solely responsible for making its own judgments in connection with the offering (irrespective of whether any of the
Underwriters has advised or is currently advising the Company on related or other matters). The Company agrees that it will not claim that the
Underwriters have rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owe an agency, fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with
such transaction or the process leading thereto.
15. Research Analyst Independence. The Company acknowledges that the Underwriters’ research analysts and research departments are required to be

and/or the offering of the Securities that differ from the views of their respective investment banking divisions. The Company hereby waives and
releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Company may have against the Underwriters with respect to any conflict of interest
that may arise from the fact that the views expressed by their independent research analysts and research departments may be different from or
inconsistent with the views or advice communicated to the Company by such Underwriters’ investment banking divisions. The Company acknowledges
that each of the Underwriters is a full service securities firm and as such from time to time, subject to applicable securities laws, may effect transactions
for its own account or the account of its customers and hold long or short positions in debt or equity securities of the companies that may be the subject
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

17. Applicable Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts
made and to be performed within the State of New York.
18. Waiver of Jury Trial. The Company hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in

instrument. The words “execution,” “signed,” “delivery,” and words of like import in or relating to this Agreement or any document to be signed in
connection with this Agreement shall be deemed to include electronic signatures, deliveries or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which

recordkeeping system, as the case may be, and the parties hereto consent to conduct the transactions contemplated hereunder by electronic means.

The following additional definitions are hereby established for purposes of this Twentieth Supplemental Indenture and shall have the meanings set
forth in this Twentieth Supplemental Indenture only for purposes of this Twentieth Supplemental Indenture:
“2029 Bonds Par Call Date” means December 15, 2028.
“2033 Bonds Par Call Date” means March 15, 2033.
“DTC” means The Depository Trust Company.
“Electronic Means” means the following communications methods: e-mail, facsimile transmission, secure electronic transmission containing
applicable authorization codes, passwords and/or authentication keys issued by the Trustee, or another method or system specified by the Trustee as
available for use in connection with its services hereunder.
“Instructions” has the meaning specified in Section 609 hereof.
“Original Issue Date” means June 5, 2023.
“Par Call Date” means (1) with respect to the 2029 Bonds, the 2029 Bonds Par Call Date, and (2) with respect to the 2033 Bonds, the 2033
Bonds Par Call Date.
“Redemption Price” means (1) with respect to the 2029 Bonds, the price at which the 2029 Bonds may be redeemed pursuant to Section 208(a)
or Section 208(b) hereto, as applicable, or (2) with respect to the 2033 Bonds, the price at which the 2033 Bonds may be redeemed pursuant to
Section 308(a) or Section 308(b) hereto, as applicable.
“Treasury Rate” means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the yield determined by the Company in accordance with the following two
paragraphs.
The Treasury Rate shall be determined by the Company after 4:15 p.m., New York City time (or after such time as yields on U.S. government
securities are posted daily by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System), on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date based
upon the yield or yields for the most recent day that appear after such time on such day in the most recent statistical release published by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System designated as “Selected Interest Rates (Daily)—H.15” (or any successor designation or publication) (“H.15”)
under the caption “U.S. government securities–Treasury constant maturities—Nominal” (or any successor caption or heading) (“H.15 TCM”). In
determining the Treasury Rate, the Company shall select, as applicable: (1) the yield for the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal to the
period from the Redemption Date to the applicable Par Call Date of the 2029 Bonds and the 2033 Bonds (the “Remaining Life”); or (2) if there is no
such Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal to the Remaining Life, the two yields—one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity
on H.15 immediately shorter than and one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately longer than the Remaining Life—
and shall interpolate to the applicable Par Call Date for the 2029 Bonds and the 2033 Bonds on a straight-line basis (using the actual number of days)
using such yields and rounding the result to three decimal places; or (3) if there is no such Treasury constant maturity on H.15 shorter than or longer
than the Remaining Life, the yield for the single Treasury constant maturity on H.15 closest to the Remaining Life. For purposes of this paragraph, the
applicable Treasury constant maturity or maturities on H.15 shall be deemed to have a maturity date equal to the relevant number of months or years, as
applicable, of such Treasury constant maturity from the Redemption Date.
 
2
If on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date H.15 TCM is no longer published, the Company shall calculate the Treasury Rate
based on the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity at 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day
preceding such Redemption Date of the United States Treasury security maturing on, or with a maturity that is closest to, the applicable Par Call Date
for the 2029 Bonds and the 2033 Bonds. If there is no United States Treasury security maturing on the applicable Par Call Date for the 2029 Bonds and
the 2033 Bonds but there are two or more United States Treasury securities with a maturity date equally distant from the applicable Par Call Date for the
2029 Bonds and the 2033 Bonds, one with a maturity date preceding such Par Call Date and one with a maturity date following such Par Call Date, the
Company shall select the United States Treasury security with a maturity date preceding such Par Call Date. If there are two or more United States
Treasury securities maturing on the applicable Par Call Date for the 2029 Bonds and the 2033 Bonds or two or more United States Treasury securities
meeting the criteria of the preceding sentence, the Company shall select from among these two or more United States Treasury securities the United
States Treasury security that is trading closest to par based upon the average of the bid and asked prices for such United States Treasury securities at
11:00 a.m., New York City time. In determining the Treasury Rate in accordance with the terms of this paragraph, the semi-annual yield to maturity of
the applicable United States Treasury security shall be based upon the average of the bid and asked prices (expressed as a percentage of principal
amount) at 11:00 a.m., New York City time, of such United States Treasury security, and rounded to three decimal places.

PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of California (herein called
the “Company,” which term includes any successor Person pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Mortgage Indenture hereinafter referred to), for
value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., as nominee for The Depository Trust Company, or registered assigns, the Principal Amount
stated above on the Maturity Date stated above, and to pay interest thereon from and including the Original Issue Date stated above or, in the case of a
6.100% First Mortgage Bond Due 2029 issued upon the registration of transfer or exchange, from and including the most recent Interest Payment Date
to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually in arrears on the Interest Payment Dates set forth above and on the Maturity Date
stated above at the rate of 6.100% per annum until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment. The interest so payable, and punctually
paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Mortgage Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this 6.100%
First Mortgage Bond Due 2029 (this “Bond”) (or one or more Predecessor Bonds) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for
such interest, which shall be January 1 or July 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date;
provided, however, that interest payable at the Maturity Date or on a Redemption Date will be paid to the Person to whom principal is payable. Any such
interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid
to the Person in whose name this Bond (or one or more Predecessor Bonds) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the
payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, as set forth in Section 3.07 of the Mortgage Indenture, notice whereof shall be given to
Holders of Bonds of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not
inconsistent with the requirements of the Mortgage Indenture and any securities exchange, if any, on which the Bonds of this series may be listed, and
upon such notice as may be required by any such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Mortgage Indenture.
Payments of interest on this Bond will include interest accrued to but excluding the respective Interest Payment Dates. Interest payments for this
Bond shall be computed and paid on the basis of the 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on
this Bond (other than the Maturity Date) is not a Business Day, then payment of the interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding
day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or payment in respect of any such delay) with the same force and effect as if made on the date the
payment was originally payable. If the Maturity Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest
may be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after maturity.
 
A-2
Payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds of this series shall be made in such coin or currency of the United States of
America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the
Bonds of this series represented by a Global Bond shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Holder of such Global Bond,
provided that, in the case of payments of principal and premium, if any, such Global Bond is first surrendered to the Paying Agent. If any of the Bonds
of this series are no longer represented by a Global Bond, (i) payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest due on the Maturity Date or on a
Redemption Date of such Bonds shall be made at the office of the Paying Agent upon surrender of such Bonds to the Paying Agent, and (ii) payments of
interest shall be made, at the option of the Company, subject to such surrender where applicable, (A) by check mailed to the address of the Person
entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Bond Register or (B) by wire transfer to registered Holders of at least $10,000,000 in principal
amount of Bonds at such place and to such account at a banking institution in the United States as such Holders may designate in writing to the Trustee
at least sixteen (16) days prior to the date for payment.
REFERENCE IS HEREBY MADE TO THE FURTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS BOND SET FORTH ON THE REVERSE HEREOF, WHICH
FURTHER PROVISIONS SHALL FOR ALL PURPOSES HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS IF SET FORTH AT THIS PLACE.

[FORM OF REVERSE OF 6.100% FIRST MORTGAGE BOND DUE 2029]
This 6.100% First Mortgage Bond due 2029 is one of a duly authorized issue of Bonds of the Company (the “Bonds”), issued and issuable in one
or more series under and equally secured by an Indenture of Mortgage, dated as of June 19, 2020 (such Mortgage Indenture as originally executed and
delivered and as supplemented or amended from time to time thereafter, together with any constituent instruments establishing the terms of particular
Bonds, being herein called the “Mortgage Indenture”), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee
(herein called the “Trustee”, which term includes any successor trustee under the Mortgage Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Mortgage
Indenture for a description of the property mortgaged, pledged and held in trust, the nature and extent of the security and the respective rights,
limitations of rights, duties and immunities of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of Bonds thereunder and of the terms and conditions upon
which Bonds are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. The acceptance of this Bond shall be deemed to constitute the consent and agreement by the
Holder hereof to all of the terms and provisions of the Mortgage Indenture.
The Company shall not be required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Bonds of this series.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Mortgage Indenture, prior to the Par Call Date, the Company may redeem the Bonds of this series at its
option (“Optional Redemption”), in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a Redemption Price (expressed as a percentage of the
principal amount and rounded to three decimal places) equal to the greater of: (1)(a) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments
of principal and interest thereon discounted to the Redemption Date (assuming the Bonds of this series matured on the Par Call Date) on a semi-annual
basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 40 basis points, less (b) interest accrued to the
Redemption Date; and (2) 100% of the principal amount of the Bonds of this series to be redeemed, plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest
thereon to the Redemption Date.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Mortgage Indenture, on or after the Par Call Date, the Company may redeem the Bonds of this series, in
whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Bonds of this series being
redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date.
For purposes of determining the Redemption Price, the following terms have the following meanings:
“Par Call Date” means December 15, 2028.
“Treasury Rate” means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the yield determined by the Company in accordance with the following two
paragraphs.
 
A-6
The Treasury Rate shall be determined by the Company after 4:15 p.m., New York City time (or after such time as yields on U.S. government
securities are posted daily by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System), on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date based
upon the yield or yields for the most recent day that appear after such time on such day in the most recent statistical release published by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System designated as “Selected Interest Rates (Daily)—H.15” (or any successor designation or publication) (“H.15”)
under the caption “U.S. government securities–Treasury constant maturities—Nominal” (or any successor caption or heading) (“H.15 TCM”). In
determining the Treasury Rate, the Company shall select, as applicable: (1) the yield for the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal to the
period from the Redemption Date to the Par Call Date (the “Remaining Life”); or (2) if there is no such Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly
equal to the Remaining Life, the two yields—one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately shorter than and one yield
corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately longer than the Remaining Life—and shall interpolate to the Par Call Date on a
straight-line basis (using the actual number of days) using such yields and rounding the result to three decimal places; or (3) if there is no such Treasury
constant maturity on H.15 shorter than or longer than the Remaining Life, the yield for the single Treasury constant maturity on H.15 closest to the
Remaining Life. For purposes of this paragraph, the applicable Treasury constant maturity or maturities on H.15 shall be deemed to have a maturity date
equal to the relevant number of months or years, as applicable, of such Treasury constant maturity from the Redemption Date.
If on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date H.15 TCM is no longer published, the Company shall calculate the Treasury Rate
based on the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity at 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day
preceding such Redemption Date of the United States Treasury security maturing on, or with a maturity that is closest to, the Par Call Date. If there is no
United States Treasury security maturing on the Par Call Date but there are two or more United States Treasury securities with a maturity date equally
distant from the applicable Par Call Date, one with a maturity date preceding the Par Call Date and one with a maturity date following the Par Call Date,
the Company shall select the United States Treasury security with a maturity date preceding the Par Call Date. If there are two or more United States
Treasury securities maturing on the Par Call Date or two or more United States Treasury securities meeting the criteria of the preceding sentence, the
Company shall select from among these two or more United States Treasury securities the United States Treasury security that is trading closest to par
based upon the average of the bid and asked prices for such United States Treasury securities at 11:00 a.m., New York City time. In determining the
Treasury Rate in accordance with the terms of this paragraph, the semi-annual yield to maturity of the applicable United States Treasury security shall be
based upon the average of the bid and asked prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) at 11:00 a.m., New York City time, of such United
States Treasury security, and rounded to three decimal places.
Interest installments whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to such Redemption Date will be payable to Holders of such Bonds of this series, or one
or more Predecessor Bonds, of record at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates referred to on the face hereof, all as provided in the
Mortgage Indenture.
In the case of an Optional Redemption, notice of redemption will be sent not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption
Date to each Holder of Bonds of this series to be redeemed. If money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of all Bonds of this series (or portions
thereof) to be redeemed on the Redemption Date is deposited with the Paying Agent or the Trustee on or prior to the Redemption Date, from and after
such Redemption Date such Bonds of this series or portions thereof shall cease to bear interest. The Bonds of this series in denominations larger than
$2,000 in principal amount may be redeemed in part but only in integral multiples of $1,000.
 
A-7
In the case of a partial redemption, selection of the Bonds of this series for redemption will be made pro rata, by lot or by such other method as the
Trustee in its sole discretion deems appropriate and fair. No Bonds of this series of a principal amount of $2,000 or less will be redeemed in part. If any
Bond of this series is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to the Bond of this series will state the portion of the principal
amount of the Bond of this series to be redeemed. A new Bond of this series in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Bond of this
series will be issued in the name of the Holder of the Bond of this series upon surrender for cancellation of the original Bond of this series. For so long
as the Bonds of this series are held by DTC (or another Depositary), the redemption of the Bonds of this series shall be done in accordance with the
policies and procedures of the Depositary.
As provided in the Mortgage Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, this Bond or any portion of the principal amount hereof
will be deemed to have been paid for all purposes of the Mortgage Indenture and to be no longer Outstanding thereunder, and the Company’s entire
indebtedness in respect thereof will be satisfied and discharged, if there has been irrevocably deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent (other than
the Company), in trust, money in an amount which will be sufficient and/or Eligible Obligations, the principal of and interest on which when due,
without regard to any reinvestment thereof, will provide moneys which, together with money, if any, deposited with or held by the Trustee or such
Paying Agent, will be sufficient to pay when due the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on this Bond when due.
If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing as provided in the Mortgage Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in
aggregate principal amount of Bonds then Outstanding, considered as one class, may declare the principal amount of all Bonds then Outstanding to be
due and payable immediately by notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders); provided, however, that with respect to
certain Events of Default relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and similar events, the principal amount of all Bonds then Outstanding shall be due and
payable immediately without further action by the Trustee or the Holders.
The Mortgage Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the Company and the Trustee to enter into one or more supplemental
indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to, or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of, the Mortgage Indenture with
the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds at the time Outstanding, considered as one class;
provided, however, that if there shall be Bonds of more than one series Outstanding under the Mortgage Indenture and if a proposed supplemental
indenture shall directly affect the rights of the Holders of Bonds of one or more, but less than all, of such series, then the consent only of the Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Bonds of all series so directly affected, considered as one class, shall be required; and
provided, further, that if the Bonds of any series shall have been issued in more than one Tranche and if a proposed supplemental indenture shall directly
affect the rights of the Holders of Bonds of one or more, but less than all, of such Tranches, then the consent only of the
 
A-8
Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Bonds of all Tranches so directly affected, considered as one class, shall be
required; and provided, further, that the Mortgage Indenture permits the Company and the Trustee to enter into one or more supplemental indentures for
certain purposes without the consent of any Holders of Bonds. The Mortgage Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of Bonds, on behalf of the Holders of all such Bonds, to waive certain past defaults under the Mortgage Indenture and their
consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Bond shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of
this Bond and of any Bond issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such
consent or waiver is made upon this Bond.
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Mortgage Indenture, the Holder of this Bond shall not have the right to institute any proceeding
with respect to the Mortgage Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have
previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default, the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds at
the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered
the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of Bonds
at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such written request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding for 60 days after receipt
of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Bond for the enforcement of any
payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
No reference herein to the Mortgage Indenture and no provision of this Bond or of the Mortgage Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of
the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Bond at the times, place and rate, and in
the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
As provided in the Mortgage Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Bond is registrable in the Bond
Register, upon surrender of this Bond for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any
premium and interest on this Bond are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the
Company, the Trustee or the Bond Registrar, as the case may be, duly executed by the Holder hereof or such Holder’s attorney duly authorized in
writing, and thereupon one or more new Bonds of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal
amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
The Bonds of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in
excess thereof. As provided in the Mortgage Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Bonds of this series are exchangeable for a like
aggregate principal amount of Bonds of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holders surrendering the
same.
 
A-9
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
The Company shall not be required to execute or to provide for the registration of the transfer of or the exchange of (A) any Bond of this series
during a period of 15 days immediately preceding the date notice is to be given identifying the serial numbers (or with respect to Global Bonds, CUSIP
numbers) of the Bonds of this series called for redemption, or (B) any Bond of this series selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the
unredeemed portion of any Bond of this series being redeemed in part.
Prior to due presentment of this Bond for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat
the Person in whose name this Bond is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Bond is overdue, and neither the Company,
the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
This Bond shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York without regard to the
principles of conflicts of laws thereunder, except to the extent that the Trust Indenture Act shall be applicable.
As provided in the Mortgage Indenture, no recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest with respect to
this Bond, or any part thereof, or for any claim based hereon or otherwise in respect hereof, or of the indebtedness represented hereby, or upon any
obligation, covenant or agreement under the Mortgage Indenture, against any incorporator, shareholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or
future, of the Company or of any predecessor or successor corporation (either directly or through the Company or a predecessor or successor
corporation), whether by virtue of any constitutional provision, statute or rule of law or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise; it
being expressly agreed and understood that the Mortgage Indenture and all the Bonds are solely corporate obligations and that any such personal
liability is hereby expressly waived and released as a condition of, and as part of the consideration for, the execution of the Mortgage Indenture and the
issuance of this Bond.
All terms used in this Bond which are not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Mortgage Indenture.

PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of California (herein called
the “Company,” which term includes any successor Person pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Mortgage Indenture hereinafter referred to), for
value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., as nominee for The Depository Trust Company, or registered assigns, the Principal Amount
stated above on the Maturity Date stated above, and to pay interest thereon from and including the Original Issue Date stated above or, in the case of a
6.400% First Mortgage Bond Due 2033 issued upon the registration of transfer or exchange, from and including the most recent Interest Payment Date
to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually in arrears on the Interest Payment Dates set forth above and on the Maturity Date
stated above at the rate of 6.400% per annum until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment. The interest so payable, and punctually
paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Mortgage Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this 6.400%
First Mortgage Bond Due 2033 (this “Bond”) (or one or more Predecessor Bonds) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for

provided, however, that interest payable at the Maturity Date or on a Redemption Date will be paid to the Person to whom principal is payable. Any such
interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid
to the Person in whose name this Bond (or one or more Predecessor Bonds) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the

inconsistent with the requirements of the Mortgage Indenture and any securities exchange, if any, on which the Bonds of this series may be listed, and
upon such notice as may be required by any such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Mortgage Indenture.
Payments of interest on this Bond will include interest accrued to but excluding the respective Interest Payment Dates. Interest payments for this
Bond shall be computed and paid on the basis of the 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on
this Bond (other than the Maturity Date) is not a Business Day, then payment of the interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding
day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or payment in respect of any such delay) with the same force and effect as if made on the date the
payment was originally payable. If the Maturity Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest
may be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after maturity.

[FORM OF REVERSE OF 6.400% FIRST MORTGAGE BOND DUE 2033]
This 6.400% First Mortgage Bond due 2033 is one of a duly authorized issue of Bonds of the Company (the “Bonds”), issued and issuable in one
or more series under and equally secured by an Indenture of Mortgage, dated as of June 19, 2020 (such Mortgage Indenture as originally executed and
delivered and as supplemented or amended from time to time thereafter, together with any constituent instruments establishing the terms of particular
Bonds, being herein called the “Mortgage Indenture”), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee
(herein called the “Trustee”, which term includes any successor trustee under the Mortgage Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Mortgage
Indenture for a description of the property mortgaged, pledged and held in trust, the nature and extent of the security and the respective rights,
limitations of rights, duties and immunities of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of Bonds thereunder and of the terms and conditions upon
which Bonds are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. The acceptance of this Bond shall be deemed to constitute the consent and agreement by the
Holder hereof to all of the terms and provisions of the Mortgage Indenture.
The Company shall not be required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Bonds of this series.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Mortgage Indenture, prior to the Par Call Date, the Company may redeem the Bonds of this series at its
option (“Optional Redemption”), in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a Redemption Price (expressed as a percentage of the
principal amount and rounded to three decimal places) equal to the greater of: (1)(a) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments
of principal and interest thereon discounted to the Redemption Date (assuming the Bonds of this series matured on the Par Call Date) on a semi-annual
basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 45 basis points, less (b) interest accrued to the
Redemption Date; and (2) 100% of the principal amount of the Bonds of this series to be redeemed, plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest
thereon to the Redemption Date.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Mortgage Indenture, on or after the Par Call Date, the Company may redeem the Bonds of this series, in
whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Bonds of this series being
redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date.
For purposes of determining the Redemption Price, the following terms have the following meanings:
“Par Call Date” means March 15, 2033.
“Treasury Rate” means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the yield determined by the Company in accordance with the following two
paragraphs.
 
B-6
The Treasury Rate shall be determined by the Company after 4:15 p.m., New York City time (or after such time as yields on U.S. government
securities are posted daily by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System), on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date based
upon the yield or yields for the most recent day that appear after such time on such day in the most recent statistical release published by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System designated as “Selected Interest Rates (Daily)—H.15” (or any successor designation or publication) (“H.15”)
under the caption “U.S. government securities–Treasury constant maturities—Nominal” (or any successor caption or heading) (“H.15 TCM”). In
determining the Treasury Rate, the Company shall select, as applicable: (1) the yield for the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal to the
period from the Redemption Date to the Par Call Date (the “Remaining Life”); or (2) if there is no such Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly
equal to the Remaining Life, the two yields—one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately shorter than and one yield
corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately longer than the Remaining Life—and shall interpolate to the Par Call Date on a
straight-line basis (using the actual number of days) using such yields and rounding the result to three decimal places; or (3) if there is no such Treasury
constant maturity on H.15 shorter than or longer than the Remaining Life, the yield for the single Treasury constant maturity on H.15 closest to the
Remaining Life. For purposes of this paragraph, the applicable Treasury constant maturity or maturities on H.15 shall be deemed to have a maturity date
equal to the relevant number of months or years, as applicable, of such Treasury constant maturity from the Redemption Date.
If on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date H.15 TCM is no longer published, the Company shall calculate the Treasury Rate
based on the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity at 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day
preceding such Redemption Date of the United States Treasury security maturing on, or with a maturity that is closest to, the Par Call Date. If there is no
United States Treasury security maturing on the Par Call Date but there are two or more United States Treasury securities with a maturity date equally
distant from the applicable Par Call Date, one with a maturity date preceding the Par Call Date and one with a maturity date following the Par Call Date,
the Company shall select the United States Treasury security with a maturity date preceding the Par Call Date. If there are two or more United States
Treasury securities maturing on the Par Call Date or two or more United States Treasury securities meeting the criteria of the preceding sentence, the
Company shall select from among these two or more United States Treasury securities the United States Treasury security that is trading closest to par
based upon the average of the bid and asked prices for such United States Treasury securities at 11:00 a.m., New York City time. In determining the
Treasury Rate in accordance with the terms of this paragraph, the semi-annual yield to maturity of the applicable United States Treasury security shall be
based upon the average of the bid and asked prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) at 11:00 a.m., New York City time, of such United
States Treasury security, and rounded to three decimal places.
Interest installments whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to such Redemption Date will be payable to Holders of such Bonds of this series, or one
or more Predecessor Bonds, of record at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates referred to on the face hereof, all as provided in the
Mortgage Indenture.
In the case of an Optional Redemption, notice of redemption will be sent not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption
Date to each Holder of Bonds of this series to be redeemed. If money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of all Bonds of this series (or portions
thereof) to be redeemed on the Redemption Date is deposited with the Paying Agent or the Trustee on or prior to the Redemption Date, from and after
such Redemption Date such Bonds of this series or portions thereof shall cease to bear interest. The Bonds of this series in denominations larger than
$2,000 in principal amount may be redeemed in part but only in integral multiples of $1,000.
 
B-7
In the case of a partial redemption, selection of the Bonds of this series for redemption will be made pro rata, by lot or by such other method as the
Trustee in its sole discretion deems appropriate and fair. No Bonds of this series of a principal amount of $2,000 or less will be redeemed in part. If any
Bond of this series is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to the Bond of this series will state the portion of the principal
amount of the Bond of this series to be redeemed. A new Bond of this series in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Bond of this
series will be issued in the name of the Holder of the Bond of this series upon surrender for cancellation of the original Bond of this series. For so long
as the Bonds of this series are held by DTC (or another Depositary), the redemption of the Bonds of this series shall be done in accordance with the
policies and procedures of the Depositary.
As provided in the Mortgage Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, this Bond or any portion of the principal amount hereof
will be deemed to have been paid for all purposes of the Mortgage Indenture and to be no longer Outstanding thereunder, and the Company’s entire
indebtedness in respect thereof will be satisfied and discharged, if there has been irrevocably deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent (other than
the Company), in trust, money in an amount which will be sufficient and/or Eligible Obligations, the principal of and interest on which when due,
without regard to any reinvestment thereof, will provide moneys which, together with money, if any, deposited with or held by the Trustee or such
Paying Agent, will be sufficient to pay when due the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on this Bond when due.
If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing as provided in the Mortgage Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in
aggregate principal amount of Bonds then Outstanding, considered as one class, may declare the principal amount of all Bonds then Outstanding to be
due and payable immediately by notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders); provided, however, that with respect to
certain Events of Default relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and similar events, the principal amount of all Bonds then Outstanding shall be due and
payable immediately without further action by the Trustee or the Holders.
The Mortgage Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the Company and the Trustee to enter into one or more supplemental
indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to, or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of, the Mortgage Indenture with
the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds at the time Outstanding, considered as one class;
provided, however, that if there shall be Bonds of more than one series Outstanding under the Mortgage Indenture and if a proposed supplemental
indenture shall directly affect the rights of the Holders of Bonds of one or more, but less than all, of such series, then the consent only of the Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Bonds of all series so directly affected, considered as one class, shall be required; and
provided, further, that if the Bonds of any series shall have been issued in more than one Tranche and if a proposed supplemental indenture shall directly
affect the rights of the Holders of Bonds of one or more, but less than all, of such Tranches, then the consent only of the
 
B-8
Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Bonds of all Tranches so directly affected, considered as one class, shall be
required; and provided, further, that the Mortgage Indenture permits the Company and the Trustee to enter into one or more supplemental indentures for
certain purposes without the consent of any Holders of Bonds. The Mortgage Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of Bonds, on behalf of the Holders of all such Bonds, to waive certain past defaults under the Mortgage Indenture and their
consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Bond shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of
this Bond and of any Bond issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such
consent or waiver is made upon this Bond.
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Mortgage Indenture, the Holder of this Bond shall not have the right to institute any proceeding
with respect to the Mortgage Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have
previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default, the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds at
the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered
the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of Bonds
at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such written request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding for 60 days after receipt
of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Bond for the enforcement of any
payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
No reference herein to the Mortgage Indenture and no provision of this Bond or of the Mortgage Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of
the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Bond at the times, place and rate, and in
the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
As provided in the Mortgage Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Bond is registrable in the Bond
Register, upon surrender of this Bond for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any
premium and interest on this Bond are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the
Company, the Trustee or the Bond Registrar, as the case may be, duly executed by the Holder hereof or such Holder’s attorney duly authorized in
writing, and thereupon one or more new Bonds of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal
amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
The Bonds of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in
excess thereof. As provided in the Mortgage Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Bonds of this series are exchangeable for a like
aggregate principal amount of Bonds of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holders surrendering the
same.
 
B-9
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
The Company shall not be required to execute or to provide for the registration of the transfer of or the exchange of (A) any Bond of this series
during a period of 15 days immediately preceding the date notice is to be given identifying the serial numbers (or with respect to Global Bonds, CUSIP
numbers) of the Bonds of this series called for redemption, or (B) any Bond of this series selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the
unredeemed portion of any Bond of this series being redeemed in part.
Prior to due presentment of this Bond for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat
the Person in whose name this Bond is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Bond is overdue, and neither the Company,
the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
This Bond shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York without regard to the
principles of conflicts of laws thereunder, except to the extent that the Trust Indenture Act shall be applicable.
As provided in the Mortgage Indenture, no recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest with respect to
this Bond, or any part thereof, or for any claim based hereon or otherwise in respect hereof, or of the indebtedness represented hereby, or upon any
obligation, covenant or agreement under the Mortgage Indenture, against any incorporator, shareholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or
future, of the Company or of any predecessor or successor corporation (either directly or through the Company or a predecessor or successor
corporation), whether by virtue of any constitutional provision, statute or rule of law or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise; it
being expressly agreed and understood that the Mortgage Indenture and all the Bonds are solely corporate obligations and that any such personal
liability is hereby expressly waived and released as a condition of, and as part of the consideration for, the execution of the Mortgage Indenture and the
issuance of this Bond.
All terms used in this Bond which are not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Mortgage Indenture.

In rendering the opinion expressed below, we have examined and relied upon copies of the Registration Statement and the exhibits filed therewith
and the Mortgage. We have also examined originals, or copies of originals certified to our satisfaction, of such agreements, documents, certificates and
statements of government officials and other instruments, and have examined such questions of law and have satisfied ourselves as to such matters of
fact, as we have considered relevant and necessary as a basis for this opinion letter. We have assumed: (i) the genuineness of all signatures; (ii) the legal
capacity of natural persons; (iii) the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and (iv) the conformity to original documents of all
documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. We have also assumed that the
Mortgage will be the valid and legally binding obligation of the Trustee.
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion that the Mortgage Bonds, when
duly authenticated by the Trustee and issued and delivered by the Company against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting
Agreement and the Mortgage, will constitute the valid and binding obligations of the Company (subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation,
receivership, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance, transfer or other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting the enforcement
of mortgagees’ and other creditors’ rights and by the effect of general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding at law or in
equity).
We do not express any opinion herein concerning any law other than the laws of the State of New York and the State of California.
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion letter as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to all references to us included in or made a
part of the Registration Statement. In giving the foregoing consent, we do not hereby admit that we come within the category of persons whose consent
is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder. This opinion letter is limited to the matters stated in
this opinion letter, and no opinion may be implied or inferred beyond the matters expressly stated in this opinion letter. This opinion letter is given as of
the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to advise you after the date hereof of facts or circumstances that come to our attention or changes in the
law, including judicial or administrative interpretations thereof, that occur which could affect the opinions contained herein.
