ITEM 1. BUSINESS
GENERAL
NIKE, Inc. was incorporated in 1967 under the laws of the S
tate of Oregon. As used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “NIKE” and the “Company” refer to NIKE, Inc. and itspredecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates, collectively, unless the context indicates otherwise. Our NIKE digital commerce website is located at 
www.nike.com . On our NIKE corporate website, located at 
investors.nike.com , we post the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”): our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and
any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities and 
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our definitive ProxyStatements are also posted on our corporate website. All such filings on our corporate website are available free of charge. Copies of these
 filings are also available on theSEC's website ( 
www.sec.gov ). Also available on our corporate website are the charters of the committees of our Board of Directors, as well as our corporate governance guidelines and code of ethics; copies of any of these documents will be provided in print to any shareholder who submits a request in writing to NIK
E Investor Relations, OneBowerman Drive, Beaverton, Oregon 97005-6453.
Our principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. NIKE is the
largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products through NIKE-owned retail stores and through digital platforms (which we refer to collectively as
our “NIKE Direct” operations), to retail accounts and a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Virtually
all of our products are manufactured by independent contractors. Nearly all footwear and apparel products are produced outside the United States,
 while equipment productsare produced both in the United States and abroad.
PRODUCTS
We focus our NIKE Brand product offerings in six key categories: Running, NIKE
 Basketball, the Jordan Brand, Football (Soccer), Training and Sportswear (our sports-inspiredlifestyle products). We also market products designed for kids, as well as for other athletic and recreational uses such as American football, baseball, cricket, golf,
 lacrosse,skateboarding, tennis, volleyball, walking, wrestling and other outdoor activities.
NIKE's athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use, although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes. We place
considerable emphasis on innovation and high-quality construction in the development and manufacturing of our products. Sportswear, Running and the Jordan Brand are
currently our top-selling footwear categories and we expect them to continue to lead in footwear sales.
We also sell sports apparel covering the above-mentioned categories, which feature the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and
distribution channels as athletic footwear. Our sports apparel, similar to our athletic footwear products, is designed primarily for athletic use and exemplifies our commitment to
innovation and high-quality construction. Sportswear, Training and Running are currently our top-selling apparel categories and we expect them to continue to lead in apparel
sales. We often market footwear, apparel and accessories in “collections” of similar use or by category. We also market apparel with licensed college and professional team
and league logos.
We sell a line of performance equipment and accessories under the NIKE Brand name, including bags, socks, sport balls, eyewear, timepieces, digital devices, bats,
 gloves,protective equipment and other equipment designed for sports activities. We also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through our wholly-
owned subsidiary, NIKE IHM, Inc., doing business as Air Manufacturing Innovation.
2019 FORM 10-K

Table of ContentsOur Jordan Brand designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories predominantly focused on basketball using the Jumpman trademark.
Sales and operating results for Jordan Brand products are reported within the respective NIKE Brand geographic operating segments.
One of our wholly-owned subsidiary brands, Converse, headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, designs, distributes and licenses casual sneakers, apparel and accessories
under the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack 
Purcell trademarks. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alonebasis.
Another of our wholly-owned subsidiary brands, Hurley, headquartered in Costa Mesa, California, designs and distributes a line of action sports and youth lifestyle apparel and
accessories under the Hurley trademark. Sales and operating results for Hurley products are included within the NIKE Brand's North America geographic operating segment.
In addition to the products we sell to our wholesale customers and directly to consumers through our NIKE Direct operations, we have also entered into
 license agreementsthat permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture and sell, using NIKE-owned trademarks, certain apparel, digital devices and applications and other equipment designed for
sports activities.
SALES AND MARKETING
We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the
second and third quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of
footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as other macroeconomic, operating and logistics-related factors.
Because NIKE is a consumer products company, the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design 
trends affect the demand for our products.We must, therefore, respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of
 existing product offerings, developing new products, styles and categoriesand influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing. Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our
sales and profitability. This is a continuing risk. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.
We report our NIKE Brand operations based on our internal geographic organization. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the
design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Company's reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are:
 NorthAmerica; Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA); Greater China; and Asia Pacific &
 Latin America (APLA), and include results for the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands. Salesthrough our NIKE Direct operations are managed within each geographic operating segment.
Converse is also a reportable operating segment and operates predominately in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and
accessories. Converse direct to consumer operations, including digital commerce, are reported within the Converse operating segment results.
UNITED STATES MARKET
For 
fiscal 2019 , NIKE Brand and Converse sales in the United States accounted  for approximately 41% of total revenues, compared to 42% and 46% for fiscal 2018 and fiscal2017 
, respectively. We sell our NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley and Converse products to thousands of  retail accounts in the United States, including a mix of footwearstores, sporting goods stores, athletic specialty stores, department stores, skate,
 tennis and golf shops and other retail accounts. In the United States, we utilize NIKE salesoffices to solicit such sales. During 
fiscal 2019 , our three largest United States customers accounted for approximately 24% of sales in the United States. 2

Table of ContentsPRODUCT RESEARCH, DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
We believe our research, design and development efforts are key factors in our success. Technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of 
footwear, appareland athletic equipment receives continued emphasis as we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance, reduce injury and maximize comfort, while
reducing waste.
In addition to our own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, industrial design, sustainability and related fields, we also
utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists and other experts who consult with us
and review designs, materials, concepts for product and manufacturing process improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world. Employee
athletes, athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes wear-test and evaluate
 products during the design and development process.As we continue to develop new technologies, we are simultaneously focused on the design of innovative products incorporating such technologies throughout our product
categories. Using market intelligence and research, our various design teams identify opportunities to leverage new technologies in existing categories responding to consumer
preferences. The proliferation of NIKE Air, Lunar, Zoom, Free, Flywire, Dri-Fit, Flyknit, Flyweave, ZoomX, React, Adaptive and NI
KE+ technologies, among others, throughoutour Running, NIKE Basketball, Jordan Brand, Football (Soccer), Training and Sportswear categories typifies our dedication to designing innovative products.
MANUFACTURING
We are supplied by 
112 footwear factories located in 12 countries. The largest single footwear factory accounted for approximately 9% of total fiscal 2019 NIKE Brand footwear production. Virtually all of our footwear is manufactured outside of the United States by independent
 contract manufacturers which often operate multiple factories. For fiscal 2019 
, contract factories in Vietnam, China and Indonesia manufactured approximately 49%, 23% and 21% of  total NIKE Brand footwear, respectively. We also havemanufacturing agreements with independent contract manufacturers in Argentina and India to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries. For 
fiscal 2019 , four 
footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10% of footwear production and in the aggregate accounted for approximately 61% of NIKE Brand footwear production.
We are supplied by 
334 apparel factories located in 36 countries. The largest single apparel factory accounted for approximately 14% of total fiscal 2019 NIKE Brand apparel production. Virtually all of our apparel is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract
 manufacturers which often operate multiple factories. For fiscal 2019 
, contract factories in China, Vietnam and Thailand produced approximately 27%, 22% and 10% of total NI KE Brand apparel, respectively. For fiscal 2019 , one apparelcontract manufacturer accounted for more than 10% of apparel production, and the top
 five contract manufacturers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 49% of NIKE Brand apparel production.
The principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, nylon,
polyester and canvas, as well as polyurethane films used to make NIKE Air-Sole cushioning components. During 
fiscal 2019 , Air Manufacturing Innovation, a wholly-owned subsidiary, with facilities near Beaverton, Oregon and in St. Charles, Missouri, as well as independent contractors in China and Vietnam, were our suppliers of the Air-Sole
cushioning components used in footwear. The principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads (both virgin and recycled);
specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat and repel rain and/or snow; and plastic and metal hardware. NIKE's
independent contractors and suppliers buy raw materials for the manufacturing of our footwear, apparel and equipment products. Most raw materials are available and
purchased by those independent contractors and suppliers in the countries where manufacturing takes place. NIKE's independent contract
 manufacturers and suppliers havethus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying raw material requirements for the production of our products.
Since 1972, Sojitz Corporation of America (“Sojitz America”), a large Japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock, has performed import-
export financing services for us. During 
fiscal 2019 , Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in certain NIKE markets including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, India, South Africa and Uruguay, excluding products produced and sold in the same coun
try. Approximately 5% of NIKE Brand sales occurred inthose countries. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz America's banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers
and to deliver products to our customers in those markets. Such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and
 profitability. However, webelieve that any such disruption would be short-term in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates.

NIKE, INC.
Table of ContentsINTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TRADE
Our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad, such as the
 implementation of, or potential changes in, foreign anddomestic trade policies, increases in import duties, anti-dumping measures, quotas, safeguard measures, trade restrictions, restrictions on the transfer of funds and, in certain
parts of the world, political instability and terrorism. We have not, to date, been materially affected by any
 such risk, but cannot predict the likelihood of such material effectsoccurring in the future.
In recent years, uncertain global and regional economic and political conditions have affected international trade and increased protectionist actions around the world. These
trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors, and the footwear and apparel industries, as a whole, are not immune. Companies in our industry are
facing trade protectionism in many different regions, and in nearly all cases we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the
industry, while observing applicable competition laws. Notwithstanding our efforts, protectionist measures have resulted in increases in the cost of our products, and additional
measures, if implemented, could adversely affect sales and/or profitability for NIKE, as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole.
We monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry, and we engage in administrative and judicial processes to
mitigate trade restrictions. We are actively monitoring actions that may result in additional anti-dumping measures and could affect our industry. We are also monitoring for and
advocating against other impediments that may limit or delay customs clearance for imports of footwear, apparel and equipment. NIKE also advocates for 
trade liberalizationfor footwear and apparel in a number of regional and bilateral free trade agreements. Changes in U.S. trade policies, including new and potential tariffs or penalties on
imported goods, may negatively affect U.S. corporations with production activities outside the U.S.,
 including NIKE. There have also been discussions and commentaryregarding retaliatory actions by countries affected by the new tariffs and other changes in U.S.
 trade policy, and certain foreign governments have instituted or are consideringimposing retaliatory measures on certain U.S. goods, which could negatively affect U.S. corporations with business operations and/or consumer markets in those countries.
Depending on the extent that certain new or proposed reforms are implemented by the U.S. government and the
 manner in which foreign governments respond to suchreforms, it may become necessary for us to change the way we conduct business, which may adversely affect our results o
f operations. In addition, with respect to proposedtrade restrictions targeting China, which represents an important sourcing country and consumer market for us, we are working with a broad coalition of global businesses and
trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented (i) addresses legitimate and core concerns, (ii) is
consistent with international trade rules and (iii) reflects and considers China's domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community.
Where trade protection measures are implemented, we believe that we have the ability to develop, over a period of time, adequate alternative sources of
 supply for theproducts obtained from our present suppliers. If events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country, our operations could be temporarily
disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact. However, we believe we could abate any such disruption, and that much of the adverse impact on supply
would, therefore, be of a short-term nature, although alternate sources of supply might not be
 as cost-effective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability.Our international operations are also subject to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or "FCPA",
 and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations. Wesource a significant portion of our products from, and have important consumer markets, outside of the United S
tates, and we have an ethics and compliance program toaddress compliance with the FCPA and similar laws by us, our employees, agents, suppliers and other partners.
COMPETITION
The athletic footwear, apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure
footwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear,
apparel and equipment, including adidas, Anta, ASICS, Li Ning, lululemon athletica, Puma, Under Armour and V.F. Corporation, among others.
 The intense competition andthe rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk
factors in our operations.
2019 FORM 10-K 
5 
Table of ContentsNIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. Important aspects of
 competition in this industry are:•
Product attributes such as quality; performance and reliability; new product innovation and development and consumer price/value.•
Consumer connection and affinity for brands and products, developed through marketing and promotion; social media interaction; customer support and service;identification with prominent and influential athletes, public figures, coaches, teams, colleges and sports leagues who endorse our brands and use our products and active
engagement through sponsored sporting events and clinics.
•
Effective sourcing and distribution of products, with attractive merchandising and presentation at retail, both in-store and digital platforms.We believe that we are competitive in all of these areas.
TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS
We believe that our intellectual property rights are important to our brand, our success and our competitive position. We pursue available protections of these rights and
vigorously protect them against third-party theft and infringement.
We use trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in
identifying our brands and the Company, and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our NIKE and
 Swoosh Design trademarks to be among ourmost valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost 170 jurisdictions worldwide. In addition, we own many other trademarks that we use in marketing our
products. We own common law rights in the trade dress of several significant shoe designs and elements. For certain trade dress, we have sought and
 obtained trademarkregistrations.
We have copyright protection in our design, graphics and other original works. In some instances, we also obtain registered copyrights.
We file for, own and maintain many U.S. and foreign utility and design patents protecting components,
 technologies, materials, manufacturing techniques, features,functionality, and industrial and aesthetic designs used in and for the manufacture of various athletic and leisure footwear and apparel, a
thletic equipment and digital devicesand related software applications. These patents expire at various times.
We believe our success depends upon our capabilities in areas such as design, research and development, production and marketing and is supported by our intellectual
property rights, such as trademarks, patents and trade secrets, among others.
We have followed a policy of applying for and registering intellectual property rights in the United States and select foreign countries on trademarks, inventions, innovations and
designs that we deem valuable. We also continue to vigorously protect our intellectual property, including trademarks, patents and trade secrets against third-party
infringement.
EMPLOYEES
As of 
May 31, 2019 , we had approximately 76,700 employees worldwide, including retail and part-time employees. Management is committed to maintaining an environment where all NIKE employees have the opportunity to reach their full potential. None of our employees are represented by a union, except
 for certain employees in the APLAgeography, where local law requires those employees to be represented by a trade union. Also, in some countries outside of the United Sta
tes, local laws require employeerepresentation by works councils (which may be entitled to information and consultation on certain Company decisions) or by organizations similar to a union. In certain
European countries, we are required by local law to enter into and/or comply with industry-wide or national collective bargaining agreements. NIKE has never experienced a
material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements.

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Analyst Reports
Certain written and oral statements, other than purely historic information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to NIKE's business plans, objectives and
expected operating results and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, made or incorporated by reference from time to
 time by NIKE or its representatives inthis report, other reports, filings with the SEC, press releases, conferences or otherwise, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the
 Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, any statement that maypredict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements, and may contain the words “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “will be,” “will
continue,” “will likely result” or words or phrases of similar meaning. Forward-
looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differmaterially from the forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed by NIKE with the SEC, including reports filed on Forms
8-K, 10-Q and 10-K, and include, among others, the following: international, national and local general economic and market conditions; the size and growth o
f the overallathletic footwear, apparel and equipment markets; intense competition among designers, marketers, distributors and sellers of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment for
consumers and endorsers; demographic changes; changes in consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categories of products and sports; seasonal and
geographic demand for NIKE products; difficulties in anticipating or forecasting changes in consumer preferences, consumer demand for NIKE products and the
 various marketfactors described above; difficulties in implementing, operating and maintaining NIKE's increasingly complex information technology systems and controls, including, without
limitation, the systems related to demand and supply planning and inventory control; interruptions in data and information technology systems; consumer data security;
fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results, including, without limitation, the fact that advance
 orders may not be indicative of future revenues due to changes inshipment timing, the changing mix of orders with shorter lead times, and discounts, order cancellations and returns; the ability of NIKE to
 sustain, manage or forecast its growthand inventories; the size, timing and mix of purchases of NIKE's products; increases in the cos
t of materials, labor and energy used to manufacture products; new productdevelopment and introduction; the ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents and other intellectual property; product
 performance and quality; customer service; adversepublicity, including without limitation, through social media or in connection with brand damaging events; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; dependence on
distributors and licensees; business disruptions; increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery deadlines; increases in borrowing costs due to any decline in
NIKE's debt ratings; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks associated with doing business outside of the
 United States, including, without limitation,exchange rate fluctuations, inflation, import duties, tariffs, quotas, political and economic instability and terrorism; the impact of U.
S. tax reform legislation on our results ofoperations; the potential impact of new laws, regulations or policy, including, without limitation, tariffs, import/export, trade and immigration regulations or policies; changes in
government regulations; the impact of, including business and legal developments relating to, climate change and natural disasters; litigation, regulatory proceedings,
sanctions or any other claims asserted against NIKE; the ability to attract and
 retain qualified employees, and any negative public perception with respect to key personnel; theeffects of NIKE's decision to invest in or divest of
 businesses and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this report and other reports.The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect NIKE's
 business and financial performance.Moreover, NIKE operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such
risks, nor can it assess the impact of all such risks on NIKE's business or the exten
t to which any risk, or combination of risks, may cause actual results to differ materially fromthose contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a
prediction of actual results.
Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against NI
KE's policy to disclose to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with any statement or report issued by any
analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report.
 Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others. Thus, to theextent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not
 the responsibility of NIKE.Our products face intense competition.
NIKE is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends af
fect the demand for our products. Theathletic footwear, apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive both in the United States and worldwide. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic
and leisure footwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure
footwear, apparel and equipment. We also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers tha
t produce our products. Our NIKEDirect operations, both through our digital commerce operations and retail stores, also compete with multi-brand retailers selling our products.

NIKE, INC.
Table of ContentsProduct offerings, technologies, marketing expenditures (including expenditures for advertising and endorsements), pricing, costs of production, customer service, digital
commerce platforms and social media presence are areas of intense competition. This, in addition to rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for
athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in our operations. In addition, the
 competitive nature of retail including shiftsin the ways in which consumers are shopping, and the rising trend of digital commerce, constitutes a risk factor implicating our NIKE Direct and wholesale operations. If we do
not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors, our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly.
Failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively
 impact our business.Our iconic brands have worldwide recognition, and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation. Maintaining, promoting and
growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts, including advertising and consumer campaigns, product innovation and product quality. Our commitment
to product innovation and quality and our continuing investment in design (including materials) and marketing may not have the desired impact on our brand image and
reputation. In addition, our success in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a
 rapidly changing media environment,including our increasing reliance on social media and digital dissemination of advertising campaigns. We could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these
objectives.
Our brand value also depends on our ability to maintain a positive consumer perception of our corporate integrity and brand culture. Negative claims or publicity involving us,
our products, consumer data, or any of our key employees, endorsers, sponsors or suppliers could seriously damage our reputation and brand image, regardless of whether
such claims are accurate. For example, while we require our suppliers of our products to operate their business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we do not
control their practices. Negative publicity relating to a violation or an alleged violation of policies or laws by such suppliers could damage our brand image. Social media, which
accelerates and potentially amplifies the scope of negative publicity, can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims. Adverse publicity about regulatory or legal
action against us, or by us, could also damage our reputation and brand image, undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if
the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations. If the reputation or image of any
 of our brands is tarnished or if we receive negative publicity, thenour sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products,
 we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues and profits.Our success depends on our ability to identify, originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate,
 gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timelymanner. However, lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences. All of
our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. Our new products may no
t receive consumer acceptance as consumerpreferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance products or away from these types of
 products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our abilityto anticipate and respond to these changes. If we 
fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing productofferings, developing new products, designs, styles and categories, and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing, we could experience lower
sales, excess inventories or lower profit margins, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition,
 we market ourproducts globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns, including social media, mobile applications and online advertising. If we
do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase, these factors could have an adverse effec
t on our business, financial condition andresults of operations.
We rely on technical innovation and high-quality products to compete in the market for our
 products.Technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, apparel and athletic equipment is essential to the commercial success of our
products. Research and development play a key role in technical innovation. We rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology,
engineering, industrial design, sustainability and related fields, as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment
managers, orthopedists, podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cutting-edge performance products. While we strive to
 produce products that help to enhance athleticperformance, reduce injury and maximize comfort, if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products, consumer demand for our products could decline, and if we
experience problems with the quality of our products, we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems.
Failure to continue to obtain or maintain high-quality endorsers of our products could
 harm our business.We establish relationships with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues, as well as other public figures, including artists, designers and influencers, to develop,
evaluate and promote our products, as well as establish product authenticity with consumers. However, as competition in our industry has increased, the costs associated with
establishing and retaining such sponsorships and other relationships have increased. If we are unable to maintain our current associations with professional
2019 FORM 10-K 
9 
Table of Contentsathletes, sports teams and leagues, or other public figures, or to do so at
 a reasonable cost, we could lose the high visibility or on-field authenticity associated with ourproducts, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. As a result, our brands, net revenues, expenses
 and profitability could beharmed.
Furthermore, if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements, our business could be adversely affected. In addition,
 actionstaken by athletes, teams or leagues, or other endorsers, associated with our products that
 harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues, or endorsers, could alsoseriously harm our brand image with consumers and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. In addition, poor performance by our
endorsers, a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes, public figures or sports organizations, to use and endorse our products or a failure to enter into
 cost-effective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes, public figures, and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand, sales and profitability.
General economic factors beyond our control, and changes in the globa
l economic environment, including fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates,could result in lower revenues, higher costs and decreased
 margins and earnings.A majority of our products are manufactured and sold outside of the United States
, and we conduct purchase and sale transactions in various currencies, which increases ourexposure to the volatility of global economic conditions, including fluctuations in inflation and foreign currency exchange rates. Additionally, there has been, and may continue
to be, volatility in currency exchange rates as a result of the United Kingdom's impending exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as “Brexit” or new or proposed
U.S. policy changes that impact the U.S. Dollar value relative to other international currencies. Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and
operations in foreign currencies, and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations, specifically amounts recorded in foreign currencies and
translated into U.S. Dollars for consolidated financial reporting, as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar adversely affects the U.S. Dollar value of the
Company's foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that
produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. Foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could
continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and 
financial condition.We may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effec
ts of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results.Since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of
 a stronger U.S. Dollar or other trading currency, but they also reducethe positive impact of a weaker U.S. Dollar or other trading currency. Our future financial results could be significantly affected by the
 value of the U.S. Dollar in relation to theforeign currencies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities.
Global economic conditions could have a material
 adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.The uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world, most acutely in emerging markets and developing economies. If
 global economicand financial market conditions do not improve or deteriorate, the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial
condition:
•
Slower consumer spending may result in reduced demand for our products, reduced orders from retailers for our products, order cancellations, lower revenues, higherdiscounts, increased inventories and lower gross margins.
•
In the future, we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so.•
We conduct transactions in various currencies, which increases our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. Continuedvolatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies, including in response to certain policies advocated or implemented
by the U.S. presidential administration, could have a significant impact on our reported operating results and financial condition.
•
Continued volatility in the availability and prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products and in our supply chain (such as cotton or petroleumderivatives) could have a material adverse effect on our costs, gross margins and profitability.
•
If retailers of our products experience declining revenues or experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products, this couldresult in reduced orders for our products, order cancellations, late retailer payments, extended payment terms, higher accounts receivable, reduced cash flows, greater
expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense.
•
If retailers of our products experience severe financial difficulty, some may become insolvent and cease business operations, which could negatively impact the sale ofour products to consumers.

If contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase rawmaterials or to finance capital equipment and other general working capital needs, it may result in delays or non-delivery of shipments of our products.
Our business is affected by seasonality, which could resu
lt in fluctuations in our operating results.We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the
second and third fiscal quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for
particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment and in connection with the timing of significant sporting events, such as
 the NBA Finals, Olympics or the World Cup,among others. In addition, our customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice. As a result, we may not be
able to accurately predict our quarterly sales. Accordingly, our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period. This seasonality, along with other
factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, changes in consumer preferences, weather conditions, availability of import quotas, transportation
disruptions and currency exchange rate fluctuations, could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to 
fluctuate. Our operating margins are alsosensitive to a number of additional factors that are beyond our control, including manufacturing and transportation costs, shif
ts in product sales mix and geographic salestrends, all of which we expect to continue. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of 
the results to be expected for any future period.We may be adversely affected by the financial health of our customers.
We extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer's financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. To assist in the scheduling of production
and the shipping of our products, we offer certain customers the opportunity to place orders five 
to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program. Theseadvance orders may be canceled under certain conditions, and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with
economic uncertainty. In the past, some customers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies, which have had an adverse ef
fect on our sales, ourability to collect on receivables and our financial condition. When the retail economy weakens or as consumer behavior shifts, retailers may be more cautious with orders. A
slowing or changing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our customers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on
 our results ofoperations and financial condition. In addition, product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing retail environment to attract consumers,
which requires continuing investments by retailers. Retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them, resulting in lower sales and
orders for our products.
Failure to accurately forecast consumer demand could lead to excess inventories or 
inventory shortages, which could result in decreased operating margins,reduced cash flows and harm to our business.
To meet anticipated demand for our products, we purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders, which we
hold in inventory and resell to customers. There is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers. Inventory levels in excess of customer
demand may result in inventory write-downs, and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on
our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we
require at the time we need them, we may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers, negatively impact retailer, distributor and
consumer relationships and diminish brand loyalty. The difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations, financial condition and
cash flows from period to period. A failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our ne
t revenues and net income, and we areunlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance.
Consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may
 increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sellproducts.
The athletic footwear, apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear, apparel and equipment retailers with many
stores. These retailers have in the past increased their market share by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores. These situations concen
trate ourcredit risk with a relatively small number of retailers, and, if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity or consumer behavior shifts away from traditional
retail, it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid. In
 addition, increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in aparticular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products, we may be unable to
 find a sufficient number ofother retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues.

Table of ContentsOur NIKE Direct operations have required and will continue
 to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risksand uncertainties.
Our NIKE Direct stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems and personnel. We have entered into
substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and
marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than other stores. Due 
to the high fixed-cost structure associated with our NIKE Direct operations, a decline in sales, a shift in consumer behavior away from brick-and-mortar retail, or the closure or poor performance
of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employee-related costs.
Many factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the Company's control, pose risks and uncertainties. Risks include, but are not limited to:
 credit card fraud;mismanagement of existing retail channel partners; and inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation. In addition, extreme weather conditions in
the areas in which our stores are located could adversely affect our business.
If the technology-based systems that give our consumers the ability to shop with us online
 do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our abilityto grow our digital commerce business globally,
 could be materially adversely affected.Many of our consumers shop with us through our digital platforms. Increasingly, consumers are using mobile-based devices and applications to shop online with us and with
our competitors, and to do comparison shopping. We are increasingly using social media and proprietary mobile applications to interact with our consumers and as a means to
enhance their shopping experience. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, effective, reliable, user-friendly digital commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of
merchandise with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss
of digital commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with consumers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our digital commerce business globally and could
have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
Risks specific to our digital commerce business also include diversion of sales from our and our retailers' brick and mortar stores, difficulty in recreating the in-store experience
through direct channels and liability for online content. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our digital commerce business, as well
as damage our reputation and brands.
Failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.
We periodically discover counterfeit reproductions of our products or products that otherwise infringe our intellectual property rights. If we are unsuccessful in enforcing our
intellectual property rights, continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and could result in a shift
 of consumer preference away from ourproducts.
The actions we take to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate 
to prevent imitation of our products by others. We also may be unable toprevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights.
We may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim we infringe on their intellectual property rights. Defending infringement claims could be expensive and time-
consuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development, use, importation
and/or sale of certain products.
We take various actions to prevent the unauthorized use and/or disclosure of our confidential information and intellectual property rights. These actions include contractual
measures such as entering into non-disclosure and non-compete agreements and agreements relating to our collaborations with third parties and providing confidential
information awareness training. Our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use and/or disclosure of confidential information and intellectual property rights might not
always be effective. For example, confidential information related to business strategy, new technologies, mergers and acquisitions, unpublished financial results or personal
data could be prematurely, inadvertently, or improperly used and/or disclosed, resulting in a loss of reputation, a decline in our stock price and/or a negative impact on our
market position, and could lead to damages, fines, penalties or injunctions.
In addition, the laws of certain countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the
 same extent as the laws of the United States. We may facesignificant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights, including outside the United States, and if we are unable 
to successfullyprotect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition may be adversely affected.
We are subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect our results, operations
 or reputation.In addition to our own sensitive and proprietary business information, we handle transactional and personal information about our customers and users of our digital
experiences, which include online distribution channels and product engagement, adaptive products and personal fitness applications. Hackers and data thieves are
increasingly sophisticated and operate social
12 
NIKE, INC.
Table of Contentsengineering, such as phishing, and large-scale, complex automated attacks that can evade detection for long periods of 
time. Any breach of our or our service providers'network, or other vendor systems, may result in the loss of confidential business and financial data, misappropriation of our consumers', users' or employees' personal
information or a disruption of our business. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on
 our business, including unwanted media attention, impairment ofour consumer and customer relationships, damage to our reputation; resulting in lost sales and consumers, fines, lawsuits, or significant legal and remediation expenses. We
also may need to expend significant resources to protect against, respond to and/or redress problems caused by any breach.
In addition, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the U.S., Europe and
 elsewhere.For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which became effective on May 25, 2018
; and California passed theCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act (the "CCPA") which will go into effect in 2020. These laws impose additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data
and provides certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored. Compliance with existing, proposed and recently enacted laws (including implementation of the
privacy and process enhancements called for under GDPR and CCPA) and regulations can be costly; any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to
legal and reputational risks. Misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations, proceedings against the
Company by governmental entities or others, damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits.
We are subject to the risk our licensees may not generate expected sales or ma
intain the value of our brands.We currently license, and expect to continue licensing, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. If our licensees fail to
successfully market and sell licensed products, or fail to obtain sufficient capital or effectively manage their business operations, customer relationships, labor relationships,
supplier relationships or credit risks, it could adversely affect our revenues, both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other
products.
We also rely on our licensees to help preserve the value of our brands. Although we attempt to protec
t our brands through approval rights over the design, productionprocesses, quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our licensed products, we cannot completely control the use of our licensed brands by
our licensees. The misuse of a brand by or negative publicity involving a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on us.
Failure of our contractors or our licensees' contractors to comply with our code
 of conduct, local laws and other standards could harm our business.We work with hundreds of contractors outside of the United States to
 manufacture our products, and we also have license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties tomanufacture or contract for the manufacture of products using our intellectual property. We require the contractors tha
t directly manufacture our products and our licenseesthat make products using our intellectual property (including, indirectly, their contract manufacturers) to comply with a code of conduct and other environmental, health and
safety standards for the benefit of workers. We also require these contractors to
 comply with applicable standards for product safety. Notwithstanding their contractualobligations, from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may fail to enforce such standards or applicable local law
on their contractors. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation or result in a product recall
and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and 
financial condition. Negative publicity regarding production methods, alleged practices or workplace or relatedconditions of any of our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our brand image and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers, manufacturers or
licenses.
Our international operations involve inherent risks which
 could result in harm to our business.Virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the United States, and
 the majority of our products are sold outside of the United States.Accordingly, we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad, which include foreign laws and regulations, varying consumer
preferences across geographic regions, political unrest, disruptions or delays in cross-border shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our products
are manufactured or where we sell products. This includes, for example, the uncertainty surrounding the effect of Brexit, including changes to
 the legal and regulatoryframework that apply to the United Kingdom and its relationship with the European Union, as well as new and proposed changes affecting 
tax laws and trade policy in the U.S.and elsewhere as further described below under 
“We could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax  laws, additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in oureffective tax rate” 
and “Changes to U.S. trade policy, tariff and import/export regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results ofoperations.” 
The U.S. presidential administration has indicated a focus on policy reforms that discourage U.S. corporations from outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to foreign jurisdictions, including through tariffs or penalties on goods manufactured outside the U.S., which may require us to change the
 way we conduct businessand adversely affect our results of operations. The administration has also targeted the specific practices of certain U.
S. multinational corporations in public statements which,if directed at us, could harm our reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business.
2019 FORM 10-K 
13 
Table of ContentsIn addition, disease outbreaks, terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad. These factors, among o
thers, could affect our ability tomanufacture products or procure materials, our ability to import products, our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business. If any of
 these orother factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, many o
f our importedproducts are subject to duties, tariffs or quotas that a
ffect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the United States and other countries. Any country inwhich our products are produced or sold may eliminate, adjust or impose new quotas, duties, tariffs, safeguard measures, anti-dumping duties, cargo restrictions to prevent
terrorism, restrictions on the transfer of currency, climate change legislation, product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverse
effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
We could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax la
ws, additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in our effective tax rate.We are subject to the tax laws in the United States and
 numerous foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make tax laws and regulations, or theirinterpretation and application, in any jurisdiction subject to significant change. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enac
ted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), whichincludes a number of significant changes to previous U.S. tax laws that impact us, including provisions for a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed
foreign earnings, and a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax
 years beginning after December 31, 2017, among other changes. The Tax Act alsotransitions U.S. international taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system and includes base erosion prevention measures on non-U.S. earnings, which has
the effect of subjecting certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to U.S. taxation.
Implementation of the Tax Act required us to record incremental provisional tax expense in fiscal 2018, which increased our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018.
 We completed ouranalysis of the Tax Act in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and
 no adjustments were made to the provisional amounts recorded.We earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and are subject to the tax laws of 
those jurisdictions. There have been proposals to reform foreign tax laws thatcould significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass,
several of the proposals considered, if enacted into law, could have an adverse impact on our income tax expense and cash 
flows.Portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of 
tax under various tax holidays and rulings. We also utilize tax rulings and other agreements to obtaincertainty in treatment of certain tax matters. These holidays and rulings expire in whole or in part from time to time and may be extended when certain conditions are met
, orterminated if certain conditions are not met. The impact of any changes in conditions would be the loss of
 certainty in treatment thus potentially impacting our effective incometax rate. For example, in January 2019, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether the Netherlands has breached State 
Aid rules whengranting certain tax rulings to the Company. If this matter is adversely resolved, the Netherlands may be required to assess additional amounts with respect to
 current and priorperiods and the Company's Netherlands income taxes in the future could increase.
We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the United S
tates Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood ofan adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax provisions are adequate,
 thefinal determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of audits or related
disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made. For example, we and our
subsidiaries are also engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions. Although we believe we have clearly reflected the economics of these
transactions and the proper local transfer pricing documentation is in place, tax authorities may propose and sustain adjustments that could result in changes tha
t may impactour mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates.
Changes to U.S. trade policy, tariff and import/export regulations or our failure
 to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse effect on ourreputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.
Changes in U.S. or international social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and
investment in the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business, as well as any negative sentiment toward the U.S. as a result of
 suchchanges, could adversely affect our business. The U.S. presidential administration has instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the nego
tiation ortermination of trade agreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S., economic sanctions on
 individuals, corporations or countries, and other governmentregulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we conduct our business. 
It may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our businessoperations in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes.
As a result of recent policy changes of the U.S. presidential administration and recent U.S.
 government proposals, there may be greater restrictions and economicdisincentives on international trade. The new tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy has in the pas

Table of Contentsor are considering imposing retaliatory measures on certain U.S. goods. The Company, similar to many other multinational corporations, does a significant amount of business
that would be impacted by changes to the trade policies of the U.S
. and foreign countries (including governmental action related to tariffs, international trade agreements, oreconomic sanctions). Such changes have the potential to adversely impact the U.S. economy or certain sec
tors thereof, our industry and the global demand for our products,and as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us
 or fail, we may incur significant losses.As part of our hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, which may include forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option
contracts, collars and swaps with various financial institutions. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and o
ther investments on deposit or inaccounts with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad. As
 a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financialinstitutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If
 one of ourcounterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default, or our assets deposited or held in accounts
 with suchcounterparty, may be limited by the counterparty's liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or 
failure of oneor more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
We rely on a concentrated source base of contract manufacturers to supply a significant portion of our footwear products.
NIKE is supplied by 
112 footwear factories located in 12 countries. We do not own or operate any of the footwear manufacturing facilities and depend upon independentcontract manufacturers to manufacture all of the footwear products we sell. In fiscal 
2019 , four footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10% of fiscal2019 
footwear production and in aggregate accounted for approximately 61% of NIKE Brand footwear production in fiscal 2019 . Our ability to meet our customers' needs depends on our ability to maintain a steady supply of products from our independent contract manufacturers. I
f one or more of our significant suppliers were to sever theirrelationship with us or significantly alter the terms of our relationship, including due to changes in applicable trade policies, we may not be able to obtain replacement products
in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, if any of our primary contract
manufacturers fail to make timely shipments, do not meet our quality standards or otherwise fail to deliver us product in accordance with our plans, there could be a material
adverse effect on our results of operations.
Our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing, manufacturing and
 financing.The principal materials used in our apparel products — natural and synthetic fabrics and threads, specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away
from the body, retain heat or repel rain and/or snow as well as plastic and metal hardware — are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place. The principal
materials used in our footwear products — natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, natural and synthetic
fabrics and threads, nylon, canvas and polyurethane films — are also locally available to manufacturers. Both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon 
theability of our unaffiliated contract manufacturers to locate, train, employ and retain adequate personnel. NIKE
 contractors and suppliers buy raw materials and are subject towage rates that are oftentimes regulated by the governments of the coun
tries in which our products are manufactured.There could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, our contract manufacturers might not
 beable to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all. Further, our unaffiliated contract manufacturers have experienced and
may continue to experience in the future, unexpected increases in work wages, whether government mandated or otherwise and increases in compliance costs due to
governmental regulation concerning certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products. In addition, we cannot be certain that our una
ffiliated manufacturers will be ableto fill our orders in a timely manner. If we experience significant increases in demand, or reductions in the availability of materials, or need to replace an existing manufacturer,
there can be no assurance additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms acceptable to us, or at
all, or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, even if we are able 
to expand existing or find newmanufacturing or sources of materials, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it 
takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in ourmethods, products, quality control standards and labor, health and safety standards. 
Any delays, interruption or increased costs in labor or wages, or the supply of materials ormanufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products
 and result in lower revenues and netincome both in the short- and long-term.
2019 FORM 10-K

Table of ContentsBecause independent manufacturers make a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets, our products must be transported by third parties over large
geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure conges
tion or otherfactors, and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers, could adversely impact our financial performance. In addition,
manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such
 as air freight, which couldadversely affect our profit margins. The cost of oil is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs,
 so increases in the price of petroleum products canadversely affect our profit margins. Changes in U.S. trade policies, including new and potential changes to import tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements, could also
have a significant impact on our activities in foreign jurisdictions, and could adversely affect our results of operations.
In addition, Sojitz America performs significant import-export financing services for the Company. During fiscal 2019, Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing
services for NIKE Brand products sold in certain NIKE markets including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, India, South
 Africa and Uruguay (collectively the “Sojitz Markets”),excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz 
America's banks could disrupt ourability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in the Sojitz Markets. Such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would
adversely affect sales and profitability.
Our success depends on our global distribution facilities.
We distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the
 world. Our ability to meet customer expectations,manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and growth, particularly in emerging markets, depends on the proper operation of our
distribution facilities, the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties (including those involved in
shipping product to and from our distribution facilities). Our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes or
fires. Any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse effect on our business. We maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately
protect us from adverse effects caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities.
We rely significantly on information technology to operate our business, 
including our supply chain and retail operations, and any failure, inadequacy orinterruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business.
We are heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the Internet and third-party services (“Information Technology Systems”), across our
supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales and distribution, as well as for processing financial information for
external and internal reporting purposes, retail operations and other business activities. Information Technology Systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our
business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown. For example, our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to
ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these Information Technology Systems. Over a number of
 years, we have implementedInformation Technology Systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate. Our work to integrate, secure and enhance these systems and
 related processes in ourglobal operations is ongoing and NIKE will continue to invest in these efforts. The failure of these
 systems to operate effectively, including as a result of security breaches,viruses, hackers, malware, natural disasters, vendor business interruptions or other causes, or failure to properly maintain, protect, repair or upgrade systems, or problems with
transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, could require significant capital
investments to remediate the problem which may not be sufficient to cover all eventualities, and may have an adverse effec
t on our reputation, results of operations andfinancial condition.
We also use Information Technology Systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial
reporting, legal and tax requirements. If Information Technology Systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans, or 
those of ourvendors, do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, which could result in lost revenues and profits,
as well as reputational damage. Furthermore, we depend on Information Technology Systems and personal data collection for digital marketing, digital commerce, consumer
engagement and the marketing and use of our digital products and services. We also rely on our ability to engage in electronic communications throughout the world between
and among our employees as well as with other third parties, including customers, suppliers, vendors and consumers. Any interruption in Information Technology Systems may
impede our ability to engage in the digital space and result in lost revenues, damage to our reputation, and loss of users.
The market for prime real estate is competitive.
Our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new retail stores and otherwise conduct our operations, bo
th domestically and internationally, depends on the availability ofreal estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease
16 
NIKE, INC.
Table of Contentseconomics, demographics and other factors. We also must be able to effectively renew our existing real estate leases. In
 addition, from time to time, we seek to downsize,consolidate, reposition or close some of our real estate locations, which may require modification of an existing lease. Failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully
modify leases for existing locations, or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of retail stores, could have
 an adverse effect on our operating resultsand financial condition.
Additionally, the economic environment may make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties domestically and internationally. This could impact the
quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any
 adverse effect on the quality of thesedecisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing 
fleet of stores, which couldhave an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating
 results and financial condition.Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores, suppliers, customers, distribution centers, headquarters and vendors are located could adversely affect our
operating results and financial condition. Moreover, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes and tsunamis, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, and
their related consequences and effects, including energy shortages and public health issues, could disrupt our operations, the operations of our vendors and
 other suppliers orresult in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.
Our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses
 and operations fail to produce expected returns.From time to time, we may invest in technology, business infrastructure, new businesses, product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of existing businesses,
such as our digital commerce operations, which require substantial cash investments and management attention. We believe cost-effective investments are essential to
business growth and profitability; however, significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or expanding an existing
business. The failure of any significant investment to provide expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert
management attention from more profitable business operations.
We are subject to a complex array of laws and regulations and
 litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings, which could have an adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.
As a multinational corporation with operations and distribution channels throughout the world, we are subject to and must comply with extensive laws and regulations in the
U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we have operations and distribution channels. If we or our employees, agents, suppliers, and other partners fail to comply with any of
these laws or regulations, such failure could subject us to fines, sanctions or other penalties that could negatively af
fect our reputation, business, financial condition and resultsof operations. We are involved in various types of claims, lawsuits, regulatory proceedings and government investigations relating to our business, our products and the actions
of our employees and representatives, including contractual and employment relationships, product liability, antitrust, trademark rights and a variety of other matters. It is not
possible to predict with certainty the outcome of any such legal or regulatory proceedings or investigations, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties,
 orenter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business, 
financial condition and results of operations and negatively impact ourreputation. The global nature of our business means legal and compliance risks, such as anti-bribery, anti-corruption, fraud, trade, environmental, competition, privacy and
other regulatory matters, will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time, which could adversely affect us. In addition,
the adoption of new laws or regulations, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations, may result in significant unanticipated legal and reputational risks. Any
current or future legal or regulatory proceedings could divert management's attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees.
The success of our business depends, in part, on high-quality emp
loyees, including key personnel.Our success depends in part on the continued service of high-quality employees, including key executive officers and personnel. The loss of the
 services of key individuals, orany negative perception with respect to these individuals, could harm our business. Our success also depends on our ability to recruit, retain and engage our personnel
sufficiently, both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives. Competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not
 be successful inattracting and retaining such personnel. In addition, shifts in U.S. immigration policy could negatively impact our ability to attract, hire and retain highly skilled employees who
are from outside the U.S.
The sale of a large number of shares of common stock by our principa
l stockholder could depress the market price of our common stock.As of June 30, 2019, Swoosh, LLC beneficially owned approximately 78% of our Class A Common Stock. 
If, on June 30, 2019, all of these shares were converted into Class BCommon Stock, the commensurate ownership percentage of our Class B Common Stock would be approximately 16%. The shares are available for resale, subject to the
requirements of the U.S. securities laws and the terms of the limited liability company agreement governing Swoosh, LLC. The sale or prospect of a sale of
 a substantial2019 FORM 10-K

. Swoosh, LLC was formed by Philip H. Knight, our Chairman Emeritus, to holdthe majority of his shares of Class A Common Stock. Swoosh, LLC is controlled by Mr. Knight's son and NI
KE director, Travis Knight.Changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquid
ity, increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options.Our long-term debt is currently rated Investment Grade by Standard & Poor's and Moody's Inves
tors Service. If our credit ratings are lowered, borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term credit facilities may increase and our financing options, including our access to the unsecured credit market, could be limited. We may also be subject
to restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pledge assets as
 security, makeinvestments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with a
ffiliates. Failure to comply with such covenantscould result in a default, and as a result, the commitments of our lenders under our credit agreements may be terminated and the
 maturity of amounts owed may beaccelerated. In addition, macroeconomic conditions, such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets, could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt.
If our internal controls are ineffective, our operating results could be adverse
ly affected.Our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the
circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of
financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience
difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.
If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting polic
ies prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be adversely affected.The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated 
financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and onvarious other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.” The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of asse
ts, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue andexpenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those
related to revenue recognition, inventory reserves, contingent payments under endorsement contracts, accounting for property, plant and equipment and
 definite-lived assets,hedge accounting for derivatives, stock-based compensation, income taxes and other contingencies. Our operating results may be adversely affected
 if our assumptionschange or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and
investors, resulting in a decline in the price of our Class B Common Stock.
Anti-takeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the Company or reduce the price of our
 common stock.There are provisions within our articles of incorporation and Oregon law intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the Board of Directors a means to attempt to
deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms. Such provisions include a control share acquisition statute,
 afreeze-out statute, two classes of stock that
 vote separately on certain issues, and the fact that holders of Class A Common Stock elect three-quarters of the Board of Directorsrounded down to the next whole number. However, such provisions could discourage, delay or prevent an unsolicited merger, acquisition or other change in control of our
company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market
price. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the Company.
We may fail to meet market expectations, which could cause the price of our
 stock to decline.Our Class B Common Stock is traded publicly, and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. These reports include
information about our historical financial results as well as analysts' opinions of our future performance, which may, in part, be based upon any guidance we have provided.
Analysts' estimates are often different from our estimates or expectations. I
f our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts andinvestors, our stock price could decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against NIK
E and other companies following a decline in the market priceof their securities. If our stock price is volatile for any reason, we may become involved in this type of litigation in the 
future. Any litigation could result in reputational damage,substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources needed to successfully run our business.

Table of ContentsITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYS
IS OFFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
NIKE designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and
apparel in the world. We sell our products through NIKE-owned retail stores and through digital platforms (which we refer to collectively as our “NIKE Direct” operations), to
retail accounts and to a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our
shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth
by creating innovative, “must-have” products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital
platforms and at retail.
Through the Consumer Direct Offense, we are focusing on our Triple Double strategy, with the objective of doubling the impact of innovation,
 increasing our speed to marketand growing our direct connections with consumers. As a result of the execution of this strategy,
 our long-term financial goals through fiscal 2023, on average, per year, are asfollows:
•
High single-digit revenue growth;•
Gross margin expansion of as much as 50 basis points;•
Slight selling and administrative expense leverage;•
Mid-teens earnings per share growth; and•
Low-thirties percentage rate of return on invested capital.Fiscal 2019 was our first full year executing against our new strategy and our results demonstrated the power of the NIK
E, Inc. portfolio to generate revenue growth, whileinvesting in capabilities to fuel our next phase of long-term growth and profitability. We achieved record revenues in fiscal 2019, growing 7% to $39.1 billion. The NIKE Brand,
which represents over 90% of NIKE, Inc. 
Revenues , delivered 8% revenue growth fueled by investments in innovative products and digital platforms. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand revenues grew 11%, driven by growth across all geographies, NIKE Direct and wholesale, nearly all key categories and double-digit growth across footwear
and apparel. Within our NIKE Direct business, digital outpaced all other channels, growing at 35% in fiscal 2019. Revenues for Converse increased 1% and 3% on a reported
and currency-neutral basis, respectively, primarily driven by double-digit growth in Asia and digital, which was partially offset by declines in the U.S. and Europe.
Income before income taxes 
increased 11% for fiscal 2019, as revenue growth and gross margin expansion were partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense. NIKE, Inc. gross margin increased 90 basis points primarily due to higher full-price average selling price (ASP), on a wholesale equivalent basis, favorable changes in foreign
currency exchange rates and growth in NIKE Direct. These benefits were partially offset by higher product costs. 
Selling and administrative expense was higher as a percent ofrevenues, reflecting investments in data and analytics capabilities, digital commerce platforms and an initial investment in a new enterprise resource planning tool to accelerate
our end-to-end digital transformation. Additionally, we prioritized investments in global brand campaigns aimed at deepening our connection with consumers.
Diluted earnings per common share reflects a 2% decline in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding, driven by our share repurchase program.
While foreign currency markets remain volatile, in part due to geopolitical dynamics leading to a stronger U.S. Dollar, we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth
and profitability, and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the long-term by executing against the operational strategies
outlined above.

Table of ContentsFor discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for 
fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 
fiscal 2018 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on July 25, 2018.
USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent revenues and currency-neutral
revenues, which should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAA
P”). References to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our NIKE Brandmarket footprint if we had no NIKE Direct operations. NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of (1) sales to
 external wholesale customers and (2) internal salesfrom our wholesale operations to our NIKE Direct operations, which are charged at prices comparable to those charged to external wholesale customers. Additionally,
currency-neutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends
excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating the Company's performance, including when making financial and operating decisions. Additionally,
management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying
business performance and trends. However, references to wholesale equivalent revenues and currency-neutral revenues should not be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and
 may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used byother companies.

The following tables present NIKE Brand revenues disaggregated by reportable operating segment, distribution channel and major product line:
FISCAL 2019 
COMPARED TO FISCAL 2018 On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. 
Revenues grew 11% for fiscal 2019 , driven by growth in both the NIKE Brand and Converse. All NIKE  Brand geographies deliveredhigher revenues for 
fiscal 2019 as our Consumer Direct Offense continued to deliver innovative products, deep brand connections and compelling retail experiences to consumers through NIKE.com and related mobile applications, digital partner platforms, NIKE-owned and partner stores, as well as through our wholesale customers. Revenue
growth was broad-based as Greater China, North America and EMEA each contributed approximately 3 percentage points of growth to NIKE
, Inc. Revenues , with APLA contributing approximately 2 percentage points of growth.
On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 
12% and 11% , respectively, for fiscal 2019 , while NIKE Brand equipment revenues grew 4% 
. On a category basis, the increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues was driven by growth in nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear and, to a lesser extent, theJordan Brand and Running. Unit sales of footwear increased 8% and higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 4 percentage points of foo
twear revenue growth, primarilydue to higher full-price and NIKE Direct ASPs.
The currency-neutral increase in NIKE Brand apparel revenues for 
fiscal 2019 was fueled by growth in nearly all key categories, most notably Sportswear. Unit sales of apparel increased 6% and higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 5 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP, in part reflecting lower
discounts, as well as higher NIKE Direct ASP.
On a reported basis, NIKE Direct revenues represented approximately 
32% of our total NIKE Brand revenues for fiscal 2019 compared to 30% for fiscal 2018 . Digital commerce sales were $3.8 billion for 
fiscal 2019 compared to $2.8 billion for fiscal 2018 . On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Direct revenues increased 16% for fiscal 2019 , driven by strong digital commerce sales growth of 35%, comparable store sales growth of 6% and the addition of new stores. Comparable store sales, which exclude digital
commerce sales, comprises revenue from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open
at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15%
 within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year.On a wholesale equivalent and currency-neutral basis, 
fiscal 2019 NIKE Brand Men's and Women's revenues increased 10% and 11% , respectively, both driven by growth in nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear. During fiscal 2019, the growth in Women's was fueled by our focus on compelling design, creating female-focused brand
campaigns globally and a shift towards digital-led distribution. Revenues for our NIKE Kids' business increased 
11% , as all key categories, except Football (Soccer), experienced growth.

fiscal 2019 , our consolidated gross profit increased 10% to $17,474 million compared to $15,956 million for fiscal 2018 . Gross margin increased 90 basis points to 44.7% for 
fiscal 2019 compared to 43.8% for fiscal 2018 due to the following: 
*Wholesale equivalent
Higher NIKE Brand product costs are primarily due to shifts in mix to higher-cost products and an increase in labor rates compared to fiscal 2018. Additionally, gross margin
was favorably impacted by growth in our higher-margin NIKE Direct business.

Demand creation expense c onsists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, complimentary product, television, digital and print advertising and media costs, brand eventsand retail brand presentation.
FISCAL 2019 
COMPARED TO FISCAL 2018 Demand creation expense 
increased 5% for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 , due to sports marketing investments, as well as higher advertising and marketing expenses to support global brand campaigns, key sports moments and new product launches. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased 
Demand creation expense by approximately 2 percentage points for 
fiscal 2019 . Operating overhead expense 
increased 13% for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 , driven primarily by higher wage-related and administrative expenses, which reflect critical investments in innovation, data and analytics capabilities, digital commerce platforms and an initial investment in a new enterprise resource planning tool to accelerate our end-
to-end digital transformation. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased 
Operating overhead expense by approximately 2 percentage points for fiscal 2019 . OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET

FISCAL 2019 
COMPARED TO FISCAL 2018 Other (income) expense, net 
changed from $66 million of other expense, net for fiscal 2018 to $78 million of other income, net for fiscal 2019 , primarily due to a $136 million net beneficial change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses, including hedges.

COMPARED TO FISCAL 2018 Our effective tax rate was 
16.1% for fiscal 2019 , compared to 55.3% for fiscal 2018 due to significant changes related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the“Tax Act”) in the prior year and a reduction in the U.S. federal statutory rate to
 21% in the current year. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in U.S. tax onforeign earnings due to the impact of global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI).
Refer to Note 9 — Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
 for additional information on the impact of the Tax Act.OPERATING SEGMENTS
Our operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Company's internal organization. The NIKE 
Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operationsparticipating in NIKE Brand sales activity.
Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic foo
twear, apparel and equipment.The Company's reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East & 
Africa (EMEA); Greater China; and Asia Pacific & Latin America(APLA), and include results for the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands. The Company's NIKE Direct operations are managed within each geographic operating segment.
Converse is also a reportable operating segment for the Company, and operates predominately in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers,
apparel and accessories.
As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency exchange rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand
entity in our geographic operating segments and Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the fu
ture selling seasons to which theyrelate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons)
based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. 
Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating segments andConverse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases into the en
tity's functional currency. Differences between assignedstandard foreign currency exchange rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our
centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.

patterns across digital and physical channels. The evolution of the North America marketplace is resulting in third-party retail store closures; however, we are currently seeing
stabilization and momentum building with our strategic wholesale customers, fueled by innovative product and NIKE Brand consumer experiences, leveraging digital.
FISCAL 2019 
COMPARED TO FISCAL 2018 On a currency-neutral basis, North America revenues increased 
7% , driven by growth in nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear. NIKE Direct revenues increased 7% forfiscal 2019 
as strong digital commerce sales growth of 29% and the addition of new stores more than offset a  3% decline in comparable store sales. The decline in comparablestore sales was primarily due to higher sales in NIKE Brand in-line stores being more than offset by declines in NIKE Brand Factory Stores ("NFS"),
 as growth in our full-pricechannel has impacted the availability and composition of off-price inventory for sale within NFS.

8% on a currency-neutral basis for fiscal 2019 , driven by growth in most key categories, led by Sportswear. Unit sales of footwear increased 4%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 4 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to higher full-price ASP, in part
reflecting lower discounts, as well as higher ASP in our NIKE Direct business.
On a currency-neutral basis, apparel revenues increased 
7% for fiscal 2019 , driven by higher revenues in all key categories, led by Sportswear, followed by NIKE Basketball. Unit sales of apparel increased 5%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 2 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. The increase in ASP per unit was
primarily a result of higher full-price ASP, in part reflecting lower discounts.
Reported EBIT increased 
9% for fiscal 2019 , reflecting higher revenues, gross margin expansion and selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin increased 30 basis points as higher full-price ASP, in part reflecting lower discounts, as well as favorable full-price mix more than offset higher product costs. Selling and administrative
expense grew due to higher demand creation and operating overhead expenses. The increase in demand creation expense was primarily due to higher advertising and
marketing costs. Operating overhead expense increased as a result of higher wage-related costs, including investments in our NIKE Direct operations.

Table of ContentsIn territories we define as “direct distribution markets,” Converse designs, markets and sells products directly to distributors, wholesale customers and to consumers through
direct to consumer operations. The largest direct distribution markets are the United States, the United Kingdom and China. We do
 not own the Converse trademarks in Japanand accordingly do not earn revenues in Japan. Territories other than direct distribution markets and Japan are serviced by third-party licensees who pay royalty revenues to
Converse for the use of its registered trademarks and other intellectual property rights.
FISCAL 2019 
COMPARED TO FISCAL 2018 On a currency-neutral basis, Converse revenues increased 
3% for fiscal 2019 . Comparable direct distribution markets (i.e., markets served under a direct distribution model for comparable periods in the current and prior fiscal years) increased 2%, which drove the majority of total Converse revenue growth. Comparable direct distribution market
unit sales decreased 3% for 
fiscal 2019 , while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 5 percentage points of direct distribution markets revenue growth. On a territory basis, the increase in comparable direct distribution markets revenues for the year was primarily attributable to revenue growth in Asia across all distribution channels, partially
offset by lower revenues in the U.S. and Europe. Conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution had minimal impact on total Converse revenues for 
fiscal 2019 . Revenues from comparable licensed markets grew 6% for 
fiscal 2019 , primarily due to revenue growth in Asia and Brazil, but had minimal impact on total Converse revenue growth.
Reported EBIT for Converse decreased 
2% for fiscal 2019 as higher selling and administrative expense more than offset gross margin expansion and revenue growth. Gross margin increased 180 basis points, driven by higher margin in our direct to consumer business, favorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher full-price ASP
due to changes in product mix. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead and higher demand creation expense. Higher operating
overhead expense was due to an increase in wage-related and administrative costs, primarily to support investments in our digital business. Higher demand creation expense
was primarily due to an increase in advertising and marketing costs associated with our digital platform.

Table of ContentsFOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND HEDGING PRACTICES
OVERVIEW
As a global company with significant operations outside the United States, in the normal course of business we are exposed 
to risk arising from changes in currency exchangerates. Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency
denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars.
Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of
 currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations,financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to NIKE, Inc. We
 manage theseexposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and, where practical and material, by hedging a portion of 
the remainingexposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company (NTC) and our foreign
currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits existing within our
portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes
 on the underlying net exposuresbeing hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of
 exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements; thelength of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for 
trading or speculative purposes.Refer to 
Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements and Note 14 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded, as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end.
TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES
We conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:
•
Product Costs — NIKE's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:1.
Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity: a.
Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE
 entities in their respective functional currencies. NTCsales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the
 NTC.b.
Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.
In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.
2.
Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under
this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the baske
t of currencies (“factory currency exposure index”) in which the labor,materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (“factory input costs”) are denominated.
For the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, 
the currency rate fluctuation affecting the productcost is recorded within 
Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through 
Other (income) expense, net 
. Refer to Note 14 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. As an offset to the impacts of 
the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollaragainst the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces NIKE's U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against
the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.

NIKE, INC.
Table of Contents•
Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales — A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned incurrencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a
 subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreigncurrency exposure.
•
Other Costs — Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certaincases, the Company has entered into contractual agreements which have payments indexed to foreign currencies that create embedded derivative contracts recorded at
fair value through 
Other (income) expense, net . Refer to Note 14 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.
•
Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities — Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables,including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to re-
measurement which may create fluctuations in 
Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations. MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES
Transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural
offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts
 to hedge the remaining effect of exchange ratefluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described
above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges, except 
for hedges of the embedded derivative components of the product cost exposures and othercontractual agreements.
Certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to re-
measurement and embedded derivative contracts are not formally designated as hedging instruments. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are recognized
in 
Other (income) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the re-measurement of the  related non-functional currency denominated asset orliability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged.
TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES
Many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as
we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of 
foreignsubsidiaries' non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to 
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 
within Shareholders' equity . In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of Income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign functionalcurrencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the
translation of our consolidated 
Revenues was a detriment of approximately $1,236 million, a benefit of approximately $832 million and a detriment of approximately $542 million for the years ended May 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate 
fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxes was a detriment of approximately $233 million, a benefit of approximately $177 million and a detriment of approximately $115 million for the years ended May 31, 2019, 2018
and 2017, respectively.
Management generally identifies hyper-inflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%. Management has
concluded our Argentina subsidiary within our APLA operating segment is operating in a hyper-inflationary market. As a result, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2019,
the functional currency of our Argentina subsidiary changed from the local currency to the U.S. Dollar. As of and
 for the period ended May 31, 2019, this change did not have amaterial impact on our results of operations or financial condition and we do not anticipate it will have a material impact in future periods based on current rates.
MANAGING TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES
To minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess
cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these
U.S. Dollar denominated investments at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under U.S.
GAAP. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the
 forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination ofthe purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the
 effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact onnet earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of the purchase of U.S
. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges.2019 FORM 10-K 
37 
Table of ContentsWe estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related
gains and losses included in 
Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact of approximately $97 million, $110 million and $59 million on our Income before income taxes 
for the years ended May 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES
We are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the
U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of fu
ture repatriated earnings. We have, in the past, hedged andmay, in the future, hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effec
ts of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments. Thesehedges are accounted for as net investment hedges in accordance with U.S. G
AAP. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2019 and 2018. Therewere no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31, 2019
, 2018 and 2017.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
CASH FLOW ACTIVITY
Cash provided by operations 
was $5,903 million for fiscal 2019 compared to $4,955 million for fiscal 2018 . Net income, adjusted for non-cash items, generated $5,341 million of operating cash flow for 
fiscal 2019 compared to $3,473 million for fiscal 2018 . The net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in an increase to Cash provided by operations 
of $562 million for fiscal 2019 , compared to an increase to Cash provided by operations of $1,482 million for fiscal 2018 . The primary driver of the change in working capital relates to the accrual of $1,172 million for the transition tax under the Tax Ac
t during fiscal 2018. Refer to Note 9 — Income Taxes for additionalinformation on the Tax Act.  
Cash provided by operations in fiscal 2019 was further impacted by the net change in cash collateral with derivative counterparties as a result of hedging transactions. During 
fiscal 2019 , we received cash collateral of $266 million compared to $23 million in fiscal 2018 . In addition, the change in Accounts receivable, net 
, decreased Cash provided by operations by $457 million in fiscal 2019 , primarily driven by revenue growth. Cash provided (used) by investing activities 
was an outflow of $264 million for fiscal 2019 , compared to an inflow of $276 million for fiscal 2018 , driven primarily by the net change in short-term investments. During 
fiscal 2019 , the net change in investments (including sales, maturities and purchases) resulted in a cash inflow of $850 million compared to an inflow of 
$1,326 million in fiscal 2018 . In fiscal 2020, we plan to continue investing in our infrastructure to support future growth, including corporate facilities, expanding our digital capabilities and new NIKE Direct
stores. We continue to expect such investments to approximate 3% to
 4% of revenues, on average.Cash used by financing activities 
was $5,293 million for fiscal 2019 compared to $4,835 million for fiscal 2018 with the increase primarily impacted by the repayment of  Notes payable 
 during fiscal 2019 . In 
fiscal 2019 , we purchased 54.3 million shares of NIKE's Class B Common Stock for $4,283 million (an average price of $ 78.86 per share). During the third quarter of fiscal 2019 
, we concluded the four-year, $12 billion program authorized by our Board of Directors in November 2015. Throughout this program we purchased a total of 192.1 million shares for $12 billion (an average price of $62.47 per share). Immediately following the completion of this program, we began repurchasing shares under the new four-
year, $15 billion program authorized by our Board of Directors in June 2018. 
As of May 31, 2019, we had repurchased 
11.6 million shares at a cost of $986 million (an average price of $84.72 per share) under this new program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows, excess cash and/or proceeds from debt. The timing and the amount of share repurchases will be dictated by
our capital needs and stock market conditions.
CAPITAL RESOURCES
On July 21, 2016, we filed a shelf registration statement (the “Shelf”) with the S
EC which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities from time to time. The Shelfexpired on July 21, 2019 and we plan to file a new shelf registration statement with the S
EC in July 2019. For additional information regarding our long-term debt refer toNote 8 — Long-Term Debt

NIKE, INC.
Table of ContentsOn August 28, 2015, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate
 of banks, which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings. The facility maturesAugust 28, 2020, with a one-year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date,
 provided that in no event shall it extend beyond August 28, 2022. As of and forthe periods ended 
May 31, 2019 and 2018 , we had no amounts outstanding under the committed credit facility. We currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor 
Services, respectively. If our long-term debt ratings wereto decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt ratings were to improve, the facility fee and
interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings
under the committed credit facility. Under this facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets
 and the amount ofdebt secured by liens we may incur as well as limits on the indebtedness we can incur relative to our net worth. In the event we were to
 have any borrowings outstanding underthis facility and failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the
 banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately dueand payable. As of 
May 31, 2019 , we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future.
Liquidity is also provided by our $2 billion commercial paper program. On June 1, 2018, we repaid $325 million and had no additional borrowings under this program as of and
for the year ended May 31, 2019. We may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities depending on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term
debt ratings of A1+ and P1 from Standard and
 Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively.To date, in fiscal 2019, we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs; however, fu
ture volatility in the capital markets mayincrease costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets.
As of 
May 31, 2019 , we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $4.7 billion , primarily consisting of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixed-income securities. Our
fixed-income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities
have varying durations, as of 
May 31, 2019 , the weighted-average days to maturity of our cash equivalents and short-term investments portfolio was 32  days.We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, toge
ther with access to external sources of funds as describedabove, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
In connection with various contracts and agreements, we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues
that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. Based on our historical experience and the estimated
probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations.

The cash payments due for lon g-term debt include estimated interest payments. Estimates of interest payments are based on outstanding principal amounts, applicable fixed interest rates or currently effectiveinterest rates as of 
May 31, 2019 (if variable), timing of scheduled payments and the term of the debt obligations.(3)
The amounts listed for endorsem ent contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete, public figure, sport team and leagueendorsers of our products. Actu
al payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievementsand/or royalties on product s
ales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines infuture periods.
In addition to the cash paym
ents, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as thecontracts generally do not stip
ulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors, including general playing conditions, thenumber of sporting events in w
hich they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source and purchase the products furnished tothe endorsers are incurred 
over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers.(4)
We generally order product at l east four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced orders received from external wholesale customers and internal orders from our NIKE Direct in-linestores and digital commerce op
erations. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of businessthat are enforceable an

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Refer to 
Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make es
timates andjudgments that affect the reported amounts of assets
, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.
We believe the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial
Statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. Management has reviewed and discussed these critical accounting policies with the
Audit & Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.
40 
NIKE, INC.
Table of ContentsThese policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements as of a given date. Because
 of the uncertainty inherent in thesematters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Within the context of
 these critical accounting policies, we are notcurrently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
On June 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update
 (ASU) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , using the modified retrospective method of adoption. Prior period amounts have not been restated and continue to
 be reported in accordance with our historical accounting policies. Our revenue recognitionpolices under Topic 606 are described in the following paragraphs and references to prior period policies under Accounting Standard Codification Topic 605 — 
Revenue Recognition, 
are included below in the event they are substantially different. Revenue transactions associated with the sale of NIKE Brand footwear, apparel and equipment, as
 well as Converse products, comprise a single performance obligation,which consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or direct to consumer channels. We satisfy 
the performance obligation and record revenues whentransfer of control has passed to the customer, based on the
 terms of sale. A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receivesubstantially all of the benefits of the product. Transfer of con
trol passes to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and theagreement with the customer. Control passes to retail store customers at the time of sale and to
 substantially all digital commerce customers upon shipment. Prior to June 1,2018, the requirements for recognizing revenue were met upon delivery to the customer. The transaction price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price, less
anticipated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreement with the
customer and payment is generally required within 90 days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer. Payment is due at the time of
 sale for retail store anddigital commerce transactions.
As part of our revenue recognition policy, consideration promised in our contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions such as sales returns, discounts and
miscellaneous claims from customers. We estimate the most likely amount we will be entitled to receive and record an anticipated reduction against 
Revenues, with an offsetting increase to 
Accrued liabilities at the time revenues are recognized. The estimated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in  Prepaid expenses and other current assets 
on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Prior to June 1, 2018, the Company's reserve balances were reported net of the estimated cost of inventory for productreturns and recognized within  
Accounts receivable, ne t for wholesale transactions and Accrued liabilities for our direct to consumer business, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns. Provisions for post-invoice sales discounts consist of
both contractual programs and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later da
te.Estimates of discretionary authorized returns, discounts and claims are based on (1) historical rates, (2) specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from
customers and outstanding discounts and claims and (3) estimated returns, discounts and claims expected but not yet 
finalized with customers. Actual returns, discounts andclaims in any future period are inherently uncertain and may differ from estimates recorded. If actual or expected future returns, discounts or claims were significantly different
than reserves established, a reduction or increase to net revenues would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made.
Refer
 also to Note  1  —  Summary  of  Significant  Accounting  Policies and Note  16  —  Revenues for  additional  information  in  the  accompanying  Notes  to  the  ConsolidatedFinancial Statements.
INVENTORY RESERVES
We also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. 
If we estimate thenet realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to
 the difference between the cost of the inventoryand the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to 
Cost of sales . If changes in market conditions result in reductions to the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination.

Table of ContentsCONTINGENT PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS
A significant amount of our 
Demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted 
for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract.Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record demand creation
expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.
Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a
specified ranking in a sport for a year). When we determine payments are probable, the amounts are reported in 
Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorser's performance. In these instances,
 to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in theendorser's performance, adjustments to 
Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period. Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products, which we record in 
Cost of sales as the related sales occur. For contracts containing minimum guaranteed royalty payments, we record the amount of any guaranteed payment in excess of tha
t earned through sales ofproduct within 
Demand creation expense . PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEFINITE-LIVED ASSETS
We review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the
assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent
 or manner in which an asset isused, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect 
the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of anasset, among others. If such facts indicate a po
tential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset groupexceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result 
from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of theprimary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates the carrying value of the asse
t group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset groupusing appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the
asset group's carrying amount and its estimated fair value.
HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES
We use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain non-functional currency monetary assets and
liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts
 hedging probable forecasted future cash flows arerecorded in 
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) , rather than Net income , until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income . In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from 
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into Net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the
 notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions.By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual 
transactions. When anticipated transaction estimatesor actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or
within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge
contract from 
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs. INCOME TAXES
We are subject to taxation in the United States, as
 well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significantjudgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. 
On an interim basis, we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year. Thisestimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date 
Income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to- date 
Income tax expense . The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, wecontinually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our
expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When 
this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs.42 
NIKE, INC.
Table of ContentsWe record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent
on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our de
ferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxableincome. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset
, which increases our Income tax expense in the period when such determination is made.
On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the
 amount recognized for uncertain tax positions basedon factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit ac
tivity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognitionof a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes
. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense 
. On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the
 Tax Act, which significantly changed previous U.S. tax laws, including provisions for a one-time transition tax ondeemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings, and a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for 
tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, amongother changes. The Tax Act also transitions U.S. international taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system and includes base erosion prevention measures
on non-U.S. earnings, which has the effect of subjecting certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to U.S.
 taxation. Certain provisions of the Tax Act, including a provision totax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) of foreign subsidiaries, were not effective for the Company until fiscal 2019. In accordance with U.S. 
GAAP, the Company hasmade an accounting policy election to treat taxes due under the GILTI
 provision as a current period expense.Implementation of the Tax Act required us to record incremental provisional tax expense in fiscal 2018, which increased our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018.
 We completed ouranalysis of the Tax Act in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and
 no adjustments were made to the provisional amounts recorded.Refer to 
Note 9 — Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. OTHER CONTINGENCIES
In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights and a
variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the
 loss is reasonablyestimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of
third-party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If
future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges during the period in
which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a
reasonable possibility the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty, we do not
believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or
cash flows.

Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALIT
ATIVE DISCLOSURESABOUT MARKET RISK
In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in
the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such
exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes.
We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk management
program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctua
tions on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Weuse forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated, but not ye
t firmly committed, transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables andpayables, including third-party and intercompany transactions. We have, in the past, and may in the future,
 also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in thenet assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in 
those subsidiaries. Where exposures arehedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate
 movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements.The timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon 
thenature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 
12 to 24 months in advance of the forecastedtransaction and may place incremental hedges up to 
100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The  majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2019 
are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro, Chinese Yuan/U.S. Dollar and Japanese Yen/U.S.  Dollarcurrency pairs. Refer to 
Note 14 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of
interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans, and
fixed-rate debt of varying maturities.
MARKET RISK MEASUREMENT
We monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis and Value-at-
Risk (“VaR”). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps,
intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt.
We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum
potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95%
confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on
 interrelationships between currencies andinterest rates (a “variance/co-variance” technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the
preceding one-year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjust the po
tentialloss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the “delta” and “gamma”) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency
rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate
 fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipatedtransactions, firm commitments, cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments.
The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of
 favorable changes inmarket rates. It also does not represent the full extent o
f the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes ordifferences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.
The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $34 million and $93
million at May 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The VAR decreased year-over-year as a result of a decrease in foreign currency volatilities at May 31, 2019. Such a
hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the
 underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in thefair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $83 million and $260 million during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively.
44 
NIKE, INC.
Table of ContentsThe instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt, fixed interest
rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our non-functional
currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above.
Therefore, we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non-functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated
financial position, results from operations and cash flows.
Details of third-party debt are provided in the table below. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates.

Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT'S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER
FINANCIAL REPORTING
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13(a) - 15(f) and Rule 15(d) -
15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
 amended. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding thereliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that
, in reasonable detail,accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of assets of the Company that could have a material effect
 on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation o
f effectiveness tofuture periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or proceduresmay deteriorate.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of
 the effectiveness of ourinternal control over financial reporting based upon the framework in

. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of May 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidatedstatements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31,
 2019, including the related notesand financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the
Company's internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2019, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as o
f May 31, 2019 and2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each o
f the three years in the period ended May 31, 2019 in conformity with accounting principles generallyaccepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effec
tive internal control over financial reporting as of May 31,2019, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Change in Accounting Principles
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed 
the manner in which it accounts for revenue from contracts with customers and themanner in which it accounts for income taxes related to intra-entity transfers other than inventory as of June 1
, 2018 and the manner in which it accounts for share-basedpayment awards to employees as of June 1, 2017.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based
on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be
 independentwith respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
 Commission and thePCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAO
B. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance aboutwhether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effec
tive internal control over financial reportingwas maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated 
financial statements,whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts
and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating ef
fectiveness of internalcontrol based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Table of ContentsDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control
 over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
 the assets ofthe company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
 thecompany; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation o
f effectiveness tofuture periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or proceduresmay deteriorate.

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of NIKE, Inc.
 and its subsidiaries (the "Company" or "NIKE"). All significant intercompany transactions andbalances have been eliminated.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Beginning in fiscal 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,  
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . Prior periodamounts have not been restated and continue to be reported in accordance with the
 Company's historical accounting policies. The Company's revenue recognition policesunder Topic 606 are described in the following paragraphs and references to prior period policies under Accounting Standard Codification Topic 605 — 
Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) 
, are included below in the event they are substantially different.Revenue transactions associated with the sale of NIKE Brand footwear, apparel and equipment, as
 well as Converse products, comprise a single performance obligation,which consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or direct to consumer channels. The Company satisfies the performance obligation and records
revenues when transfer of control has passed to the customer, based on the
 terms of sale. A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use andreceive substantially all of the benefits of the product.
Transfer of control passes to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and
 the agreement with the customer. Control passesto retail store customers at the time of sale and to substantially all digital commerce customers upon shipment. Prior to June 1, 2018
, the requirements for recognizing revenuewere met upon delivery to the customer. The transaction price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price, less anticipated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous
claims from customers. Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 90
days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer. Payment is due at the
 time of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions.Consideration for trademark licensing contracts is earned through sales-based or usage-based royalty arrangements and the associated revenues are recognized over the
license period.
Taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, and are collected by the Company from a
customer, are excluded from  
Revenues  and  Cost of sales  in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Shipping and handling costs associated with ou tbound freight aftercontrol over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in  
Cost of sales  when the related revenue is recognized. 56 
NIKE, INC.
Table of ContentsSALES-RELATED RESERVES
Consideration promised in the Company's contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions such as sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from
customers. The Company estimates the most likely amount it will be entitled to receive and records an anticipated reduction against 
Revenues , with an offsetting increase to Accrued liabilities 
 at the time revenues are recognized. The estimated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in  Prepaid expenses and other current assets  on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Prior to June 1, 2018, the Company's reserve balances were reported net of 
the estimated cost of inventory for product returns and recognizedwithin  
Accounts receivable, net  for wholesale transactions and Accrued liabilities for the Company's direct to consumer business, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns. Provisions for post-invoice sales discounts consist of
both contractual programs and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later da
te.Estimates of discretionary authorized returns, discounts and claims are based on (1) historical rates, (2) specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from
customers and outstanding discounts and claims and (3) estimated returns, discounts and claims expected, but not yet
 finalized with customers. Actual returns, discounts andclaims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from estimates recorded. If actual or expected future returns, discounts
 or claims were significantlygreater or lower than the reserves established, a reduction or increase to net revenues would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made.
COST OF SALES
Cost of sales 
consists primarily of inventory costs, as well as warehousing costs (including the cost of warehouse labor), third-party royalties, certain foreign currency hedge gains and losses and product design costs. Shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in 
Cost of sales . DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE
Demand creation expense 
consists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, complimentary product, television, digital and print advertising and media costs, brand events and retail brand presentation. Advertising production costs are expensed the first time an advertisement is run.
 Advertising mediacosts are expensed when the advertisement appears. Costs related to brand events are expensed when the
 event occurs. Costs related to retail brand presentation areexpensed when the presentation is complete and delivered.
A significant amount of the Company's promotional expenses result from payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed on
 astraight-line basis over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based
 upon the facts and circumstances of each individualcontract. Prepayments made under contracts are included in 
Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Deferred income taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepayment applies.
Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sport (e.g., winning a championship). The Company records
Demand creation expense 
for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a
specified ranking in a sport for a year). When the Company determines payments are probable, the amounts are reported in 
Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on the Company's best estimate of the endorser's performance. In these
 instances, to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from theCompany's estimate due to changes in the endorser's performance, adjustments to 
Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period. Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products, which the Company records in 
Cost of sales as the related sales occur. For contracts containing minimum guaranteed royalty payments, the Company records the amount of any guaranteed payment in excess
 of thatearned through sales of product within 
Demand creation expense . Through cooperative advertising programs, the Company reimburses its wholesale customers for certain costs of advertising the Company's products. The Company records
these costs in 
Demand creation expense at the point in time when it is obligated to its customers for the costs . This obligation may arise prior to the related advertisementbeing run.
2019 FORM 10-K 
57 
Table of ContentsTotal advertising and promotion expenses, which the Company refers to as 
Demand creation expense , were $3,753 million , $3,577 million and $3,341 million for the years ended 
May 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Prepaid advertising and promotion expenses totaled $773 million and $730 million at May 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, of which 
$333 million and $359 million , respectively, was recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets , and $440 million and $371 million , respectively, was recorded in 
Deferred income taxes and other assets , depending on the period to which the prepayment applied. OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSE
Operating overhead 
expense consists primarily of wage and benefit-related expenses, research and development costs, as well as other administrative expenses, such as rent, depreciation and amortization, professional services, meetings and travel.
CASH AND EQUIVALENTS
Cash and equivalents 
represent cash and short-term, highly liquid investments, that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates, including commercial paper, U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, money market 
funds, timedeposits and corporate debt securities with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of
 purchase.SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS
Short-term investments 
consist of highly liquid investments, including commercial paper, U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, time deposits and corporate debt securities, with maturities over 90 days at the date of purchase. Debt securities the Company has the
 ability and positive intent to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost. At May 31, 2019 
and 2018 , the Company did not hold any short-term investments classified as trading or held-to-maturity. At 
May 31, 2019 and 2018 , Short-term investments consisted of available-for-sale debt securities, which are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, in 
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) , unless unrealized losses are determined to be other than temporary. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification. The Company considers all available-for-sale debt securities, including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months, as
available to support current operational liquidity needs and, therefore, classifies all securities with maturity dates beyond 90 days at the date of purchase as
 current assetswithin 
Short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to 
Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements for more information on the Company's short-term investments. ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
Accounts receivable, net 
consist primarily of amounts receivable from customers. The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of its accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the
allowance, the Company considers historical levels of credit losses and makes judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit
evaluations. Accounts receivable with anticipated collection dates greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date
 and related allowances are considered non-current andrecorded in 
Deferred income taxes and other assets . The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $30 million at both May 31, 2019 and 2018 . INVENTORY VALUATION
Inventories 
are stated at lower of cost and net realizable value, and valued on either an average or a specific identification cost  basis. In some instances, we ship productdirectly from our supplier to the customer, with the related inventory and cost of sales recognized on a specific identification basis. Inventory cos
ts primarily consist of productcost from the Company's suppliers, as well as inbound freight, import duties, taxes, insurance and logistics and other handling fees.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is determined on a straight-line basis for land improvements, buildings and leasehold improvements over 
2 to40 
years and for machinery and equipment over 2 to 15 years.Depreciation and amortization of assets used in manufacturing, warehousing and product distribution are recorded in 
Cost of sales . Depreciation and amortization of all other assets are recorded in 
Operating overhead expense . 58 
NIKE, INC.
Table of ContentsSOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Internal Use Software 
: Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a 2 to 12 -year period on astraight-line basis. The Company's policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software. In
addition, the Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects. The
amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects. Costs associated with preliminary project stage
activities, training, maintenance and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred.
Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed 
: Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed as an integral part of a product are subject to capitalization beginning when a product's technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to
customers. In most instances, the Company's products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore, sof
tware development costs incurredsubsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally most software development costs have been expensed as incurred.
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying
amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate
 an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner inwhich an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affec
t the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observablemarket value of an asset, among others. If such fac
ts indicate a potential impairment, the Company would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if thecarrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash 
flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over theremaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the
 carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, the Companywill estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment
would be measured as the difference between the asset group's carrying amount and its estimated fair value.
GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS
The Company performs annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when events occur or
circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Even
ts orchanges in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting
unit, planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other fac
tors. The Company may first assess qualitative factors todetermine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. I
f, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, theCompany determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, an impairment test is unnecessary.
 If an impairmenttest is necessary, the Company will estimate the fair value of its related reporting units. If the
 carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of thatreporting unit is determined to be impaired and the Company will proceed with recording an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the related fair
value.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. The Company may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is
more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of even
ts and circumstances, the Company determines it is more likelythan not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired, no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary. If a
 quantitative fair value measurement calculation isrequired for these intangible assets, the Company primarily utilizes the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes trade names and trademarks have value to the extent
their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires the Company to estimate the 
future revenue for the relatedbrands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. If
 the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible exceeds its fair value, the asset isdetermined to be impaired and the Company will proceed with recording an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the related fair value.

Table of ContentsOPERATING LEASES
The Company leases retail store space, certain distribution and warehouse facilities, office space, equipment and other non-real estate assets under operating leases.
Operating lease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses, renewal options, rent holidays or certain landlord incentives, including tenant improvement allowances. Rent
expense for non-cancelable operating leases with scheduled rent increases or landlord incentives are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, beginning with
the effective lease commencement date, which is generally the date in which the Company takes possession of or controls the
 physical use of the property. Certain leases alsoprovide for contingent rent, which is generally determined as a percent of sales in excess of specified levels. A contingent rent liability is recognized together with the
corresponding rent expense when specified levels have been achieved or when the Company determines that achieving the specified levels during the period is probable.
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives, equity securities and available-for-sale debt securities.
Fair value is the price the Company would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. The
Company uses a three-level hierarchy established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs
used for the various valuation techniques (market approach, income approach and cost approach).
The levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
•
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.•
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilitiesin active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.
•
Level 3: Unobservable inputs with little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to 
the asset orliability. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the most conservative level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Pricing vendors are utilized for a majority of Level 1 and Level 2 investments. These vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs
without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals,
volatilities and credit risks. The fair value of derivative contracts is determined using observable market inputs such as the daily market foreign currency rates, forward pricing
curves, currency volatilities, currency correlations and interest rates and considers nonperformance risk of the Company and its counterparties.
The Company's fair value measurement process includes comparing fair values to another independent pricing vendor to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded.
Refer to 
Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements for additional information. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS
Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. Dollars are included in the foreign currency translation adjustment, a
component of 
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in Total shareholders' equity . The Company's global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, which are denominated in currencies other than their functional
currency. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement, the impact of which is recorded in 
Other (income) expense, net , within the Consolidated Statements of Income.
ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. All derivatives are recorded at fair
value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in 
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 
(a component of Total shareholders' equity ), Long-term debt or Net income depending on the nature of the underlying exposure, whether the derivative is formally designated as a hedge and, if designated, the extent
 to which the hedge is effective. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from derivatives in the samecategory as the cash flows from the related hedged items. For undesignated hedges and designated cash
 flow hedges, this is primarily within the Cash provided by operations component of the
60 
NIKE, INC.
Table of ContentsConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For designated net investment hedges, this is within the 
Cash used by investing activities component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the Company's fair value hedges, which are interest rate swaps used to mitigate the change in fair value of
 its fixed-rate debt attributable to changes ininterest rates, the related cash flows from periodic interest payments are reflected within the 
Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Refer to 
Note 14 — Risk Management and Derivatives for additional information on the Company's risk management program and derivatives. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value, net of estimated 
forfeitures, of equity awards and recognizing the related expense as Cost of sales 
or Operating overhead expense , as applicable, in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Substantially all awards vestratably over 
four years of continued employment, with stock options expiring ten years from the date of grant. The fair value of options, stock appreciation rights, andemployees' purchase rights under the employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs) is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of restricted stock
and restricted stock units is established by the market price on the date of grant.
Refer to 
Note 11 — Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation for additional information on the Company's stock-based compensation programs. INCOME TAXES
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and
 liabilities for the expectedfuture tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax
 basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance toreduce deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized.
The Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not the
 position will be sustained uponexamination by relevant tax authorities. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in 
Income tax expense . Refer to 
Note 9 — Income Taxes for further discussion. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing 
Net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by adjusting weighted average outstanding shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options and awards.
Refer to 
Note 12 — Earnings Per Share for further discussion. MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, including estimates relating to
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
 and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reportedamounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Topic 606, which replaces existing revenue recognition guidance. The new standard requires
companies to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount tha
t reflects the consideration to which the entityexpects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition,
 Topic 606 requires disclosures of the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cashflows arising from contracts with customers. The Company adopted this standard using a modified retrospective approach in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 with the cumulative
effect of initially applying the standard recognized in 
Retained earnings at June 1, 2018. Comparative prior period information has not been adjusted and continues to be reported in accordance with previous revenue recognition guidance in Topic 605. The Company has applied the new standard to all contracts at adoption.
2019 FORM 10-K 
61 
Table of ContentsThe Company's adoption of Topic 606 resulted in a change to the timing of revenue recognition. The satisfac
tion of the Company's performance obligation is based upontransfer of control over a product to a customer, which results in sales being recognized upon shipment rather than upon delivery for certain wholesale transactions and
substantially all digital commerce sales. A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive substantially all of the benefits
 of the product.This resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment, which increased 
Retained earnings by $23 million at June 1, 2018. The adoption of Topic 606 did not  have a material effect onthe Consolidated Statements of Income for fiscal 2019.
Additionally, the Company's reserve balances for returns, post-invoice sales discounts and miscellaneous claims for wholesale transactions were previously reported net of the
estimated cost of inventory for product returns, and as a reduction to 
Accounts receivable, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under Topic 606, an asset for the estimated cost of inventory for expected products returns is now recognized separately from the liability for sales-related reserves. This resulted in an increase to 
Accounts receivable, net 
, an increase in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and an increase in Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at May 31, 2019 . Sales- related reserves for the Company's direct to consumer operations continue to be recognized in 
Accrued liabilities , but are now recorded separately from an asset for the estimated cost of inventory for expected product returns, which is recognized in 
Prepaid expenses and other current assets . The following table presents the related effect of the adoption of Topic 606 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at 
May 31, 2019 :

$ 23,717 $ 1,192 $ 22,525 Other impacts from the adoption of Topic 606 on the Consolidated Financial Statements were immaterial. Refer to 
Note 16 — Revenues for further discussion. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02,  
Income Statement — Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
. The standard allows for reclassification of stranded tax effects on items resulting from the Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act (the “TaxAct”) from  
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)  to  Retained earnings . Tax effects unrelated to the Tax Ac t are released from  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 
 using either the specific identification approach or the portfolio approach based on the nature of the  underlying item. The Company early adopted the ASU in thethird quarter of fiscal 2018. As a result of the adoption, Retained earnings decreased by  
$17 million , with a corresponding increase to  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 
 due to the reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to  21%. Refer to  Note 9 — Income Taxes  for additional information on the impact of the Tax Act. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  
Compensation — Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees. The Company adopted the ASU in 
the first quarter of fiscal 2018.The updated guidance requires excess tax benefits and deficiencies from share-based payment awards to be recorded in income tax expense in the income statement.
Previously, excess tax benefits and deficiencies were recognized in shareholders' equity on the balance sheet. This change is required to be applied prospectively. During
fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, the Company recognized 
$175 million  and $230 million , respectively, of excess tax benefits related to share-based payment awards in  Income tax expense 
 in the Consolidated Statements of Income. In October 2016, the FASB issued A
SU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory . The updated guidance requires companies to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset o
ther than inventory when the transfer occurs. Income tax effects of intra-entitytransfers of inventory will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party. The
 Company adopted the standard on June 1, 2018, using a modifiedretrospective approach, with the cumulative effect of applying the new standard recognized in 
Retained earnings at the date of adoption. The adoption resulted in reductions to Retained earnings, Deferred income taxes and other assets 
, and Prepaid expenses and other current assets of $507 million , $422 million and $45 million , respectively, and an increase in 
Deferred income taxes and other liabilities of $40 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 62 
NIKE, INC.
Table of ContentsIn August 2017, the FASB issued 
ASU No. 2017-12,  Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities , which expands and refines hedge accounting for both financial and non-financial risk components, aligns the recognition and presentation of the effects
 of hedging instruments and hedge items inthe financial statements, and includes certain targeted improvements to ease the application of current guidance related to 
the assessment of hedge effectiveness. TheCompany elected to early adopt the ASU in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and
 the adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated FinancialStatements.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, 
Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which simplified the accounting for goodwill impairment by eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill in measuring an impairment charge, previously Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. Under the new standard, an
impairment charge is recorded based on the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value, previously Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test. The guidance still
allows companies to perform the optional qualitative assessment before determining whether to proceed to Step 1. The Company adopted the 
ASU in the first quarter of fiscal2019 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the
 Consolidated Financial Statements.In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,
  Financial Instruments — Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 
. The updated guidance enhances the reporting model for financial instruments, which includes amendments to address aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure. The Company adopted the ASU in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and
 the adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on theConsolidated Financial Statements.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, 
Leases (Topic 842) , which replaces existing lease accounting guidance. The new standard is intended to provide enhanced transparency and comparability by requiring lessees to record right-of-use (ROU) assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the balance sheet. ROU assets
represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the
lease. The new guidance will require the Company to continue to classify leases as either an operating or finance lease, with classification affecting the pattern o
f expenserecognition in the income statement. In addition, the new standard requires enhanced disclosure surrounding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash 
flows arising fromleasing agreements. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11,
 which provides entities with an additional transition method to adopt Topic 842. Under the new transitionmethod, an entity initially applies the new standard at the adoption date, versus at
 the beginning of the earliest period presented, and recognizes a cumulative-effectadjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. The Company will elect this transition method at 
the adoption date of June 1, 2019.Upon adoption, the Company will elect the package of transition practical expedients which would allow the Company to carry forward prior conclusions related to: (i) whether
any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (ii) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases and (iii) initial direct costs for existing leases. Additionally,
the Company will elect the practical expedient to not separate lease components from nonlease components for all real estate leases within the portfolio. The Company will
make an accounting policy election to keep leases with an initial term of 12 months or less off the Consolidated Balance Shee
ts and will recognize related lease payments inthe Consolidated Statements of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
In preparation for implementation, the Company has been executing changes to business processes, including implementing a software solution to assist with the new
reporting requirements. Upon adoption, the Company's total assets and total liabilities will increase by approximately 
$2.8 billion . The Company does not believe the standard will have a material impact on the Consolidated Statements of Income or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

$ 772 $ 2,392 $ 646 The Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017 and significantly changed previous U.S. tax laws, including a reduction in the corporate 
tax rate from 35% to 21% anda one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings. For fiscal 2018, the change in the corporate tax rate
 resulted in a blended U.S. federalstatutory rate for the Company of approximately 
29% . Certain provisions of the Tax Act, including a provision to tax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) of foreign subsidiaries, were not effective for the Company until fiscal 2019. In accordance with U.S. GA
AP, the Company has made an accounting policy election to treat taxes dueunder the GILTI provision as a current period expense. Implementation of the Tax Ac
t required the Company to record incremental provisional tax expense in fiscal 2018,which increased its effective tax rate in fiscal 2018. The Company completed its analysis of the Tax Ac
t in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and no adjustments were made tothe provisional amounts recorded. As of 
May 31, 2019 and 2018 , long-term income taxes payable were $902 million and $993 million , respectively, and were included within Deferred income taxes and other liabilities 
on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. A reconciliation from the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to the e

Table of ContentsThe effective tax rate for the year ended 
May 31, 2019 was lower than the effective tax rate for the year ended May 31, 2018 due to significant changes related to the enactment of the Tax Act in the prior year and reduction in the U.
S. federal statutory rate to 21% in the current year. The foreign earnings rate impact shown above for the yearended 
May 31, 2019 includes 1.5% of U.S. tax on foreign earnings driven by the impact of the  Tax Act.The effective tax rate for the year ended May 31, 2018
 was higher than the effective tax rate for the year ended May 31, 2017 primarily due to the enactment of the Tax Act,which included provisional expense of 
$1,875 million for the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings, and $158 million due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The remaining provisions of the Tax Act, which were a net benefit to the
 effective tax rate, did not have a material impacton the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements during fiscal 2018. Additionally, the increase in the effective tax rate was partially offse
t by the tax benefit from share-based compensation in the current period as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 in 
the first quarter of fiscal 2018. During the year ended May 31, 2017, income tax benefitof 
$177 million attributable to employee share-based compensation were allocated to Total shareholders' equity . As a result of the adoption of A SU 2016-09, beginning infiscal 2018, income tax benefits from share-based compensation are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

NIKE, INC.
Table of ContentsThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The liability for payment of interest and penalties increased by 
$17 million 
during the year ended May 31, 2019 , decreased by $14 million during the year ended May 31, 2018 and decreased by $38 million during the year ended May 31, 2017 . As of 
May 31, 2019 and 2018 , accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were $174 million and $157 million , respectively (excluding federal benefit). The Company is subject to taxation in the United States, as well as various state
 and foreign jurisdictions. The Company has closed all U.S. federal income tax matters throughfiscal 
2016 , with the exception of certain transfer pricing adjustments. The Company's major foreign jurisdictions, China and the Netherlands, have concluded substantially all income tax matters through calendar 2008 and fiscal 2012, respectively. Although the timing of resolution of audits is no
t certain, the Company evaluates all domestic andforeign audit issues in the aggregate, along with the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations, and estimates 
that it is reasonably possible the total gross unrecognized taxbenefits could decrease by up to 
$210 million within the next 12 months. In January 2019, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether the Netherlands has breached State Aid rules when granting certain tax rulings to the Company. The Company believes the investigation is without merit. If 
this matter is adverselyresolved, the Netherlands may be required to assess additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods, and the company's Netherlands income taxes in the future
could increase.
The Company historically provided for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they were considered indefinitely reinvested outside the
United States. As a result of the enactment
 of the Tax Act, in fiscal 2018 the Company reevaluated its historic indefinite reinvestment assertion and determined that anyhistorical or future undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested.
A portion of the Company's foreign operations benefit from a tax holiday, which is set to expire in 
2021 . This tax holiday may be extended when certain conditions are met or may be terminated early if certain conditions are not met. The tax benefit attributable to 
this tax holiday was $167 million , $126 million and $187 million for the fiscal years ended 
May 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The benefit of the tax holiday on diluted earnings per common share was $0.10 , $0.08 and $0.11 for the fiscal years ended 
May 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Deferred tax assets at 
May 31, 2019 and 2018 were reduced by a valuation allowance primarily relating to tax benefits of certain entities with operating losses. There was a $7 million 
net decrease in the valuation allowance for the year ended May 31, 2019 , compared to a $13 million net increase for the year ended May 31, 2018 , and $30 million net increase for the year ended 
May 31, 2017 . The Company has available domestic and foreign loss carry-forwards of

May 31, 2019 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro, Chinese Yuan/U.S. Dollar and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. All derivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classified based on 
theinstrument's maturity date.
The following table presents the fair values of derivative instruments included within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of 
May 31, 2019 and 2018 . Refer to Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements

All changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in  
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)  until  Net income  is affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction. Effective hedge results are classified in the Consolidated S
tatements of Income in the same manner as the underlyingexposure. Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be discontinued when it is no longer probable the forecasted hedged transaction will occur in the
initially identified time period. The gains and losses associated with discontinued derivative instruments in 
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be recognized immediately in 
Other (income) expense, net , if it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur by the end of  the initially identified time period or within anadditional 
two -month period thereafter. In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, the Company will account for thederivative as an undesignated instrument as discussed below.
The purpose of the Company's foreign exchange risk management program is to lessen both the positive and negative effects
 of currency fluctuations on the Company'sconsolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Foreign currency exposures the Company may elect to hedge in this manner include product cost
exposures, non-functional currency denominated external and intercompany revenues, demand creation expenses, investments in U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale
debt securities and certain other intercompany transactions.
76 
NIKE, INC.
Table of ContentsProduct cost exposures are primarily generated through non-functional currency denominated product purchases and the foreign currency adjustment program described
below. NIKE entities primarily purchase product in two ways: (1) Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NIKE Trading Company (NTC), a wholly owned sourcing hub
that buys NIKE branded products from third party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.
S. Dollar, then sells the product toNIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different
 functional currency result in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC. (2)Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those
 NIKE entities with afunctional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.
The Company operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming
certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to the
 Company's existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, theCompany's payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket
 of currencies (“factory currency exposure index”) in which the labor, materials andoverhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (“factory input cos
ts”) are denominated. For the portion of the indices denominated in thelocal or functional currency of the factory, the Company may elect to place formally designated cash flow hedges. For all currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S.
 Dollarand the local or functional currency of the factory, an embedded derivative contract is created upon 
the factory's acceptance of NIKE's purchase order. Embedded derivativecontracts are separated from the related purchase order, as further described within the Embedded Derivatives section below.
The Company's policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or other strategies cannot be effectively employed.
Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 
12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The
 total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was  $8.1 billion 
 as of May 31, 2019 . As of 
May 31, 2019 , approximately $518 million of deferred net gains (net of tax) on both outstanding and  matured derivatives in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 
are expected to be reclassified to Net income during the next 12 months concurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in Net income . Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to Net income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts currently outstanding mature.
 As of May 31, 2019 , the maximum term over which the Company is hedging exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted transactions was 
15 months.FAIR VALUE HEDGES
The Company has, in the past, been exposed to the risk of
 changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. Derivatives used by theCompany to hedge this risk are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. All interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt meet the
shortcut method requirements under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, changes in the 
fair values of the interest rate swaps are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value ofthe underlying long-term debt. The Company had 
no interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges as of May 31, 2019 . NET INVESTMENT HEDGES
The Company has, in the past, hedged and may, in the fu
ture, hedge the risk of variability in foreign currency-denominated net investments in wholly-owned internationaloperations. All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment hedges are reported in 
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) along with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. The Company had 
no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2019 . UNDESIGNATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
The Company may elect to enter into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets
 and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and/orthe embedded derivative contracts. These undesignated instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with 
theircorresponding change in fair value recognized in 
Other (income) expense, net , together with the re-measurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position and/or embedded derivative contract. The total notional amount of outstanding undesignated derivative instruments was  
$6.5 billion  as of  May 31, 2019 . 2019 FORM 10-K 
77 
Table of ContentsEMBEDDED DERIVATIVES
As part of the foreign currency adjustment program described above, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the fac
tory's acceptance of NIKE's purchase order forcurrencies within the factory currency exposure indices that are neither the U.S. Dollar nor the local or functional currency of the factory. In
 addition, embedded derivativecontracts are created when the Company enters into certain other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to
 currencies that are not the functionalcurrency of either substantial party to the contracts. Embedded derivative contracts are treated
 as foreign currency forward contracts that are bifurcated from the relatedcontract and recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in  
Other (income) expense, net 
, through the date the foreign currency fluctuations cease to exist. At 
May 31, 2019 , the total notional amount of embedded derivatives outstanding was approximately $452 million . CREDIT RISK
The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to hedging instruments. The counterparties to all derivative transactions are
major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings; however, this does not eliminate the Company's exposure to credit risk with these institutions. This credit risk is
limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted. To
 manage this risk, the Company has established strictcounterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored.
The Company's derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features designed to protect against significant deterioration in counterparties' creditworthiness and
their ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal course of business. The Company's bilateral credit-related contingent features generally require the
owing entity, either the Company or the derivative counterparty, to post collateral for the portion of 
the fair value in excess of $50 million should the fair value of outstanding derivatives per counterparty be greater than 
$50 million . Additionally, a certain level of decline in credit rating of either the Company or the counterparty could also trigger collateral requirements. As of  
May 31, 2019 , the Company was in compliance with all credit risk-related contingent features and derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features in a net liability position were immaterial. Accordingly, the Company was not required to post any collateral as a result of these contingent fea
tures. Further,as of  
May 31, 2019 , the Company had  $289 million  of cash collateral received from various counterparties to its derivative contracts (refer to  Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements 
). The Company considers the impact of the risk of counterparty default to be immaterial . NOTE 15 — ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)

Table of ContentsNOTE 17 — OPERATING SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION
The Company's operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Company's internal organization. The NIKE Brand segments
 are defined by geographic regions foroperations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity.
Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic foo
twear, apparel and equipment.The Company's reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East & 
Africa; Greater China; and Asia Pacific & Latin America, andinclude results for the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands.
The Company's NIKE Direct operations are managed within each NIKE Brand geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable segment for the Company, and
operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories.
Global Brand Divisions is included within the NIKE Brand for presentation purposes to align with the way management views the Company. Global Brand Divisions primarily
represent NIKE Brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment, and demand creation and
 operating overhead expense, including productcreation and design expenses that are centrally managed for the NIKE Brand, as well as costs
 associated with NIKE Direct global digital operations and enterprise technology.Corporate consists primarily of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and
amortization related to the Company's headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign
currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses.
The primary financial measure used by the Company to evaluate performance of individual operating segments is earnings before interest and taxes (commonly referred to as
“EBIT”), which represents 
Net income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As part of the Company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand
entity in the Company's geographic operating segments and to Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of 
the future selling seasonsto which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to 
the spring and summerselling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. 
Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases in the
 entity's functional currency. Differences betweenassigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from the
Company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.
Accounts receivable, net, Inventories 
and Property, plant and equipment, net for operating segments are regularly reviewed by management and are therefore provided below. Additions to long-lived assets as presented in the following table represent capital expenditures.

Capital leases and other fin ancing obligations include payments related to build-to-suit lease arrangements.As of 
May 31, 2019 and 2018 , the Company had bank guarantees and letters of credit outstanding to taling $215 million and $165 million , respectively, issued primarily for real estate agreements, self-insurance programs and other general business obligations.
In connection with various contracts and agreements, the Company provides routine indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for
legal issues that arise and other items where the Company is acting as the guarantor. Currently, the Company has several such agreements in place. However, based on the
Company's historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, the Company has determined the fair value of such indemnification is not material to the
Company's financial position or results of operations.
In the ordinary course of its business, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims,
trademark rights and a variety of other matters. While the Company cannot predict the outcome of its
 pending legal matters with certainty, the Company does not believe anycurrently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or
cash flows.

NIKE, INC.
DESCRIPTION OF NIKE, INC. CAPITAL STOCKThe following description of Nike, Inc.’s (“Company”) capital stock is a summary that is not complete and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the Company’s Restated Articles of Incorporation (“Articles of Incorporation”) and the Company’s Fifth
Restated By-Laws (“By
‑ Laws”).General
The Company’s Articles of Incorporation provide that it may issue up to 400,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, no
par value (“Class A Common Stock”); 2,400,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock, no par value (“Class B Common Stock” and
collectively with the Class A Common Stock, the “Common Stock”); and 300,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per
share (“Preferred Stock”). As of July 19, 2019, 315,024,752 shares of Class A Common Stock, 1,251,863,621 shares of Class B
Common Stock and 300,000 shares of Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding.
Voting and Other Rights
General
Each share of Common Stock is entitled to one vote per share, voting as a single class, on all matters which stockholders
generally are entitled to vote, except as provided below in the case of voting for the election of directors. The holders of the
Common Stock have no preemptive rights and are not entitled to cumulative voting.
Shares of Class A Common Stock are convertible into shares of Class B Common Stock on a share-for-share basis any time
at the option of the holder, subject to certain terms and conditions. The Class B Common Stock does not have any conversion rights.
Except as otherwise required by law, holders of Preferred Stock do not have general voting rights but do have the right to
vote as a separate class with one vote per share on, (i) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries, (ii) on a merger, consolidation, liquidation or dissolution of the Company, or (iii) on the sale or assignment of the
“NIKE” trademark for athletic shoes sold in the United States. If any such matter is submitted for approval by the holders of the
Preferred Stock and is not approved by more than 66⅔% of such holders, then the Company has the right to redeem the shares of
Preferred Stock voting against such action at the redemption price of $1.00 per share, plus accrued dividends and interest, if any, and
the holders of such Preferred Stock have the right to require the Company to redeem their shares at the same price. The outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock may also be redeemed by the Company, at its option, or at the option of the holders of Preferred Stock, at a
redemption price of $1.00 per share, plus any accrued dividends and interest, under certain other circumstances.
Voting for the Election of Directors
At any time and so long as the number of outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock equals or exceeds 25% of the total
outstanding shares of Common Stock, the holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common stock will vote as separate
classes for the purposes of electing directors. In such case, holders of Class B Common Stock, voting as a separate class, 
shall beentitled to elect 25% (rounded up to

the nearest whole number) of the total number of authorized directors with holders of Class A Common Stock, voting as a separateclass, electing the remaining directors.
Notwithstanding the above paragraph, in the event that the number of outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock is less
than 12.5% of the total number of Common Stock shares outstanding, the holders of Class B Common Stock, voting as a separate
class, shall continue to elect 25% (rounded up to the nearest whole number) of the total number of authorized directors and the
remaining directors will be elected by all holders of Common Stock voting together as a single class.
If the number of outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock is less than 25% of the total number of Common Stock shares
outstanding, the holders of the Common Stock will elect all directors voting together as a single class.
Dividend and Liquidation Rights
Dividends on the Preferred Stock, which are preferential and cumulative, are at the rate of $0.10 per share per annum. Any
unpaid dividends on the Preferred Stock accrue interest at the rate of 12% per annum.
The holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock are entitled to share ratably in dividends when and as
declared by the Company’s Board of Directors. Dividends on the Common Stock may not be paid in any fiscal year unless all
dividends for such fiscal year on all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock have been declared and paid, or set apart for payment, in
full.
Holders of Class A and Class B Common Stock also are entitled to share ratably in any proceeds legally available for
distribution to shareholders upon liquidation or dissolution, after provision is first made for holders of the Preferred Stock. Holders
of Preferred Stock are entitled to receive $1.00 per share, together with dividends declared and unpaid, prior to any payment upon
liquidation to holders of the outstanding Common Stock.
Anti-takeover Effects of Certain Provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws
The provisions of the Company’s Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws summarized below may have an anti-takeover
effect and may delay, defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt.
Voting Thresholds
The Company’s Articles of Incorporation provide that a vote of 80% of all of the outstanding Common Stock, voting
together as one class, is required to approve a merger, sale of assets or similar business tran
saction with any beneficial holder of 10%or more of the Company’s Common Stock, unless the transaction is first approved by the Board of Directors. The 80% vote in such
instance must include the affirmative vote of at least 50% of the Common Stock held by persons other than the interested party.
Additionally, any amendment of provisions of the Articles of Incorporation concerning the 80% voting provisions, the number of
directors constituting the Board of Directors, and the removal of directors, also requires the approval of the holders of 80% of the
outstanding Common Stock.
These provisions with respect to super-majority voting requirements may make it more difficult for any person interested in
acquiring the Company to effect a merger or other business combination with the Company. Any shareholder or group of
shareholders owning more than 20% of the Common Stock

will have effective veto power over certain proposed acquisitions of the Company. Such provisions could result in the holders of amajority of the outstanding voting Common Stock being unable to effect requisite shareholder approval, even though the terms of
such combination might be considered favorable.
Authorized but Unissued Common Stock
The Company’s shares of authorized and unissued common stock will be available for future issuance without additional
stockholders approval, provided that that the Company shall at all times keep available enough shares of Class B Common Stock as
would be needed to convert all outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock to Class B Common Stock on a share-for-share basis.
The existence of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock may enable the Company’s Board of Directors to render more
difficult or to discourage an attempt to obtain control of the Company by means of a merger, tender offer or otherwise.
No Cumulative Voting
The Articles of Incorporation do not grant holders of the Common Stock the right to vote cumulatively.
Notice Provisions Relating to Stockholder Proposals and Nominees
The Company’s By-Laws contain provisions requiring stockholders to give advance written notice to the Company of a
proposal or director nomination in order to have the proposal or the nominee considered at an annual meeting of stockholders. The
notice for a shareholder proposal must be received not less than 60 days prior to the meeting.
Market Listing
The Company’s Class B Common Stock is listed under the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “NKE”.
