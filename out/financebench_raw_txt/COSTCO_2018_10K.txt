PART I
Item 1—Business
Costco
 Wholesale Corporation and its subsidiaries (Costco or the Company) began operations in 1983, in Seattle, Washington. We are principallyengaged
 in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico, Canada, United Kingdom (U.K.), Mexico, Japan,Korea,
 Australia,  Spain,  France,  Iceland,  and  through  a  majority-owned  subsidiary  in  Taiwan.  Costco  operated 762 ,  741,  and 715 warehousesworldwide
 at September  2, 2018 , September 3, 2017 ,  and August  28, 2016 ,  respectively.  Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ GlobalSelect Market, under the symbol “COST.”
We
 report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first threequarters
 consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). Thematerial
 seasonal impact in our operations is increased net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2018 and 2016relate
 to the 52-week fiscal years ended September  2, 2018 ,  and August  28, 2016 ,  respectively. References to 2017 relate  to the 53-week fiscalyear ended 
September 3, 2017 . General
We
 operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded andprivate-label products in a wide range of categ
ories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operatingefficiencies
 achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities,these
 volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most otherretailers. We generally sell inventory before we are require
d to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early payment discounts.We
 buy  most  of  our  merchandise  directly  from  manufacturers  and  route  it  to  cross-docking  consolidation  points  (depots)  or  directly  to  ourwarehouses.
 Our depots receive large shipments from manufacturers and quickly ship these goods to warehouses. This process creates freightvolume and handling efficie
ncies, lowering costs associated with traditional multiple-step distribution channels.Our
 average warehouse space is approximately 145,000 square feet, with newer units being slightly larger. Floor plans are designed for economyand
 efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally bythe quality of merchandise and
3

Table of Contentslow
 prices,  our  warehouses  are  not  elaborate.  By  strictly  controlling  the  entrances  and  exits  and  using  a  membership  format,  we  believe  ourinventory losses (shrinkage) are well belo
w those of typical retail operations.Our
 warehouses on average operate on a seven-day, 70-hour week. Gasoline operations generally have extended hours. Because the hours ofoperation
 are shorter than other retailers, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to thevolume
 of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities, reducing laborrequired.
 In general, with variations by country, our warehouses accept certain credit, including the Costco co-branded card, and debit cards, cash,and checks.
Our
 strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high-quality merchandise at prices we believe are consistently lower than elsewhere.We
 seek to limit items to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors. We carry an average of approximately 3,700 active stock keeping units (SKUs) perwarehous
e in our core warehouse business, significantly less than other broadline retailers. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case,carton, or multiple-pack quantities only.
In
 keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we typically have a 90-day
 return policy and provide, free of charge, technical support services, as well as an extended warranty. Additional third-party warranty coverageis sold on certain electronic items.
We offer merchandise in the following categories:
•
Food  and  Sundries (including  dry  foods,  packaged  foods,  groceries,  snack  foods,  candy,  alcoholic  and  nonalcoholic  beverages,  andcleaning supplies)
•
Hardlines (including major applianc es, electronics, health and beauty aids, hardware, and garden and patio)•
Fresh Foods (including meat, produce, deli, and bakery) •
Softlines (including apparel and s mall appliances)•
Ancillary (including gasoline and phar macy businesses)Ancillary
 businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services, encouraging members to shop more frequently.These
 businesses include gas stations, pharmacies, optical dispensing centers, food courts, and hearing-aid centers. The number of warehouseswith gas stations vary significantly by
 country, and we do not operate our gasoline business in Korea or France. We operated 567 gas stations at theend of 
2018 . Our
 e-commerce  operations  allow  us  to  connect  with  our  members  online  and  provide  additional  products  and  services,  many  not  found  in  ourwarehouses.
 We  operate  e-commerce  websites  in  the  U.S.,  Canada,  Mexico,  U.K.,  Korea,  and  Taiwan.  Net  sales  for  e-commerce  representedapproximately 4% of total net sales in 
2018 . Additionally, we offer business delivery, travel and vari ous other services online in certain countries.We
 have  direct  buying  relationships  with  many  producers  of  national  brand-name  merchandise.  We  do  not  obtain  a  significant  portion  ofmerchandise
 from any one supplier. We generally have not experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise and believe that ifcurrent
 sources of supply became unavailable, we would be able to obtain alternative sources without substantial disruption of our business. Wealso purchase and manufacture private-labe
l merchandise, as long as quality and member demand are comparable and the value to our members issignificant.
Certain
 financial  information  for  our  segments  and  geographic  areas  is  included  in  Note  11  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  inItem 8 of this Report.

Table of ContentsMembership
Our
 members  may  utilize  their  memberships  at  our  warehouses  worldwide.  Gold  Star  memberships  are  available  to  individuals;  Businessmemberships
 are  limited  to  businesses,  including  individuals  with  a  business  license,  retail  sales  license  or  comparable  evidence.  Businessmembers
 have the ability to add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Starmembers.
 Our annual fee for these memberships is $60 in our U.S. and Canadian operations and varies in other countries. All paid membershipsinclude a free household card.
Our
 member renewal rate was 90% in the U.S. and Canada and 88% on a worldwide basis at the end of 2018 .  The majority of members renewwithin
 six months following their renewal date. Therefore, our renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven toeighteen months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):
 
2018   2017   2016 Gold Star
40,700  38,600  36,800 Business, including affiliates
10,900  10,800  10,800 Total paid members
51,600  49,400  47,600 Household cards
42,700  40,900  39,100 Total cardholders
94,300  90,300  86,700 Paid
 cardholders (except Business affiliates) are eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S. and Canada for an additional annualfee
 of $60. Executive memberships are also available in Mexico and the U.K., for which the additional annual fee varies. Executive members earn a2%
 reward on qualified purchases (up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year in U.S. and Canada and varies in Mexico and the U.K.), and can beredeemed
 only at Costco warehouses. This program also offers (except in Mexico), access to additional savings and benefits on various businessand
 consumer services, such as auto and home insurance, the Costco auto purchase program, and check printing services. These services aregenerally
 provided by third parties and vary by state and country. Executive members, who represented 37% of  paid members at the end of 2018 , generally shop more frequently and spen
d more than other members.Labor
Our employee count was as follows:
 
2018   2017   2016 Full-time employees
143,000   133,000   126,000 Part-time employees
102,000   98,000   92,000 Total employees
245,000   231,000   218,000 Approximately 
15,900 employees are union employees. We consi der our employee relations to be very good.Competition
Our
 industry is highly competitive, based on factors such as price, merchandise quality and selection, location, convenience, distribution strategy,and
 customer  service.  We  compete  on  a  worldwide  basis  with  global,  national,  and  regional  wholesalers  and  retailers,  including  supermarkets,supercenters,
 internet  retailers,  gasoline  stations,  hard  discounters,  department  and  specialty  stores,  and  operators  selling  a  single  category  ornarrow range of merchandise. Walmart, Target, Kroger, and Amazon.com are among our significant gen
eral5

Table of Contentsmerchandise
 retail competitors. We also compete with warehouse club operations (primarily Walmart’s Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club), andnearly every major U.S. and Mexico metropolitan area has multiple cl
ub operations.Intellectual Property
We
 believe that, to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes, trade secrets, patents, trade dress, domainnames
 and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important to our success. We have invested significantly in thedevelopment
 and  protection  of  our  well-recognized  brands,  including  the  Costco  Wholesale ® trademarks  and  our  private-label  brand,  KirklandSignature 
® . We believe that Kirkland Signature products are high quality, offered to our members at prices that are generally lower than nationalbrands,
 and  that  they  help  lower  costs,  differentiate  our  merchandise  offerings,  and  generally  earn  higher  margins.  We  expect  to  continue  toincrease the sales penetration of our private labe
l items.We
 rely on trademark and copyright laws, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality, license and other agreements with our suppliers, employeesand
 others to protect  our intellectual property.  The availability and duration of trademark  registrations  vary by country;  however, trademarks  aregenerally valid and may be renew
ed indefinitely as long as they are in use and registrations are properly maintained.Available Information

Table of ContentsItem 1A—Risk Factors
The
 risks  described  below  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.  We  could  also  beaffected by
 additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us orthat
 we currently consider to be immaterial. These Risk Factors should be carefully reviewed in conjunction with Management '  s Discussion andAnalysis
 of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item    7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item    8 of thisReport.
Business and Operating Risks
We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our U.S. and Canadian operations.
Our
 financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our U.S. and Canadian operations, which comprised 87% and 83% of net salesand
 operating income in 2018 ,  respectively. Within the U.S., we are highly dependent on our California operations, which comprised 30% of U.S.net
 sales in 2018 .  Our California market, in general, has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other domesticmarkets.
 Any  substantial  slowing  or  sustained  decline  in  these  operations  could  materially  adversely  affect  our  business  and  financial  results.Declines
 in  financial  performance  of  our  U.S.  operations,  particularly  in  California,  and  our  Canadian  operations  could  arise  from,  among  otherthings:
 slow  growth  or  declines  in  comparable  warehouse  sales  (comparable  sales);  negative  trends  in  operating  expenses,  including increasedlabor,
 healthcare and energy costs; failing to meet targets for warehouse openings; cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses; shifts insales
 mix  toward  lower  gross  margin  products;  changes  or  uncertainties  in  economic  conditions  in  our  markets,  including  higher  levels  ofunemployment and depressed home val
ues; and failing to consistently provide high quality and innovative new products.We
 may  be  unsuccessful  implementing  our  growth  strategy,  including  expanding  our  business  in  existing  markets  and  new  markets,which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our
 growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses and depots. We compete with other retailersand businesses for suitable locations. Local land
 use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses and depots,as
 well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses or depots at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restrictingour
 operations and environmental regulations, may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of sites and of constructing,leasing
 and operating warehouses and depots. We also may have difficulty negotiating leases or purchase agreements on acceptable terms. Inaddition,
 certain  jurisdictions  have  enacted  or  proposed  laws  and  regulations  that  would  prevent  or  restrict  the  operation  or  expansion  plans  ofcertain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including us. Failure to
 effectively manage these and other similar factors may affect our ability to timelybuild or lease and operate new w
arehouses and depots, which could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and profitability.We
 seek  to  expand  in  existing  markets  to  attain  a  greater  overall  market  share.  A  new  warehouse  may  draw  members  away  from  our  existingwarehouses and adversely affect their comparable sa
les performance, member traffic, and profitability.We intend to
 continue to open warehouses in new markets. Associated risks include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity withus,
 attracting members of other wholesale club operators, our lack of familiarity with local member preferences, and seasonal differences in themarket.
 Entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large, established marketpresence.
 We  cannot  ensure  that  new  warehouses  and  new  websites  will  be  profitable  and,  as  a  result,  future  profitability  could  be  delayed  orotherwise materially adversely affected.

Table of ContentsOur failure to maintain membership growth, loyalty and brand recognition
 could adversely affect our results of operations.Membership
 loyalty  and  growth  are  essential  to  our  business.  The  extent  to  which  we  achieve  growth  in  our  membership  base,  increase  thepenetration
 of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Damage to our brands or reputationmay
 negatively impact comparable sales, diminish member trust, and reduce member renewal rates and, accordingly, net sales and membershipfee revenue, negatively impacting our results of operatio
ns.We
 sell  many  products  under  our  Kirkland  Signature  brand.  Maintaining  consistent  product  quality,  competitive  pricing,  and  availability  of  theseproducts
 is  essential  to  developing  and  maintaining  member  loyalty.  These  products  also  generally  carry  higher  margins  than  national  brandproducts
 carried  in  our  warehouses  and  represent  a  growing  portion  of  our  overall  sales.  If  the  Kirkland  Signature  brand  experiences  a  loss  ofmember acceptance or confidence, our sales and gross margin results cou
ld be adversely affected.Disruptions
 in our merchandise distribution or processing, packaging, manufacturing, and other facilities could adversely affect salesand member satisfaction.
We
 depend  on  the  orderly  operation  of  the  merchandise  receiving  and  distribution  process,  primarily  through  our  depots.  We  also  rely  uponprocessing,
 packaging,  manufacturing  and  other  facilities  to  support  our  business,  which  includes  the  production  of  certain  private-label  items.Although we
 believe that our operations are efficient, disruptions due to fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes or other catastrophic events, laborissues
 or other shipping problems may result in delays in the production and delivery of merchandise to our warehouses, which could adverselyaffect sales and the satisfaction of our members.
We
 may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively affect our relationship with our members,the demand for our products and services, and our market share.
It
 is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services that our members will desire. Our success depends, in part, on ourability
 to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Failure to identify timely or effectively respond to changingconsumer
 tastes,  preferences  (including  those  relating  to  sustainability  of  product  sources  and  animal  welfare)  and  spending  patterns  couldnegatively
 affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. If we are not successful atpredicting our sales trends and adjusting our
 purchases accordingly, we may have excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns andreduce our operating performance. This could have a
n adverse effect on net sales, gross margin and operating income.We
 rely  extensively  on  information  technology  to  process  transactions,  compile  results,  and  manage  our  businesses.  Failure  ordisruption
 of  our  primary  and  back-up  systems  could  adversely  affect  our  businesses.  A  failure  to  adequately  update  our  existingsystems and implement new systems could harm our businesses and adversely affect our results of operations.
Given
 the very high volume of transactions we process each year it is important that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-criticalcomputer
 systems.  Our  systems,  including  our  back-up  systems,  are  subject  to  damage  or  interruption  from  power  outages,  computer  andtelecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal
 or external security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes andhurricanes, and errors by
 our employees. If our systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make significant investments tofix or
 replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. Any material interruption in these systems could have a materialadverse effect on our business and results of operations.
We
 are currently making, and will continue to make, investments to improve or advance critical information systems and processing capabilities.Failure
 to  monitor  and  choose  the  right  investments  and  implement  them  at  the  right  pace  would  be  harmful.  The  risk  of  system  disruption  isincreased

 us to realize benefits. Targeting the wrong opportunities, failing to make the best investments, or making an investment commitment significantlyabove
 or below our needs could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.The potential problems and
 interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations.These initiatives might not provide the anticip
ated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost.We
 identified  a  material  weakness  in  our  internal  control  related  to  ineffective  information  technology  general  controls  which,  if  notremediated appropriately or timely, could result in loss of investor confidence and adversely impact our stock price.
Internal
 controls  related  to  the  operation  of  technology  systems  are  critical  to  maintaining  adequate  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  Asdisclosed
 in  Part  II,  Item  9A,  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  fiscal  2018,  management  identified  a  material  weakness  in  internal  control  related  toineffective
 information technology general controls (ITGCs) in the areas of user access and program change-management over certain informationtechnolo
gy (IT) systems that support the Company’s financial reporting processes. As a result, management concluded that our internal control overfinancial
 reporting was not effective as of September 2, 2018. We are implementing remedial measures and, while there can be no assurance thatour
 efforts will be successful, we plan to remediate the material weakness prior to the end of fiscal 2019. These measures will result in additionaltechnology
 and other expenses. If we are unable to remediate the material weakness, or are otherwise unable to maintain effective internal controlover
 financial  reporting  or  disclosure  controls  and  procedures,  our  ability  to  record,  process  and  report  financial  information  accurately,  and  toprepare
 financial statements within required time periods, could be adversely affected, which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiringmanagement
 resources and payment of legal and other expenses, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adverselyimpact our stock price.
If
 we do not maintain the privacy and security of personal and business information, we could damage our reputation with members andemployees, incur substantial additional costs, and become subject to litigation.
We
 receive,  retain,  and  transmit  personal  information  about  our  members  and  employees  and  entrust  that  information  to  third-party  businessassociates,
 including  cloud  service-providers  that  perform  activities  for  us.  Our  warehouse  and  online  businesses  depend  upon  the  securetransmission
 of encrypted confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. A compromise of oursecurity
 systems  or  defects  within  our  hardware  or  software,  or  those  of  our  business  associates,  that  results  in  our  members'  or  employees'information
 being obtained by unauthorized persons, could adversely affect our reputation with our members and others, as well as our operations,results
 of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation, government actions, or the imposition of penalties. In addition, abreach could require that we expend sig
nificant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could disrupt our operations.The
 use of data by our business and our business associates is regulated at the national and state or local level in all of our operating countries.   Privacy
 and information-security laws and regulations change, and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to, among other things,systems
 changes  and  the  development  of  new  processes.  If  we  or  those  with  whom  we  share  information  fail  to  comply  with  these  laws  andregulati
ons, our reputation could be damaged, possibly resulting in lost future business, and we could be subjected to additional legal risk as a resultof
 non-compliance, including fines of up to 4% of our global revenue in the case of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We do notmaintain cyber-insurance for these risks.
We
 have security measures and controls to protect personal and business information and continue to make investments to secure access to ourinformation
 technology network. These measures may be undermined, however, due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, internal orexternal malfeas
ance, or otherwise, and, as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business andpersonal information. Because the techniq
ues used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade10

 or  sabotage  systems  change  frequently  and  may  not  immediately  produce  signs  of  intrusion,  we  may  be  unable  to  anticipate  thesetechniques, timely discover or counter
 them, or implement adequate preventative measures. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result insignificant legal and financ
ial exposure, damage to our reputation, and potentially have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We are subject to payment-related risks.
We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash an
d checks, a select variety of credit and debit cards, and our proprietary cash card.As
 we offer new payment options to our members, we may be subject to additional rules, regulations, compliance requirements, and higher fraudlosses. For certain payment methods, we pay interchange and other relate
d card acceptance fees, along with additional transaction processing fees.We
 rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing services, including the processing of credit and debit cards, and our proprietarycash
 card, and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject topayment
 card association and network operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic fundstransfers,
 which  could  change  over  time.  For  example,  we  are  subject  to  Payment  Card  Industry  Data  Security  Standards  (“PCI  DSS”),  whichcontain
 compliance  guidelines  and  standards  with  regard  to  our  security  surrounding  the  physical  and  electronic  storage,  processing  andtransmission
 of individual cardholder data. In addition, if our internal systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card re-issuancecosts,
 subject  to  fines  and  higher  transaction  fees  and  lose  our  ability  to  accept  credit  and/or  debit  card  payments  from  our  members,  and  ourbusiness and operating results coul
d be adversely affected.We might sell products that cause illness or injury to our members, harm to our reputat
ion, and expose us to litigation.If
 our merchandise, such as food and prepared food products for human consumption, drugs, children '  s products, pet products and durable goods,do
 not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safety standards or our members '  expectations regarding safety, we could experience lostsales,
 increased costs, litigation or reputational harm. The sale of these items involves the risk of health-related illness or injury to our members.Such
 illnesses or injuries could result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence offoreign
 objects,  substances,  chemicals,  other  agents,  or  residues  introduced  during  the  growing,  manufacturing,  storage,  handling  andtransportation
 phases, or faulty design. Our vendors are generally contractually required to comply with product safety laws, and we are dependenton
 them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations andwork
 to comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that consumption or use of our products will notcause illness or injury in the future or that we will not
 be subject to claims, lawsuits, or government investigations relating to such matters resulting incostly
 product  recalls  and  other  liabilities  that  could  adversely  affect  our  business  and  results  of  operations.  Even  if  a  product  liability  claim  isunsuccessful
 or is not fully pursued, negative publicity could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporateand brand image, and these effects could be lon

 we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for our members, our results of operations could beadversely impacted.
Omnichannel
 retailing is rapidly evolving, and we must keep pace with changing member expectations and new developments by our competitors.Our
 members are increasingly using mobile phones, tablets, computers, and other devices to shop and to interact with us through social media. Weare
 making technology investments in our websites and mobile applications. If we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant member-facingtechnology in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operati
ons could be adversely affected.11

Table of ContentsInability
 to attract,  train and retain highly qualified  employees could adversely impact our business,  financial  condition  and results ofoperations.
Our
 success  depends  on  the  continued  contributions  of  members  of  our  senior  management  and  other  key  operations,  merchandising  andadministrative personnel. Failure to identify an
d implement a succession plan for key senior management could negatively impact the business.We
 must attract, train and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees, while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our corevalues.
 Our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous internal and external factors, including regulatory changes, prevailingwage
 rates,  and  healthcare  and  other  insurance  costs.  We  compete  with  other  retail  and  non-retail  businesses  for  these  employees  and  investsignific
ant resources in training and motivating them. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in thefuture, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, fina
ncial condition and results of operations.We may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance.
The
 Company is predominantly self-insured for employee health care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’and
 officers’ liability, vehicle liability, and inventory loss. Insurance coverage is maintained in certain instances to limit the exposure arising fromcatastrophic
 events. The types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention andregulatory
 requirements.  Significant  claims  or  events,  regulatory  changes,  a  substantial  rise  in  costs  of  health  care  or  costs  to  maintain  ourinsuranc
e, or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.We are
 primarily self-insured as it relates to property damage. Although we maintain specific coverages for catastrophic losses, we still bear the riskof
 losses incurred as a result of any physical damage to, or the destruction of, any warehouses, depots, manufacturing or home office facilities, lossor
 spoilage of inventory, and business interruption caused by any such events to the extent they are below catastrophic levels of coverage, as wellas
 any losses to the extent they exceed our aggregate limits of applicable coverages. Such losses could materially impact our cash flow and resultsof operations.
Market and Other External Risks
We
 face  strong  competition  from  other  retailers  and  warehouse  club  operators,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financialcondition and results of operations.
The
 retail business is highly competitive. We compete for members, employees, sites, products and services and in other important respects with awide
 range of local, regional and national wholesalers and retailers, both in the United States and in foreign countries, including other warehouse-club
 operators, supermarkets, supercenters, internet retailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores and operatorsselling
 a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Such retailers  and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways, includingmerchandi
se pricing, selection and availability, services, location, convenience, store hours, and the attractiveness and ease of use of websites andmobile
 applications. The evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improved the ability of customers to comparison shop with digitaldevices,
 which has enhanced competition. Some competitors may have greater financial resources and technology capabilities, better access tomerchandise,
 and greater market penetration than we do. Our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, changes in the retail marketsand member expectations could result in lost market share and neg
atively affect our financial results.General
 economic  factors,  domestically  and  internationally,  may  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition,  and  results  ofoperations.
Higher
 energy  and  gasoline  costs,  inflation,  levels  of  unemployment,  healthcare  costs,  consumer  debt  levels,  foreign-currency  exchange  rates,unsettled
 financial markets, weaknesses in housing and real estate markets, reduced consumer confidence, changes and uncertainties related togovernment fiscal and tax

Table of Contentspolicies
 including changes in tax rates, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions, sovereign debt crises, and other economic factors could adversely affectdemand
 for our products and services, require a change in product mix, or impact the cost of or ability to purchase inventory. Prices of certaincommodity
 products,  including  gasoline  and  other  food  products,  are  historically  volatile  and  are  subject  to  fluctuations  arising  from  changes  indomestic
 and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, taxes and periodic delays indelivery.
 Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices and our ability and desire to pass them through to our members may affect our salesand
 profit  margins.  These  factors  could  also  increase  our  merchandise  costs  and  selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses,  and  otherwiseadversely affect our operations and financial results. General
 economic conditions can also be affected by significant events like the outbreak of waror acts of terrorism.
Vendors
 may be unable to timely supply us with quality merchandise at competitive prices or may fail to adhere to our high standards,resulting in adverse effects on our business, merchandise inventories, sales, and profit margins.
We depend
 heavily on our ability to purchase quality merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. As the quantities we require continueto
 grow, we have no assurances of continued supply, appropriate pricing or access to new products, and any vendor has the ability to change theterms upon which they sell to us or discontinue selli
ng to us. Member demands may lead to out-of-stock positions of our merchandise leading to lossof sales and profits.
We buy
 from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers. Our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or theloss
 of  key  vendors  could  negatively  affect  us.  We  may  not  be  able  to  develop  relationships  with  new  vendors,  and  products  from  alternativesources,
 if any, may be of a lesser quality or more expensive than those from existing vendors. Because of our efforts to adhere to high qualitystandards
 for  which  available  supply  may  be  limited,  particularly  for  certain  food  items,  the  large  volume  we  demand  may  not  be  consistentlyavailable.
Our
 suppliers (and those they depend upon for materials and services) are subject to risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activities,financial
 liquidity, inclement weather, natural disasters, supply constraints, and general economic and political conditions that could limit their abilityto
 timely provide us with acceptable merchandise. For these or other reasons, one or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control,legal,
 regulatory, labor, environmental or animal welfare standards. These deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us andmight
 not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members. This failure could lead to recalls and litigation and otherwise damage ourreputation and our brands, increase our costs, and otherwise a
dversely impact our business.Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.
During 
2018 ,  our international operations, including Canada, generated 28% and 38% of our net sales and operating income, respectively. Ourinternational
 operations have accounted for an increasing portion of our warehouses, and we plan to continue international growth. To prepare ourconsolidated
 financial statements, we translate the financial statements of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars usingcurrent
 exchange  rates.  Future  fluctuations  in  exchange  rates  that  are  unfavorable  to  us  may  adversely  affect  the  financial  performance  of  ourCanadian
 and  Other  International  operations  and  have  a  corresponding  adverse  period-over-period  effect  on  our  results  of  operations.  As  wecontinue to expand internationa
lly, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may increase.A
 portion of the products we purchase for sale in our warehouses around the world is paid for in a currency other than the local currency of thecountry
 in which the goods are sold. Currency fluctuations may increase our cost of goods and may not be passed on to members. Consequently,fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.

Table of ContentsNatural disasters or other catastrophes could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Natural
 disasters,  such  as  hurricanes,  typhoons  or  earthquakes,  particularly  in  California  or  Washington  state,  where  our  centralized  operatingsystems
 and administrative personnel are located, could negatively affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result inphysical
 damage  to  one  or  more  of  our  properties,  the  temporary  closure  of  one  or  more  warehouses,  depots,  manufacturing  or  home  officefacilities,
 the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some localor
 overseas suppliers, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods to or from overseas, delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses ordepots
 within the countries in which we operate, and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses. Public health issues,whether occurring in
 the U.S. or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or members, or have an adverse impact onconsumer
 spending and confidence levels. These events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to procureproducts.
 We may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition and resu
lts of operations.Factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business.
We
 use natural  gas, diesel fuel,  gasoline,  and electricity  in our distribution  and warehouse operations.  U.S.  and foreign  government  regulationslimiting
 carbon  dioxide  and  other  greenhouse  gas  emissions  may  result  in  increased  compliance  and  merchandise  costs,  and  legislation  orregulation
 affecting  energy  inputs  that  could  materially  affect  our  profitability.  Climate  change  and  extreme  weather  conditions,  such  as  intensehurricane
s, thunderstorms, tornadoes, and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels could affect our ability to procure needed commodities atcosts and in quantities we currently experienc
e. We also sell a substantial amount of gasoline, the demand for which could be impacted by concernsabout climate change and which co
uld face increased regulation.Failure to meet financial market expectations could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.
We
 believe that the price of our stock currently reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay inmeeting
 these expectations, including our warehouse and e-commerce comparable sales growth rates, membership renewal rates, new membersign-ups,
 gross margin, earnings, earnings per share, new warehouse openings, or dividend or stock repurchase policies could cause the marketprice of our stock to decline.
Legal and Regulatory Risks
Our
 international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economicfactors
 specific  to  the  countries  or  regions  in  which  we  operate,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition  andresults of operations.
During 
2018 ,  we operated 235 warehouses outside of the U.S., and we plan to continue expanding our international operations. Future operatingresults
 internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, many similar to those we face in the U.S., certain of which are beyond ourcontrol. These
 factors include political and economic conditions, regulatory constraints, currency regulations, policy changes such as the U.K.'s voteto withdraw from the
 European Union, commonly known as "Brexit", and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now orin the
 future. Other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade (including tariffs), monetary and fiscal policies and the lawsand
 regulations  of  the  U.S.  and  foreign  governments,  agencies  and  similar  organizations,  and  risks  associated  with  having  major  facilities  inlocations
 which have been historically less stable than the U.S. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, the costs anddifficulties of managing internationa
l operations, adverse tax consequences, and difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights.14

Table of ContentsChanges
 in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accountingmatters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Accounting
 principles  and  related  pronouncements,  implementation  guidelines,  and  interpretations  we  apply  to  a  wide range  of  matters  that  arerelevant to our business, including self-insur
ance liabilities and income taxes, are highly complex and involve subjective assumptions, estimates andjudgments
 by  our  management.  Changes  in  rules  or  interpretation  or  changes  in  underlying  assumptions,  estimates  or  judgments  by  ourmanagement
 could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance and have a material impact on our consolidated financialstatements.
We could be subject to additional income tax liabilities.
We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the cou
ntries in which we operate. As tax rates vary among countries, a changein
 earnings  attributable  to  the  various  jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate  could  result  in  an  unfavorable  change  in  our  overall  tax  provision.Additionally,
 changes  in  the  enacted  tax  rates,  adverse  outcomes  in  tax  audits,  including  transfer  pricing  disputes,  or  any  change  in  thepronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes co
uld have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Significant
 changes in, or failure to comply with, federal, state, regional, local and international laws and regulations relating to the use,storage,
 discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters couldadversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We
 are subject to a wide variety of federal, state, regional, local and international laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge anddisposal
 of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters. Failure to comply with these laws couldresult
 in  harm  to  our  members,  employees  or  others,  significant  costs  to  satisfy  environmental  compliance,  remediation  or  compensatoryrequirements,
 or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect ourbusiness, financial conditio
n and results of operations.We
 are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits and some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business, financialcondition and results of operations.
Our
 business  requires  compliance  with  many  laws  and  regulations.  Failure  to  achieve  compliance  could  subject  us  to  lawsuits  and  otherproceedings,
 and  lead  to  damage  awards,  fines,  penalties,  and  remediation  costs.  We  are,  or  may  become  involved,  in  a  number  of  legalproceedings
 and  audits  including  grand  jury  investigations,  government  and  agency  investigations,  and  consumer,  employment,  tort,  unclaimedproperty
 laws,  and  other  litigation.  We  cannot  predict  with  certainty  the  outcomes  of  these  proceedings  and  other  contingencies,  includingenvironmental
 remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities. The outcome of some of these proceedings, audits,unclaimed
 property  laws,  and  other  contingencies  could  require  us  to  take,  or  refrain  from  taking,  actions  which  could  negatively  affect  ouroperations
 or  could  require  us  to  pay  substantial  amounts  of  money,  adversely  affecting  our  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.Additionally,
 defending  against  these  lawsuits  and  proceedings  may  involve  significant  expense  and  diversion  of  management '  s  attention  andresources.

 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations (amounts  in millions, except per share,share, membership fee, and warehouse count data)
Overview
We
 believe that the most important driver of our profitability is sales growth, particularly comparable warehouse sales (comparable sales) growth.We
 define comparable sales as sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, as well asonline
 sales related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shoppingfrequency
 from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularlyinfluenced
 by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results ofour international operatio
ns); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions. The higher our comparable sales exclusiveof
 these items, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales andenhanci
ng profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at theright
 prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term. Another substantial factor in sales growth is the health ofthe
 economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Sales growth and gross marginsare
 also  impacted  by  our  competition,  which  is vigorous  and  widespread,  across  a wide range  of  global,  national  and regional  wholesalers  andretailers,
 including  those  with  e-commerce  operations.  While  we  cannot  control  or  reliably  predict  general  economic  health  or  changes  incompetition,
 we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to ourpricing and to our merchandise mix, includin
g increasing the penetration of our private label items, and through our online offerings.Our
 philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short term on maximizingprices
 charged,  but  instead  seek  to  maintain  what  we  believe  is  a  perception  among  our  members  of  our  “pricing  authority”  on  quality  goods  –consistently
 providing  the  most  competitive  values.  Our  investments  in  merchandise  pricing  can,  from  time  to  time,  include  reducing  prices  onmerchandise
 to  drive  sales  or  meet  competition  and  holding  prices  steady  despite  cost  increases  instead  of  passing  the  increases  on  to  ourmembers,
 all negatively impacting near-term gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage). We believe that our gasolinebusiness
 draws  members  but  it  generally  has  a  significantly  lower  gross  margin  percentage  relative  to  our  non-gasoline  business.  A  higherpenetration
 of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-term
 net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our grossmargin
 percentage  but  decreases  our  selling,  general  and  administrative  (SG&A)  expenses  as  a  percentage  of  net  sales.  A  decline  in  gasolineprices has the inverse effect.
We
 also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable potential sites become moredifficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial compo
nent of growth. The negative aspects of such growth,however,
 including  lower  initial  operating  profitability  relative  to  existing  warehouses  and  cannibalization  of  sales  at  existing  warehouses  whenopenings
 occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of squarefootage
 growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commercebusiness growth, domestically and internati
onally, has also increased our sales.Our
 membership  format  is  an  integral  part  of  our  business  and  has  a  significant  effect  on  our  profitability.  This  format  is  designed  to  reinforcemember loyalty and provide continuing fee reve
nue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of ourExecutive
 members,  and  sustain  high  renewal  rates,  materially  influences  our  profitability.  Our  paid  membership  growth  rate  may  be  adverselyimpacted when warehouse ope
nings occur in existing markets.21

Our financial performance depends heavily on our ability to control costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, somesignificant
 costs  are  partially  outside  our  control,  most  particularly  health  care  and  utility  expenses.  With  respect  to  expenses  relating  to  thecompensation
 of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term
 objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better thanthe industry avera
ge for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through totheir
 workforces. Because our business is operated on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the income statement, particularlymerchandise costs and selling, genera
l and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income.Our
 operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canada, and Other International operating segments (see Note 11 to the consolidatedfinancial
 statements included in Item 8 of this Report). Certain countries in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of squarefootage growth, lower wages and benefits costs as a percenta
ge of country sales, and/or less or no direct membership warehouse competition.In
 discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which arereferences
 to the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from localcurrencies
 into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the differencebetween
 the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on netsales is calculated based on the differenc
e between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period.Our
 fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. Fiscal year 2018 and 2016 were  52-week fiscal years ending on September  2, 2018 and August
 28, 2016 ,  respectively, and 2017 was  a 53-week fiscal year ending on September  3, 2017 .  Certain percentages presented are calculatedusing actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherw
ise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco.Highlights for fiscal year 
2018 included: •
We opened 25 new warehouses, including 4 relocations, in 2018 : 13 net new locations in the U.S., three in  Canada, and five in our OtherInternational segment, compared to 28 new warehous
es, including 2 relocations in 2017 ; •
Net sales increased 10% to 138,434 driven  by a 9% increase in comparable sales and sales at new warehouses opened in 2017 and 2018 , partially offset by one additional week of sal
es in 2017 ; •
Membership  fee  revenue  increased 10% to $3,142 ,  primarily  due  to  the  annual  fee  increase  in  the  U.S.  and  Canada  in  June  2017,  andmembership sign-ups at existing and new ware
houses;•
Gross margin percentage decreased 29 basis points due to the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales and a shift in sales penetration tocertain lower margin warehouse ancil
lary businesses from our core merchandise categories;•
Selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 24 basis points, due to the impact of gasoline priceinflation and leveraging in
creased sales;•
The effective tax rate in 2018 was 28.4% and was favorably impacted by the 2017 Tax Act and net tax benefits of $57. The effective tax rate in2017 was 32.8% and was favorably impacted by n
et tax benefits of $104;•
Net income increased 17% to $3,134 , or $7.09 per diluted share compared to $2,679 , or $6.08 per diluted share in 2017 ; and •
In April 2018, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.50 to $0.57 per share.22

Net
 sales increased $12,262 or 10% during 2018 ,  primarily due to a 9% increase in comparable sales and sales at new warehouses opened in2017 
and 2018 , partially offset by the impact of one additional week of sales in 20 17.Changes
 in gasoline prices positively impacted net sales by approximately $2,267, or 180 basis points, due to a 19% increase in the average salesprice
 per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted net sales by approximately $1,156, or 92 basis points,compared to 
2017 . The positive impact was driven by both our Canadia n and Other International operations.Comparable Sales
Comparable
 sales increased 9% during 2018 and  were positively impacted by increases in both shopping frequency and the average ticket. Theaverage
 ticket and comparable sales results were positively impacted by an increase in gasoline prices and exchange rates in foreign currenciesrelative to
 the U.S. dollar. Changes in comparable sales includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to ournewly opened locations).

Net
 sales increased $10,099 or 9% during 2017, primarily due to a 4% increase in comparable sales, new warehouses opened in 2016 and 2017,and the benefit of one additional week of sales in 2017. Changes in gasolin
e prices positively impacted net sales by approximately $785, or 68 basispoints, due to an
 8% increase in the average sales price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted netsales
 by approximately  $295, or 25 basis points, compared to 2016. The negative impact was driven by Other International operations, partiallyoffset by positive impacts attributable to our Canadian operati

vs. 2017The
 increase in membership fees was primarily due to the annual fee increase and membership sign-ups at existing and new warehouses. Theseincreases
 were partially offset by the impact of one additional week of membership fees in 2017. At the end of 2018 ,  our member renewal rateswere 
90% in the U.S. and  Canada and 88% worldwide. As
 reported in fiscal 2017, we increased our annual membership fees in the U.S. and Canada and in certain of our Other International operations.We
 account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. These fee increases had apositive impact of approximately $178 in fiscal 20
18 and will positively impact fiscal 2019, primarily the first two quarters, by approximately $70.2017 
vs. 2016The
 increase in membership fees was primarily due to membership sign-ups at existing and new warehouses, an extra week of membership feerevenue,
 the annual fee increase, and an increased number of upgrades to our higher-fee Executive Membership program. Fee increases had apositive impact on membership fee revenues during 2
017 of approximately $23.24

 gross margin of our core merchandise categories (food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage ofcore
 merchandise  sales  (rather  than  total  net  sales),  increased  one  basis  point  primarily  due  to  increases  in  food  and  sundries  and  hardlinespartially
 offset by decreases in fresh foods and softlines. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross marginsfrom our warehouse ancillary and other business
es.Total
 gross margin percentage decreased 29 basis points compared to 2017. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, grossmargin
 as  a  percentage  of  adjusted  net  sales  was  11.22%,  a  decrease  of  11  basis  points.  This  decrease  was  primarily  due  to  a  shift  in  salespenetration
 to  certain  lower  margin  warehouse  ancillary  and  other  businesses,  which  contributed  to  a  13  basis  point  decrease  in  our  coremerchandise
 categories, except hardlines which was flat. Gross margin percentage was also negatively impacted by 10 basis points due to a non-recurring
 legal settlement benefiting 2017 and costs related to our centralized return centers in the U.S. These decreases were partially offset by a13
 basis  point  increase  in  our  warehouse  ancillary  and  other  businesses,  predominantly  our  gasoline  business.  Changes  in  foreign  currenciesrelative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted gross margin by approx
imately $124 in 2018.The

 prices  on  net  sales  (segment  gross  margin  percentage),  decreased  in  our  U.S.  operations,  predominantly  in  our  core  merchandisecategories,
 and as a result of the non-recurring legal settlement in 2017, and the costs related to our centralized return centers mentioned above.The
 segment  gross  margin  percentage  in  our  Canadian  operations  increased,  due  to  warehouse  ancillary  and  other  businesses,  primarily  ourgasoline
 business. The segment gross margin percentage in our Other International operations decreased, predominantly in food and sundries andsoftlines, partially offset by an increase in our gasolin
e business.2017 
vs. 2016The
 gross margin of our core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales, increased eight basis pointsdue to increases in these categories other than fresh foods.
Total
 gross margin percentage decreased two basis points compared to 2016. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, grossmargin
 as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 11.40%, an increase of five basis points. This increase was primarily due to amounts earnedunder
 the co-branded credit card arrangement in the U.S. of 15 basis points and a benefit of three basis points from non-recurring legal settlementsand
 other matters. The improvement in terms in our current co-brand agreement as compared to the prior co-brand arrangement led to substantialyear
 over  year  benefits  in  fiscal  2017.  These  increases  were  partially  offset  by  a  six  basis  point  decrease  in  our  core  merchandise  categories,primarily due to
 food and sundries as a result of a decrease in sales penetration. The gross margin percentage was also negatively impacted by fivebasis
 points due to a LIFO benefit in 2016 and one basis point in warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Changes in foreign currencies relativeto the U.S. dollar had an immaterial impact on gross margin in 2017.

 ancillary, and other businesses, which includes e-commerce and travel, were lower by six basis points, predominantly in our U.S. andOther Internationa
l operations, due to leveraging increased sales. Charges related to certain non-recurring legal and other matters in 2017 positivelyimpacted
 SG&A expense by two basis points. Stock compensation expense was also lower by one basis point. Central operating costs were higherby two basis points. Changes in foreign currenci
es relative to the U.S. dollar increased our SG&A expenses by approximately $98 in 2018.Effective in June 2018,
 a portion of the savings generated from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”) were used to increase wages for themajority
 of our U.S. hourly employees. The impact in fiscal 2018 was two basis points and the estimated annualized pre-tax cost of these increasesis approximately $120.

 expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 14 basis points compared to 2016. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on netsales,
 SG&A  expenses  as  a  percentage  of  adjusted  net  sales  was  10.33%,  a  decrease  of  seven  basis  points.  Operating  costs  related  towarehouses,
 ancillary, and other businesses, were lower by nine basis points, primarily due to lower costs associated with the co-branded creditcard
 arrangement in the U.S. of 18 basis points. The improvement in terms in our current co-brand agreement as compared to the prior co-brandarrangeme
nt led to substantial year over year benefits in fiscal 2017. This was partially offset by higher payroll and employee benefit expenses of 11basis
 points, primarily in our U.S. operations. Central operating costs were higher by one basis point, primarily due to increased costs associatedwith
 our information systems modernization, including increased depreciation for projects placed in service, incurred by our U.S. operations. Stockcompensation expense was also h
igher by one basis point.26

 effective tax rate for 2018 was  favorably impacted by the 2017 Tax Act, which included a reduction in the U.S. federal corporate rate from 35%to
 21%. Due to the timing of our fiscal year relative to the effective date of the rate change, our U.S. corporate rate for 2018 resulted in a blendedrate
 of 25.6%. Other impacts from the 2017 Tax Act consisted of tax expense of $142 for  the estimated tax on deemed repatriation of unremittedearnings
 and $43 for  the  reduction  in  foreign  tax  credits  and  other  immaterial  items,  largely  offset  by  a  tax  benefit  of   $166 for  the provisionalremeasureme

ation and other immaterial net benefits.In
 2017, our provision was favorably impacted by net tax benefits of $104, primarily due to a tax benefit recorded in connection with the May 2017special dividend pai

(2,947 )  (2,366 )  (2,345 ) Net cash used in financing activities
(1,281 )  (3,218 )  (2,419 ) Our primary sources
 of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Cashand
 cash  equivalents  and  short-term  investments  were $7,259 and $5,779 at  the  end  of 2018 and 2017 ,  respectively.  Of  these  balances,approximately
 $ 1,348 and  $ 1,255 represented  unsettled credit and debit card receivables, respectively. These receivables generally settle withinfour days.
 Cash and cash equivalents were negatively impacted by a change in exchange rates of $ 37 in 2018 and positively  impacted by $ 25 and$ 
50 in 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Management
 believes  that  our  cash  position  and  operating  cash  flows  will  be  sufficient  to  meet  our  liquidity  and  capital  requirements  for  theforeseeable future. While we believe that
 our U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity requirements, beginningin
 the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we no longer consider current fiscal year and future earnings of our non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries to bepermanently
 reinvested. We recorded the estimated incremental foreign withholding (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxespayable
 on current fiscal year earnings assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. We continue to consider undistributed earnings of certainnon-U.S. consolidated subsidi
aries prior to fiscal 2018 to be indefinitely reinvested and have not provided for withholding or state taxes.In
 fiscal 2018, we recorded a one-time charge of $142 for  the estimated tax on deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings under the 2017 Tax Act.The 2017 Tax
 Act provides for the payment of the federal tax over an eight-year period. Because of the availability of foreign tax credits, the amountpayable is $97, of which $89 is classifi
ed as long-term and included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net
 cash provided by operating activities totaled $ 5,774 in 2018 ,  compared to $ 6,726 in 2017 .  Our cash flow provided by operations is primarilyderived from net sales and membership fees. Cash flow used in op

ly consists of payments to our merchandise vendors, warehouse operating costs including payroll and employee benefits, utilities, and creditand
 debit card processing fees. Cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes. The decrease in net cash provided by operatingactivities
 for 2018 when  compared to 2017 was  primarily due to accelerated vendor payments of approximately $1,700 made in the last week offiscal 2016, which positively impacted cas
h flows in 2017.Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net
 cash used in investing activities totaled $2,947 in 2018 ,  compared to $2,366 in 2017 ,  and primarily related to capital expenditures. Net cash flows from investing activities also includes maturities an
d purchases of short-term investments.Capital Expenditures
We opened 
21 net new warehous es  and relocated 4 warehouses in 2018 and  plan to open approximately 20 net new warehouses and relocate upto
 4 warehouses in 2019 .  Our primary  requirement  for capital is acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses.Capital
 is also required for information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations and working capital. In 2018 , we
 spent $2,969 on  capital  expenditures,  and  it  is  our  current  intention  to  spend  approximately  $2,800  to  $3,100  during  fiscal 2019 . Theseexpendit
ures are expected to be financed with cash from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. There can beno assurance that current expectations will be realiz
ed and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs.Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net
 cash  used  in  financing  activities  totaled $1,281 in 2018 ,  compared to $3,218 in 2017 .  The  primary  uses  of  cash  in 2018 were  related todividend
 payments  and  repurchases  of  common  stock.  Net  cash  used  in  financing  activities  in 2017 primarily  related  to  dividend  payments,predominantly
 the special dividend paid in May 2017, and the repayments of debt totaling $2,200 representing the aggregate principal balances ofthe 5.5% and 1.125% Senior Notes.
In
 May 2017, we issued $3,800 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes. The proceeds received were net of a discount and used to pay thespecial dividend and a p
ortion of the redemption of the 1.125% Senior Notes.Stock Repurchase Programs
During 
2018 and 2017 ,  we repurchased 1,756,000 and 2,998,000 shares  of common stock, at average prices of $183.13 and $157.87 ,  totalingapproximately 
$322 and $473 ,  respectively. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $2,427 at  the end of2018 
. These amounts may  differ from the stock repurchase balances in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes inunsettled
 stock repurchases at the end of each fiscal year. Purchases are made from time-to-time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or inblock
 purchases  and pursuant  to  plans under  SEC Rule 10b5-1.  Repurchased  shares  are  retired,  in accordance  with  the Washington  BusinessCorporation Act.
Dividends
Cash
 dividends declared in 2018 totaled  $ 2.14 per  share, as compared to $ 8.90 per  share in 2017 ,  which included a special cash dividend of$7.00
 per share. In April 2018 ,  our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.50 to $0.57 per  share. Subsequent to the endof 2018, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash divide
nd in the amount of $0.57 per share, which is payable on November 23, 20 18.29

Table of ContentsBank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs
We
 maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At September  2, 2018 ,  we had borrowing capacity underthese
 facilities of $857, including a $400 revolving line of credit renewed by the U.S., which expires in June 2019. The Company currently has noplans
 to draw upon this facility. Our international operations maintain $344 of the total borrowing capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $163is guaranteed by the Company. There were no outstand
ing short-term borrowings under the bank credit facilities at the end of 2018 and 2017.The Company has letter of
 credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $220. The outstanding standby letters of credit underthese
 facilities at the end of 2018 totaled $149 and expire within one year. The bank credit facilities and commercial paper programs have variousexpiration
 dates, all within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities. The amount of borrowings available at any time under ourbank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercia
l letters of credit then outstanding.Contractual Obligations

The total amount excludes $36 ofnon-current unrecognized tax contingencies and $30 of other obligations due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In
 the opinion of management, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current orfuture
 effect on our financial condition or financial statements other than operating leases, included in the table above and discussed in Note 1 andNote 5 to the consolidated financial statements inc
luded in Item 8 of this Report.30

Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Estimates
The
 preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requiresthat
 we  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  the  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  andliabilities
 at  the date of the  financial statements  and the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and expenses during  the reporting  period.  We  base ourestimates
 on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, and we continue to review and evaluate these estimates.For
 further information on significant accounting policies, see discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of thisReport.
Insurance/Self-Insurance Liabilities
The
 Company is predominantly self-insured for employee health-care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’and
 officers’ liability, vehicle liability, and inventory loss. Insurance coverage is maintained in certain instances to limit the exposure arising fromcatastrophic events.
 We use different mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and participate in a reinsurance program.Liabilities
 associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated by using historical claims experience, demographic factors,severity
 factors  and  other  actuarial  assumptions.  The  costs  of  claims  are  highly  unpredictable  and  can  fluctuate  as  a  result  of  inflation  rates,regulatory
 or legal changes, and unforeseen developments in claims of an extended nature. While we believe our estimates are reasonable andprovide
 for a certain degree of coverage to account for these variables, actual claims and costs could differ significantly from recorded liabilities.Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material.
Income Taxes
The
 determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application ofcomplex
 tax laws. Significant judgment also is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability ofsustaining
 uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded only after determining a more-likely-than-notprobability
 that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these positions andrecord
 any changes in the consolidated  financial statements  as appropriate.  In December  2017,  the 2017 Tax Act  was signed into law and oureffective tax rate for fiscal 2018 reflects the provisional impact (see Note 8 to our Consolidate
d Financial Statements).Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 1 to the consolidated financi
al statements included in Item 8 of this Report for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements.Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
(amounts in millions) Our
 exposure  to  financial  market  risk  results  from  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  We  do  not  engage  inspeculative or leveraged transactions or hol
d or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.Interest Rate Risk
Our
 exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among various instrumentsconsidered
 to be cash equivalents, as defined in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report, as well as short-term
 investments in government and agency securities with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. Theprimary
 objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short-term investmentsare in fixed interest-rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair val
ue due to interest rate fluctuations.31

Table of ContentsOur
 policy limits investments in the U.S. to direct U.S. government and government agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized byU.S.
 government  and  government  agency  obligations,  and  U.S.  government  and  government  agency  money  market  funds.  Our  wholly-ownedcaptive
 insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. government and government agency obligations and U.S. government and government agency moneymarket funds. Our
 Canadian and Other International subsidiaries’ investments are primarily in money market funds, bankers’ acceptances, and bankcertificates of deposit, generally denominated i
n local currencies.A
 100 basis-point change in interest rates as of the end of 2018 would  have had an immaterial incremental change in fair market value. For thoseinvestments
 that are classified as available-for-sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates arereflected within stockholders’ equity in accumu
lated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets.The
 nature and amount of our long-term debt may vary as a result of business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. As of the end of2018 
,  long-term debt with fixed interest rates was $6,577 .  Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed-rate debt. See Note 4to the consolidated financial statements incl
uded in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long-term debt.Foreign Currency-Exchange Risk
Our
 foreign  subsidiaries  conduct  certain  transactions  in  their  non-functional  currencies,  which  exposes  us  to  fluctuations  in  exchange  rates.  Wemanage
 these  fluctuations,  in  part,  through  the  use  of  forward  foreign-exchange  contracts,  seeking  to  economically  hedge  the  impact  of  thesefluctuations
 on known future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency. The contracts are intended primarily to economicallyhedge
 exposure to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries whose functional currency is other thanthe
 U.S. dollar. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. For additionalinformation
 related to the Company's forward foreign-exchange contracts, see Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements included inItem
 8  of  this  Report.  A  hypothetical  10%  strengthening  of  the  functional  currency  compared  to  the  non-functional  currency  exchange  rates  atSeptember
 2, 2018 ,  would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $80 and resulted in an unrealized loss in the consolidated statementsof income for the same amount.
Commodity Price Risk
We
 are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through fixed-pricecontracts
 for certain of our warehouses and other facilities, predominantly in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable-priced contracts forsome
 purchases of electricity and natural gas, in addition to fuel for our gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics ofderivativ
e instruments, but generally qualify for the “normal purchases or normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and require no mark-to-market adjustment.

Costco Wholesale Corporation:
Opinion on the Consolidated
 Financial StatementsWe
 have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of  Costco  Wholesale  Corporation  and  subsidiaries  (the  Company)  as  ofSeptember
 2, 2018 and September 3, 2017 ,  the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for the52-week period ended 
September 2, 2018 , the 53-week period ended September 3, 2017 and the 52-week period ended August 28, 2016 , and the related
 notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all materialrespects, the financial position of the Company as of 
September 2, 2018 and September 3, 2017 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
 the 52-week period ended September  2, 2018 ,  the 53-week period ended September  3, 2017 and  the 52-week period ended August  28, 2016 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accountin

 financial  statements  based  on  our  audits.  We  are  a  public  accounting  firm  registered  with  the  PCAOB  and  are  required  to  beindependent

Costco Wholesale Corporation:
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial R
eportingWe
 have audited Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries’ (the  Company) internal control over financial reporting as of September  2, 2018 , based
 on  criteria  established  in Internal  Control  -  Integrated  Framework  (2013) issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  theTreadway Commission. In
 our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness, described below, on the achievement of the objectives of thecontrol
 criteria,  the  Company  has  not  maintained  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  September  2,  2018,  based  on  criteriaestablished in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Tread way Commission.We
 also  have  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)  (PCAOB),  theconsolidated
 balance sheets of the Company as of September 2, 2018 and September 3, 2017, and the related consolidated statements of income,comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for the 52-week p
eriod ended September 2, 2018, the 53-week period ended September 3, 2017 andthe 52-week
 period ended August 28, 2016, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated October25, 2018 expressed an unqual
ified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.A
 material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonablepossibility
 that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.The following material weakness h
as been identified and included in management’s assessment:There
 were ineffective  information  technology  general controls (ITGCs)  in the areas of user access and program change-management  overcertain
 information technology (IT) systems that support the Company’s financial reporting processes. As a result, business process automatedand
 manual controls that were dependent on the affected ITGCs were ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted. Thesecontrol
 deficiencies  were  a  result  of:  IT  control  processes  lacked  sufficient  documentation;  insufficient  knowledge  and  training  of  certainindividuals
 with IT expertise; and risk-assessment processes inadequate to identify and assess changes in IT environments and personnel thatcould impact internal control over financial rep
orting.The
 material  weakness  was  considered  in  determining  the  nature,  timing,  and  extent  of  audit  tests  applied  in  our  audit  of  the  fiscal  year  2018consolidated financial statements, and this rep
ort does not affect our report on those consolidated financial statements.Basis for Opinion
The
 Company’s  management  is  responsible  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  for  its  assessment  of  theeffectiveness
 of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  the  accompanying  Management’s  Annual  Report  on  Internal  Control  OverFinancial
 Reporting (Item 9A). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on ouraudit.
 We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordancewith the U.S. federal securities laws and the applic
able rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We
 conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtainreasonable
 assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internalcontrol
 over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a materialweakness exists, and testing and evaluati
ng the design and operating effectiveness of internal34

Table of Contentscontrol
 based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.We believe that our audit provides a reasonab
le basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Fina
ncial ReportingA
 company’s  internal  control  over  financial reporting  is a process  designed to  provide  reasonable assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financialreporting
 and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  Acompany’s
 internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, inreasonab
le detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance thattransactions
 are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,and
 that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors  of thecompany;
 and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use,  or  disposition  of  thecompany’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because
 of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  anyevaluation
 of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or thatthe degree of compliance with the polici
es or procedures may deteriorate./s/ KPMG LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(amounts in millions, except share, per share, and warehouse count data)
Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or
 the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses based onthe
 concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandisecategories
 will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. At September  2, 2018 ,  Costco operated 762 warehouses worldwide: 527 United
 States  (U.S.)  locations  (in 44 U.S.  states,  Washington,  D.C.,  and  Puerto  Rico), 100 Canada  locations, 39 Mexico  locations, 28 UnitedKingdom
 (U.K.)  locations, 26 Japan locations, 15 Korea locations, 13 Taiwan locations, 10 Australia locations, two Spain locations, one Icelandlocation, and 
one France location. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea, and Taiwan.Basis of Presentation
The
 consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  Costco  Wholesale  Corporation,  its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries,  and  subsidiaries  inwhich it
 has a controlling interest. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from theCompany’s
 equity.  All  material  inter-company  transactions  between  and  among  the  Company  and  its  consolidated  subsidiaries  have  beeneliminat
ed in consolidation. The Company’s net income excludes income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Taiwan. During the first quarterof 
2018 ,  Costco purchased its former joint-venture partner's remaining equity interest in its Korean operations. Unless otherwise noted, referencesto net income relate to net income attributable to Costco.
Fiscal Year End
The
 Company operates on a 52/53 week  fiscal year basis with the fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2018 and 2016 
relate  to the 52-week fiscal years ended September  2, 2018 ,  and August  28, 2016 ,  respectively. References to 2017 relate  to the 53-weekfiscal year ended 
September 3, 2017 . Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. general
ly accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to makeestimates and assumptio
ns that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dateof
 the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from thoseestimates and assumptions.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The
 Company considers as cash and cash equivalents all cash on deposit, highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at thedate
 of  purchase,  and  proceeds  due  from  credit  and  debit  card  transactions  with  settlement  terms  of  up  to  four  days.  Credit  and  debit  cardreceivables were $ 
1,348 and $ 1,255 at the end of 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The
 Company provides for the daily replenishment of major bank accounts as checks are presented. Included in accounts payable at the end of2018 
and 2017 are  $ 463 and $ 383 , respectively, representing the excess of outstanding checks over cash on deposit at the banks on which thechecks were drawn.
41

Table of ContentsShort-Term Investments
In
 general, short-term investments have a maturity at the date of purchase of three months to five years. Investments with maturities beyond fiveyears
 may be classified, based on the Company’s determination, as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because they represent theinvestment of cash that
 is available for current operations. Short-term investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value using thespecific
 identification  method  with  the  unrealized  gains  and  losses  reflected  in  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  until  realized.Realized
 gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis and are recorded ininterest
 income  and  other,  net  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  income.  Short-term  investments  classified  as  held-to-maturity  are  financialinstruments
 that the Company has the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported net of any related amortization and are not remeasuredto fair value on a recurring basis.
The
 Company periodically evaluates unrealized losses in its investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment, using both qualitative andquantitative
 criteria. In the event a security is deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, the Company recognizes the loss in interest incomeand other, net in the consolidated statements of income.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The
 Company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash andcash
 equivalents, receivables and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to their short-term nature or variable interest rates. See Notes 2, 3,and 4 for the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s inv
estments, derivative instruments, and fixed-rate debt, respectively.Fair
 value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer  a liability in an orderly transaction  between marketparticipants
 at the measurement date. Fair value is estimated by applying a fair value hierarchy, which requires maximizing the use of observableinputs when measuring fair value. The three leve
ls of inputs are:Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservab
le inputs that are corroborated by market data.Level 3: Significant unobservab
le inputs that are not corroborated by market data.The
 Company’s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market mutual funds are based on quoted market prices, such asquoted net asset
 values published by the fund as supported in an active market. Valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of all othernon-derivative
 financial  instruments  are  based  on  independent  external  valuation  information.  The  pricing  process  uses  data  from  a  variety  ofindependent
 external valuation information providers, including trades, bid price or spread, two-sided markets, quotes, benchmark curves includingbut not limited to 
treasury benchmarks and Libor and swap curves, discount rates, and market data feeds. All are observable in the market or can bederived
 principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The Company reports transfers in and out of Levels 1, 2, and 3, as applicable,using the fair value of the individual sec
urities as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the transfer(s) occurred.Current
 financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Long-term financial liabilities include the Company's long-termdebt,
 which are recorded on the balance sheet at issuance price and adjusted for unamortized discounts or premiums and debt issuance costs, andare
 being amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan. The estimated fair value of the Company's long-term debt is based primarily onreported market values, recently completed market transactions, and estimates based upon i
nterest rates, maturities, and credit.42

Table of ContentsReceivables, Net
Receivables
 consist primarily of vendor, reinsurance, credit card incentive, third-party pharmacy and other receivables. Vendor receivables includecoupons,
 volume rebates or other purchase discounts. Balances are generally presented on a gross basis, separate from any related payable due.In
 certain circumstances, these receivables may be settled against the related payable to that vendor, in which case the receivables are presentedon
 a net basis. Reinsurance receivables are held by the Company’s wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and primarily represent amountsceded
 through reinsurance arrangements gross of the amounts assumed under reinsurance, which are presented within other current liabilities inthe
 consolidated  balance  sheets.  Credit  card  incentive  receivables  primarily  represent  amounts  earned  under  the  co-branded  credit  cardarrangement
 in  the  U.S.  Third-party  pharmacy  receivables  generally  relate  to  amounts  due  from  members’  insurers.  Other  receivables  primarilyconsist of amounts due from governmental entities, mostly tax-related items.
Receivables
 are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance is based on historical experience and application of the specificidentification method. Write-offs of receivables were immaterial for fiscal years 
2018 , 2017 , and 2016 . Merchandise Inventories
Merchandise inventories consist of the followi
ng: 
2018   2017 United States
$ 8,081  $7,091 Canada
1,189  1,040 Other Inte
rnational1,770  1,703 Merchandise inventories
$ 11,040   $9,834 Merchandise inventories
 are stated at the lower of cost or market. U.S. merchandise inventories are valued by the cost method of accounting, usingthe
 last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matchingcurrent
 costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the projected annual effect of inflation ordeflation,
 and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end, after actual inflation or deflation rates and inventory levels forthe
 year  have  been  determined.  Canadian  and  Other  International  merchandise  inventories  are  predominantly  valued  using  the  cost  and  retailinventory methods, respectively, using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.
As
 of September  2, 2018 and September 3, 2017 ,  U.S. merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower ofcost or market principle. Due to net deflation, a benefit of 
$64 was recorded to merchandise costs in 2016 . The
 Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales, using estimates based onthe Company’s experie
nce. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourthfiscal
 quarters. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towardsearning those rebates, provided that they are probabl
e and reasonably estimable.Property and Equipment
Property
 and equipment are stated at cost. In general, new building additions are classified into components, each with an estimated useful life,generally 
five to fifty years for buildings and improvements  and three to twenty years  for  equipment  and fixtures.  Depreciation  and amortizationexpense is computed using the straight-line metho
d over estimated useful lives or the lease term, if shorter. Leasehold improvements made after thebeginning of the initial le
ase term are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of43

Table of Contentsthe asset or
 the remaining term of the initial lease plus any renewals that are reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are made.The
 Company  capitalizes  certain  computer  software  and  software  development  costs  incurred  in  developing  or  obtaining  computer  software  forinternal
 use.  These  costs  are  included  in  equipment  and  fixtures  and  amortized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  estimated  useful  lives  of  thesoftware, generally 
three to seven years. Repair
 and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. Expenditures for remodels, refurbishments and improvements that add to or changethe
 way  an  asset  functions  or  that  extend  the  useful  life  are  capitalized.  Assets  that  were  removed  during  the  remodel,  refurbishment  orimprovement are retired. Assets classified as held-for-sale at the end of 
2018 and 2017 were immaterial. The
 Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment on an annual basis, when relocating or closing a facility, or when events or changes incircumstances
 may indicate the carrying amount of the asset group, generally an individual warehouse, may not be fully recoverable. For assetgroups
 held and used, including warehouses to be relocated, the carrying value of the asset group is considered recoverable when the estimatedfuture
 undiscounted cash flows generated from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group exceed the respective carrying value. In theevent
 that the carrying value is not considered recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized for the asset group to be held and used equal to theexcess
 of the carrying value above the estimated fair value of the asset group. For asset groups classified as held-for-sale (disposal group), thecarrying
 value is compared to the disposal group’s fair value less costs to sell. The Company estimates fair value by obtaining market appraisalsfrom third party brokers or using other valuation techniques. There were no impairment charg
es recognized in 2018 , 2017 or 2016 . Insurance/Self-Insurance Liabilities
The
 Company is predominantly self-insured for employee health care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’and
 officers’ liability, vehicle liability, and inventory loss. Insurance coverage is maintained in certain instances to limit the exposure arising fromcatastrophic
 events.  It  uses  different  mechanisms  including  a  wholly-owned  captive  insurance  subsidiary  (the  captive)  and  participates  in  areinsurance
 program.  Liabilities  associated  with  the  risks  that  are  retained  by  the  Company  are  not  discounted  and  are  estimated,  in  part,  byconsidering
 historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for theseliabilities
 could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. At the end of 2018 and 2017 
,  these insurance liabilities were $ 1,148 and  $ 1,059 in  the aggregate, respectively, and were included in accrued salaries and benefits andother current liabilities in the consolid
ated balance sheets, classified based on their nature.The
 captive receives direct premiums, which are netted against the Company’s premium costs in selling, general and administrative expenses, inthe
 consolidated  statements  of  income.  The  captive  participates  in  a  reinsurance  program  that  includes  other  third-party  participants.  Thereinsuran
ce agreement is one year in duration, and new agreements are entered into by each participant at their discretion at the commencement ofthe
 next calendar year. The participant agreements and practices of the reinsurance program limit a participating members’ individual risk. Incomestatement
 adjustments related to the reinsurance program and related impacts to the consolidated balance sheets are recognized as informationbecomes known. In the event the Company leaves the reinsurance program, the Company retains its primary obligation to the policyholders for prior
activity.
Derivatives
The
 Company is exposed to foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. It manages these fluctuations, in part,through
 the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on knownfuture
 expenditures  denominated  in  a  non-functional  foreign-currency.  The  contracts  relate  primarily  to  U.S.  dollar  merchandise  inventoryexpenditures made by the Company’s internati
onal subsidiaries with functional currencies other44

Table of Contentsthan
 the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The Company seeks to mitigate risk with the use ofthese
 contracts and does not intend to engage in speculative transactions. Some of these contracts contain credit-risk-related contingent featuresthat
 require settlement of outstanding contracts upon certain triggering events. At the end of 2018 and 2017 ,  the aggregate fair value amounts ofderivative
 instruments  in a net liability position and the amount  needed to settle the  instruments immediately if the  credit-risk-related contingentfeatures
 were triggered were immaterial. The aggregate notional amounts of open, unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were $ 717 and $637 
at the end of 2018 and 2017 ,  respectively. See Note 3 for information on the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts at theend of 
2018 and 2017 . The
 unrealized gains or losses recognized in interest income and other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income relating to thenet changes in the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exch
ange contracts were immaterial in 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 . The
 Company is exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electricity and natural gas, which it seeks to partially mitigate through theuse
 of  fixed-price  contracts  for  certain  of  its  warehouses  and  other  facilities,  primarily  in  the  U.S.  and  Canada.  The  Company  also  enters  intovariable-priced
 contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for its gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet thecharacterist
ics of derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the “normal purchases or normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance andrequire no mark-to-market adjustment.
Foreign Currency
The
 functional currencies of the Company’s international subsidiaries are the local currency of the country in which the subsidiary is located. Assetsand
 liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments are recorded inaccumulated
 other  comprehensive  loss.  Revenues  and  expenses  of  the  Company’s  consolidated  foreign  operations  are  translated  at  averageexchange rates pre
vailing during the year.The
 Company recognizes foreign-currency transaction gains and losses related to revaluing or settling monetary assets and liabilities denominatedin currencies other than the functional currency in interest income an
d other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Generally,these
 include  the  U.S.  dollar  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  the  U.S.  dollar  payables  of  consolidated  subsidiaries  revalued  to  their  functionalcurrency.
 Also included are realized foreign-currency  gains or losses from settlements  of forward foreign-exchange contracts.  These items wereimmaterial fo
r 2018 and 2017 and resulted in net gains of $38 for 2016 . Revenue Recognition
The
 Company  generally  recognizes  sales,  which  include  gross  shipping  fees  where  applicable,  net  of  returns,  at  the  time  the  member  takespossession
 of  merchandise  or  receives  services.  When  the  Company  collects  payments  from  members  prior  to  the  transfer  of  ownership  ofmerchandise
 or the performance of services, the amounts received are generally recorded as deferred sales, included in other current liabilities inthe
 consolidated  balance  sheets,  until  the  sale  or  service  is  completed.  The  Company  reserves  for  estimated  sales  returns  based  on  historicaltrends
 in merchandise returns and reduces sales and merchandise costs accordingly. The sales returns reserve is based on an estimate of the netrealizable
 value of merchandise inventories expected to be returned. Amounts collected from members for sales or value added taxes are recordedon a net basis.
Generally,
 when Costco is the primary obligor, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, can influenceproduct
 or service specifications, or has several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. It otherwise records the netamounts earned, which is reflected in net sales.
The
 Company accounts for membership fee revenue, net of refunds, on a deferred basis, ratably over the one-year membership. The Company'sExecutive members qualify for a 
2% reward on qualified purchases45

Table of Contents(up
 to a maximum reward of approximately $ 1,000 per  year), which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses. The Company accounts for thisreward
 as a reduction in sales. The sales reduction and corresponding liability (classified as accrued member rewards in the consolidated balancesheets)
 are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non-redemptions, based on historical data. The net reduction in sales was $1,394 
, $ 1,281 , and $ 1,172 in 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively. Merchandise Costs
Merchandise
 costs consist of the purchase price or manufacturing costs of inventory sold, inbound and outbound shipping charges and all costsrelated
 to  the  Company’s  depot  operations,  including  freight  from  depots  to  selling  warehouses,  and  are  reduced  by  vendor  consideration.Merchandise costs also include salari
es, benefits, depreciation, and utilities in fresh foods and certain ancillary departments.Vendor Consideration
The
 Company  has  agreements  to  receive  funds  from  vendors  for  coupons  and  a  variety  of  other  programs.  These  programs  are  evidenced  bysigned
 agreements that are reflected in the carrying value of the inventory when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning the rebateor
 discount, and as a component of merchandise costs as the merchandise is sold. Other vendor consideration is generally recorded as a reductionof merchandise costs upon completion of contractual mileston
es, terms of the related agreement, or by another systematic approach.Selling, General and Ad
ministrative ExpensesSelling,
 general  and  administrative  expenses  consist  primarily  of  salaries,  benefits  and  workers’  compensation  costs  for  warehouse  employees(other than fresh foods departments and certain ancillary business
es) as well as all regional and home office employees, including buying personnel.Selling,
 general  and  administrative  expenses  also  include  substantially  all  building  and  equipment  depreciation,  stock  compensation  expense,utilities, credit and debit card processing fees, as well as oth
er operating costs incurred to support warehouse operations.Retirement Plans
The
 Company's 401(k) retirement plan is available to all U.S. employees who have completed 90 days of  employment. The plan allows participantsto
 make  wage  deferral  contributions,  a  portion  of  which  the  Company  matches.  In  addition,  the  Company  provides  each  eligible  participant  anannual
 discretionary contribution. The Company also has a defined contribution plan for Canadian employees and contributes a percentage of eachemployee's wages. Certain subsid
iaries in the Company's Other International operations have defined benefit and defined contribution plans that arenot
 material. Amounts expensed under all plans were $578 , $543 ,  and $489 for 2018 , 2017 ,  and 2016 ,  respectively, and are predominantlyincluded in selling, ge
neral and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.Stock-Based Compensation
Restricted
 stock units (RSUs) granted to employees generally vest over five years and allow for quarterly vesting of the pro-rata number of stock-based
 awards that would vest on the next anniversary of the grant date in the event of retirement or voluntary termination. Actual forfeitures arerecognized as they occur.
Compensation
 expense for stock-based awards is predominantly recognized using the straight-line method over the requisite service period for theentire
 award.  Awards  for  employees  and  non-employee  directors  provide  for  accelerated  vesting  of  a  portion  of  outstanding  shares  based  oncumulative
 years of service with the Company. Compensation expense for the accelerated shares is recognized upon achievement of the long-service
 term. The cumulative amount of compensation cost recognized at any point in time equals at least the portion of the grant-date fair value ofthe
 award that is vested at that date. The fair value of RSUs is calculated as the market value of the common stock on the measurement date lessthe present value of the expected dividends forgo
ne during the vesting period.46

Table of ContentsStock-based
 compensation expense is predominantly included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements ofincome. Certain stock-bas
ed compensation costs are capitalized or included in the cost of merchandise. See Note 7 for additional information on theCompany’s stock-ba
sed compensation plans.Leases
The
 Company  leases  land  and/or  buildings  at  warehouses  and  certain  other  office  and  distribution  facilities,  primarily  under  operating  leases.Operating leases
 expire at various dates through 2064 ,  with the exception of one lease in the U.K., which expires in 2151 .  These leases generallycontain
 one or more of the following options, which the Company can exercise at the end of the initial lease term: (a) renewal of the lease for adefined
 number of years at the then-fair market rental rate or rate stipulated in the lease agreement; (b) purchase of the property at the then-fairmarket value; or (c) right of first refusal in the event of a third-party purchase offer.
The
 Company accounts for its lease expense with free rent periods and step-rent provisions on a straight-line basis over the original term of thelease and
 any extension options that the Company more likely than not expects to exercise, from the date the Company has control of the property.Certain leases provide for periodic rental incre
ases based on price indices, or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume.The
 Company has capital leases for certain warehouse locations, expiring at various dates through 2059 .  Capital lease assets are included in landand
 buildings and improvements in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amortization expense on capital lease assets is recorded asdepreciation
 expense  and  is  included  in  selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses.  Capital  lease  liabilities  are  recorded  at  the  lesser  of  theestimated
 fair market value of the leased property or the net present value of the aggregate future minimum lease payments and are included inother
 current liabilities and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Interest on these obligations is included in interestexpense in the consolidated statements of income.
The Company
 records an asset and related financing obligation for the estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements where itis
 considered  the  owner  for  accounting  purposes,  to  the  extent  the  Company  is  involved  in  the  construction  of  the  building  or  structuralimprovements
 or has construction risk prior to commencement of a lease. Upon occupancy, the Company assesses whether these arrangementsqualify
 for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance. If the Company continues to be the deemed owner, it accounts for thearrangement as a financing lease.
The
 Company’s asset retirement obligations (ARO) primarily relate to leasehold improvements that at the end of a lease must be removed. Theseobligations
 are recorded as a liability with an offsetting asset at the inception of the lease term based upon the estimated fair value of the costs toremove
 the leasehold improvements. These liabilities are accreted over time to the projected future value of the obligation using the Company’sincremental
 borrowing rate. The ARO assets are depreciated using the same depreciation method as the leasehold improvement assets and areincluded
 with buildings and improvements. Estimated ARO liabilities associated with these leases were immaterial at the end of 2018 and 2017 , respectively, and are included in other li
abilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.Preopening Expenses
Preopening
 expenses include costs for startup operations related to new warehouses and relocations, developments in new international markets,new manufacturing and distribution facil
ities, and expansions at existing warehouses and are expensed as incurred.Income Taxes
The
 Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future taxconsequences attributed to differences betwee

 carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credits and loss carry-forwards. Deferred taxassets
 and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differencesand
 carry-forwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized inincome
 in  the  period  that  includes  the  enactment  date.  A  valuation  allowance  is  established  when  necessary  to  reduce  deferred  tax  assets  toamounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized.
The
 timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions requires significant judgment. Thebenefits
 of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements only after determining a more-likely-than-notprobability
 that  the  uncertain  tax  positions  will  withstand  challenge  from  tax  authorities.  When  facts  and  circumstances  change,  the  Companyreassesses these probabilities and records a
ny changes as appropriate.Net Income per Common Share Attributable to Costco
The
 computation  of  basic  net  income  per  share  uses  the  weighted  average  number  of  shares  that  were  outstanding  during  the  period.  Thecomputation
 of diluted net income per share uses the weighted average number of shares in the basic net income per share calculation plus thenumber
 of common shares that would be issued assuming vesting of all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding using the treasury stockmethod for shares subject to RSUs.
Stock Repurchase Programs
Repurchased
 shares of common stock are retired,  in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The par value of repurchasedshares
 is deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par value is deducted by allocation to additional paid-in capital andretained
 earnings. The amount allocated to additional paid-in capital is the current value of additional paid-in capital per share outstanding and isapplied to the number of shares repurchased. Any remaini
ng amount is allocated to retained earnings. See Note 6 for additional information.Recent Accounting Pronoun
cements AdoptedIn March 2016, 
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09 related to the accounting forshare-based payment transactions. The guidanc
e relates to income taxes, forfeitures, and minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. The newstandard was
 effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. TheCompany
 adopted this guidance at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal year 2018. As a result, the Company recognized a net tax benefit infiscal
 2018 of $ 33 as part of its income tax provision in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, which includes the impact of thelower
 tax  rate  from  the  2017  Tax  Act.  Previously,  tax  benefits  associated  with  the  release  of  employee  RSUs  were  reflected  in  equity.  Theseamounts are now reflected as
 cash flows from operations instead of cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flowson
 a prospective basis. Adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements ofcash flows, or related disclosures.
Recent Accounting Pronounceme
nts Not Yet AdoptedIn
 May  2014,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  2014-09  providing  for  changes  in  the  recognition  of  revenue  from  contracts  with  customers.  The  guidanceconverges
 the  requirements  for  reporting  revenue  and  requires  disclosures  sufficient  to  describe  the  nature,  amount,  timing,  and  uncertainty  ofrevenue and
 cash flows arising from these contracts. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginningafter
 December  15,  2017.  The  Company  plans  to  adopt  this  guidance  at  the  beginning  of  its  first  quarter  of  fiscal  2019,  using  the  modifiedretrospective
 approach through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings. The Company has substantially completed its assessment ofthe new
 standard and it does not believe the impacts to be material to the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company continues toevaluate the disclosure requirements related to the ne
w standard.48

Table of ContentsIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 which will require recogn
ition on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by leaseswith
 terms  greater  than  twelve  months.  The  new  standard  is  effective  for  fiscal  years  and  interim  periods  within  those  years  beginning  afterDecember
 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company plans to adopt this guidance at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal 2020 andplans
 to utilize the transition option which does not require application of the guidance to comparative periods in the year of adoption. While theCompany
 continues  to  evaluate  this  standard  and  the  effect  on  related  disclosures,  the  primary  effect  of  adoption  will  be  recording  right-of-useassets
 and corresponding lease obligations for current operating leases. The adoption is expected to have a material impact on the Company'sconsolidated
 balance  sheets,  but  not  on  the  consolidated  statements  of  income  or  cash  flows.  Additionally,  the  Company  is  in  the  process  ofreviewing
 current  accounting  policies,  changes  to  business  processes,  systems  and  controls  to  support  adoption  of  the  new  standard,  whichincludes implementing a new l
ease accounting system.Note 2—Investments

 price is equal to the greater of 100% of  the principal amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments ofprincipal
 and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain events, as defined by the terms of the Senior Notes, the holder has the right to requirethe
 Company to purchase this security at a price of 101% of  the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the event. Intereston all outstanding long-term debt is payab

$0.57 per share, which is payable on November 23, 20 18.Stock Repurchase Programs
The Company’s stock repurchase program is conducted under a 
$4,000 authorizat ion by the Board of Directors, which expires April 17, 2019 . As of the

Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation Plans
The
 Company  grants  stock-based  compensation  primarily  to  employees  and  non-employee  directors.  RSU  grants  to  all  executive  officers  areperformance-based.
 Through a series of shareholder approvals, there have been amended and restated plans and new provisions implemented bythe
 Company. RSUs are subject to quarterly vesting upon retirement or voluntary termination. Employees who attain certain years of service withthe
 Company receive shares under accelerated vesting provisions on the annual vesting date rather than upon retirement. The Seventh Restated2002 Stock
 Incentive Plan (Seventh Plan) is the Company’s only stock-based compensation plan with shares available for grant at the end of 2018 . Each
 share issued in respect of stock awards is counted as 1.75 shares  toward the limit of shares made available under the Seventh Plan. TheSeventh
 Plan  authorized  the  issuance  of 23,500,000 shares  ( 13,429,000 RSUs)  of  common  stock  for  future  grants  in  addition  to  the  sharesauthorized
 under  the  previous  plan.  The  Company  issues  new  shares  of  common  stock  upon  vesting  of  RSUs.  Shares  for  vested  RSUs  aregenerally delivered to participa
nts annually, net of statutory withholding taxes.Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
RSUs
 granted to employees and to non-employee directors generally vest over five and three years,  respectively.  Additionally, the terms  of theRSUs,
 including performance-based awards, provide for accelerated vesting for employees and non-employee directors who have attained 25 ormore
 and five or more years of service with the Company, respectively. Recipients are not entitled to vote or receive dividends on non-vested andundelivered shares. At the end of 
2018 , 8,313,000 shares were available to be granted as RS Us under the Seventh Plan.53

Table of ContentsThe following awards were outstand

7,246,000 time-based RSUs that vest upon continued employme nt over specified periods of time;•
332,000 performance-based  RSUs,  of  which 205,000 were  granted  to  executive  officers  subject  to  the  certification  of  the  attainment  ofspecified
 performance targets for 2018 .  This certification occurred in October 2018 ,  at which time a portion vested as a result of the longservice of all executive officers. The remaining awards vest upon co

 December 2017, the 2017 Tax Act was signed into law. Except for certain provisions, the 2017 Tax Act is effective for tax years beginning on orafter
 January 1, 2018. The Company is a fiscal-year taxpayer, so most provisions will become effective for fiscal 2019, including limitations on theCompany’s
 ability  to  claim  foreign  tax  credits,  repeal  of  the  domestic  manufacturing  deduction,  and  limitations  on  certain  business  deductions.Provisions
 with  significant  impacts  that  were  effective  starting  in  the  second  quarter  of  fiscal  2018  and  throughout  the  remainder  of  fiscal  2018included:
 a  decrease  in  the  U.S.  federal  income  tax  rate,  remeasurement  of  certain  net  deferred  tax  liabilities,  and  a  transition  tax  on  deemedrepatriation
 of certain foreign earnings. The decrease in the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to  21.0%  resulted  in a blended rate for theCompany of  
25.6%  for fiscal 2018. The reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate is as follows:

 fiscal 2018, the Company recognized a net tax expense of  $19 related to the 2017 Tax Act. This expense included $ 142  for the estimatedtax
 on deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, and $ 43  for the reduction in foreign tax credits and other immaterial items, largely offset by a taxbenefit of $ 
166  for the provisional remeasurement of certain deferred tax liabilities. These items were predominantly recorded in the second quarteras
 provisional amounts and reflect the Company's current interpretations and estimates that it believes are reasonable. As the Company continuesto
 evaluate the 2017 Tax Act and available data,  it anticipates that  adjustments  may be made in future  periods up to and including the secondquarter of fiscal 2019 in accordance with Staff Accounting B
ulletin 118.In
 fiscal 2018, we also recognized net tax benefits of $ 76 , which was largely driven by the adoption of an accounting standard related to stock-based
 compensation and other immaterial net benefits. In fiscal 2017, the Company ’  s provision for income taxes was favorably impacted by a nettax benefit of $ 
104 , primarily55

 deferred tax accounts at the end of fiscal 2018 and 2017 include  deferred income tax assets of $316 and $254 ,  respectively, included in otherassets; and deferred income tax liabilities of 
$317 and $312 , respectively, included in other liabil ities.The
 Company no longer considers current fiscal 2018 and  future earnings of our non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries to be permanently reinvestedand has recorded the estimated
 incremental foreign withholding (net of available foreign tax credits) on current fiscal year earnings and state incometaxes
 payable  assuming  a  hypothetical  repatriation  to  the  U.S.  The  Company  continues  to  consider  undistributed  earnings  of  certain  non-U.S.consolidated subsidiari
es prior to fiscal 2018, which totaled $ 3,071 , to be indefinitely reinvested an d has not provided for withholding or state taxes.A reconciliation of the beginni

des tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timingof
 such deductibility. At the end of 2018 and 2017 ,  these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other thaninterest
 and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment ofcash
 to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income taxrate in future periods is 
$32 and $29 at the end of 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Accrued
 interest  and  penalties  related  to  income  tax  matters  are  classified  as  a  component  of  income  tax  expense.  Interest  and  penaltiesrecognized during 
2018 and 2017 and accrued at the end of each respective period were n ot material.56

Table of ContentsThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdict
ions in the United States and in several foreign countries. Some audits may conclude in thenext
 12 months and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical toestimate the effect,
 if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection withthe
 audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits inthe next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign jurisdicti
ons.With
 few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2014. The Company iscurrently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 20
07 to present. No other examinations are believed to be material.Note 9—Net Income per Common and Common Equivalent Share

 Company is involved in a number of claims, proceedings and litigation arising from its business and property ownership. In accordance withapplicable
 accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters reach a stage where theypresent loss continge
ncies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. TheCompany
 monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable indemnificationarrangements
 concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. As of the date ofthis
 Report, the Company has recorded an immaterial accrual with respect to one matter described below, in addition to other immaterial accrualsfor
 matters not described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish anaccrual,
 but will continue to monitor the matter for developments that will make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. Ineach
 case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where noaccrual
 has  been  recorded,  the  possible  loss  or  range  of  loss  (including  any  loss  in  excess  of  the  accrual)  cannot,  in  the  Company's  view,  bereasonably estimated because, among other things:
 (i) the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified; (ii) the legal and/or factualtheories are not well developed; an
d/or (iii) the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties.The
 Company is a defendant in a class action alleging violation of California Wage Order 7-2001 for failing to provide seating to member serviceassistants
 who act as greeters and exit attendants in the Company’s California warehouses. Canela  v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. (Case  No.5:13-cv-03598, N.D. Cal. filed July
 1, 2013). The complaint seeks relief under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys’ fees.The Company
 filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. The plaintiff has since indicated that exit attendants are no longer asubject of the litigation. The action in the district court

 been  stayed  pending  review  by  the  Ninth  Circuit  of  the  order  certifying  a  class.  On  September  6,  2018,  counsel  claiming  to  represent  anemployee
 notified the California Labor and Workforce Development agency of an intention to bring similar claims concerning Costco employeesengaged at member services counters.
On
 November 23, 2016, the Company’s Canadian subsidiary received from the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care a request for aninspection
 and information concerning compliance with the anti-rebate provisions in the Ontario Drug Benefit Act and the Drug Interchangeabilityand
 Dispensing Fee Act. The Company is seeking to cooperate with the request. The Ministry has indicated it has reason to believe the Companyreceived payments in violation of these laws a
nd is seeking disgorgement of these sums.In
 December  2017,  the  United  States  Judicial  Panel  on  Multidistrict  Litigation  consolidated  numerous  cases  filed  against  various  defendants  bycounties,
 cities, hospitals, Native American tribes and third-party payors concerning the impacts of opioid abuse. In  re National Prescription OpiateLitigation 
(MDL No. 2804) (N.D. Ohio).  Included are federal court cases that name the Company, including actions filed by a number of counties andcities
 in Michigan, New Jersey and Ohio, and a third-party payor in Ohio. Similar cases that name the Company have been filed in state courts inNew Jersey and Oklahoma. The Company is defend
ing these matters.In
 November 2016 and September 2017, the Company received notices of violation from the Connecticut Department of Energy and EnvironmentalProtection
 regarding hazardous waste practices at its Connecticut warehouses, primarily concerning unsalable pharmaceuticals. The Company isseeking to cooperate concerning the resol
ution of these notices.The
 Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effecton
 the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of thematters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an indiv
idual fiscal quarter.58

Table of ContentsNote 11—Segment Reporting
The
 Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Japan,Korea,
 Australia,  Spain,  Iceland,  and  France  and  through  a  majority-owned  subsidiary  in  Taiwan.  Reportable  segments  are  largely  based  onmanagement’s
 organization  of  the  operating  segments  for  operational  decisions  and  assessments  of  financial  performance,  which  considersgeographic
 locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and expenses havebeen
 eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income. Certain operating expenses, predominantly stock-based compensation, incurredon
 behalf of the Company's Canadian and Other International operations, are included in the U.S. operations because those costs generally comeunder the responsibility of U.S. management.

Item 9A—Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our
 disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) aredesigned
 to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,summarized,
 and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and to ensure thatinformation
 required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, toallow
 timely decisions regarding disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), with assistance from othermembers
 of management, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 2, 2018 and, based on theirevaluation,
 have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date due to a material weakness in internalcontrol over financial reporting, described be
low.Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing a
nd maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) underthe
 Exchange  Act.  Our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financialreporting
 and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  U.S.  GAAP  and  includes  those  policies  andprocedures
 that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositionsof
 our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements inaccordance
 with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  and  that  our  receipts  and  expenditures  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  withappropriate
 authorizations;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use  ordisposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financi
al statements.Because of
 its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation ofeffectiven
ess for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree ofcompliance with the policies or proced
ures may deteriorate.Under 
the supervision of and with the participation of our management, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reportingas of September 2,
 2018, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in InternalControl 
— Integrated  Framework  (2013).  A material  weakness is a deficiency,  or a combination  of deficiencies,  in internal  control  over financialreporting,
 such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be preventedor detected on a timely basis.
We
 identified  a  material  weakness  in  internal  control  related  to  ineffective  information  technology  general  controls  (ITGCs)  in  the  areas  of  useraccess
 and  program  change-management  over  certain  information  technology  (IT)  systems  that  support  the  Company’s  financial  reportingprocesses.
 Our  business  process  controls  (automated  and  manual)  that  are  dependent  on  the  affected  ITGCs  were  also  deemed  ineffectivebecause
 they  could  have  been  adversely  impacted.  We  believe  that  these  control  deficiencies  were  a  result  of:  IT  control  processes  lackingsufficient
 documentation such that the successful operation of ITGCs was overly dependent upon knowledge and actions of certain individuals withIT
 expertise, which led to failures resulting from changes in IT personnel; insufficient training of IT personnel on the importance of ITGCs; and risk-assessment processes
 inadequate to identify and assess changes in IT environments that could impact internal control over financial reporting. Thematerial weakness did not result in any identifi
ed misstatements62

 the financial statements, and there were no changes to previously released financial results. Based on this material weakness, the Company’smanagement concluded that at September 2, 2018, the Compa
ny’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective.The
 Company’s  independent  registered  public  accounting  firm,  KPMG  LLP  has  issued  an  adverse  audit  report  on  the  effectiveness  of  theCompany’s internal control over financia
l reporting as of September 2, 2018, which appears in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Following
 identification of the material weakness and prior to filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we completed substantive procedures for theyear
 ended September 2, 2018. Based on these procedures, management believes that our consolidated financial statements included in this Form10-K
 have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  U.S.  GAAP.  Our  CEO  and  CFO  have  certified  that,  based  on  their  knowledge,  the  financialstatements,
 and  other  financial  information  included  in  this  Form  10-K,  fairly  present  in  all  material  respects  the  financial  condition,  results  ofoperatio
ns and cash flows of the Company as of, and for, the periods presented in this Form 10-K. KPMG LLP has issued an unqualified opinion onour financial statements, which is included i
n Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Remediation
Management
 has been implementing and continues to implement measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the materialweakness
 are  remediated,  such  that  these  controls  are  designed,  implemented,  and  operating  effectively.  The  remediation  actions  include:  (i)creating
 and  filling  an  IT  Compliance  Oversight  function;  (ii)  developing  a  training  program  addressing  ITGCs  and  policies,  including  educatingcontrol
 owners concerning the principles and requirements of each control, with a focus on those related to user access and change-managementover
 IT systems impacting financial reporting; (iii) developing and maintaining documentation underlying ITGCs to promote knowledge transfer uponpersonnel
 and  function  changes;  (iv)  developing  enhanced  risk  assessment  procedures  and  controls  related  to  changes  in  IT  systems;  (v)implementing
 an  IT  management  review  and  testing  plan  to  monitor  ITGCs  with  a  specific  focus  on  systems  supporting  our  financial  reportingprocesses; and (vi) enhanced quarterly reporting on the remedi
ation measures to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.We
 believe that these actions will remediate the material weakness. The weakness will not be considered remediated, however, until the applicablecontrols
 operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. Weexpect that the remediation of this material weakness will be comp
leted prior to the end of fiscal 2019.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Except
 for the material weakness identified during the quarter, as of September 2, 2018, there have been no other changes in our internal controlover
 financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 thathave materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s i
nternal control over financial reporting./s/    W. C
