translational currency.  
 
Consumer Healt h

counter (OTC) products .  Major contributors to growth  in OTC were TYLENOL and MOTRIN analgesic s, as well 
as upper respiratory products  and digestive health products in the international markets.   Additionally, Skin 
Health/Beauty adjusted operational growth was primarily driven by NEUTROGENA outside the U.S. Growth was 
partially offset by Oral Care in the international markets . 
 
Pharmaceu tical

SUSTENNA/XEPLION  and INVEGA  TRINZA/TREVICTA (paliperidone palmitate), long -acting, injectable 
atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults.   This growth was parti ally offset by declines 
in sales of  REMICADE (infliximab), a biologic approved for the treatment of several  immune -mediated 
inflammatory diseases , IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) , an oral, once daily therapy approved for use in treating certain 
B-cell malignancies, a type of blood or lymph node cancer , and ZYTIGA (abiratone acetate), an oral, once  daily

FULL -YEAR 2023 GUIDANCE:  
Johnson & Johnson does not provide GAAP financial measures on a forward -looking basis because the company 
is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, unusual gains and 
losses, acquisition -related expenses and p urchase accounting fair value adjustments without unreasonable 
effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material to Johnson & Johnson's 
results computed in accordance with GAAP.

Acquisition, integration and divestiture related for 2022 primarily includes costs related to the Abiomed acquisition.  Acquisition, integration and divestiture related for 2021 
primarily includes the gain on the divestiture of two Pharmaceutical brands outside of the U.S. 
European Medical Device Regulation (MDR) costs represent one-time compliance costs for the Company’s previously registered products. MDR is a replacement of the existing 
European Medical Devices Directive regulatory framework, and manufacturers of currently marketed medical devices were required to comply with EU MDR beginning in May 
2021. The Company considers the adoption of EU MDR to be a significant one-time regulatory change and is not indicative of on-going operations.  The Company has excluded 
only external third-party regulatory and consulting costs from its MedTech operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing 
performance which is expected to be completed during 2024.
The tax impact related to special item adjustments reflects the current and deferred income taxes associated with the above pre-tax special items in arriving at adjusted 
earnings.COVID-19 Vaccine related costs include remaining commitments and obligations, including external manufacturing network exit costs and required clinical trial expenses, 
associated with the Company's modification of its COVID-19 vaccine research program and manufacturing capacity to levels that meet all remaining customer contractual 
requirements.
