Financial and Other Business Information
See
 the Summary of Business Segment Data and Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information, including revenuesand earnings from operations, for each of our business segments.
Intellectual Property
We own numerous patents and have
 licenses for the use of patents owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture. In additionto
 owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and from third parties. For example, the U.S. governmenthas
 licenses in our patents that are developed in performance of government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventionscovered
 by such patents for government purposes. Unpatented research, development and engineering skills, as well as certain trademarks, tradesecrets,
 and  other  intellectual  property  rights,  also  make  an  important  contribution  to  our  business.  While  our  intellectual  property  rights  in  theaggregate
 are  important  to  the  operation  of  each  of  our  businesses,  we  do  not  believe  that  our  business  would  be  materially  affected  by  theexpiration of any particular intellectual pro
perty right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement.Non-U.S. Revenues
See Note 
21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding non-U.S. revenues.Research and Development
Research
 and development (R&D) expenditures involve experimentation, design, development and related test activities for defense systems, newand
 derivative  jet  aircraft  including  both  commercial  and  military,  advanced  space  and  other  company-sponsored  product  development.  R&Dexpenditures are expensed as incurred i
ncluding amounts allocable as reimbursable overhead costs on U.S. government contracts.Our total research and development expense, net amounted to 
$3.2 billion , $4.6 billion and $3.3 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Research
 and development costs also include bid and proposal efforts related to government products and services, as well as costs incurred inexcess
 of  amounts  estimated  to  be  recoverable  under  cost-sharing  research  and  development  agreements.  Bid  and  proposal  costs  were $288 million 
, $311 million and $286 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. 2

The
 commercial  jet  aircraft  market  and  the  airline  industry  remain  extremely  competitive.  We  face  aggressive  international  competitors  who  areintent
 on  increasing  their  market  share,  such  as  Airbus,  Embraer  and  Bombardier,  and  other  entrants  from  Russia,  China  and  Japan.  We  arefocused
 on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts. We intend to continue to compete with other airplane manufacturers byproviding customers with greater value products.
BDS
 faces  strong  competition  in  all  market  segments,  primarily  from  Lockheed  Martin  Corporation,  Northrop  Grumman  Corporation,  RaytheonCompany,
 General Dynamics Corporation and SpaceX. Non-U.S. companies such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group continue to build a strategicpresence
 in the U.S. market by strengthening  their North American operations and partnering with U.S. defense companies. In addition, certaincompetitors
 have occasionally formed teams with other competitors to address specific customer requirements. BDS expects the trend of strongcompetition to continue into 
2018 . The
 commercial  and  defense  services  market  is  an  extremely  challenging  landscape  made  up  of  many  of  the  same  strong  U.S.  and  non-U.S.competitors
 facing BCA and BDS along with other competitors in those markets. BGS leverages our extensive services network offering productsand
 services which span the life cycle of our defense and commercial airplane programs: training, fleet services and logistics, maintenance andengineering,
 modifications  and  upgrades  -  as  well  as  the  daily  cycle  of  gate-to-gate  operations.  BGS  expects  the  market  to  remain  highlycompetitive in 2018, and intends to grow market share by leverag
ing a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity.Regulatory Matters
Our
 businesses are heavily regulated in most of our markets. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but notlimited
 to  all  of  the  branches  of  the  U.S.  military,  NASA,  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  and  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security.Similar government authorities exist in our non-U.S. markets.
Government Contracts. 
The U.S.  government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, as wellas
 for default based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If any of our U.S. government contracts were to be terminated forconvenience,
 we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of ourgovernment contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S.
3

Table of Contentsgovernment
 would pay only for the work that has been accepted and could require us to pay the difference between the original contract price andthe
 cost  to  re-procure  the  contract  items,  net  of  the  work  accepted  from  the  original  contract.  The  U.S.  government  can  also  hold  us  liable  fordamages resulting from the default.
Commercial
 Aircraft. In  the U.S., our commercial aircraft products are required to comply with FAA regulations governing production and qualitysystems,
 airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. Outside the U.S., similar requirements existfor
 airworthiness, installation and operational approvals. These requirements are generally administered by the national aviation authorities of eachcountry and, in the case of Europe, coordinated by the Europe
an Joint Aviation Authorities.Environmental. 
We  are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including thedischarge,
 treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We continually assess our compliance status andmanagement
 of  environmental  matters  to  ensure  our  operations  are  in  compliance  with  all  applicable  environmental  laws  and  regulations.Investigation,
 remediation, and operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal,recurring
 part of our operations. These costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the U.S. government. It is reasonably possible thatcosts
 incurred to ensure continued environmental compliance could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cashflows
 if  additional  work  requirements  or  more  stringent  clean-up  standards  are  imposed  by  regulators,  new  areas  of  soil,  air  and  groundwatercontamination are discovered and/or expa
nsions of work scope are prompted by the results of investigations.A Potentially Responsibl
e Party (PRP) has joint and several liability under existing U.S. environmental laws. Where we have been designated a PRPby
 the Environmental Protection Agency or a state environmental agency, we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the full costof
 remediating contamination at our facilities or former facilities or at third-party sites. If we were required to fully fund the remediation of a site forwhich
 we were originally assigned a partial share, the statutory framework would allow us to pursue rights to contribution from other PRPs. Foradditional information relating to env
ironmental contingencies, see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Non-U.S.
 Sales. Our  non-U.S.  sales  are  subject  to  both  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  governmental  regulations  and  procurement  policies  and  practices,including
 regulations relating to import-export control, investment, exchange controls, anti-corruption, and repatriation of earnings. Non-U.S. salesare also subject to varying currency, political and eco
nomic risks.Raw Materials, Parts, and Subassemblies
We
 are  highly  dependent  on  the  availability  of  essential  materials,  parts  and  subassemblies  from  our  suppliers  and  subcontractors.  The  mostimportant
 raw materials required for our aerospace products are aluminum (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions), titanium (sheet, plate, forgingsand
 extrusions) and composites (including carbon and boron). Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification ofthe sources could take a year or
 more. Many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basiswith a number of companies.
Suppliers
We
 are dependent upon the ability of a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance specifications, qualitystandards
 and delivery schedules at our anticipated costs. While we maintain an extensive qualification and performance surveillance system tocontrol
 risk  associated  with  such  reliance  on  third  parties,  failure  of  suppliers  or  subcontractors  to  meet  commitments  could  adversely  affectproduction schedules and program/contract profitabi
lity, thereby jeopardizing our ability4

Table of Contentsto fulfill commitments to our customers. We are also dependent on the availability of energy so
urces, such as electricity, at affordable prices.Seasonality

Table of ContentsOur Commercial Airplanes and Global Services businesses depend heavily on commercial airlines, and are subject to unique risks.
Market
 conditions  have  a  significant  impact  on  demand  for  our  commercial  aircraft  and  related  services. The  commercial  aircraft  market  ispredominantly
 driven  by  long-term  trends  in  airline  passenger  and  cargo  traffic.  The  principal  factors  underlying  long-term  traffic  growth  aresustained
 economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further influencedby
 airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological advances, price andother
 competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, epidemics and environmental regulations. Traditionally, the airline industry has been cyclical andvery
 competitive  and  has  experienced  significant  profit  swings  and  constant  challenges  to  be  more  cost  competitive.  In  addition,  availability  offinancing
 to non-U.S. customers depends in part on the Export-Import Bank of the United States being fully operational. Significant deterioration inthe
 global economic environment, the airline industry generally, or the financial stability of one or more of our major customers could result in fewernew
 orders for aircraft or services, or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual orders and/or payments to us, which couldresult in
 lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog. In addition, because our commercial aircraft backlogconsists
 of  aircraft  scheduled  for  delivery  over  a  period  of  several  years,  any  of  these  macroeconomic,  industry  or  customer  impacts  couldunexpectedly affect deliveries over a long p
eriod.We enter into
 firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses which could subject us to losses if we have cost overrunsor
 if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft  sales contracts are often entered into years before the aircraftare
 delivered. In order to help account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing generally consists of afixed
 amount as modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our revenue estimates are based oncurrent
 expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of our control. Escalation factors canfluctuate
 significantly  from  period  to  period.  Changes  in  escalation  amounts  can  significantly  impact  revenues  and  operating  margins  in  ourCommercial Airplanes business.
We
 derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines. We  can make no assurance that any customer willexercise
 purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us. In addition, fleet decisions,airline
 consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues andlimit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.
Our
 Commercial Airplanes business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy production system, achieve planned production ratetargets, successfully develop new aircraft or new derivative aircraft, and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standards.
The
 commercial aircraft business is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with U.S and non-U.S. suppliers, highly-skilled
 labor from thousands of employees and other partners, and stringent regulatory requirements and performance and reliability standards. Inaddition,
 the  introduction  of  new  aircraft  programs  and/or  derivatives,  such  as  the  787-10,  and  777X,  involves  increased  risks  associated  withmeeting
 development,  testing,  production  and  certification  schedules.  As  a  result,  our  ability  to  deliver  aircraft  on  time,  satisfy  regulatory  andcustomer requirements, and achieve or maintain, as applica
ble, program profitability is subject to significant risks.We
 must  minimize  disruption  caused  by  production  changes  and  achieve  productivity  improvements  in  order  to  meet  customer  demand  andmaintain our profitability. 
We  have plans to adjust production rates on several of our commercial aircraft programs, while at the same time engagingin significant ongoing dev
elopment and production of the 787-10 and 777X aircraft. In addition, we continue to seek opportunities to reduce the costsof building our aircraft, including workin
g with our suppliers to reduce supplier costs,6

Table of Contentsidentifying
 and  implementing  productivity  improvements,  and  optimizing  how  we  manage  inventory.  If  production  rate  changes  at  any  of  ourcommercial
 aircraft assembly facilities are delayed or create significant disruption to our production system, or if our suppliers cannot timely delivercomponents
 to  us  at  the  cost  and  rates  necessary  to  achieve  our  targets,  we  may  be  unable  to  meet  delivery  schedules  and/or  the  financialperformance of one or more of our programs may suffer.
Operational
 challenges  impacting  the  production  system  for  one  or  more  of  our  commercial  aircraft  programs  could  result  in  production  delaysand/or
 failure  to  meet  customer  demand  for  new  aircraft,  either  of  which  would  negatively  impact  our  revenues  and  operating  margins. Our commercial
 aircraft production system is extremely complex. Operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, failure to meetinternal
 performance plans, or delays or failures to achieve required regulatory certifications, could result in significant out-of-sequence work andincreased
 production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers, impacts to aircraft performance and/or increased warranty or fleet supportcosts.
If our
 commercial airplanes fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirements, we could face additional costs and/or lower revenues. Developing and
 manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatoryagencies, can be costly and technolo
gically challenging. These challenges are particularly significant with newer aircraft programs. Any failure of anyBoeing aircraft to satisfy performance or reliability requirements could result in d
isruption to our operations, higher costs and/or lower revenues.Changes
 in levels of U.S. government defense spending or overall acquisition priorities could negatively impact our financial positionand results of operations.
We
 derive  a  substantial  portion  of  our  revenue  from  the  U.S.  government,  primarily  from  defense  related  programs  with  the  United  StatesDepartment of Defense ( 
U.S. DoD ). Levels of U.S. defense spending are very difficult to predict and may be impacted by numero us factors such asthe
 political environment, U.S. foreign policy, macroeconomic conditions and the ability of the U.S. government to enact relevant legislation such asauthorization and approp
riations bills.In
 addition,  significant  budgetary  delays  and  constraints  have  already  resulted  in  reduced  spending  levels,  and  additional  reductions  may  beforthcoming.
 The  Budget  Control  Act  of  2011  (The  Act)  established  limits  on  U.S.  government  discretionary  spending,  including  a  reduction  ofdefense
 spending  between  the  2012  and  2021  U.S.  government  fiscal  years.  Accordingly,  long-term  uncertainty  remains  with  respect  to  overalllevels of defense spending an
d it is likely that U.S. government discretionary spending levels will continue to be subject to pressure.In
 addition,  there  continues  to  be  significant  uncertainty  with  respect  to  program-level  appropriations  for  the U.S.  DoD and  other  governmentagencies
 (including  NASA)  within  the  overall  budgetary  framework  described  above.  While  the  House  and  Senate  Appropriations  committeesincluded
 funding  for  Boeing’s  major  programs,  such  as  F/A-18,  CH-47  Chinook,  AH-64  Apache, KC-46A  Tanker and  P-8  programs,  in  the  finalFY2017
 appropriation  and  in  their  FY2018  bills,  uncertainty  remains  about  how  defense  budgets  in  FY2018  and  beyond  will  affect  Boeing’sprograms.
 Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions associated with the authorizations andappropriations
 process could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have amaterial effect on the results of the Company’s operations, financial pos
ition and/or cash flows.In
 addition,  as  a  result  of  the  significant  ongoing  uncertainty  with  respect  to  both  U.S.  defense  spending  levels  and  the  nature  of  the  threatenvironment,
 we expect the U.S.  DoD to  continue to emphasize cost-cutting and other efficiency initiatives in its procurement processes. If we canno
 longer  adjust  successfully  to  these  changing  acquisition  priorities  and/or  fail  to  meet  affordability  targets  set  by  the U.S.  DoD customer,  ourrevenues and market share would be further impacted.

ect to extensive procurement regulations and other unique risks.Our sales to the U.S. government are subject to extensive procurement regulations, and cha
nges to those regulations could increase our costs. New procurement
 regulations,  or  changes  to  existing  requirements,  could  increase  our  compliance  costs  or  otherwise  have  a  material  impact  on  theoperating
 margins of our BDS and BGS businesses. These requirements may result in increased compliance costs, and we could be subject toadditional
 costs  in  the  form  of  withheld  payments  and/or  reduced  future  business  if  we  fail  to  comply  with  these  requirements  in  the  future.Compliance
 costs attributable to current and potential future procurement regulations such as these could negatively impact our financial conditionand operating results.
The
 U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate one or more of our contracts. The  U.S. government contracting party may modify, curtail orterminate
 its contracts and subcontracts with us, without prior notice and either at its convenience or for default based on performance. In addition,funding
 pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations process due tofiscal
 constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programscould also
 result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such as “continuing resolutions”rather
 than full-year appropriations. Any loss or anticipated loss or reduction of expected funding and/or modification, curtailment, or termination ofone or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our earnin
gs, cash flow and/or financial position.We
 are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under U.S.government
 contracts. U.S.  government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency,routinely
 audit  government  contractors.  These  agencies  review  our  performance  under  contracts,  cost  structure  and  compliance  with  applicablelaws,
 regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found tobe
 misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must berefunded.
 Any  inadequacies  in  our  systems  and  policies  could  result  in  withholds  on  billed  receivables,  penalties  and  reduced  future  business.Furthermore,
 if  any  audit,  inquiry  or  investigation  uncovers  improper  or  illegal  activities,  we  could  be  subject  to  civil  and  criminal  penalties  andadministrative
 sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment fromdoing
 business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if suchallegations are later determined to be false.
We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns.
Our
 BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 65% and 77% of their 2017 revenues  from fixed-price contracts. While fixed-pricecontracts
 enable us to benefit from performance improvements, cost reductions and efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced marginsor
 incurring  losses if we are  unable to achieve estimated  costs  and revenues.  If  our estimated  costs  exceed our estimated  price,  we recognizereach-forward
 losses which can significantly affect our reported results. For example, during 2017, we recorded reach-forward losses totaling $471 million 
on the USAF  KC-46A Tanker contract,  primarily driven by additional costs attributable to certification and incorporating changes into low rateinitial
 production (LRIP) aircraft. The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the process of estimating costs and revenues on fixed-pricecontracts
 inherently risky. Fixed-price contracts often contain price incentives and penalties tied to performance which can be difficult to estimateand have significant
8

Table of Contentsimpacts on margins. In addition, some of our contracts have specific provisions relatin
g to cost, schedule and performance.Fixed-price
 development  contracts  are  generally  subject  to  more  uncertainty  than  fixed-price  production  contracts.  Many  of  these  developmentprograms
 have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays andhigher
 costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. Examples of significant BDSfixed-price development contracts include Commercia
l Crew, Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker , and commercial and military satellites. We enter into cost-type contracts which also carry risks.
Our
 BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 35% and 23% of  their 2017 revenues  from cost-type contracting arrangements.Some
 of these are development programs that have complex design and technical challenges. These cost-type programs typically have award orincentiv
e fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily inreduced
 fees,  lower  profit  rates  or  program  cancellation  if  cost,  schedule  or  technical  performance  issues  arise.  Programs  whose  contracts  areprimarily cost-type include 
GMD , Proprietary and SLS programs. We enter into contracts that include in-orbit incentive payments that subject us to r
isks.Contracts in the
 commercial satellite industry and certain government satellite contracts include in-orbit incentive payments. These in-orbit paymentsmay
 be paid over time after final satellite acceptance or paid in full prior to final satellite acceptance. In both cases, the in-orbit incentive payment isat
 risk if the satellite does not perform  to specifications  for up to 15 years after acceptance.  The net present value of in-orbit incentive fees weultimately
 expect  to  realize  is  recognized  as  revenue  in  the  construction  period.  If  the  satellite  fails  to  meet  contractual  performance  criteria,customers
 will  not  be  obligated  to  continue  making  in-orbit  payments  and/or  we  may  be  required  to  provide  refunds  to  the  customer  and  incursignificant charges.
Our
 ability to deliver products and services that satisfy customer requirements is heavily dependent on the performance and financialstability of our subcontractors and suppliers, as well as on the availability of raw materials and o
ther components.We rely on other companies including U.S. and n
on-U.S. subcontractors and suppliers to provide and produce raw materials, integrated componentsand
 sub-assemblies,  and production commodities  and to perform  some of the services that we provide to our customers.  If one or more  of oursuppliers
 or  subcontractors  experiences  financial  difficulties,  delivery  delays  or  other  performance  problems,  we  may  be  unable  to  meetcommitments
 to our customers or incur additional costs. In addition, if one or more of the raw materials on which we depend (such as aluminum,titanium
 or composites) becomes unavailable or is available only at very high prices, we may be unable to deliver one or more of our products in atimely
 fashion  or  at  budgeted  costs.  In  some  instances,  we  depend  upon  a  single  source  of  supply.  Any  service  disruption  from  one  of  thesesuppliers,
 either due to circumstances beyond the supplier’s control, such as geo-political developments, or as a result of performance problems orfinancial difficulties, could have a materia
l adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers or increase our operating costs.We
 use estimates in accounting for many contracts and programs. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financialresults.
Contract and program accounting require judgme
nt relative to assessing risks, estimating revenues and9

Table of Contentscosts and
 making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts and programs, the estimationof total revenues and
 cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time tocomplete
 the contract or program because costs also include expected increases in wages and employee benefits, material prices and allocatedfixed
 costs. Incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded whenthere
 is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Suppliers’ assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costsand profit rates. Estimates of award fees are also used in sales and profit rates based on actua
l and anticipated awards.With
 respect  to  each  of  our  commercial  aircraft  programs,  inventoriable  production  costs  (including  overhead),  program  tooling  and  other  non-recurring
 costs and routine warranty costs are accumulated and charged as cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. Aprogram
 consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort fordelivery
 under existing and anticipated contracts limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates. To establish the relationship ofsales
 to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period overwhich
 the units can reasonably be expected to be produced and (c) the units’ expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and othernon-recurring
 costs, and routine warranty costs for the total program. Several factors determine accounting quantity, including firm orders, letters ofintent
 from prospective customers and market studies. Changes to customer or model mix, production costs and rates, learning curve, changes toprice
 escalation indices, costs of derivative aircraft, supplier performance, customer and supplier negotiations/settlements, supplier claims and/orcertification
 issues can impact these estimates. Any such change in estimates relating to program accounting may adversely affect future financialperformance.
Because
 of the  significance  of  the judgments  and estimation  processes  described  above,  materially  different  sales  and profit  amounts  could berecorded if
 we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances orestimates
 may adversely affect future period financial performance. For additional information on our accounting policies for recognizing sales andprofits, see our
 discussion under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Critical Accounting Policies – Contract Accounting/Program Accounting”on pages 
41 – 43 and Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 52 – 64 of this Form 10-K.Competition within our markets and with respect to the products we sell
 may reduce our future contracts and sales.The
 markets  in  which  we  operate  are  highly  competitive  and  one  or  more  of  our  competitors  may  have  more  extensive  or  more  specializedengineering,
 manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas. In our Commercial Airplanes business, we anticipate increasingcompetition among non-U.S. aircraft manufacturers
 of commercial jet aircraft. In our BDS business, we anticipate that the effects of defense industryconsolidation,
 fewer large and new programs and new priorities, including near and long-term cost competitiveness, of our U.S.  DoD and non-U.S. will
 intensify competition for many of our BDS products. Our BGS segment faces competition from many of the same strong U.S. and non-U.S.competitors
 facing BCA and BDS. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition.There
 can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that the competitive pressureswe face will not result in reduced revenues an
d market share.10

Table of ContentsWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from non-U.S. sales and are subject to the risks of doing business in other countr
ies.In 
2017 ,  non-U.S. customers, which includes FMS, accounted for approximately 55% of  our revenues. We expect that non-U.S. sales will continueto
 account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally,including:
•
changes in regulatory requirements; •
U.S.  and non-U.S. government policies, including requirements to expend a portion of program funds locally and governmental industrialcooperation or participation requirements;
•
fluctuations in international currency excha nge rates;•
volatility  in international political and economic environments and changes in non-U.S. national priorities and budgets, which can lead todelays or fluctuations in orders;
•
the complexity and necessity of using non-U.S. representatives a nd consultants;•
the  uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases, including the availability of financing from the Export-Import Bankof the United States;
•
uncertainties and restrictions concerning the ava ilability of funding credit or guarantees;•
imposition of domestic and international taxes, exp ort controls, tariffs, embargoes, sanctions and other trade restrictions;•
the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise sprea d over many countries;•
compliance with a variety of non-U.S. laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activ ities of U.S. companies abroad; and•
unforeseen developments and con ditions, including terrorism, war, epidemics and international tensions and conflicts.While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations in the future.
Unauthorized access to our or our customers’ information and systems could negatively impact our business.
We
 face certain security threats, including threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and systems. We maintain an extensivenetwork
 of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight in order to address thesethreats.
 While  these  measures  are  designed  to  prevent,  detect  and  respond  to  unauthorized  activity  in  our  systems,  certain  types  of  attacks,including
 cyber-attacks, could result in significant financial or information losses and/or reputational harm. In addition, we manage information andinformation
 technology systems for certain customers. Many of these customers face similar security threats. If we cannot prevent the unauthorizedaccess,
 release and/or corruption of our customers’ confidential, classified or personally identifiable information, our reputation could be damaged,and/or we could face financial losses.
The
 outcome  of  litigation  and  of  government  inquiries  and  investigations  involving  our  business  is  unpredictable  and  an  adversedecision in any such matter could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.
We
 are involved in a number of litigation matters. These matters may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used tobenefit
 our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of any of theselawsuits, or future lawsuits, could have a material impact on our financi
al position and results of operations. In addition, we11

Table of Contentsare subject to extensive regulation under the laws of
 the United States and its various states, as well as other jurisdictions in which we operate. As aresult,
 we are sometimes subject to government inquiries and investigations of our business due, among other things, to our business relationshipswith
 the U.S. government, the heavily regulated nature of our industry, and in the case of environmental proceedings, our current or past ownershipof
 certain property. Any such inquiry or investigation could potentially result in an adverse ruling against us, which could have a material impact onour financial position and results of operati
ons.A
 significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in certain types of Boeing aircraft,which exposes us to concentration risks.
A
 significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in distinct geographic regions. Our portfolio isalso
 concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft, and among customers that webelieve
 have less than investment-grade credit. If one or more customers holding a significant portion of our portfolio assets experiences financialdifficulties
 or otherwise defaults on or does not renew its leases with us at their expiration, and we are unable to redeploy the aircraft on reasonableterms,
 or if the types of aircraft that are concentrated in our portfolio suffer greater than expected declines in value, our earnings, cash flows and/orfinancial position could b
e materially adversely affected.We
 may be unable to obtain debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments at competitive rates, on commercially reasonableterms or in sufficient amounts.
We
 depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments. As of December  31, 2017 and 2016 ,  ourairplane
 financing commitments totaled $10,221  million and $14,847 million .  If we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financingcommitments or
 meet other business requirements, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. A number of factors could cause us to incur increasedborrowing
 costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include disruptions or declines in theglobal
 capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings. The occurrence of any or all of these events mayadversely affect our ability to fund our operations and contractual or fina
ncing commitments.We may not realize the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures/strategic alliances or divestitures.
As
 part of our business strategy, we may merge with or acquire businesses and/or form joint ventures and strategic alliances. Whether we realizethe
 anticipated benefits from these acquisitions and related activities depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate the operations of the acquiredbusiness, the performanc
e of the underlying product and service portfolio, and the performance of the management team and other personnel of theacquired
 operations.  Accordingly,  our  financial  results  could  be  adversely  affected  by  unanticipated  performance  issues,  legacy  liabilities,transaction-related
 charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets, credit guarantees, partnerperformance
 and indemnifications. Consolidations of joint ventures could also impact our reported results of operations or financial position. Whilewe
 believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there is no assurance that thesetransactions
 will be successful.  We also may make strategic divestitures  from time to time. These transactions  may result in continued financialinvolvement
 in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Nonperformance bythose divested businesses could affect our future financi
al results through additional payment obligations, higher costs or asset write-downs.12

Table of ContentsOur insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures.
We
 are  exposed  to  liabilities  that  are  unique  to  the  products  and  services  we  provide.  We  maintain  insurance  for  certain  risks  and,  in  somecircumstances,
 we  may  receive  indemnification  from  the  U.S.  government.  The  amount  of  our  insurance  coverage  may  not  cover  all  claims  orliabilities
 and we may be forced to bear substantial costs. For example, liabilities arising from the use of certain of our products, such as aircrafttechnologies,
 missile systems, border security systems, anti-terrorism technologies, and/or air traffic management systems may not be insurable oncommercially
 reasonable terms. While some of these products are shielded from liability within the U.S. under the SAFETY Act provisions of the2002
 Homeland Security Act, no such protection is available outside the U.S., potentially resulting in significant liabilities. The amount of insurancecoverage we maintain may be inadeq
uate to cover these or other claims or liabilities.Business disruptions could seriously affect our future sales and financial condition or increase our costs and expenses.
Our
 business may be impacted by disruptions including threats to physical security, information technology or cyber-attacks or failures, damagingweather
 or other acts of nature and pandemics or other public health crises. Any of these disruptions could affect our internal operations or ourability
 to deliver products and services to our customers. Any significant production delays, or any destruction, manipulation or improper use of ourdata, information systems or networks could impact our sales, increase our expenses and/or have an adverse effect on the reputation of Boeing and
of our products and services.
Some of our and our suppliers’ workforces are represented by labor unions, which may lead to work stoppages.
Approximately 
52,000 employees,  which constitute 37% of  our total workforce, were union represented as of December  31, 2017 . We experienced a
 work stoppage in 2008 when a labor strike halted commercial aircraft and certain BDS program production. We may experience additional workstoppages
 in the future, which could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict how stable our relationships, currently with 10 U.S. labororganizations and 
7 non-U.S. labor organizations, will be or whether we will be able to meet the unions’ requirements without impacting our financialcondition.
 The unions may also limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. Union actions at suppliers can also affect us. Work stoppages andinstability
 in our union relationships could delay the production and/or development of our products, which could strain relationships with customersand cause a loss of revenues which wou
ld adversely affect our operations.Substantial
 pension and other postretirement benefit obligations have a material impact on our earnings, shareholders’ equity and cashflows from operations, and could have significant adverse impacts in future periods.
The
 majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatoryamounts
 required under the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act and  discretionary contributions to improve the plans '  funded status. Theextent
 of future contributions depends heavily on market factors such as the discount rate and the actual return on plan assets. We estimate futurecontributions
 to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions could  have a significant effecton
 future contributions as well as on our annual pension costs and/or result in a significant change to shareholders '  equity. For U.S. governmentcontracts, we allocate pension costs to individua
l contracts based on U.S. Cost Accounting Standards which can also affect contract profitability. Wealso
 provide  other  postretirement  benefits  to  certain  of  our  employees,  consisting  principally  of  health  care  coverage  for  eligible  retirees  andqualifying depende
nts. Our estimates of future costs associated with these benefits are also subject to assumptions, including13

Table of Contentsestimates
 of the level of medical cost increases. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and otherpostretirement
 plan accounting policies, see “  Management '  s Discussion and Analysis -  Critical Accounting Policies -  Pension Plans ”  on page 43 of
 this Form 10-K. Although GAAP expense and pension or other postretirement benefit contributions are not directly related, the key economicfactors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or stock we would contrib
ute to our plans.Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.
We
 are subject to various U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations related to environmental protection, including the discharge,treatment,
 storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, finesand
 civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if we were to violate or become liable underenvironmental
 laws or regulations. In some cases, we may be subject to such costs due to environmental impacts attributable to our current or pastmanufacturing
 operations  or  the  operations  of  companies  we  have  acquired.  In  other  cases,  we  may  become  subject  to  such  costs  due  to  anindemnification
 agreement  between  us  and  a  third  party  relating  to  such  environmental  liabilities.  In  addition,  new  laws  and  regulations,  morestringent
 enforcement  of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new remediationrequirements
 could result in additional costs. For additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see Note 11 to our ConsolidatedFinancial Statements.

Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Overview
We are a
 global market leader in the design, development, manufacture, sale, service and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites,missile
 defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for theworldwide
 commercial  airline  industry  and  one  of  the  largest  defense  contractors  in  the  U.S.  While  our  principal  operations  are  in  the  U.S.,  weconduct operations in an expand
ing number of countries and rely on an extensive network of non-U.S. partners, key suppliers and subcontractors.Our
 strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses – Commercial Airplanes ( BCA ), Defense, Space & Security ( BDS ), and
 Global Services ( BGS )  – supplemented and supported by Boeing  Capital ( BCC ).  Taken together, these core businesses have historicallygenerated
 substantial  earnings  and  cash  flow  that  permit  us  to  invest  in  new  products  and  services.  We  focus  on  producing  the  products  andproviding
 the services that the market demands, and continue to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality to provide a fair return for ourshareholders. 
BCA is  committed to being the leader in commercial aviation by offering airplanes and services that deliver superior design, efficiencyand
 value to customers around the world. BDS integrates  its resources in defense, intelligence, communications, security, space and services todeliver

 in 2017 decreased by $1,179 million or 1% compared with 2016 . BCA revenues decreased by $1,283 million or 2% primarily due todelivery
 mix, with fewer twin aisle deliveries more than offsetting the impact of higher single aisle deliveries. BDS revenues decreased by $1,506million 
primarily  due to fewer C-17 deliveries, l ower milestone revenue on satellite programs, and the mix of deliveries on the Apache and F-15programs,
 partially  offset  by  higher  volume  on  various  weapons  programs.  The  decreases  at  BCA  and  BDS  were  partially  offset  by  higherunallocated revenue and highe

 in 2016 decreased by $1,543 million or 2% compared with 2015. BCA revenues decreased by $1,387 million or 2% due fewer deliveries.BDS
 revenues  decreased  by  $1,145  million  or  5%  primarily  due  to  lower  milestone  revenue  on  government  satellite  programs, fewer  C-17deliveries,
 lower Commercial Crew revenue, as well as timing and mix of CH-47 Chinook deliveries, partially offset by higher revenue on severalmodifications
 and  upgrades  programs.  The  decreases  at  BCA  and  BDS  were  partially  offset  by  higher  BGS  revenue,  primarily  due  to  highercommercial parts revenue and government services revenue.
The
 changes  in  unallocated  items,  eliminations  and  other  in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 primarily  reflect  the  timing  of  eliminations  for  intercompanyaircraft deliveries and the sale of aircraft previously leased to customers.

Table of ContentsEarnings
 from operations in 2017 increased by $4,444 million compared  with 2016 ,  primarily due to higher earnings at BCA and BDS, and higherunallocated
 pension income, which more than offset other unallocated items and eliminations. BCA's 2017 earnings increased by $3,437  millionprimarily reflectin
g lower reach-forward losses, lower research and development costs, and improved margins reflecting favorable cost performance,which
 more  than  offset  the  impact  of  lower  revenues.  In  2016,  BCA  recorded  reach-forward  losses  of $1,258  million on  the  747  program  andreclassified 
$1,235 million of 787 flight test aircraft inventory costs to research and development expense. BDS 
earnings  from operations in 2017 increased by $257 million compared  with 2016 primarily  due to lower charges on the KC-46A Tanker andCommercial Crew programs, which more than offset the impact of fewer C-17 deliveries and Apac
he delivery mix.Earnings
 from operations in 2016 decreased by $1,609 million compared with 2015 due to lower earnings at BCA, partially offset by the change inunalloc
ated pension and postretirement income/(expense). BCA earnings in 2016 decreased by $2,289 million primarily due to the reclassification of$1,235
 million  of  787  flight  test  aircraft  costs  to  research  and  development  and  higher  reach-forward  losses  on  the  747  and  KC-46A  Tankerprograms.
 The reclassification of flight test aircraft costs was recorded in the second quarter of 2016 as a result of our determination that two 787flight
 test aircraft were no longer commercially saleable. The change in the unallocated pension and postretirement income/(expense) in 2016 wasprimarily driven by lower service costs and lower amortization of actuaria
l losses.During 
2017, 2016 and 2015 ,  we recorded reach-forward losses on the KC-46A Tanker program. In 2017 , we recorded charges of $471 million , of which 
$378  million was  recorded at BCA and $93  million at BDS .  During 2016 ,  we recorded charges of $1,128  million : $772 million at  BCA and$356
 million at  BDS. During 2015 ,  we recorded charges of $835  million : $513 million at  BCA and $322  million at  BDS. During 2016 and 2015 werecorded reach-forward losses on the 747 program of $1,258 milli
on and $885 million.Core
 operating  earnings  for 2017 increased by $3,506  million compared  with 2016 primarily  due  to  lower  reach  forward  losses  and  thereclassification of costs related to the 787 flight test aircraft in 2016.
Core
 operating earnings in 2016 decreased by $2,227 million compared with 2015 primarily due to the reclassification of costs related to the 787flight test aircraft and higher charges on the 747 and KC-46A Ta

 decreases in net periodic pension benefit costs of $211  million in 2017 and  of $2,263 million in 2016 are primarily due to lower service costsreflecting
 the transition of employees in 2016 to defined contribution  retirement  savings plans. The decrease in 2016 costs is also due to loweramortization of actuarial losses which reflects actuarial ga
ins in 2015 resulting from the year-end discount rate increase from 3.9% to 4.2%.A
 portion of net periodic benefit cost is recognized in Earnings from operations in the period incurred and the remainder is included in inventory atthe

Our effective income tax rates were 
18.4% , 12.1% and 27.7% for the years ended December  31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The Tax Cuts and
 Jobs Act, enacted in December 2017, reduced the 2017 effective tax rate by 10.5% and resulted in incremental tax benefits of $1,051  million , primarily
 related to the remeasurement of our U.S. net deferred tax liabilities to reflect the reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Our2016 effective tax
 rate was lower than the 2015 rate primarily due to lower pre-tax income in 2016 and discrete tax benefits of $617 million recorded in the third quarter of 2016 related to tax basis adjustments and the settlement of the 2011-20
12 federal tax audit.For additional discussion relate
d to Income Taxes, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Total Costs and Expenses (“Cost of Sales”)
Cost
 of sales, for both products and services, consists primarily of raw materials, parts, sub-assemblies, labor, overhead and subcontracting costs.Our
 Commercial  Airplanes  segment  predominantly  uses  program  accounting  to  account  for  cost  of  sales, BDS predominantly  uses  contractaccounting
 and  BGS  uses  contract  accounting  for  defense  contracts.  Under  program  accounting,  cost  of  sales  for  each  commercial  airplaneprogram
 equals  the  product  of  (i)  revenue  recognized  in  connection  with  customer  deliveries  and  (ii)  the  estimated  cost  of  sales  percentageapplicable
 to the total remaining program. Under contract accounting, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimatedcost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized.

Additional Considerations
KC-46A
 Tanker In  2011, we were awarded a contract from the U.S.  Air Force ( USAF )  to  design,  develop,  manufacture  and deliver  four  nextgeneration
 aerial  refueling  tankers.  The KC-46A  Tanker is  a  derivative  of  our  767  commercial  aircraft.  This  Engineering,  Manufacturing  andDevelopment
 (EMD)  contract  is  a  fixed-price  incentive  fee  contract  valued  at  $4.9  billion  and  involves  highly  complex  designs  and  systemsintegration.
 In  2015,  we  began  work  on  low  rate  initial  production  (LRIP)  aircraft  for  the  USAF.  During  the  third  quarter  of  2016,  following  ourachievement of key flight testing milestones, the 
USAF authorize d two LRIP lots for 7 and 12 aircraft valued at $2.8 billion. On January 27, 2017, theUSAF authorized an addi
tional23

Table of ContentsLRIP
 lot for 15 aircraft valued at $2.1 billion. The contract contains production options for both LRIP aircraft and full rate production aircraft. If alloptions
 under the contract are exercised, we expect to deliver 179 aircraft for a total expected contract value of approximately $30 billion. The EMDcontract is currently in the certification and flight testing phases and we ex
pect 18 fully operational aircraft to be delivered in 2018.During
 2016 and 2015, we recorded reach-forward losses of $1,128  million and $835 million related  to the EMD contract and LRIP aircraft. During2017,
 we  recorded  further  reach-forward  losses  of $471  million primarily  reflecting  higher  estimated  costs  associated  with  certification  andincorporating
 changes  into  LRIP  aircraft.  As  with  any  development  program,  this  program  remains  subject  to  additional  reach-forward  losses  ordelivery delays if we experience further productio
n, technical or quality issues, delays in certification and/or flight testing.Export-Import
 Bank  of  the  United  States Many  of  our  non-U.S.  customers  finance  purchases  through  the  Export-Import  Bank  of  the  UnitedStates.
 Following the expiration of the bank’s charter on June 30, 2015, the bank’s charter was reauthorized in December 2015. The bank is nowauthorized through September 30, 2019. How
ever, until the U.S. Senate confirms members sufficient to reconstitute a quorum of the bank’s board ofdirectors,
 the bank will not be able to approve any transaction totaling more than $10 million. As a result, we may fund additional commitmentsand/or
 enter into new financing arrangements with customers. Certain of our non-U.S. customers also may seek to delay purchases if they cannotobtain
 financing at reasonable costs, and there may be further impacts with respect to future sales campaigns involving non-U.S. customers. Wecontinue to work with our
 customers to mitigate risks associated with the lack of a quorum of the bank’s board of directors and assist with alternativethird party financing sources.
Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Commercial Airplanes
Business Environment and Trends
Airline
 Industry Environment Global  economic growth, a primary driver for air travel, has returned to the long-term average of approximately 3%.Passenger
 traffic  in 2017 is estimated  to grow by more  than 7%, exceeding  the long-term  trend  of  approximately  5%. While growth  was strongacross
 all major world regions, there continues to be variation between regions and airline business models. Airlines operating in the Asia Pacificregions
 and Europe, as well as low-cost-carriers globally, are currently leading the growth in passenger traffic. Air cargo traffic growth, building onthe recovery that started in 2016, is expected to exceed 9% in 2017, driven by strong trade an
d industrial production in all regions.Airline
 financial performance also plays a role in the demand for new capacity. Airlines continue to focus on increasing revenue through alliances,partnerships,
 new marketing initiatives, and effective leveraging of ancillary services and related revenues. Airlines are also focusing on reducingcosts and renewing fleets to leverage more efficient airpla
nes. Net profits in 2017 are expected to approximate $35 billion, consistent with 2016.The
 long-term outlook for the industry continues to remain positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth: economic growth and theincreasi
ng propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights betweencountries. Our
 20-year forecast projects a long-term average growth rate of 4.7% per year for passenger traffic and 4.2% for cargo traffic. Based onlong-term
 global economic growth projections of 2.8% average annual GDP growth, we project a $6.1 trillion market for approximately 41,030 newairplanes over the next 20 years.
The
 industry remains vulnerable to exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, acts of terrorism, natural disasters,conflicts, epidemics and increased glo
bal environmental regulations.24

Table of ContentsIndustry
 Competitiveness The  commercial  jet  airplane  market  and  the  airline  industry  remain  extremely  competitive.  Market  liberalization  inEurope,
 the  Middle  East  and  Asia  is  enabling  low-cost  airlines  to  continue  gaining  market  share.  These  airlines  are  increasing  the  pressure  onairfares.
 This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensurea favorable market position at acceptable profit margins.
Continued
 access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately91% of Commercial Airplanes’ total backlog, in d
ollar terms, is with non-U.S. airlines.We
 face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access tomost
 of  the  same  customers  and  suppliers.  With  government  support,  Airbus  has  historically  invested  heavily  to  create  a  family  of  products  tocompete
 with ours. Regional jet makers Embraer and Bombardier continue to develop and market larger and increasingly more capable airplanes,including
 Embraer’s E-195 in the regional jet market and Bombardier’s C Series in the 100-150 seat transcontinental  market. Additionally, othercompetitors
 from Russia, China and Japan are developing commercial jet aircraft. Some of these competitors have historically enjoyed access togovernment-provided
 financial  support,  including  “launch  aid,”  which  greatly  reduces  the  cost  and  commercial  risks  associated  with  airplanedevelopment activities. This has enabl
ed the development of airplanes without commercial viability; others to be brought to market more quickly thanotherwise
 possible; and many offered for sale below market-based prices. Many competitors have continued to make improvements in efficiency,which
 may result in funding product development, gaining market share and improving earnings. This market environment has resulted in intensepressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to conti
nue or intensify in the coming years.We
 are focused on improving our products and services and continuing our cost-reduction efforts, which enhances our ability to compete. We arealso focused on taking actions to ensure that Boei
ng is not harmed by unfair subsidization of competitors.Results of Operations

Earnings
 from operations in 2017 increased by $3,437 million compared  with 2016 .  The increase in earnings and operating margins is primarilydue to lower reach-forward losses, lower research and deve
lopment costs and improved margins reflecting favorable cost performance, which morethan offset the impact of lower revenues.
Earnings
 from operations in 2016 decreased by $2,289 million compared  with 2015. The decrease in earnings and operating margins is primarilydue
 to  higher  research  and development  costs  of $1,395  million ,  delivery  mix  and higher  reach-forward  losses  on the  747 program  of  $1,258million
 compared with $885 million in 2015. Research and development expense in 2016 reflect the reclassification from inventory to research anddevelopment
 expense  of  $1,235  million  related  to  the  fourth  and  fifth  787  flight  test  aircraft  and  higher  planned  spending  related  to  the  777Xprogram.
Reach-forward
 losses  of $378  million , $772  million and $513  million were  recorded  related  to  the  KC-46A  Tanker  in  2017,  2016  and  2015,respectively. During 2016 and 201

 backlog  represents  orders  for  products  and services  where  no contingencies  remain  before  we and the  customer  are  required  to  perform.Backlog
 does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customer receiving approval from itsboard of directors, shareholders or
 government or completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired priorto
 recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Firm backlog excludes options. A number of our customers mayhave
 contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays. We address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as theyarise. However, once orders are include
d in firm backlog, orders remain in backlog until canceled or fulfilled, although the value of orders is adjustedas changes to price and schedule are agre
ed to with customers.BCA
 total backlog was $421,345 million , $413,036 million and $429,346 million at  December 31, 2017, 2016  and 2015 ,  respectively. The increasein 
2017 was primarily due to net orders in excess of deliveries. The decrease i n 2016 was primarily due to deliveries in excess of net orders. 26

Table of ContentsAccounting
 Quantity The  accounting  quantity  is  our  estimate  of  the  quantity  of  airplanes  that  will  be  produced  for  delivery  under  existing  andanticipated
 contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenueand cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize o
n sales of individual airplanes throughout aprogram’s
 life.  Estimation  of  each  program’s  accounting  quantity  takes  into  account  several  factors  that  are  indicative  of  the  demand  for  thatprogram,
 including  firm  orders,  letters  of  intent  from  prospective  customers  and  market  studies.  We  review  our  program  accounting  quantitiesquarterly.
The
 accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to beunder
 contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantitymust be considered.
The
 following table provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of December 31. Cumulative firm orders representthe cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus unde
livered firm orders.

737 Program 
The  accounting quantity for the 737 program increased by 800 units during 2017 due to the program ’  s normal progress of obtainingadditional
 orders and delivering airplanes. We are currently producing at a rate of 47 per month and plan to increase to 52 per month in 2018. Weplan
 to further increase the rate to 57 per month in 2019. We delivered the first 737 MAX 8 in May 2017 and announced the launch of the 737 MAX10 in June 2017.
747 Program 
During  the fourth quarter of 2017, we received firm orders and commitments for 15 aircraft and we increased the program accountingquantity
 by 15 aircraft. The program accounting quantity now includes aircraft scheduled to be produced through 2021. We are currently producingat
 a rate of 0.5 aircraft per month, having reduced the rate from 1.0 per month in September 2016. In 2016 and 2015, we recorded reach-forwardlosses
 of $1,258 million and $885 million as lower than expected demand for large commercial passenger and freighter aircraft and slower-than-expected growth of global freight traffic
27

Table of Contentsresulted in lower anticip
ated revenues from future sales and higher costs to produce fewer airplanes. We continue to evaluate the viability of the 747program and it is reasonably possible that we cou
ld decide to end production of the 747.767
 Program The  accounting  quantity  for  the  767 program  increased  by 12  units  during  the  third  quarter  of  2017 due  to  the  program's  normalprogress of obtaining addit
ional orders and delivering airplanes. The 767 assembly line includes a 767 derivative to support the tanker program. Thecombined tanker and commercial production rate increas
ed from 2 per month to 2.5 per month in the third quarter of 2017.777
 Program We  implemented a planned production rate decrease from 8.3 per month to 7 per month during the first quarter of 2017. We furtherreduced
 the rate to 5 per month in the third quarter of 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we launched the 777X, which features a new compositewing,
 new engines and folding wing-tips. The 777X will have a separate program accounting quantity, which will be determined in the year of firstairplane delivery, targeted for 2020.
787
 Program The  accounting quantity for the 787 program increased by 100 units during the third quarter of 2017 due to the program’s normalprogress of
 obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. We are currently producing at a rate of 12 per month and plan to increase to 14 permonth in 2019. First delivery of the 787-10 derivative aircraft is targeted for 2018.
Fleet Support 
We  provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation.Collecti
vely known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational lifeof
 the  airplane.  They  include  flight  and  maintenance  training,  field  service  support,  engineering  services,  information  services  and  systems  andtechnical
 data  and  documents.  The  costs  for  fleet  support  are  expensed  as  incurred  and  have  historically  been  approximately 1.0% of  totalconsolidated costs of products and services.

Additional Considerations
The
 development  and  ongoing  production  of  commercial  aircraft  is  extremely  complex,  involving  extensive  coordination  and  integration  withsuppliers
 and highly-skilled labor from employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well asthose
 of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, suchas
 the 787-10 and 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. As a result, ourability
 to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subjectto significant risks. Factors
 that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or is determined to have reach-forwardlosses) include the following: cha
nges to the program accounting28

Table of Contentsquantity,
 customer  and  model  mix,  production  costs  and  rates,  changes  to  price  escalation  factors  due  to  changes  in  the  inflation  rate  or  othereconomic indicators, performance or
 reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing oradding
 new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, achieving anticipated cost reductions, flight test and certificationschedules,
 costs, schedule and demand for new airplanes and derivatives and status of customer claims, supplier assertions and other contractualnegotiations.
 While we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the technicalcomplexity
 of our airplane programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates couldbe extended, which could trigger termination prov
isions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure.Defense, Space & Security
Business Environment and Trends
United States Government Defense Environment Overview
In
 November 2017, Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018 (FY2018), which authorizes a U.S. DoD budgettopline
 higher than the administration’s budget request from May. While the appropriations process for FY2018 remains incomplete, both the Houseand
 Senate appropriations committees have also produced bills that increase the U.S. DoD budget topline above the administration’s request .  OnFebruary
 9,  2018,  Congress  passed  a  fifth  Continuing  Resolution  that  maintains  current  funding  levels  through  March  23,  2018  and  includesincreases
 to  the  Budget  Control  Act  caps  for  defense  and  non-defense  spending  for  FY2018  and  FY2019.  However,  the  Budget  Control  Actcontinue
s to mandate limits on U.S. government discretionary spending and remains in effect. As a result, continued budget uncertainty and the riskof future sequestration cuts will remain unless Congress acts to repeal or susp
end this law.Funding
 timeliness also remains a risk. If Congress is unable to pass appropriations bills or an omnibus spending bill before the expiration of thecurrent
 Continuing Resolution, a government shutdown could result which may have impacts above and beyond those resulting from budget cuts,sequestration
 impacts  or  program-level  appropriations.  For  example,  requirements  to  furlough  employees  in  the  U.S.  DoD,  the  Department  ofTransportation,
 or  other  government  agencies  could  result  in  payment  delays,  impair  our  ability  to  perform  work  on  existing  contracts,  and/ornegatively impact future orders.
In
 addition,  there  continues  to  be  uncertainty  with  respect  to  program-level  appropriations  for  the  U.S.  DoD  and  other  government  agencies,including
 the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), within the overall budgetary framework described above. Future budget cutsor
 investment priority changes could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts couldhave a material effect on the results of the Company’s operations, financia
l position and/or cash flows. 
Non-U.S. Defense
 Environment Overview The non-U.S.  market continues to be driven by complex and evolving security challenges and the needto
 modernize aging equipment and inventories. BDS expects that it will continue to have a wide range of opportunities across Asia, Europe and theMiddle East given the diverse regiona
l threats. At the end of 2017, 40% of BDS backlog was attributable to non-US customers.29

Table of ContentsEarnings From Operations
BDS 
earnings  from operations in 2017 increased by $257 million compared  with 2016 primarily  due to lower charges on the KC-46A Tanker andCommercial
 Crew  programs,  which  more  than  offset  the  impact  of  fewer  C-17  deliveries  and  Apache  delivery  mix.  Higher  earnings  reflect  thefavorable impact of cumulative catch-up adjustments which were 
$541 million higher in 2017 than in 2016 , primarily driven by lower charges. BDS 
earnings  from operations in 2016 decreased by $346 million compared with 2015, primarily due to lower earnings on the Commercial Crewprogram, driven by a charge of $162 million during the third q
uarter of 2016, as well as lower volume and mix on the CH-47 Chinook program. Lowerearnings
 include the unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments which were $441  million higher  than 2015, primarily due toCommercial Crew charges in 2016 and the abs
ence of favorable F-15 program adjustments recorded in 2015.BDS
 earnings from operations include equity earnings of $183  million , $249 million and $202 million primarily  from our ULA joint venture in 2017 , 2016 
and 2015 . During 
2017 , 2016 and 2015 , BDS recorded charges related to the KC-46A Tanker contract of $93 million , $356 million and $322 million . Backlog
Total
 backlog of $49,577  million at December 31, 2017 increase d  by 11% from December  31, 2016 ,  primarily due to current year contract awardsfor the F-15 and Apache programs, partially offset by revenue recognized o
n contracts awarded in prior years.Total backlog of 
$44,825 million at December 31, 2016 decreased by 4% reflecting revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years, partiallyoffset by current year contract awards for satellite, P-8, weapons, Apache and CH-47 Chin
ook programs.Additional Considerations
Our BDS
 business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs havecost-type
 contracting  arrangements.  In  these  cases,  the  associated  financial  risks  are  primarily  in  reduced  fees,  lower  profit  rates  or  programcancellation
 if  cost,  schedule  or  technical  performance  issues  arise.  Examples  of  these  programs  include Ground-based  Midcourse  Defense , Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.
Some
 of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Many of these programs have highly complex designs. As technical orquality
 issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to performthe
 work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. Theseprograms
 are  ongoing,  and  while  we  believe  the  cost  and  fee  estimates  incorporated  in  the  financial  statements  are  appropriate,  the  technicalcomplexity
 of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could beextended,
 which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. Theseprograms
 have  risk  for  reach-forward  losses  if  our  estimated  costs  exceed  our  estimated  contract  revenues.  Examples  of  significant  fixed-pricedevelopment programs include KC-46
A Tanker, Commercial Crew, Saudi F-15, and commercial and military satellites.KC-46A Tanker

Business Environment and Trends
The aerospace markets we serve include parts distribution, lo
gistics, and other inventory services; maintenance, engineering, and upgrades; trainingand professional services; and information services. We expect the market to grow by around 3.5% a
nnually.As the size of the worldwide commercial airline fleet conti
nues to grow, so does demand for aftermarket services designed to increase efficiency andextend
 the  economic  lives  of  airplanes.  Airlines  are  using  data  analytics  to  plan  flight  operations  and  predictive  maintenance  to  improve  theirproductivity and efficiency. Airlines continu
e to look for opportunities to reduce the size and cost of their spare parts inventory, frequently outsourcingspares management to third parties.
Government
 services market segments are growing on pace with related fleets, but vary based on the utilization and age of the aircraft. The U.S.government services market is the single largest individu
al market, comprising over 50 percent of the government services markets served. Over thenext
 decade,  we  expect  U.S.  growth  to  remain  flat  and  non-U.S.  fleets,  led  by  Middle  East  and  Asia  Pacific  customers,  to  add  rotorcraft  andcommercial derivativ
e aircraft at the fastest rates. We expect less than 20 percent of the worldwide fleet of military aircraft to be retired and replacedover the next ten years, driving increased demand for services to maintain agi
ng aircraft and enhance aircraft capability.BGS’
 major customer, the U.S. government, remains subject to the spending limits and uncertainty described on page 29 , which could restrict theexecution of certain program activities and delay ne
w programs or competitions.Industry
 Competitiveness Aviation  services is a competitive market with many domestic and international competitors. This market environmenthas resulted
 in intense pressures on pricing and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years. Continued access to globalmarkets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales growth potential a
nd long-term investment returns.Results of Operations

Business Environment and Trends
BCC’s
 gross customer financing and investment portfolio at December  31, 2017 totaled $3,006  million .  A substantial portion of BCC’s portfolio isrelated to
 customers that we believe have less than investment-grade credit. BCC’s portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeingaircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft.
BCC
 provided customer financing of $480  million and $1,376 million during 2017 and 2016 .  While we may be required to fund a number of newaircraft
 deliveries in 2018 and/or provide refinancing for existing bridge debt, we expect alternative financing will be available at reasonable pricesfrom broad
 and globally diverse sources. However, a number of factors could cause BCC’s new business volume to increase further, including if theExport-Import Bank of the United States continues to be unable to, or does not, approve ne
w financing transactions.Aircraft
 values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 2,000 western-builtcommercial
 jet aircraft ( 8.3% of  current world fleet) were parked at the end of 2017 ,  including both in-production and out-of-production aircrafttypes.
 Of  these  parked  aircraft,  approximately 2% are  not  expected  to  return  to  service.  At  the  end  of 2016 and 2015 , 8.8% and 9.5% of  thewestern-built
 commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types withrelatively few operators, are placed out of service.

Cash used by financing activities was $11.4 billion during 2017 , an increase of $1.8 billion compared with 2016 , primarily due to
 higher share repurchases and dividend payments. During 2017 ,  our net borrowings were $1.1  billion compared  with minimal net repayments in2016 
.  Cash used by financing activities was $9.6  billion during  2016, an increase of $1.7  billion compared  with 2015 ,  primarily due to lower netborrowings and higher divid
end payments and share repurchases.At 
December 31, 2017 and 2016 the recorded balance of  debt was $11.1 billion and $10.0 billion of which $1.3 billion and $0.4 billion was classified as
 short-term. At December  31, 2017 and 2016 this  included $2.5  billion and $2.9 billion of  debt attributable to BCC ,  of which $0.9  billion and $0.1billion 
were classified as short-term. During 
2017 and 2016 we  repurchased 46.1  million and 55.1 million shares  totaling $9.2  billion and $7.0 billion through  our open market sharerepurchase
 program. In 2017  and 2016 ,  we had 0.7  million shares  transferred to us from employees for tax withholdings. At December  31, 2017 , the amount available under the share repurch
ase plan, announced on December 11, 2017 , totaled $18 billion . Capital
 Resources We  have substantial borrowing capacity. Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debtcovenants as described below. We have a commercial p

 that serves as a source of short-term liquidity. At December  31, 2017 ,  commercial paper borrowings totaling $600  million were supported by
 unused commitments under the revolving credit agreement. We had no commercial paper borrowings in 2016. Currently, we have $5.0  billion of unused borrowing capacity on revolv
ing credit line agreements. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to supportour general corporate borrowing needs.
Financing
 commitments totaled $10.2 billion and $14.8 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016 .  We anticipate that we will not be required to fund asignificant
 portion of our financing commitments  as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers.Historically,
 we have not been required to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we willnot
 be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. In addition, many of our non-U.S. customers finance aircraft purchases throughthe Export-Import
 Bank of the United States. Following the expiration of the bank’s charter on June 30, 2015, the bank’s charter was reauthorized inDecember
 2015.  The  bank  is  now  authorized  through  September  30,  2019.  However,  until  the  U.S.  Senate  confirms  members  sufficient  toreconstitute
 a quorum of the bank’s board of directors, the bank will not be able to approve any transaction totaling more than $10 million. As aresult, we may fund additional commitments and/or enter into new financi
ng arrangements with customers.In
 the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities, our commercial aircraft financing commitments, unfavorableresolution
 of litigation or other loss contingencies, or other business requirements, we expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuingcommercial
 paper or term debt. We believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing short-term andlong-term
 commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunitiesshould
 they  arise  within  the  next  year.  However,  there  can  be  no  assurance  of  the  cost  or  availability  of  future  borrowings,  if  any,  under  ourcommercial paper program, in the debt markets or our credit facilities.
At 
December 31, 2017 and 2016 ,  our pension plans were $16.4  billion and $20.1 billion underfunded  as measured under GAAP. On an Employee Retirement Income
 Security Act ( ERISA )  basis our plans are more than 100% funded at December 31, 2017 with  minimal required contributions in2018 
.  During 2017, we contributed shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $3.5  billion and  $ 0.5  billion in  cash. We do not expectto make contributions to our pension plans in 
2018 . We may be required to make higher contributions to our pension pla ns in future years.At 
December  31,  2017 ,  we  were  in  compliance  with  the  covenants  for  our  debt  and  credit  facilities.  The  most  restrictive  covenants  include  alimitation
 on  mortgage  debt  and  sale  and  leaseback  transactions  as  a  percentage  of  consolidated  net  tangible  assets  (as  defined  in  the  creditagreements),
 and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined). When considering debt covenants, we continue tohave substantial bor
rowing capacity.36

Pension
 and  Other  Postretirement  Benefits Pension  cash  requirements  are  based  on  an  estimate  of  our  minimum  funding  requirements,pursuant
 to ERISA regulations,  although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are basedon both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to pl
ans that are funded through trusts.Purchase
 Obligations Purchase  obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify afixed,
 minimum  or  range  of  quantities;  specify  a  fixed,  minimum,  variable,  or  indexed  price  provision;  and  specify  approximate  timing  of  thetransaction.

 relates  to  inventory  procurement  contracts.  We  have  entered  into  certain  significant  inventory  procurement  contracts  that  specifydeterminable
 prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. Theseagreements require suppliers and vend
ors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need forsuch
 arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portionof
 these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customersfor
 penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for programand
 contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included ourbest estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the tabl

Table of ContentsIndustrial Participation Agreements 
We have entered into  various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. tofacilitate
 economic flow back and/or technology or skills transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement ofgoods
 and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our local operations there, placement of direct work or vendor orders forsupplies,
 opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitmentsmay
 be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. In certain cases, penalties couldbe
 imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2017 ,  we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2017 , we have
 outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $17.9  billion that  extend through 2030 .  Purchase order commitments associated withindustrial
 participation agreements are included in purchase obligations in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitmentfrom us, a non-U.S. supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, qual
ity and schedule.Commercial Commitments

Table of ContentsNon-GAAP Measures
Core Operating Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings Per Share
Our Consolidated Fina
ncial Statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting  Principles in the United States of America ( GAAP 
) which we supplement with certain non-GAAP fina ncial information. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as asubstitute
 for  the  related  GAAP  measures,  and  other  companies  may  define  such  measures  differently.  We  encourage  investors  to  review  ourfinancial
 statements  and  publicly-filed  reports  in  their  entirety  and  not  to  rely  on  any  single  financial  measure.  Core  operating  earnings,  coreoperating
 margin  and  core  earnings  per  share  exclude  the  impact  of  certain  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefit  expenses  that  are  notallocated to business segments. Pensio
n costs, comprising service and prior service costs computed in accordance with GAAP are allocated to BCAand
 certain  BGS  businesses  supporting  commercial  customers.  Pension  costs  allocated  to  BDS  and  BGS  businesses  supporting  governmentcustomers are
 computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions andaccounting
 conventions  than  GAAP.  CAS  costs  are  allocable  to  government  contracts.  Other  postretirement  benefit  costs  are  allocated  to  allbusiness
 segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid. The unallocated pension costs recognized in earnings during 2017 was
 a benefit of $1,120  million compared  with a benefit of $217  million in 2016 and  an expense of $421  million in 2015 .  The higher 2017 benefitreflects
 the  amortization  of  pension  benefits  capitalized  as  inventory  in  prior  years.  The  2016  benefit  reflects  the  difference  between  the  highersegment allocat
ion compared to the U.S. GAAP net periodic pension costs recognized in earnings in the current period, as well as lower settlementsand curtailments. For further
 discussion of pension and other postretirement costs see the Management’s Discussion and Analysis on pages 20 and21 
of this Form 10-K and see Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management uses core operating earnings, core operating marginand
 core  earnings  per  share  for  purposes  of  evaluating  and  forecasting  underlying  business  performance.  Management  believes  these  coreearnings
 measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit costprimarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to U.S. government contracts.

Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies
Contract Accounting
Contract
 accounting  is  used  to  determine  revenue,  cost  of  sales,  and  profit  predominantly  by  BDS  and  for  defense  contracts  at  BGS.  Contractaccounting
 involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimatedcost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of
 sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentageto the amount of revenue recognized.
Due
 to the size, duration and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subjectto
 many variables. Total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regardingcontract
 options,  change  orders,  incentive  and  award  provisions  associated  with  technical  performance,  and  price  adjustment  clauses  (such  asinflatio
n or index-based clauses). The majority of these contracts are with the U.S. government where the price is generally based on estimated costto
 produce  the  product  or  service  plus  profit.  Federal  Acquisition  Regulations  provide  guidance  on  the  types  of  cost  that  will  be  reimbursed  inestablishing
 contract  price.  Total  contract  cost  estimates  are  largely  based  on  negotiated  or  estimated  purchase  contract  terms,  historicalperformance trends,
 business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical andschedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, busin
ess volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements.Revenue
 and  cost  estimates  for  all  significant  contracts  are  reviewed  and  reassessed  quarterly.  Changes  in  these  estimates  could  result  inrecognition
 of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the contract’s inception to date revenues, cost of sales and profit, in the period in which suchchanges are made. Changes in revenu
e and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reach-forward loss, whichwould be recorded immediately in earn
ings. For the year ended December 31, 2017 net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, includ ing reach-forward
 losses, across all contracts increased Earnings from operations by $14  million .  For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 ,  netunfavorable
 cumulative  catch-up  adjustments,  including  reach-forward  losses,  across  all  contracts  decreased  Earnings  from  operations  by $912 million 
and $224 million . Due
 to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could berecorded
 if  we  used  different  assumptions  or  if  the  underlying  circumstances  were  to  change.  Changes  in  underlying  assumptions/estimates,supplier
 performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin forall
 contracts in BDS and defense contracts at BGS for all of 2017 had  been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased ordecreased pre-tax
 income for the year by approximately $280 million . In  addition, a number of our fixed price development contracts are in a reach-forward loss position. Changes to estimated losses are recorde
d immediately in earnings.Program Accounting
Program
 accounting  requires  the  demonstrated  ability  to  reliably  estimate  the  relationship  of  sales  to  costs  for  the  defined  program  accountingquantity.
 A  program  consists  of  the  estimated  number  of  units  (accounting  quantity)  of  a  product  to  be  produced  in  a  continuing,  long-termproduction
 effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to makereasonably
 dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost ofsales
 is  determined  by  applying  the  estimated  cost  of  sales  percentage  for  the  total  remaining  program  to  the  amount  of  sales  recognized  forairplanes delivered and acc
epted by the customer.41

Table of ContentsFactors
 that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured partcosts,
 major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs. Estimation of the accountingquantity for
 each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, lettersof
 intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and salesprice for all unsold units within 
the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales pricesfor
 all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. Cost estimates arebased
 largely  on  negotiated  and  anticipated  contracts  with  suppliers,  historical  performance  trends,  and  business  base  and  other  economicprojections.
 Factors  that  influence  these  estimates  include  production  rates,  internal  and  subcontractor  performance  trends,  customer  and/orsupplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticip
ated labor agreements, and inflationary or deflationary trends.To
 ensure  reliability  in  our  estimates,  we  employ  a  rigorous  estimating  process  that  is  reviewed  and  updated  on  a  quarterly  basis.  Changes  inestimates
 are  normally  recognized  on  a  prospective  basis;  when  estimated  costs  to  complete  a  program  exceed  estimated  revenues  fromundelivered
 units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in theaccounting
 quantity. For example, in 2016 and 2015, we recorded reach-forward losses of $1,258 million and $885 million on the 747 program. Wecontinue to evaluate the viability of the 747 pro
gram and it is reasonably possible that we could decide to end production of the 747.The
 program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non-recurring and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program.Because of the higher unit production costs experi
enced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling andother
 non-recurring  costs,  new  commercial  aircraft  programs,  such  as  the  787  and  777X  programs,  typically  have  lower  initial  margins  thanestablished
 programs.  In  addition,  actual  costs  incurred  for  earlier  units  in  excess  of  the  estimated  average  cost  of  all  units  in  the  programaccounting
 quantity are included within program inventory as deferred production costs. Deferred production, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be fully recovered when all units in the accounting quant
ity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveriesis below the estimated average cost as learning curve a
nd other improvements are realized.Due to the significance of
 judgment in the estimation process described above, it is reasonably possible that changes in underlying circumstances orassumptions
 could  have  a  material  effect  on  program  gross  margins.  If  the  combined  gross  margin  percentages  for  our  commercial  airplaneprograms
 had been estimated to be 1% higher or lower it would have a similar effect on the Commercial Airplane segment’s operating margins. Forthe
 year ended December  31, 2017 ,  a 1% increase or decrease in operating margins for our Commercial Airplane segment would have a $567 million 
impact on operating earnings. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible 
ImpairmentsWe
 test  goodwill  for  impairment  by  performing  a  qualitative  assessment  or  using  a  two-step  impairment  process.  If  we  choose  to  perform  aqualitative
 assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as an initial step in assessing the fair value of operations. Ifwe
 determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the two-stepimpairment
 process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the two-step impairment process is used, wefirst
 compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, asecond
 step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fairvalue
 of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwillimpairment.
42

Table of ContentsWe
 estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate offuture
 sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements andgeneral market conditions. Changes in thes
e forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any.The
 cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at thedate of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any.
We
 completed our assessment of goodwill as of April 1, 2017 and  determined that there is no impairment of goodwill. As a result of the change inour
 reportable  segments,  as described  in Note 21 , we reallocated  goodwill to our  new reporting  units using a relative  fair  value approach.  Weevaluated
 goodwill for impairment at July 1, 2017 and determined that no impairment existed. As of December 31, 2017 ,  we estimated that the fairvalue
 of  each reporting  unit  significantly  exceeded  its  corresponding  carrying  value.  Changes  in our  forecasts,  or  decreases  in  the  value  of  ourcommon
 stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in futureperiods.
As
 of December  31, 2017 and 2016 ,  we had $490  million of  indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the Jeppesen and Aviall brand and tradenames
 acquired  in  business  combinations.  We  test  these  intangibles  for  impairment  by  comparing  their  carrying  value  to  current  projections  ofdiscounted
 cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows representsthe
 amount of the impairment. A 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows would not impact the carrying value of these indefinite-lived intangibleassets.
Pension Plans
The
 majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that hadparticipated
 in  defined  benefit  pension plans  transitioned  to  a company-funded  defined  contribution  retirement  savings  plan in  2016.  Accountingrules
 require  an  annual  measurement  of  our  projected  obligation  and  plan  assets.  These  measurements  are  based  upon  several  assumptions,including
 the  discount  rate  and  the  expected  long-term  rate  of  asset  return.  Future  changes  in  assumptions  or  differences  between  actual  andexpected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual ex
pense, projected benefit obligation and Shareholders’ equity.The
 following table shows the sensitivity of our pension plan liability and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate as ofDecember 31, 2017 
. (Dollars in millions)

 expense  is  also  sensitive  to  changes  in  the  expected  long-term  rate  of  asset  return.  A  decrease  or  increase  of  25  basis  points  in  theexpected
 long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2017 net  periodic pension expense by $148  million .  We expect 2018 net
 periodic pension cost to decrease by approximately $44  million and  the portion recognized in earnings before income taxes to decrease byapproximately 
$512 million primarily due to lower amortization of actuarial losses. 43

Table of ContentsItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Interest Rate Risk
We
 have  financial  instruments  that  are  subject  to  interest  rate  risk,  principally  fixed-rate  debt  obligations,  and  customer  financing  assets  andliabilities. Additiona
lly, BCC uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. Historically, we havenot
 experienced material gains or losses on our customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes. As of December  31, 2017 , the
 impact over the next 12 months of a 100 basis point rise in interest rates to our pre-tax earnings would not be significant. The investors in ourfixed-rate
 debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interestrate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
We
 are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We useforeign
 currency  forward  contracts  to  hedge  the  price  risk  associated  with  firmly  committed  and  forecasted  foreign  denominated  payments  andreceipts
 related  to  our  ongoing  business.  Foreign  currency  forward  contracts  are  sensitive  to  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  AtDecember
 31,  2017 ,  a  10%  increase  or  decrease  in  the  exchange  rate  in  our  portfolio  of  foreign  currency  contracts  would  have  increased  ordecreased
 our unrealized losses by $289 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations,such unrealized losses
 or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactionsbeing hedge
d. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk.44

Note 
1 – Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
The
 Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report have been prepared by management of The Boeing Company (herein referred to as“Boeing,” the “Company,” “we,”
 “us,” or “our”). These statements include the accounts of all majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entitiesthat
 are  required  to  be  consolidated.  All  significant  intercompany  accounts  and  transactions  have  been  eliminated.  As  described  in  Note 21 ,effective
 July  1,  2017,  we  now  operate  in four reportable  segments:  Commercial  Airplanes  (BCA);  Defense,  Space  &  Security  (BDS),  GlobalServices (BGS), and Boeing Capital (BCC). Amounts in prior peri
ods have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.Use of Estimates
Management
 makes assumptions and estimates to prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in theUnited
 States  of  America.  Those  assumptions  and  estimates  directly  affect  the  amounts  reported  in  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.Significant
 estimates for which changes in the near term are considered reasonably possible and that may have a material impact on the financialstatements are disclosed in these Notes to the Consolid
ated Financial Statements.Operating Cycle
For
 classification of certain current assets and liabilities, we use the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle, which isgenerally longer than one year 
. Revenue and Related Cost Recognition
Contract
 Accounting Contract  accounting is used for development and production activities predominantly by BDS and  for defense contracts atBGS.
 The majority of these activities are performed under contracts with the U.S. government and other customers that extend over several years.Contract
 accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating total sales and costs for each contract resulting in the development of estimatedcost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of
 sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentageto the amount of revenue recognized. When the current estimates of total sales and costs for a contract indicate a loss, a provisio
n for the entire losson the contract is recognized.
Changes
 in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effect on operating income are recognized using a cumulative catch-up adjustmentwhich recognizes in the current period the
 cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a contract’s percent complete. Netcumulative catch-up adjustments to prior years’ earnings, inclu
ding reach-forward losses, across all contracts were as follows: 
2017  2016  2015 Increase/(decrease) to Earnings from Operations
$14  ($912 )  ($224 ) Increase/(decrease) to Diluted EPS
$0.02  ($1.25 )  ($0.23 ) Significant
 adjustments during the three years ended December 31, 2017 included reach-forward losses of $471 , $1,128 and $835 on  the USAFKC-46A Tanker contract recorded during 2017, 201
6 and 2015.52

Table of ContentsWe
 combine contracts for accounting purposes when they are negotiated as a package with an overall profit margin objective. These essentiallyrepresent
 an agreement to do a single project for a single customer, involve interrelated construction activities with substantial common costs, andare performed concurrently or sequentially. When a group of contracts is combined, reven
ue and profit are earned uniformly over the performance ofthe
 combined contracts. Similarly, we may segment a single contract or group of contracts when a clear economic decision has been made duringcontract negotiations that would produce different rates of profitabil
ity for each element or phase of the contract.Sales
 related  to  fixed-price  contracts  are  recognized  as  deliveries  are  made,  except  for  certain  fixed-price  contracts  that  require  substantialperformance
 over an extended period before deliveries begin, for which sales are recorded based on the attainment of performance milestones.Sales related
 to contracts in which we are reimbursed for costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit are recorded as costs are incurred. The FederalAcquisition
 Regulations  provide  guidance  on  the  types  of  cost  that  will  be  reimbursed  in  establishing  contract  price.  Contracts  may  containprovisions
 to earn incentive and award fees if specified targets are achieved. Incentive and award fees that can be reasonably estimated and areprobable
 are recorded over the performance period of the contract. Incentive and award fees that cannot be reasonably estimated are recordedwhen awarded.
Program
 Accounting Our  Commercial Airplanes segment uses program accounting to account for cost of sales related to its programs. Programaccounting
 is applicable to products manufactured for delivery under production-type contracts where profitability is realized over multiple contractsand
 years.  Under  program  accounting,  inventoriable  production  costs,  program  tooling  and  other  non-recurring  costs,  and  warranty  costs  areaccumulated
 and charged to cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. A program consists of the estimated number ofunits
 (accounting  quantity)  of  a  product  to  be  produced  in  a  continuing,  long-term  production  effort  for  delivery  under  existing  and  anticipatedcontracts. The
 determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost ofexisting and anticipated contracts. To establish the relationship of sales
 to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number ofunits
 to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced, and (c) the units’expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling an
d other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs for the total program.We
 recognize sales for commercial airplane deliveries as each unit is completed and accepted by the customer. Sales recognized represent theprice negotiated with the customer,
 adjusted by an escalation formula as specified in the customer agreement. The amount reported as cost of salesis
 determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanesdelivered
 and accepted by the customer. Changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effects on program margins are recognizedprospectively
 except in cases where the program is determined to have a reach-forward loss in which case the loss is recognized in the currentperiod. Reductions
 to a reach-forward loss are spread over all undelivered units in the accounting quantity, whereas increases to the estimated lossare recorded immediately. See Note 
11 .Concession
 Sharing  Arrangements We  account  for  sales  concessions  to  our  customers  in  consideration  of  their  purchase  of  products  andservices
 as  a  reduction  to  revenue  when  the  related  products  and  services  are  delivered.  The  sales  concessions  incurred  may  be  partiallyreimbursed
 by certain suppliers in accordance with concession sharing arrangements. We record these reimbursements, which are presumed torepresent reductions in the price of the vendor’s products or services, as a reduction in C
ost of products.Spare Parts Revenue 
We recognize sales of spare parts upon delivery and the amo unt reported as cost of sales is recorded at average cost.Service
 Revenue Service  revenue is recognized when the service is performed with the exception of U.S. government service agreements, whichare accounted for using contract accounting. Service activities
53

Table of Contentsprimarily
 include:  support  agreements  associated  with  military  aircraft  and  helicopter  contracts,  space  travel  on  Commercial  Crew,  ongoingmaintenance of
 International Space Station, military and commercial aircraft training contracts, fleet care, and technical and flight operation servicesfor
 commercial  aircraft.  Service  revenue  and  associated  cost  of  sales  from  pay-in-advance  subscription  fees  are  deferred  and  recognized  asservices are rendered.
Financial
 Services  Revenue We  record  financial  services  revenue  associated  with  sales-type/finance  leases,  operating  leases,  and  notesreceivable.
Lease
 and financing revenue arrangements are included in Sales of services on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For sales-type/financeleases,
 we record an asset at lease inception. This asset is recorded at the aggregate of future minimum lease payments, estimated residual valueof the leased equipment, and deferred
 incremental direct costs less unearned income. Income is recognized over the life of the lease to approximatea
 level rate of return on the net investment. Residual values, which are reviewed periodically, represent the estimated amount we expect to receiveat
 lease  termination  from  the  disposition  of  the  leased  equipment.  Actual  residual  values  realized  could  differ  from  these  estimates.  Declines  inestimated residual value that are deemed other-than-temporary are recogn
ized in the period in which the declines occur.For
 operating leases, revenue on leased aircraft and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Operating leaseassets,
 included in Customer financing, are recorded at cost and depreciated over the period that we project we will hold the asset to an estimatedresidual
 value,  using  the  straight-line  method.  We  periodically  review  our  estimates  of  residual  value  and  recognize  forecasted  changes  byprospectively adjusting
 depreciation expense.For
 notes receivable, notes are recorded net of any unamortized discounts and deferred incremental direct costs. Interest income and amortizationof any discounts are recorded ratably over the related term of the note.
Reinsurance
 Revenue Our  wholly-owned  insurance  subsidiary,  Astro  Ltd.,  participates  in  a  reinsurance  pool  for  workers’  compensation.  Themember
 agreements and practices of the reinsurance pool minimize any participating members’ individual risk. Reinsurance revenues were $141 , $147 
and $136 during 2017 , 2016 and 2015 ,  respectively. Reinsurance costs related to premiums and claims paid to the reinsurance pool were$144 
, $139 and $132 during 2017 , 2016 and 2015 ,  respectively. Revenues and costs are presented net in Cost of sales in the ConsolidatedStatements of Operations.
Fleet Support
We
 provide  assistance  and  support  to  facilitate  efficient  and  safe  aircraft  operation  to  the  operators  of  all  our  commercial  airplane  models.Collectively
 known as fleet support, these activities and support services include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineeringsupport,
 and technical data and documents. Fleet support activity begins prior to aircraft delivery as the customer receives training, manuals, andtechnical
 consulting support. This activity continues throughout the aircraft’s operational life. Services provided after delivery include field servicesupport,
 consulting on maintenance, repair, and operational issues brought forth by the customer or regulators, updating manuals and engineeringdata,
 and the issuance of service bulletins that impact the entire model’s fleet. Field service support involves our personnel located at customerfacilities providing and coordi
nating fleet support activities and requests. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred as Cost of services.Research and Development
Research
 and  development  includes  costs  incurred  for  experimentation,  design,  and  testing,  as  well  as  bid  and  proposal  efforts  related  togovernment products and services which are expens
ed as incurred54

Table of Contentsunless
 the costs are related to certain contractual arrangements with customers. Costs that are incurred pursuant to such contractual arrangementsare
 recorded over the period that revenue is recognized, consistent with our contract accounting policy. We have certain research and developmentarrangements
 that meet the requirement for best efforts research and development accounting. Accordingly, the amounts funded by the customerare
 recognized  as  an  offset  to  our  research  and  development  expense  rather  than  as  contract  revenues.  Research  and  development  expenseincluded bid and proposal co
sts of $288 , $311 and $286 in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Share-Based Compensation
We provide various forms of
 share-based compensation to our employees. For awards settled in shares, we measure compensation expense basedon
 the  grant-date  fair  value  net  of  estimated  forfeitures.  For  awards  settled  in  cash,  or  that  may  be  settled  in  cash,  we  measure  compensationexpense
 based on the fair value at each reporting date net of estimated forfeitures. The expense is recognized over the requisite service period,which is generally the vesting perio
d of the award.Income Taxes
Provisions
 for U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. income taxes are calculated on reported Earnings before income taxes based on currenttax
 law and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferredtax
 assets and liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense arerecognized
 in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. Significant judgment is required in determiningincome tax provisions and evaluatin
g tax positions.The
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of taxpositions
 taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured forfinancial
 statement purposes and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such taxpositions
 changes,  the  change  in  estimate  is  recorded  in  the  period  in  which  the  determination  is  made.  Tax-related  interest  and  penalties  areclassified as a component of Income tax expense.
Postretirement Plans
The
 majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that hadparticipated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a
 company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. We also providepostretirement
 benefit  plans  other  than  pensions,  consisting  principally  of  health  care  coverage  to  eligible  retirees  and  qualifying  dependents.Benefits
 under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of service and, for somepension
 plans, benefits are also based on the employee’s annual earnings. The net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans isdetermined
 using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the long-term
 rate of asset return, and medical trend (rate of growth for medical costs). A portion of net periodic pension and other postretirement income orexpense is not recognized in net earnings in 
the year incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs, and reflected in inventory at theend
 of  a  reporting  period.  Actuarial  gains  and  losses,  which  occur  when  actual  experience  differs  from  actuarial  assumptions,  are  reflected  inShareho
lders’ equity (net of taxes). If actuarial gains and losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities we amortize themover
 the average future service period of employees. The funded status of our pension and postretirement plans is reflected on the ConsolidatedStatements of Financial Position.

Table of ContentsPostemployment Plans
We record a liability for postemployment benefits, such as severance or job traini
ng, when payment is probable, the amount is reasonably estimable,and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumul
ated.Environmental Remediation
We
 are  subject  to  federal  and  state  requirements  for  protection  of  the  environment,  including  those  for  discharge  of  hazardous  materials  andremediation
 of  contaminated  sites.  We  routinely  assess,  based  on  in-depth  studies,  expert  analyses  and  legal  reviews,  our  contingencies,obligations,
 and commitments  for remediation  of contaminated  sites,  including assessments  of ranges and probabilities of recoveries  from  otherresponsible
 parties and/or insurance carriers. Our policy is to accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to environmentalremediation
 sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The amount of the liability isbased
 on  our  best  estimate  or  the  low  end  of  a  range  of  reasonably  possible  exposure  for  investigation,  cleanup,  and  monitoring  costs  to  beincurred.
 Estimated remediation costs are not discounted to present value as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. We may beable
 to recover a portion of the remediation costs from insurers or other third parties. Such recoveries are recorded when realization of the claim forrecovery is deemed probable.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash
 and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments, such as commercial paper, time deposits, and other money market instruments,which
 have original maturities of three months or less. We aggregate our cash balances by bank where conditions for right of set-off are met, andreclassify
 any negative balances, consisting mainly of uncleared checks, to Accounts payable. Negative balances reclassified to Accounts payablewere 
$116 and $77 at December 31, 2017 and 2016 . Inventories
Inventoried
 costs  on  commercial  aircraft  programs  and  long-term  contracts  include  direct  engineering,  production  and  tooling  and  other  non-recurring
 costs,  and  applicable  overhead,  which  includes  fringe  benefits,  production  related  indirect  and  plant  management  salaries  and  plantservices, not in excess of
 estimated net realizable value. To the extent a material amount of such costs are related to an abnormal event or are fixedcosts
 not appropriately attributable to our programs or contracts, they are expensed in the current period rather than inventoried. Inventoried costsinclude
 amounts relating to programs and contracts with long-term production cycles, a portion of which is not expected to be realized within oneyear. Included in inventory for federal government contracts is an allocati
on of allowable costs related to manufacturing process reengineering.Commercial aircraft programs
 inventory includes deferred production costs and supplier advances. Deferred production costs represent actual costsincurred for
 production of early units that exceed the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity. Higher production costsare
 experienced at the beginning of a new or derivative airplane program. Units produced early in a program require substantially more effort (laborand
 other  resources)  than  units  produced  later  in  a  program  because  of  volume  efficiencies  and  the  effects  of  learning.  We  expect  that  thesedeferred
 costs will be fully recovered when all units included in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries isbelow
 the estimated average cost of all units in the program. Supplier advances represent payments for parts we have contracted to receive fromsuppliers in the future. As parts are received, supplier advances are amortize
d to work in process.56

Table of ContentsThe
 determination of net realizable value of long-term contract costs is based upon quarterly reviews that estimate costs to be incurred to completeall
 contract requirements. When actual contract costs and the estimate to complete exceed total estimated contract revenues, a loss provision isrecorded.
 The determination of net realizable value of commercial aircraft program costs is based upon quarterly program reviews that estimaterevenue
 and  cost  to  be  incurred  to  complete  the  program  accounting  quantity.  When  estimated  costs  to  complete  exceed  estimated  programrevenues to go, a program loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss o
n all undelivered units in the accounting quantity.Used
 aircraft purchased by the Commercial Airplanes segment and general stock materials are stated at cost not in excess of net realizable value.See ‘Aircraft Valuation’ within this
 Note for a discussion of our valuation of used aircraft. Spare parts inventory is stated at lower of average unit costor
 net realizable value. We review our commercial spare parts and general stock materials quarterly to identify impaired inventory, including excessor obsolete inventory,
 based on historical sales trends, expected production usage, and the size and age of the aircraft fleet using the part. Impairedinventories are charged to Cost of products in the period the impairment occurs.
Included
 in inventory for commercial aircraft programs are amounts paid or credited in cash, or other consideration to certain airline customers, thatare
 referred to as early issue sales consideration. Early issue sales consideration is recognized as a reduction to revenue when the delivery of theaircraft under contract
 occurs. If an airline customer does not perform and take delivery of the contracted aircraft, we believe that we would have theability
 to recover amounts paid. However, to the extent early issue sales consideration exceeds advances and is not considered to be otherwiserecoverable, it would be written off in the current period.
We net advances and progress
 billings on long-term contracts against inventory in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Advances andprogress billings in excess of related inve
ntory are reported in Advances and billings in excess of related costs.Precontract Costs
We
 may, from time to time, incur costs in excess of the amounts required for existing contracts. If we determine the costs are probable of recoveryfrom
 future  orders,  then  we  capitalize  the  precontract  costs  we  incur,  excluding  start-up  costs  which  are  expensed  as  incurred.  Capitalizedprecontract
 costs  are included in Inventories,  net of advances and progress  billings, in the  accompanying  Consolidated Statements  of FinancialPosition.
 Should future orders not materialize or we determine the costs are no longer probable of recovery, the capitalized costs would be writtenoff.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property,
 plant  and  equipment  are  recorded  at  cost,  including  applicable  construction-period  interest,  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  aredepreciated principally over the following estimated
 useful lives: new buildings and land improvements, from 10 to 40 years; and new machinery andequipment,
 from 4  to 20 years. The principal methods of depreciation are as follows: buildings and land improvements, 150% declining balance;and
 machinery  and  equipment,  sum-of-the-years’  digits.  Capitalized  internal  use  software  is  included  in  Other  assets  and  amortized  using  thestraight
 line  method  over 5 years.  We  periodically  evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  remaining  depreciable  lives  assigned  to  long-lived  assets,including assets that may be subject to a management pla
n for disposition.Long-lived
 assets  held  for  sale  are  stated  at  the  lower  of  cost  or  fair  value  less  cost  to  sell.  Long-lived  assets  held  for  use  are  subject  to  animpairment
 assessment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carryingvalue
 is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference betweenthe carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.

Table of ContentsAsset Retirement Obligations
We
 record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liability’s fair value can be reasonably estimated, including certain asbestos removal,asset decommissioning and contractual le
ase restoration obligations. Recorded amounts are not material.We
 also  have  known  conditional  asset  retirement  obligations,  such  as  certain  asbestos  remediation  and  asset  decommissioning  activities  to  beperformed in
 the future, that are not reasonably estimable due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation.Accordingly,
 these obligations have not been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. A liability for these obligations will be recorded inthe
 period when sufficient information regarding timing and method of settlement becomes available to make a reasonable estimate of the liability’sfair
 value. In addition, there may be conditional asset retirement obligations that we have not yet discovered (e.g., asbestos may exist in certainbuildings
 but we have not become aware of it through the normal course of business), and therefore, these obligations also have not been includedin the Consolidated Financial
 Statements.Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangibles
Goodwill
 and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized,  but are tested for impairment  annually and when an eventoccurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. Our annual testing date is April 1.
We
 test  goodwill  for  impairment  by  performing  a  qualitative  assessment  or  using  a  two-step  impairment  process.  If  we  choose  to  perform  aqualitative
 assessment and determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the relatedoperations,
 the  two-step  impairment  process  is  then  performed;  otherwise,  no  further  testing  is  required.  For  operations  where  the  two-stepimpairment
 process  is  used,  we  first  compare  the  carrying  value  of  net  assets  to  the  fair  value  of  the  related  operations.  If  the  fair  value  isdetermined
 to be less than carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value forgoodwill
 is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value belowcarrying value represents the amount of goodwill imp
airment.Indefinite-lived
 intangibles  consist  of  brand  and  trade  names  acquired  in  business  combinations.  We  test  these  intangibles  for  impairment  bycomparing
 their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying valueover the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment.
Our
 finite-lived acquired intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: developed technology,from 
4 to 14 years; product know-how, from 3 to 30 years; customer base, from 3 to 17 years; distribution rights, from 3 to 27 years; and other, from2 
to 32 years. We evaluate the potential impairment of finite-lived acquired intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicatethat
 the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows ofthe asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.

Table of ContentsInvestments
Time deposits are held-to-maturity investments that are carried at cost.
Available-for-sale
 securities  include  commercial  paper,  U.S.  government  agency  securities,  and  corporate  debt  securities.  Available-for-salesecurities are recorded at fair value, and unrealized gain
s and losses are recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensiveincome.
 Realized gains and losses  on available-for-sale  securities  are  recognized  based on the  specific  identification  method.  Available-for-salesecurities are assessed for impairment quarterly.
The
 equity method of accounting is used to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control,over
 an investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of an investee of between20% 
and 50% . We
 classify  investment  income  and  loss  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations  based  on  whether  the  investment  is  operating  or  non-operatin
g in nature. Operating investments align strategically and are integrated with our operations. Earnings from operating investments, includingour
 share  of  income  or  loss  from  equity  method  investments,  dividend  income  from  certain  cost  method  investments,  and  any  impairments  orgain/loss
 on the disposition of these investments, are recorded in Income from operating investments, net. Non-operating investments are those wehold
 for  non-strategic  purposes.  Earnings  from  non-operating  investments,  including  interest  and  dividends  on  marketable  securities,  and  anyimpairments or gain/loss on the disposition of these inv
estments are recorded in Other income/(expense), net.Derivatives
All
 derivative instruments are recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent of holding them.We
 use derivative instruments to principally manage a variety of market risks. For derivatives designated as hedges of the exposure to changes infair
 value of the recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment (referred to as fair value hedges), the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in theperiod of
 change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. The effect of that accounting is toinclude in earni
ngs the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. For our cash flow hedges, the effectiveportion of
 the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported in comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same periodor
 periods  during  which  the  hedged  forecasted  transaction  affects  earnings.  The  ineffective  portion  of  the  gain  or  loss  of  a  cash  flow  hedge  isreported
 in  earnings  immediately.  We  have  agreements  to  purchase  and  sell  aluminum  to  address  long-term  strategic  sourcing  objectives  andinternational
 business  requirements.  These  agreements  are  derivatives  for  accounting  purposes  but  are  not  designated  for  hedge  accountingtreatment.
 We also hold certain derivative instruments for economic purposes that are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. For thesealuminum
 agreements  and  for  other  derivative  instruments  not  designated  for  hedge  accounting  treatment,  the  changes  in  their  fair  value  arerecorded in earnings immediately.
Aircraft Valuation
Used
 aircraft under trade-in commitments and aircraft under repurchase commitments In  conjunction with signing a definitive agreement forthe
 sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in usedaircraft
 at a specified price upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. Additionally, we have entered into contingent repurchase commitments with certaincustomers
 wherein we agree to repurchase the Sale Aircraft at a specified price, generally  10 to 15 years after  delivery of the Sale Aircraft. Ourrepurchase
 of the Sale Aircraft is contingent upon a future, mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft. If we execute anagreement for the sale of additional new aircraft, and if the customer exercises its right to sell the Sale
59

Table of ContentsAircraft
 to us, a contingent repurchase commitment would become a trade-in commitment. Our historical experience is that contingent repurchasecommitments infrequently become trade-in commitments.
Exposure related to trade-in commitments may take the form of:
(1)
adjustments to revenue for the difference between the contractual trade-in price in the definitive agreement and our best estimate of thefair value of the trade-in aircraft as of the date of such agreement, which would be recogniz
ed upon delivery of the Sale Aircraft, and/or(2)
charges  to  cost  of  products  for  adverse  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  trade-in  aircraft  that  occur  subsequent  to  signing  of  a  definitiveagreement
 for Sale Aircraft but prior to the purchase of the used trade-in aircraft. Estimates based on current aircraft values would beincluded in Accrued liabilitie
s.The
 fair value of trade-in aircraft is determined using aircraft-specific data such as model, age and condition, market conditions for specific aircraftand
 similar  models,  and  multiple  valuation  sources.  This  process  uses  our  assessment  of  the  market  for  each  trade-in  aircraft,  which  in  mostinstances
 begins years before the return of the aircraft. There are several possible markets in which we continually pursue opportunities to placeused
 aircraft. These markets include, but are not limited to, the resale market, which could potentially include the cost of long-term storage; theleasing
 market,  with  the  potential  for  refurbishment  costs  to  meet  the  leasing  customer’s  requirements;  or  the  scrap  market.  Trade-in  aircraftvaluation
 varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft. On a quarterly basis, we update our valuationanalysis
 based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into a market or using current published third-party aircraft valuationsbased on the type and age of the aircraft, adjusted for individu
al attributes and known conditions.Used aircraft
 acquired by the Commercial Airplanes segment are included in Inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value as it is our intentto
 sell these assets. To mitigate costs and enhance marketability, aircraft may be placed on operating lease. While on operating lease, the assetsare included in Customer financing.
Customer
 financing Customer  financing includes operating lease equipment, notes receivable, and sales-type/finance leases. Sales-type/financeleases are treated as receivables, and allo
wances for losses are established as necessary.We
 assess  the  fair  value  of  the  assets  we  own,  including  equipment  under  operating  leases,  assets  held  for  sale  or  re-lease,  and  collateralunderlying receivables, to determine if their fair values are l
ess than the related assets’ carrying values. Differences between carrying values and fairvalues
 of sales-type/finance leases and notes and other receivables, as determined by collateral value, are considered in determining the allowancefor losses on receivables.
We
 use a median calculated from published collateral values from multiple third-party aircraft value publications based on the type and age of theaircraft
 to determine the fair value of aircraft. Under certain circumstances,  we apply judgment based on the attributes  of the specific aircraft orequipment,
 usually  when  the  features  or  use  of  the  aircraft  vary  significantly  from  the  more  generic  aircraft  attributes  covered  by  outsidepublications.
Impairment review for
 assets under operating leases and held for sale or re-lease We evaluate for impairment assets  under operating lease orassets
 held for sale or re-lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may beless
 than the carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow, including our intentions for howlong
 we will hold an asset subject to operating lease before it is sold, the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset,periods in which the asset may be held in prep
aration for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic60

Table of Contentslife of the asset. We record assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.
When
 we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value overthe fair value of the asset.
Allowance
 for losses on customer financing receivables We  record the potential impairment of customer financing receivables in a valuationaccount,
 the balance of which is an accounting estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses. The allowance for losses on receivables relates to twocomponents of receivables: (a) receivables that are evaluate
d individually for impairment and (b) all other receivables.We
 determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts dueaccording
 to  the  original contractual terms  of  the  receivable agreement,  without regard  to  any  subsequent restructurings.  Factors  considered inassessing
 collectability include, but are not limited to, a customer’s extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. Wedetermine
 a specific impairment allowance based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of therelated collateral we would exp
ect to realize.We
 review the adequacy of the allowance attributable  to the remaining receivables (after  excluding receivables subject to a specific impairmentallowa
nce) by assessing both the collateral exposure and the applicable cumulative default rate. Collateral exposure for a particular receivable is theexcess
 of the carrying value of the receivable over the fair value of the related collateral. A receivable with an estimated fair value in excess of thecarrying
 value is considered to have no collateral exposure. The applicable cumulative default rate is determined using two components: customercredit
 ratings and weighted average remaining contract term. Internally assigned credit ratings, our credit quality indicator, are determined for eachcustomer in the portfolio. Those ratings are updated based up
on public information and information obtained directly from our customers.We
 have entered into agreements with certain customers that would entitle us to look beyond the specific collateral underlying the receivable forpurposes
 of determining the collateral exposure as described above. Should the proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral asset resultingfrom
 a default condition be insufficient to cover the carrying value of our receivable (creating a shortfall condition), these agreements would, forexample,
 permit us to take the actions necessary to sell or retain certain other assets in which the customer has an equity interest and use theproceeds to cover the shortfall.
Each quarter we review customer
 credit ratings, published historical credit default rates for different rating categories, and multiple third-party aircraftvalue
 publications as a basis to validate the reasonableness of the allowance for losses on receivables. There can be no assurance that actualresults
 will not differ from estimates or that the consideration of these factors in the future will not result in an increase or decrease to the allowancefor losses on receivables.
Warranties
In conjunction with certain product sales, we provide warranties that cover factors such as non-conformance to specifications and defects in material
and
 design. The majority of our warranties are issued by our Commercial Airplanes segment. Generally, aircraft sales are accompanied by a three to 
four -year standard warranty for systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us or manufactured to certain standardsunder
 our authorization. These warranties are included in the programs’ estimate at completion. On occasion we have made commitments beyondthe
 standard  warranty  obligation  to  correct  fleet-wide  major  issues  of  a  particular  model,  resulting  in  additional  accrued  warranty  expense.Warranties
 issued by our BDS segment principally relate to sales of military aircraft and weapons hardware and are included in the contract costestimates.
 These sales are generally accompanied by a six month to two -year warranty period and cover systems, accessories, equipment, parts,and software manufactured by us to certain contractual specifications. Estimated costs related to stand
ard warranties are recorded in the61

Table of Contentsperiod
 in which the related product sales occur. The warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date reflects the estimated number of monthsof
 warranty coverage outstanding for products delivered times the average of historical monthly warranty payments, as well as additional amountsfor
 certain major warranty issues that exceed a normal claims level. Estimated costs of these additional warranty issues are considered changes tothe initial liability estimate.
We
 provide  guarantees  to  certain  commercial  airplane  customers  which  include  compensation  provisions  for  failure  to  meet  specified  aircraftperformance
 targets. We account for these performance guarantees as warranties. The estimated liability for these warranties is based on knownand
 anticipated operational characteristics and forecasted customer operation of the aircraft relative to contractually specified performance targets,and
 anticipated settlements when contractual remedies are not specified. Estimated payments are recorded as a reduction of revenue at delivery ofthe
 related  aircraft.  We  have  agreements  that  require  certain  suppliers  to  compensate  us  for  amounts  paid  to  customers  for  failure  of  suppliedequipment
 to meet specified performance targets. Claims against suppliers under these agreements are included in Inventories and recorded as areduction
 in  Cost  of  products  at  delivery  of  the  related  aircraft.  These  performance  warranties  and  claims  against  suppliers  are  included  in  theprograms’ estimate at completion.
Supplier Penalties
We
 record an accrual for supplier penalties when an event occurs that makes it probable that a supplier penalty will be incurred and the amount isreasonably estimable. Until an event occurs, we fully a
nticipate accepting all products procured under production-related contracts.Guarantees
We
 record a liability in Accrued liabilities for the fair value of guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002. For a residual valueguarantee
 where  we  received  a  cash  premium,  the  liability  is  equal  to  the  cash  premium  received  at  the  guarantee’s  inception.  For  creditguarantees,
 the liability is equal to the present value of the expected loss. We determine the expected loss by multiplying the creditor’s default rateby
 the  guarantee  amount  reduced  by  the  expected  recovery,  if  applicable,  for  each  future  period  the  credit  guarantee  will  be  outstanding.  If  atinception
 of a guarantee, we determine there is a probable related contingent loss, we will recognize a liability for the greater of (a) the fair value ofthe guarantee as described above or (b) the probabl
e contingent loss amount.Standards Issued and Not Yet Implemented
In
 February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016 -  02, Leases (Topic  842) . The new standard is
 effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The standard will require lesseesto
 report  most  leases  as  assets  and  liabilities  on  the  balance  sheet,  while  lessor  accounting  will  remain  substantially  unchanged.  The  standardrequires
 a modified retrospective transition approach for existing leases, whereby the new rules will be applied to the earliest year presented. Weplan
 to adopt the new lease standard in 2019 and do not expect it to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cashflows.
We
 are  adopting  ASU  No.  2014-09, Revenue  from  Contracts  with  Customers  (Topic  606) in  the  first  quarter  of  2018  using  the  retrospectivetransition
 method which will require 2016 and 2017 financial statements to be restated. The new standard requires revenue to be recognized whenpromised
 goods or services are transferred to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled inexchange for those goods or services. The standard also requ
ires expanded disclosures regarding revenue and contracts with customers.62

Table of ContentsMost
 of our defense contracts at BDS and BGS that have historically recognized revenue as deliveries are made or based on the attainment ofperformance
 milestones will recognize revenue under the new standard over time as costs are incurred. Certain military derivative aircraft contractsincluded
 in our BCA segment will also recognize revenue as costs are incurred. The new standard will not change the total amount of revenuerecognized
 on these contracts, only accelerate the timing of when the revenue is recognized. In addition, the timing of cost of sales recognition forthese contracts will be accelerated, resulting in a decre
ase in Inventories from long-term contracts in progress.The
 new  standard  will  not  affect  revenue  recognition  or  the  use  of  program  accounting  for  commercial  airplane  contracts.  We  will  continue  torecognize revenue for these contracts at the point in time when the customer accepts deliv
ery of the airplane.Because revenue will be
 recognized under the new standard as costs are incurred for most of our defense and military derivative airplane contracts,approximately 
$10,000 of revenues and $1,300 of  associated operating earnings will be accelerated into years ending prior to January 1, 2016. Therestatement
 will result in a cumulative adjustment to increase retained earnings by $900 effective  January 1, 2016. Restated income statements for2016 and 2017 are shown below.
We are also adopting 
ASU No. 2017-07 , Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Costand
 Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost in  the first quarter of 2018. The standard requires non-service cost components of net periodic benefitcost
 to be presented in non-operating earnings using a retrospective transition method which will require us to restate 2016 and 2017 in the firstquarter
 of 2018. In addition, only service costs may be allocated to production costs and capitalized in inventory on a prospective basis effectiveJanuary 1, 2018. Adoption in the 
first quarter of 2018 is expected to result in a reclassification of non-service cost components of net periodic benefitcost of 
$6 in 2017 and $478 in  2016 from Earnings from Operations to Other income/(loss), net. We applied a practical expedient as the estimationbasis
 for this reclassification. Adoption of the new pension standard will not affect previously reported financial position, earnings per share, or cashflows.

 The  FAS/CAS  service  cost  adjustment  represents  the  difference  between  the  pension  and  postretirement  service  costs  calculated  underGenerally
 Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and costs allocated to the business segments which are based on U.S. Government CostAccounting
 Standards for our defense businesses. Restated Other income/(loss), net includes the non-service cost components of net periodicbenefit cost.
In
 addition to the income statement changes described above, adoption of ASC  Topic 606 is  expected to increase total assets and total liabilities atDecember
 31, 2017 and 2016 by approximately $20,000 and $19,000 primarily  due to classifying certain advances from customers  as liabilitiesunder the
 new standard, whereas these advances were netted against inventory under existing GAAP. Adoption of ASU No. 2017-07 has no impact on
 total assets and total liabilities. The new standards have no impact on cash flows reported in 2017 and 2016. The impact of the new revenuestandard
 on  our  2017  and  2016  financial  results  may  not  be  representative  of  the  impact  on  our  financial  position  and  operating  results  insubsequent
 years. ASC  Topic 606 requires  additional detailed disclosures regarding the Company’s contracts with customers, including disclosureof
 remaining  unsatisfied  performance  obligations,  in  the  first  quarter  of  2018  which  we  are  continuing  to  assess.  We  have  identified  andimplemented changes to the Company’s bus
iness processes, systems and controls to support adoption of the new standard.64

3 – Earnings Per ShareBasic
 and diluted earnings per share are computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method that determines earningsper
 share  for  common  shares  and  participating  securities.  The  undistributed  earnings  are  allocated  between  common  shares  and  participatingsecurities
 as if all earnings had been distributed during the period. Participating securities and common shares have equal rights to undistributedearnings.
Basic
 earnings  per  share  is  calculated  by  taking  net  earnings,  less  earnings  available  to  participating  securities,  divided  by  the  basic  weightedaverage common shares outstanding.
Diluted
 earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities, divided by the diluted weightedaverage common shares outstanding.

iluted earnings per share were as follows:(In millions - except per share amounts)

 On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was enacted. The TCJA revises the U.S. corporate income tax by, among otherthings,
 lowering the rate from 35% to 21% effective  January  1, 2018, implementing  a territorial  tax system  and imposing a one-time  tax ondeemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsid
iaries. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded provisional tax benefits of $1,210 related to the remeasurement
 of  our  net  U.S.  deferred  tax  liabilities  to  reflect  the  reduction  in  the  corporate  tax  rate.  We  also  recorded  a  provisional  taxexpense of 
$159 related to tax on non-U.S. activities resulting from the TCJA. (2) 
 In the third quarter of 2016, we recorded incremental tax benefits of $440 related  to the application of a 2012 Federal Court of Claims decisionwhich held that the tax basis in certain assets could be i
ncreased (tax basis adjustment).(3) 
 In the third quarter of 2016, a tax benefit of $177 was recorded as a result of the settlement of the 2011-2012 federal tax audit. (4) 
 In 2017 and 2016, we recorded excess tax benefits related to employee share-based payments of $207 and $105 . 68

 Included in the net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets as of December  31, 2017 and 2016 are  deferred tax assets in the amounts of $4,636 and $7,701 
related to Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets at December 31 were as follows:

(9,888 )  (14,502 ) Valuation allowance
(69 ) (95 )Net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets
($1,498 )  ($1,006 ) The
 deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of thedeferred tax assets will not be realized.
The
 TCJA one-time repatriation tax liability effectively taxed the undistributed earnings previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. We have notprovided
 for  foreign  withholding  tax  on  the  undistributed  earnings  from  our  non-U.S.  subsidiaries  because  such  earnings  are  considered  to  beindefinitely reinvested. If such earnings were to be distrib
uted, any foreign withholding tax would not be significant.In
 accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 the amounts recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017related
 to the TCJA represent reasonable estimates based on our analysis to date and are considered to be provisional and subject to revisionduring 2018. Provisional amounts were recorded for
 the repatriation tax, the remeasurement of our 2017 U.S. net deferred tax liabilities and ancillarystate
 tax effects. These amounts are considered to be provisional as we continue to assess available tax methods and elections and refine ourcomputations.
 In addition, further regulatory guidance related to the TCJA is expected to be issued in 2018 which may result in changes to ourcurrent
 estimates. Any revisions to the estimated impacts of TCJA will be recorded quarterly until the computations are complete which is expectedno later than 
the fourth quarter of 2018.As of 
December 31, 2017 and 2016 , the amounts accrued for the payment of income tax-relat ed interest and penalties included in the ConsolidatedStatements
 of Financial Position were not significant. The amounts of interest benefit included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations werenot significant for the 
years ended December  31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 . 69

$1,736   $1,557   $1,617 As
 of December  31 ,  2017, 2016 and 2015 ,  the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $1,736 , $1,557 and $1,617 ,  respectively, of which$1,568 
, $1,402 and $1,479 would affect the effective tax rate, if recognized. As of December 31, 2017 , these amounts are primarily associated with U.S.
 federal tax issues such as the amount of research tax credits claimed, the U.S. manufacturing activity tax benefit and tax basis adjustments.Also included in
 these amounts are accruals for domestic state tax issues such as the allocation of income among various state tax jurisdictions andthe amount of state tax credits claimed.
Federal income tax audits have been settled for all ye
ars prior to 2013. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) began the 2013-2014 federal tax audit inthe
 fourth quarter of 2016. We are also subject to examination in major state and non-U.S. jurisdictions for the 2001-2016 tax years. We believeappropriate provisions for all outstandin
g tax issues have been made for all jurisdictions and all open years.Audit
 outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 monthsunrecognized
 tax benefits related to federal and state matters under audit may decrease by up to $540 and $430 ,  respectively, based on currentestimates.

Table of ContentsUnder contract accounting unbillable receivables on long-term contracts
 arise when the sales or revenues based on performance attainment, thoughappropriately
 recognized, cannot be billed yet under terms of the contract as of the balance sheet date. Any adjustment for the credit quality ofunbill
able receivables, if required, would be recorded as a direct reduction of revenue. Factors considered in assessing the collectability of unbillablereceivables
 include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  a  customer’s  extended  delinquency,  requests  for  restructuring  and  filings  for  bankruptcy.  Unbillablereceivables
 related  to  commercial  customers  expected  to  be  collected  after  one  year  were $172 and $172 at December  31,  2017  and  2016 . Accounts

 determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts dueaccording
 to  the  original  contractual  terms.  At December  31,  2017 and 2016 ,  we  individually  evaluated  for  impairment  customer  financingreceivables
 of $77 and $55 ,  of  which $66 and $44 were  determined  to  be  impaired.  We  recorded  no  allowance  for  losses  on  these  impairedreceivables as the collateral values exc
eeded the carrying values of the receivables.Income
 recognition is generally suspended for financing receivables at the date full recovery of income and principal becomes not probable. Incomeis
 recognized when financing receivables become contractually current and performance is demonstrated by the customer . The average recordedinvestment in impaired financing receiva
bles for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $46 and the related interest income was insignificant.72

Table of ContentsThe
 change  in  the  allowance  for  losses  on  financing  receivables  for  the years  ended  December  31,  2017,  2016  and  2015 ,  consisted  of  thefollowing:

 adequacy of the allowance for losses is assessed quarterly. Three primary factors influencing the level of our allowance for losses on customerfinancing
 receivables  are  customer  credit  ratings,  default  rates  and  collateral  values.  We  assign  internal  credit  ratings  for  all  customers  anddetermine
 the creditworthiness of each customer based upon publicly available information and information obtained directly from our customers.Our rating categories are comparable to those used by the major credit rating agenc
ies.Our financing receivable balanc

December 31, 2017 ,  our allowance related to receivables with ratings of B, BB and BBB. We applied default rates that averaged 22.6% , 4.7%and 
0.9% to the exposure associated with those receivabl es.Customer Financing Exposure
Customer
 financing is collateralized by security in the related asset. The value of the collateral is closely tied to commercial airline performance andoverall
 market  conditions  and  may  be  subject  to  reduced  valuation  with  market  decline.  Declines  in  collateral  values  could  result  in  assetimpairments,
 reduced finance lease income, and an increase in the allowance for losses. Our customer financing collateral is concentrated in 747-8and out-of-production aircraft. Generally, out-of-production aircraft have experience
d greater collateral value declines than in-production aircraft.The majority of customer financing carrying values are concentrated in the fol

10 – Other AssetsSea Launch
At 
December 31, 2017 and 2016 ,  Other assets included $356 of  receivables related to our former investment in the Sea Launch venture whichbecame payable by certain Sea Lau
nch partners following Sea Launch’s bankruptcy filing in June 2009. The net amounts owed to Boeing by each ofthe
 partners are as follows: S.P. Koroley Rocket and Space Corporation Energia of Russia (RSC Energia) – $223 , PO Yuzhnoye Mashinostroitelny Zavod of Ukraine – 
$89 and KB Yuzhnoye of Ukraine – $44 .In
 2013, we filed an action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California seeking reimbursement from the other Sea Launchpartners.
 In 2016, the United States District Court for the Central District of California issued a judgment in favor of Boeing. Later that year, wereached
 an  agreement  which  we  believe  will  enable  us  to  recover  the  outstanding  receivable  balance  from  RSC  Energia  over  the  next  severalyears.
 We continue to pursue collection efforts against the former Ukrainian partners in connection with the court judgment. We continue to believethe
 partners have the financial wherewithal to pay and intend to pursue vigorously all of our rights and remedies. In the event we are unable tosecure reimbursement from RSC Energia and the Ukrainian S
ea Launch partners, we could incur additional charges.75

As of 
December  31, 2017 and 2016 ,  Other assets included $137 and $143 of  receivables related to indemnifications from Spirit AeroSystems, Inc.(Spirit), for costs
 incurred related to pension and retiree medical obligations of former Boeing employees who were subsequently employed by Spirit.During
 the  fourth  quarter  of  2014,  Boeing  filed  a  complaint  against  Spirit  in  the  Delaware  Superior  Court  seeking  to  enforce  our  rights  toindemnification
 and to  recover  from  Spirit  amounts  incurred  by Boeing for  pension and retiree  medical  obligations.  During  2017,  the  court  ruledagainst
 Boeing and denied our claim.  In January 2018, Boeing filed a notice of appeal with the Delaware Supreme Court. We believe we havesubstantial arguments on appeal an
d expect to fully recover from Spirit.Note

 31$1,211   $1,414 Commercial Aircraft Commitments
In
 conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certaincustomers
 that  give  them  the  right  to  trade  in  used  aircraft  at  a  specified  price  upon  the  purchase  of  Sale  Aircraft.  The  probability  that  trade-incommitments
 will be exercised is determined by using both quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative information from othersources.
 The probability of exercise is assessed quarterly, or as events trigger a change, and takes into consideration the current economic andairline
 industry environments. Trade-in commitments, which can be terminated by mutual consent with the customer, may be exercised only duringthe period specified in the agreement, and requ
ire advance notice by the customer.Trade-in
 commitment agreements at December  31, 2017 have  expiration dates from 2018 through 2026 .  At December 31, 2017 and 2016 ,  totalcontractual
 trade-in commitments were $1,462 and $1,485 .  As of December  31, 2017 and 2016 ,  we estimated that it was probable we would beobligated
 to  perform  on  certain  of  these  commitments  with  net  amounts  payable  to  customers  totaling $155 and $126 and  the  fair  value  of  therelated trade-in aircraft was 
$155 and $126 . Financing Commitments
Financing

$10,221 As
 of December  31, 2017 ,  all of these financing commitments related to customers we believe have less than investment-grade credit. We haveconcluded
 that no reserve for future potential losses is required for these financing commitments based upon the terms, such as collateralizationand interest rates, under which funding woul
d be provided.77

Table of ContentsStandby Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds
We
 have  entered  into  standby  letters  of  credit  and  surety  bonds  with  financial  institutions  primarily  relating  to  the  guarantee  of  our  futureperformance
 on  certain  contracts.  Contingent  liabilities  on  outstanding  letters  of  credit  agreements  and  surety  bonds  aggregated  approximately$3,708 
and $4,701 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 . Commitments to ULA
We
 and Lockheed Martin Corporation have each committed to provide ULA with additional capital contributions in the event ULA does not havesufficient fund
s to make a required payment to us under an inventory supply agreement. As of December 31, 2017 , ULA’s total remaining obligation to Boeing under the inventory supply agre
ement was $120 . See Note 6 .F/A-18
At 
December 31, 2017 ,  our backlog included 26 F/A-18 aircraft under contract with the U.S. Navy. We have begun work or authorized suppliers tobegin
 working  on  aircraft  beyond  those  already  in  backlog  in  anticipation  of  future  orders.  At December  31, 2017 ,  we had $155 of  capitalizedprecontract costs and 
$855 of potential termination liabilities to sup pliers associated with F/A-18 aircraft not yet ordered.Company Owned Life Insurance
McDonnell
 Douglas Corporation insured its executives with Company Owned Life Insurance (COLI), which are life insurance policies with a cashsurrender
 value. Although we do not use COLI currently, these obligations from the merger with McDonnell Douglas are still a commitment at thistime.
 We have loans in place to cover costs paid or incurred to carry the underlying life insurance policies. As of December 31,  2017 and 2016 , the cash
 surrender  value was $489 and $483 and  the  total  loans  were $470 and $456 .  As  we  have  the  right  to  offset  the  loans  against  the  cashsurrender
 value of the policies, we present the net asset in Other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 
. United States Government Defense Environment Overview
In
 November 2017, Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018 (FY2018), which authorizes a U.S. DoD budgettopline
 higher than the administration’s budget request from May. While the appropriations process for FY2018 remains incomplete, both the Houseand
 Senate appropriations committees have also produced bills that increase the U.S. DoD budget topline above the administration’s request .  OnFebruary
 9,  2018,  Congress  passed  a  fifth  Continuing  Resolution  that  maintains  current  funding  levels  through  March  23,  2018  and  includesincreases
 to  the  Budget  Control  Act  caps  for  defense  and  non-defense  spending  for  FY2018  and  FY2019.  However,  the  Budget  Control  Actcontinue
s to mandate limits on U.S. government discretionary spending and remains in effect. As a result, continued budget uncertainty and the riskof future sequestration cuts will remain unless Congress acts to repeal or susp
end this law.Funding
 timeliness also remains a risk. If Congress is unable to pass appropriations bills or an omnibus spending bill before the expiration of thecurrent
 Continuing Resolution, a government shutdown could result which may have impacts above and beyond those resulting from budget cuts,sequestration
 impacts  or  program-level  appropriations.  For  example,  requirements  to  furlough  employees  in  the  U.S.  DoD,  the  Department  ofTransportation,
 or  other  government  agencies  could  result  in  payment  delays,  impair  our  ability  to  perform  work  on  existing  contracts,  and/ornegatively impact future orders.
78

Table of ContentsIn
 addition,  there  continues  to  be  uncertainty  with  respect  to  program-level  appropriations  for  the  U.S.  DoD  and  other  government  agencies,including
 the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), within the overall budgetary framework described above. Future budget cutsor
 investment priority changes could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts couldhave a material effect on the results of the Company’s operations, financia
l position and/or cash flows.BDS Fixed-Price Development Contracts
Fixed-price
 development work is inherently uncertain and subject to significant variability in estimates of the cost and time required to complete thework.
 BDS fixed-price contracts with significant development work include Commercial Crew, Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker and commercialand
 military satellites. The operational and technical complexities of these contracts create financial risk, which could trigger termination provisions,order
 cancellations  or  other  financially  significant  exposure.  Changes  to  cost  and  revenue  estimates  could  result  in  lower  margins  or  materialcharges
 for reach-forward losses. For example, during 2017, we recorded additional reach-forward losses of $471 on  the KC-46A Tanker program.Moreover,
 this and our other fixed-price development programs remain subject to additional reach-forward losses if we experience further technicalor quality issues, schedule delays, or increase
d costs.KC-46A Tanker
In
 2011,  we  were  awarded  a  contract  from  the  U.S.  Air  Force  (USAF)  to  design,  develop,  manufacture  and  deliver  four  next  generation  aerialrefueling
 tankers. This Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) contract is a fixed-price incentive fee contract valued at $4.9 billion and involves
 highly  complex  designs  and  systems  integration.  In  2016,  the USAF authorized  two  low  rate  initial  production  (LRIP)  lots  for  7  and  12aircraft valued at 
$2.8 billion . In January 2017, the USAF authorized an additio nal LRIP lot for 15 aircraft valued at $2.1 billion.At 
December 31, 2017 , we had approximately $347 of capitalized precontract costs and $1,024 of potential termination liabilities to sup pliers.Recoverable Costs on Government Contracts
Our
 final incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and review for allowability by the U.S. government, which can result in payment demandsrelated to
 costs they believe should be disallowed. We work with the U.S. government to assess the merits of claims and where appropriate reservefor
 amounts disputed. If we are unable to satisfactorily resolve disputed costs, we could be required to record an earnings charge and/or providerefunds to the U.S. government.

 to  ULA In  2006,  we  agreed  to  indemnify  ULA  through  December  31,  2020  against  potential  non-recoverability  and  non-allowability
 of $1,360 of  Boeing  Delta  launch  program  inventory  included  in  contributed  assets  plus $1,860 of  inventory  subject  to  an  inventorysupply agreement which ends on 
March 31, 2021 . Since inception, ULA has consumed $1,288 of the $1,360 of inventory that was contributed by us and
 has yet to consume $72 . Under the inventory supply agreement, we have recorded revenues and cost of sales of $1,528 through December 31, 2017 
.  ULA has made payments of $1,740 to  us under the inventory supply agreement and we have made $48 of net indemnification paymentsto ULA.
We agreed to indemnify ULA against potenti
al losses that ULA may incur in the event ULA is unable to obtain certain additional contract pricing fromthe
 USAF for four satellite missions. In 2009, ULA filed a complaint before the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA) for a contractadjustment
 for the price of two of these missions, followed in 2011 by a subsequent notice of appeal with respect to a third mission. The USAF didnot
 exercise an option for a fourth mission prior to the expiration of the contract. During the second quarter of 2016, the ASBCA ruled that ULA isentitled
 to additional contract pricing for each of the three missions and remanded to the parties to negotiate appropriate pricing. During the fourthquarter
 of 2016, the USAF appealed the ASBCA’s ruling. In April 2017, the USAF withdrew its appeal. If ULA is ultimately unsuccessful in obtainingadditional
 pricing, we may be responsible for an indemnification payment up to $261 and  may record up to $277 in  pre-tax losses associated withthe 
three missions. Potential
 payments for Other Delta contracts include $85 related to deferred support costs and $91 related to deferred production costs. In June2011,
 the  Defense  Contract  Management  Agency  (DCMA)  notified  ULA  that  it  had  determined  that $271 of  deferred  support  costs  are  notrecoverable
 under government contracts. In December 2011, the DCMA notified ULA of the potential non-recoverability of an additional $114 of deferred production costs. ULA and Boeing b
elieve that all costs are recoverable and in November80

Table of Contents2011,
 ULA filed a certified claim with the USAF for collection of deferred support and production costs. The USAF issued a final decision denyingULA’s certified
 claim in May 2012. In 2012, Boeing and ULA filed a suit in the Court of Federal Claims seeking recovery of the deferred support andproduction
 costs from the U.S. government, which subsequently asserted a counterclaim for credits that it alleges were offset by deferred supportcost
 invoices. We believe that the U.S. government’s counterclaim is without merit. The discovery phase of the litigation completed in 2017, andduring
 the fourth quarter, Boeing filed a motion for summary judgment for full recovery of its costs. If, contrary to our belief, it is determined thatsome
 or all of the deferred support or production costs are not recoverable, we could be required to record pre-tax losses and make indemnificationpayments to ULA for up to 
$317 of the costs questioned by the DCMA. Other Indemnifications 
In conjunction with our  sales of Electron Dynamic Devices, Inc. and Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power businesses and ourBCA
 facilities in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma, we agreed to indemnify, for an indefinite period, the buyers for costs relatingto pre-closing environm
ental conditions and certain other items. We are unable to assess the potential number of future claims that may be assertedunder
 these indemnifications, nor the amounts thereof (if any). As a result, we cannot estimate the maximum potential amount of future paymentsunder these
 indemnities and therefore, no liability has been recorded. To the extent that claims have been made under these indemnities and/or areprobable and reasonably estima
ble, liabilities associated with these indemnities are included in the environmental liability disclosure in Note 11 .Credit Guarantees 
We have issued credit guarantees where  we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event that the originallessee
 or  debtor  does not  make  payments  or  perform  certain  specified  services.  Generally,  these  guarantees  have been extended  on behalf  ofguaranteed
 parties  with  less  than  investment-grade  credit  and  are  collateralized  by certain  assets.  Current  outstanding  credit  guarantees  expirethrough 
2036 . Industrial Revenue Bonds
Industrial
 Revenue Bonds (IRB) issued by St. Louis County were used to finance the purchase and/or construction of real and personal property atour
 St. Louis site. Tax benefits associated with IRBs include a twelve-year property tax abatement and sales tax exemption from St. Louis County.We
 record  these  properties  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Financial  Position.  We  have  also  purchased  the  IRBs  and  therefore  are  thebondholders
 as well as the borrower/lessee of the properties purchased with the IRB proceeds. The liabilities and IRB assets are equal and arereported net in the Consolidated Statements of Financ

December 31, 2017 and 2016 , the assets and liabilities associated with the IRBs w ere $166 and $64 .Note

14 – Postretirement PlansThe
 majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that hadparticipated in defined benefit pe
nsion plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016.We fund our major pension plans through trusts. Pension assets are pl
aced in trust solely for the benefit of the plans’ participants, and are structuredto
 maintain liquidity that is sufficient to pay benefit obligations as well as to keep pace over the long-term with the growth of obligations for futurebenefit payments.
We
 also have other postretirement benefits (OPB) other than pensions which consist principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees andqualifying
 dependents, and to a lesser extent, life insurance to certain groups of retirees. Retiree health care is provided principally until age 65 forapproximately
 half those retirees who are eligible for health care coverage. Certain employee groups, including employees covered by most UnitedAuto
 Workers bargaining agreements, are provided lifetime health care coverage. The funded status of the plans is measured as the differencebetween the plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligatio
n (PBO). We have recognized the aggregate of all overfunded plans in Otherassets,
 and the aggregate of all underfunded plans in either Accrued retiree health care or Accrued pension plan liability, net. The portion of theamount by
 which the actuarial present value of benefits included in the PBO exceeds the fair value of plan assets, payable in the next 12 months, isreflected in Accrued liabilities.

The
 following assumptions, which are the weighted average for all plans, are used to calculate the benefit obligation at December 31 of each yearand the net periodic benefit cost for the subsequent year.
December 31,
2017  2016  2015 Discount rate:
        Pension
3.60 % 4.00 % 4.20 %Other postretirement benefits
3.30 % 3.70 % 3.80 %Expected return on plan assets
6.80 % 6.80 % 7.00 %Rate of compensation increase
5.30 % 4.40 % 4.00 %The
 discount rate for each plan is determined based on the plans’ expected future benefit payments using a yield curve developed from high qualitybonds that
 are rated as Aa or better by at least half of the four rating agencies utilized as of the measurement date. The yield curve is fitted to yieldsdeveloped
 from bonds at various maturity points. Bonds with the ten percent highest and the ten percent lowest yields are omitted. A portfolio ofabout
 400 bonds is used to construct the yield curve. Since corporate bond yields are generally not available at maturities beyond 30 years, it isassumed that
 spot rates will remain level beyond that 30-year point. The present value of each plan’s benefits is calculated by applying the discountrates to projected benefit cash flows. All bonds are U.S. issues, with a minimum outstand
ing of $50.The pension fund’s expected return on plan assets
 assumption is derived from a review of actual historical returns achieved by the pension trust andanticipated
 future long-term performance of individual asset classes. While consideration is given to recent trust performance and historical returns,the
 assumption represents a long-term, prospective return. The expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic benefit cost for theupcoming
 plan year is determined based on the expected return on plan assets assumption and the market-related value of plan assets (MRVA).Since
 our adoption of the accounting standard for pensions in 1987, we have determined the MRVA based on a five -year moving average of planassets. As of 
December 31, 2017 , the MRVA was approximately $2,260 less than the fair market value of assets. 85

2021  2021  2021 Assumed
 health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. To determine the health care costtrend rates we look at a combination of information includi
ng ongoing claims cost monitoring, annual statistical analyses of claims data, reconciliationof
 forecast claims against actual claims, review of trend assumptions of other plan sponsors and national health trends, and adjustments for plandesign
 changes, workforce changes, and changes in plan participant behavior. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trendrates would have the following effect:

Investment Strategy 
The overall  objective of our pension assets is to earn a rate of return over time to satisfy the benefit obligations of the pensionplans
 and to maintain sufficient liquidity to pay benefits and address other cash requirements of the pension fund. Specific investment objectives forour
 long-term  investment  strategy  include  reducing  the  volatility  of  pension  assets  relative  to  pension  liabilities,  achieving  a  competitive  totalinvestment
 return, achieving diversification between and within asset classes and managing other risks. Investment objectives for each asset classare determined based on specific risks and investment op
portunities identified.We
 periodically update our long-term, strategic asset allocations. We use various analytics to determine the optimal asset mix and consider planliability
 characteristics, liquidity characteristics, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. We identify investmentbenchmarks
 to evaluate performance for the asset classes in the strategic asset allocation that are market-based and investable where possible.Actual allocations to
 each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy changes, market value fluctuations, the lengthof
 time it takes to fully implement investment allocation positions, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. Short-term investments andexchange-traded
 derivatives are used to rebalance the actual asset allocation to the target asset allocation. The asset allocation is monitored andrebalanced on a monthly basis. The actual a
nd target allocations by asset class for the pension assets at December 31 were as follows: 
Actual Allocations   Target Allocations Asset Class
2017  2016  2017  2016 Fixed income
46 % 48 % 47 % 47 %Global equity

Table of ContentsFixed
 income  securities  are  invested  primarily  in  a  diversified  portfolio  of  long  duration  instruments.  Global  equity  securities  are  invested  in  adiversified portfolio of U.S. and non-U.S. companies, across various i
ndustries and market capitalizations.Real
 estate and real assets include global private investments that may be held through an investment in a limited partnership (LP) or other fundstructures
 and publicly traded investments (such as Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in the case of real estate). Real estate includes, but isnot
 limited to, investments in office, retail, apartment and industrial properties. Real assets include, but are not limited to, investments in naturalresources
 (such  as  energy,  farmland  and  timber),  commodities  and  infrastructure.  Private  equity  investment  vehicles  are  primarily  limitedpartnerships (LPs) that mainly invest in U.S. and non-U.S. leveraged b
uyout, venture capital and special situation strategies.Hedge
 fund investments  seek to capitalize on inefficiencies  identified across and within different  asset classes or markets.  Hedge fund strategytypes include, but are not limited to directional, event driven, relativ
e value, long-short and multi-strategy.Investment
 managers are retained for explicit investment  roles specified by contractual  investment  guidelines. Certain investment  managers areauthorized
 to use derivatives, such as equity or bond futures, swaps, options and currency futures or forwards. Derivatives are used to achieve thedesired
 market  exposure  of  a  security  or  an  index,  transfer  value-added  performance  between  asset  classes,  achieve  the  desired  currencyexposure, adjust portfolio duration or rebalanc
e the total portfolio to the target asset allocation.As
 a percentage of total pension plan assets, derivative net notional amounts were 5.0% and 6.0% for  fixed income, including to-be-announcedmortgage-backed securities and treasury forwards, and 
6.9% and 1.2% for global equity and commodities at December 31, 2017 and 2016 . In
 August 2017, the Company elected to contribute $3,500 of  our common stock to the pension fund. An independent fiduciary was retained tomanage
 and liquidate the stock over time at its discretion. The liquidation of the common stock holdings was completed during the fourth quarter of2017.
Risk
 Management In  managing  the  plan  assets,  we  review  and  manage  risk  associated  with  funded  status  risk,  interest  rate  risk,  market  risk,counterparty
 risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. Liability matching and asset class diversification are central to our risk management approachand
 are  integral  to  the  overall  investment  strategy.  Further,  asset  classes  are  constructed  to  achieve  diversification  by  investment  strategy,  byinvestment manager, by industry or
 sector and by holding. Investment manager guidelines for publicly traded assets are specified and are monitoredregularly
 through  the  custodian.  Credit  parameters  for  counterparties  have  been  established  for  managers  permitted  to  trade  over-the-counterderivatives.
 Valuation  is  governed  through  several  types  of  procedures,  including  reviews  of  manager  valuation  policies,  custodian  valuationprocesses, pricing vendor practices, pricing reconcil
iation, and periodic, security-specific valuation testing . 87

Table of ContentsFair Value Measurements 
The  following table presents our plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of December 31,  2017 and 2016 . The fair value
 hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based onquoted
 prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and Level 3includes fair values estimated using sig
nificant unobservable inputs.

 income  securities  are  primarily  valued  upon  a  market  approach,  using  matrix  pricing  and  considering  a  security’s  relationship  to  othersecurities
 for which quoted prices in an active market may be available, or an income approach, converting future cash flows to a single presentvalue amount. Inputs used in developi
ng fair value estimates include reported trades, broker quotes, benchmark yields, and base spreads.Common/collective/pooled
 funds are typically common or collective trusts valued at their NAVs that are calculated by the investment manager orsponsor
 of the fund and have daily or monthly liquidity. Derivatives included in the table above are over-the-counter and are primarily valued usingan
 income approach with inputs that include benchmark yields, swap curves, cash flow analysis, rating agency data and interdealer broker rates.Exchang
e-traded derivative positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflectedin the payables and receivabl
es portion of the table.Cash
 equivalents and other short-term investments (which are used to pay benefits) are held in a separate account which consists of a commingledfund
 (with daily liquidity) and separately held short-term securities and cash equivalents. All of the investments in this cash vehicle are valued dailyusing
 a  market  approach  with  inputs  that  include  quoted  market  prices  for  similar  instruments.  In  the  event  a  market  price  is  not  available  forinstruments
 with  an  original  maturity  of  one  year  or  less,  amortized  cost  is  used  as  a  proxy  for  fair  value.  Common  and  preferred  stock  equitysecurities are primarily valued using a market approach b
ased on the quoted market prices of identical instruments.Private
 equity  and  private  debt  NAV  valuations  are  based  on  the  valuation  of  the  underlying  investments,  which  include  inputs  such  as  cost,operating
 results, discounted future cash flows and market based comparable data. For those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis(primarily LPs) we use NAVs, adjusted for subsequent cash flows a
nd significant events.Real
 estate and real asset NAV valuations are based on valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, discountedfuture
 cash  flows,  independent  appraisals  and  market  based  comparable  data.  For  those  investments  reported  on  a  one-quarter  lagged  basis(primarily
 LPs) NAVs are adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events. Publicly traded REITs and infrastructure stocks are valuedusing
 a market approach based on quoted market prices of identical instruments. Exchange-traded commodities futures positions are reported inaccordance with changes in dai
ly variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table.Hedge
 fund  NAVs  are  generally  based  on  the  valuation  of  the  underlying  investments.  This  is  primarily  done  by  applying  a  market  or  incomevaluation methodology dep
ending on the specific type of security or instrument held.Investments
 in private equity, private debt, real estate, real assets, and hedge funds are primarily calculated and reported by the General Partner(GP),
 fund manager or third party administrator. Additionally, some investments in fixed income and equity are made via commingled vehicles andare
 valued in a similar fashion. Pension assets invested in commingled and limited partnership structures rely on the NAV of these investments asthe practical expedient for the valuations.

 the plans are terminated within five years thereafter, the assets in the plan first will be used to provide the level of retirement benefits requiredby 
ERISA ,  and then any surplus will be used to fund a trust to continue present and future payments under the postretirement medical and lifeinsurance benefits in our group insuranc
e benefit programs.Should
 we terminate certain pension plans under conditions in which the plan’s assets exceed that plan’s obligations, the U.S. government will beentitled to a fair allocation of any of the plan’s assets base
d on plan contributions that were reimbursed under U.S. government contracts.Defined Contribution Plans
We
 provide certain defined contribution plans to all eligible employees. The principal plans are the Company-sponsored 401(k) plans. The expensefor these defined contribution plans was 
$1,522 , $1,413 and $768 in 2017, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Note

Our
 2003 Incentive Stock Plan, as amended and restated, permits awards of incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights,restricted
 stock or units, performance shares, performance restricted stock or units, performance units and other stock and cash-based awards toour
 employees, officers, directors, consultants, and independent contractors. The aggregate number of shares of our stock authorized for issuanceunder the plan is 
87,000,000 . Shares
 issued as a result of stock option exercises or conversion of stock unit awards will be funded out of treasury shares, except to the extentthere
 are insufficient treasury shares, in which case new shares will be issued. We believe we currently have adequate treasury shares to satisfythese issuances during 
2018 . 91

Performance-
Based Restricted Stock Units (PBRSUs) are stock units that pay out based on the Company’s total shareholder return as compared toa
 group of peer companies over a three-year period. The award payout can range from 0% to 200% of  the initial PBRSU grant, but will not exceed400% 
of  the initial value (excluding dividend equivalent credits). The PBRSUs granted under this program will vest at the payout amount and settlein
 common stock (on a one-for-one basis) on the third anniversary of the grant date. If an executive terminates employment because of retirement,involuntary
 layoff,  disability,  or death,  the  employee (or  beneficiary)  remains  eligible under the  award and, if the  award is earned,  will receive  aproration
 of stock units based on active employment during the three-year service period. In all other cases, the PBRSUs will not vest and all rightsto the stock units will terminate.
In
 February  2017,  2016 and 2015 ,  we  granted  to  our  executives 492,273 , 721,176 and 556,203 PBRSUs  as  part  of  our  long-term  incentiveprogram.
 Compensation expense for the award is recognized over the three-year performance period based upon the grant date fair value. Thegrant
 date  fair  values  were  estimated  using  a  Monte-Carlo  simulation  model  with  the  assumptions  presented  below.  The  model  includes  noexpected dividend yield as

17 – Derivative Financial InstrumentsCash Flow Hedges
Our
 cash flow hedges include foreign currency forward contracts and commodity purchase contracts. We use foreign currency forward contracts tomanage
 currency  risk  associated  with  certain  transactions,  specifically  forecasted  sales  and  purchases  made  in  foreign  currencies.  Our  foreigncurrency
 contracts  hedge  forecasted  transactions  through 2024 .  We  use  commodity  derivatives,  such  as  fixed-price  purchase  commitments  tohedge
 against potentially unfavorable price changes for items used in production. Our commodity contracts hedge forecasted transactions through2021 
. Fair Value Hedges
Interest
 rate swaps under which we agree to pay variable rates of interest are designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate debt. The net change infair value of the derivatives and the hedged items is reported in B

Table of ContentsWe
 have derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features. For foreign exchange contracts with original maturities of at least fiveyears,
 our  derivative  counterparties  could  require  settlement  if  we  default  on  our  five-year  credit  facility.  For  certain  commodity  contracts,  ourcounterparties
 could require collateral posted in an amount determined by our credit ratings. The fair value of foreign exchange and commoditycontracts
 that have credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position at December 31, 2017 was $13 . At December 31, 2017 , there was no collateral posted related to our derivatives.
Note 
18 – Significant Group Concentrations of RiskCredit Risk
Financial
 instruments involving potential credit risk are predominantly with commercial aircraft customers and the U.S. government. Of the $13,639 in gross accounts receivable and gross customer financing include
d in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2017 , $5,572 
related  predominantly  to  commercial  aircraft  customers  ( $2,512 of  accounts  receivable  and $3,060 of  customer  financing)  and $5,989 related to the U.S. government.
Of
 the $3,061 in  gross  customer  financing, $1,828 related  to  customers  we  believe  have  less  than  investment-grade  credit  including  Silk  Way,American,
 and Hawaiian Airlines who were associated with 14% , 8% , and 7% , respectively, of our financing portfolio. Financing for aircraft iscollateralized by security in the related asset and i
n some instances security in other assets as well.Other Risk
As of 
December 31, 2017 , approximately 37% of our total workforce was represented by collective bargaini ng agreements.Note 
19 – Fair Value MeasurementsThe
 fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determinedbased
 on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs andLevel 3 includes fair values estimated
 using significant unobservable inputs. The following table presents our assets and liabilities that are measuredat fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized usi

Table of ContentsMoney
 market funds, available-for-sale debt investments and equity securities are valued using a market approach based on the quoted marketprices or broker/dealer quotes of identical or comparable i
nstruments.Derivatives
 include foreign  currency,  commodity  and interest  rate  contracts.  Our  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  are valued using an incomeapproach
 based on the present value of the forward rate less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valuedusing
 an income approach based on the present value of the commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Thefair value of our interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analys
is based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve.Certain
 assets  have  been  measured  at  fair  value  on  a  nonrecurring  basis  using  significant  unobservable  inputs  (Level  3).  The  following  tablepresents
 the nonrecurring losses recognized for the years ended December 31 due to long-lived asset impairment, and the fair value and assetclassification of the related assets as of the impairment date:

 Acquired  intangible  assets  and  Property,  plant  and  equipment  were  primarily  valued  using  an  income  approach  based  on  thediscounted
 cash flows associated with the underlying assets. The fair value of the impaired operating lease equipment is derived by calculating amedian
 collateral value from a consistent group of third party aircraft value publications. The values provided by the third party aircraft publicationsare derived from their knowledge of market trades
 and other market factors. Management reviews the publications quarterly to assess the continuedappropriateness
 and consistency with market trends. Under certain circumstances, we adjust values based on the attributes and condition of thespecific
 aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered bythird party publications, or on the expected net sales price for the aircraft.

 notes receivable are estimated with discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates currently offered on loans with similar termsto borrowers of similar credit quality. The
 fair value of our debt that is traded in the secondary market is classified as Level 2 and is based on currentmarket yields. For
 our debt that is not traded in the secondary market, the fair value is classified as Level 2 and is based on our indicative borrowingcost
 derived  from  dealer  quotes  or  discounted  cash  flows.  The  fair  values  of  our  debt  classified  as  Level  3  are  based  on  discounted  cash  flowmodels
 using the implied yield from similar securities. With regard to other financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, it is not practicable toestimate
 the fair value of our indemnifications and financing commitments because the amount and timing of those arrangements are uncertain.Items not
 included in the above disclosures include cash, restricted cash, time deposits and other deposits, commercial paper, money market funds,Accounts receivable, Accounts payabl
e and long-term payables. The carrying values of those items, as reflected in the100

Table of ContentsConsolidated
 Statements of Financial Position, approximate their fair value at December  31, 2017 and 2016 .  The fair value of assets and liabilitieswhose carrying value approximates fair value is d
etermined using Level 2 inputs, with the exception of cash (Level 1).Note 
20 – Legal ProceedingsVarious legal proceedin
gs, claims and investigations related to products, contracts, employment and other matters are pending against us.In
 addition, we are subject to various U.S. government inquiries and investigations from which civil, criminal or administrative proceedings couldresult or have resulted in the past. Such proceedings inv
olve or could involve claims by the government for fines, penalties, compensatory and trebledamages, restitution and/or forfeitures.
 Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or subdivisions, can alsobe
 suspended or debarred from government contracts, or lose its export privileges, based on the results of investigations. We believe, based uponcurrent
 information, that the outcome of any such legal proceeding, claim, or government dispute and investigation will not have a material effect onour financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

We
 have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December  31, 2017 , based
 on  criteria  established  in Internal  Control  –  Integrated  Framework  (2013) issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  theTreadway
 Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reportingas of 
December 31, 2017 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (201 3) issued by COSO.We
 have  also  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)  (PCAOB),  theconsolidated
 financial statements as of and for the year ended December  31, 2017 ,  of the Company and our report dated February  12, 2018 , expressed an unqualified o
pinion on those financial statements.Basis for Opinion
The
 Company’s  management  is  responsible  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  for  its  assessment  of  theeffectiveness
 of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  the  accompanying  Management’s  Report  on  Internal  Control  Over  FinancialReporting.
 Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a publicaccounting
 firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federalsecurities laws and the applicab
le rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We
 conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtainreasonable
 assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit includedobtaining
 an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating thedesign
 and  operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control  based  on  the  assessed  risk,  and  performing  such  other  procedures  as  we  considerednecessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reaso
nable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control
 over Financial ReportingA
 company’s  internal  control  over  financial reporting  is a process  designed to  provide  reasonable assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financialreporting
 and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  Acompany’s
 internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, inreasonab
le detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance thattransactions
 are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,and
 that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors  of thecompany;
 and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use,  or  disposition  of  thecompany’s
 assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financialreporting
 may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk thatcontrols
 may  become  inadequate  because  of  changes  in  conditions,  or  that  the  degree  of  compliance  with  the  policies  or  procedures  maydeteriorate.
