 Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of thehardware
 and  software  integration  and  demonstrate  the  unique  solutions  that  are  available  on  its  products.  The  Company  further  believes  providing  directcontact

pport experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers.To

 capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide. The Company’s retail stores are typically located at high-traffic locations inquality

CompetitionThe
 markets  for  the  Company’s  products  and  services  are  highly  competitive  and  the  Company  is  confronted  by  aggressive  competition  in  all  areas  of  itsbusiness. These markets
 are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilitiesand
 use of mobile communication and media devices, personal computers and other digital electronic devices. The Company’s competitors that sell mobiledevices
 and personal computers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain marketshare.
 The  Company’s  financial  condition  and  operating  results  can  be  adversely  affected  by  these  and  other  industry-wide  downward  pressures  on  grossmargins.
 Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product features (including security features), relative price and performance,product
 quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service andsupport and corporate reputation.
The
 Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to personal computers and mobile communication and media devices. These marketsare
 highly  competitive  and  include  many  large,  well-funded  and  experienced  participants.  The  Company  expects  competition  in  these  markets  to  intensifysignificantly
 as  competitors  attempt  to  imitate  some  of  the  features  of  the  Company’s  products  and  applications  within  their  own  products  or,  alternatively,collaborate
 with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. These markets are characterized by aggressive pricingpractices,
 frequent  product  introductions,  evolving  design  approaches  and  technologies,  rapid  adoption  of  technological  and  product  advancements  bycompetitors and price se
nsitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.The
 Company’s digital content services have faced significant competition from other companies promoting their own digital music and content products andservices, including those of
fering free peer-to-peer music and video services.The
 Company’s future financial condition and operating results depend on the Company’s ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative products andservices
 in each of the markets in which it competes. The Company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including thehardware
 (iOS devices, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV), software (iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS), online services and distribution of digital content andapplications (Internet Services). Some of
 the Company’s current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such productsand services at little o
r no profit or even at a loss to compete with the Company’s offerings.Supply of Components
Although
 most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, a number of components are currently obtainedfrom
 single or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication andmedia
 devices and personal computers. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are attimes
 subject to industry-wide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operatingresults.
The
 Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and the Company often utilizes custom components availablefrom
 only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured ormanufacturing
 capacity has increased. If the Company’s supply of components were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments ofcompleted
 products to the Company, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Company’s businessand financial performance cou
ld also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or toidentify
 and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected ifthose suppliers concentrated on the product
ion of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.The Company
 has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend orrenew
 these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases thatcould materially adversely affec
t its financial condition and operating results.While
 some Mac computers are manufactured  in the U.S. and Ireland, substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are currently manufactured  byoutsourcing
 partners that are located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcingpartners,
 often  in  single  locations.  Certain  of  these  outsourcing  partners  are  the  sole-sourced  suppliers  of  components  and  manufacturers  for  many  of  theCompany’s
 products. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company’s operating results could beadversely
 affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations typicallycover its requirements for pe
riods up to 150 days.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K |

Research and DevelopmentBecause
 the  industries  in  which  the  Company  competes  are  characterized  by  rapid  technological  advances,  the  Company’s  ability  to  compete  successfullydepends
 heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Companycontinues
 to develop new technologies  to enhance  existing products  and to expand  the range of its product offerings  through  R&D, licensing of intellectualproperty and acquisition of thi
rd-party businesses and technology. Total R&D expense was $ 10.0 billion , $ 8.1 billion and $ 6.0 billion in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
Patents, Trademarks, Copyrigh
ts and LicensesThe
 Company  currently  holds  rights  to  patents  and  copyrights  relating  to  certain  aspects  of  its  hardware  devices,  accessories,  software  and  services.  TheCompany
 has registered or has applied for trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries. Although the Company believes theownership
 of such patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on suchownership, the Company r
elies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.The Company
 regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development and design, and is currently pursuing thousands ofpatent
 applications  around  the  world.  Over  time,  the  Company  has  accumulated  a  large  portfolio  of  issued  patents  around  the  world.  The  Company  holdscopyrights relating
 to certain aspects of its products and services. No single patent or copyright is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products. TheCompany believes the duration of 
its patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products.Many
 of the Company’s products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renewlicenses
 relating  to  various  aspects  of  its  products,  processes  and  services.  While  the  Company  has  generally  been  able  to  obtain  such  licenses  oncommercially
 reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Because oftechnological
 changes in the industries in which the Company competes, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it ispossible
 that certain components of the Company’s products, processes and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights ofothers. From time to time, the Compan
y has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.Foreign and Domestic Operations and Geographic 
DataDuring 
2016 ,  the Company’s domestic and international net sales accounted for 35% and 65%, respectively, of total net sales. Information regarding financialdata by geographic segment is set forth in Part II,
 Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the subheading “Segment Operating Performance,” and in Part II, Item 8 of thisForm 10-K in the Notes to Conso
lidated Financial Statements in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data.”While
 some Mac computers are manufactured  in the U.S. and Ireland, substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are currently manufactured  byoutsourcing
 partners  that  are  located  primarily  in  Asia.  The  supply  and  manufacture  of  a  number  of  components  is  performed  by  sole-sourced  outsourcingpartners
 in the U.S., Asia and Europe. Margins on sales of the Company’s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include componentsobtained
 from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffsand
 antidumping penalties. Information regarding concentration in the available sources of supply of materials and products is set forth in Part II, Item 8 of thisForm 10-K in the Notes to Conso
lidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies.”Business Seasonality and Product Introductions
The
 Company  has  historically  experienced  higher  net  sales  in  its  first  quarter  compared  to  other  quarters  in  its  fiscal  year  due  in  part  to  seasonal  holidaydemand. Additionally,
 new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Product introductions can also impactthe
 Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction, and often,channel
 inventory of a particular product declines as the next related major product launch approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers anddistributors
 anticipate a product introduction. However, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be consideredreliable indicator
s of the Company’s future pattern of product introductions, future net sales or financial performance.Warranty
The
 Company  offers  a  limited  parts  and  labor  warranty  on  most  of  its  hardware  products.  The  basic  warranty  period  is  typically  one  year  from  the  date  ofpurchase
 by the original end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Company’s hardware products. Incertain
 jurisdictions, local law requires that manufacturers guarantee their products for a period prescribed by statute, typically at least two years. In addition,where available, consumers may
 purchase APP or AC+, which extends service coverage on many of the Company’s hardware products.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K |

BacklogIn
 the Company’s experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. Inparticular, backlog ofte
n increases immediately following new product introductions as customers anticipate shortages. Backlog is often reduced once customersbelieve they can
 obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company’s ability to achieve anyparticular level of revenue
 or financial performance.Employees
As of 
September 24, 2016 , the Company had  approximately 116,000 full-time equivalent employees.Available Information

Item 1A.Risk Factors The following discussion of
 risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this Form10-K.
 The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperations” and the consolidated finan
cial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.The
 business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, includingbut
 not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company’s actual financial condition and operatingresults
 to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materiallyand adversely affect
 the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results and stock price.Because of the following factor
s, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should notbe considered to be a reliable 
indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely af
fect the Company.The
 Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Uncertainty about global and regional economicconditions
 poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, higher unemployment, financial market volatility,government
 austerity  programs,  negative  financial  news,  declines  in  income  or  asset  values  and/or  other  factors.  These  worldwide  and  regional  economicconditions
 could have a material adverse effect on demand for the Company’s products and services. Demand also could differ materially from the Company’sexpectations
 as a result of currency fluctuations because the Company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the U.S. to correspond withthe
 effect of a strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Other factors that could influence worldwide or regional demand include changes in fuel and other energy costs,conditions
 in  the  real  estate  and  mortgage  markets,  unemployment,  labor  and  healthcare  costs,  access  to  credit,  consumer  confidence  and  othermacroeconomic
 factors affecting consumer spending behavior. These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the Company’sproducts and services.
In
 the  event  of  financial  turmoil  affecting  the  banking  system  and  financial  markets,  additional  consolidation  of  the  financial  services  industry,  or  significantfinancial
 service institution failures, there could be tightening in the credit markets, low liquidity and extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency and equitymarkets.
 This could have a number of effects on the Company’s business, including the insolvency or financial instability of outsourcing partners or suppliers ortheir
 inability to obtain credit to finance development and/or manufacture products resulting in product delays; inability of customers, including channel partners,to
 obtain  credit  to  finance  purchases  of  the  Company’s  products;  failure  of  derivative  counterparties  and  other  financial  institutions;  and  restrictions  on  theCompany’s
 ability to issue new debt. Other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the saleor
 exchange of financial instruments; impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments; changes in interestrates; increases or decreases
 in cash balances; volatility in foreign exchange rates; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments. Increased volatility in thefinancial
 markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the future on the Company’s financial instrumentsdiffering significantly from th
e fair values currently assigned to them.Global markets for the Company’s p
roducts and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may beunable to compete effectively in these markets.
The
 Company’s products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressureon
 gross  margins,  frequent  introduction  of  new  products,  short  product  life  cycles,  evolving  industry  standards,  continual  improvement  in  productprice/performance character
istics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers.The
 Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, servicesand
 technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including thehardware,
 operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. TheCompany
 currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register numerous patents, trademarks andservice
 marks.  In  contrast,  many  of  the  Company’s  competitors  seek  to  compete  primarily  through  aggressive  pricing  and  very  low  cost  structures,  andemulating
 the Company's products and infringing on its intellectual property. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new productswith
 attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could beadversely affected.

The  Company  markets  certain  mobile  communication  and  media  devices  based  on  the  iOS  mobile  operating  system  and  also  markets  related  services,including
 third-party  digital  content  and  applications.  The  Company  faces  substantial  competition  in  these  markets  from  companies  that  have  significanttechnical, marketing, di
stribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships; and the Company hasa minority market
 share in the global smartphone market. Additionally, the Company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling pricesand
 attempt to imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutionsthat
 are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Companyalso
 competes  with  illegitimate  means  to  obtain  third-party  digital  content  and  applications.  Some  of  the  Company’s  competitors  have  greater  experience,product
 breadth and distribution channels than the Company. Because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and/or experienceand
 a lower cost structure, they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company also expects competition tointensify
 as competitors attempt to imitate the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaborativelyto
 offer integrated solutions. The Company’s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually improve iOSand iOS devices in order to ma
intain their functional and design advantages.The
 Company is the only authorized maker of hardware using macOS, which has a minority market share in the personal computer market. This market hasbeen
 contracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably Windows. In the market for personal computers andaccessories,
 the Company faces a significant number of competitors, many of which have broader product lines, lower priced products and a larger installedcustomer
 base. Historically, consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors. Price competition has been particularly intense as competitors haveaggressively
 cut prices and lowered product margins. An increasing number of internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller andsimpler
 than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the Company’s existing products. The Company’s financial condition and operatingresults also depend on its abi
lity to continually improve the Mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages.There can be no assurance the Company w
ill be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.To remain competitive and stimulate custo
mer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions.Due
 to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products,services
 and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and successfullymanage
 the transition to these new and upgraded products. The success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limitedto,
 timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-upissues,
 the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipatedproduct
 demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products mayhave quality or other defects or defi
ciencies in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of newproduct introductions 
and transitions.The Company depends on the performance of dis
tributors, carriers and other resellers.The
 Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, national and regional retailers and value-added resellers, many of whomdistribute
 products  from  competing  manufacturers.  The  Company  also  sells  its  products  and  third-party  products  in  most  of  its  major  markets  directly  toeducation, enterprise and government custo
mers and consumers and small and mid-sized businesses through its online and retail stores.Some
 carriers  providing  cellular  network  service  for  iPhone  subsidize  users’  purchases  of  the  device.  There  is  no  assurance  that  such  subsidies  will  becontinued
 at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company’s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with newcarriers.
Many
 resellers have been adversely affected in the past by weak economic conditions. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs toenhance reseller sales,
 including staffing selected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. Theseprograms
 could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue. The financial condition of these resellers couldweaken, these resellers cou
ld stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could causeresellers to reduce their o
rdering and marketing of the Company’s products.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K |

The Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.The
 Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable valueand
 accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company also reviews its long-lived assets, includingcapital
 assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of anasset may not be recoverable. If the Compan
y determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying valueof
 the assets exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its provisions related to inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assetsand
 purchase commitments are currently adequate, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid andunpredictable pace of product obsoles
cence in the industries in which the Company competes.The
 Company  must  order  components  for  its  products  and  build  inventory  in  advance  of  product  announcements  and  shipments.  Consistent  with  industrypractice,
 components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts and open orders, in each case based on projecteddemand.
 Manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. Because theCompany’s markets are volatile, c
ompetitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order orproduce excess or insuffic
ient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.Future operating results depend upon the Co
mpany’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.Because
 the  Company  currently  obtains  components  from  single  or  limited  sources,  the  Company  is  subject  to  significant  supply  and  pricing  risks.  Manycomponents,
 including  those  that  are  available  from  multiple  sources,  are  at  times  subject  to  industry-wide  shortages  and  significant  commodity  pricingfluctuations.
 While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able toextend
 or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. A number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead tobusiness failure
 for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components oncommercially reasonable
 terms. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “ Global
and
regional
economic conditions

could
materially
adversely
affect
the
Company”
above,  also  could  affect  the  Company’s  ability  to  obtain  components .
 Therefore,  the  Companyremains subject to significant
 risks of supply shortages and price increases.The
 Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initialcapacity
 constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. Continued availability of these components atacceptable
 prices,  or  at  all,  may  be  affected  for  any  number  of  reasons,  including  if  those  suppliers  decide  to  concentrate  on  the  production  of  commoncomponents instead of
 components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. The supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayedor constrained, or a key manufactur
ing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the Company.The
 Company  depends  on  component  and  product  manufacturing  and  logistical  services  provided  by  outsourcing  partners,  many  of  which  arelocated outside of the U.S.
Substantially all of
 the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia. The Company has alsooutsourced
 much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s directcontrol
 over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or theCompany’s
 flexibility  to  respond  to  changing  conditions.  Although  arrangements  with  these  partners  may  contain  provisions  for  warranty  expensereimbursement,
 the  Company  may  remain  responsible  to  the  consumer  for  warranty  service  in  the  event  of  product  defects  and  could  experience  anunanticipated
 product defect or warranty liability. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of thesupplier code of cond
uct could occur.The
 Company  relies  on  sole-sourced  outsourcing  partners  in  the  U.S.,  Asia  and  Europe  to  supply  and  manufacture  many  critical  components,  and  onoutsourcing partners primar
ily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to performmay
 have a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations ortransit
 to  final  destinations  may  be  disrupted  for  a  variety  of  reasons  including,  but  not  limited  to,  natural  and  man-made  disasters,  information  technologysystem failures, commercial disputes
, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues.The
 Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments tocertain
 of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, ifthese
 outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply could be reduced orterminated and the net realizable va
lue of these assets could be negatively impacted.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K |

The Company’s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating marginand harm to the Company
’s reputation.The
 Company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating systemsoftware
 and applications, such as those sold by the Company, often contain “bugs” that can unexpectedly interfere with the software’s intended operation. TheCompany’s
 online services may from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns, or errors. Defects may also occur in components and products theCompany purchases
 from third parties. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware, software and servicesit sells. Failure to do 
so could result in lost revenue, significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the Company’s reputation.The Company relies on access to third-par
ty digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.The Company contracts with nume
rous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell currently available music, movies, TVshows and
 books. The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation orrenewal
 of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competingproducts
 and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future.Other
 content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unableto
 continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. Failure to obtain theright to
 make available third-party digital content, or to make available such content on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact onthe Company’s financia
l condition and operating results.Some
 third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, theCompany may have to develop or l
icense new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license suchsolutions
 at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force theCompany
 to  license  its  digital  rights  management,  which  could  lessen  the  protection  of  content  and  subject  it  to  piracy  and  also  could  negatively  affectarrangements with the
 Company’s content providers.The Company’s future perfor
mance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.The
 Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products  depend in part on the availability of third‑ party software applications andservices. There is no assu
rance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s products.If
 third-party  software  applications  and  services cease  to  be  developed  and  maintained  for  the  Company’s  products,  customers  may  choose  not  to  buy  theCompany’s products.
With
 respect to its Mac products, the Company believes the availability of third‑ party software applications and services depends in part on the developers’perception
 and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software for the Company’s products compared to Windows-based
 products. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may begenerated,
 expected  future  growth  of  Mac  sales  and  the  costs  of  developing  such  applications  and  services.  If  the  Company’s  minority share  of  the  globalpersonal
 computer  market  causes  developers  to  question  the  Mac’s  prospects,  developers  could  be  less  inclined  to  develop  or  upgrade  software  for  theCompany’s Mac products and mo
re inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market.With
 respect to iOS devices, the Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications, which aredistributed
 through a single distribution channel, the App Store. iOS devices are subject to rapid technological change, and, if third-party developers are unableto
 or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers. As withapplications for
 the Company’s Mac products, the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers’ perceptions and analysis of therelative
 benefits  of developing,  maintaining  or upgrading  software for  the  Company’s  iOS devices  rather than  its competitors’  platforms,  such as Android.  Ifdevelopers focus their efforts on these 
competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s iOS devices may suffer.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K |

The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms orat all.
Many
 of  the  Company’s  products  include  third-party  intellectual  property,  which  requires  licenses  from  those  third  parties.  Based  on  past  experience  andindustry
 practice, the Company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the necessarylicenses
 can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property oncommercially
 reasonable  terms,  could  preclude  the  Company  from  selling  certain  products  or  otherwise  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on  the  Company’sfinancial condition and o
perating results.The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results o
f legal proceedings, such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights.The
 Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business,and additional claims may arise in
 the future.For example,
 technology companies, including many of the Company’s competitors, frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement orother
 violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. Theintellectual
 property rights claims against the Company have generally increased over time and may continue to increase. In particular, the Company's cellularenabled
 products compete with products from mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios, and the Company hasfaced
 a significant number of patent claims against it. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of U.S. jurisdictions andbefore
 the U.S. International Trade Commission, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions andsubstantial damages.
Regardless
 of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants, the Companymay
 have to engage in protracted litigation. If the Company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights, regardless of whether itcan
 develop  non-infringing  technology,  it  may  be  required  to  pay  substantial  damages  or  royalties  to  a  third-party,  or  it  may  be  subject  to  a  temporary  orpermanent injunction pr
ohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain products.In
 certain cases, the Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements, although no assurance can be given that such licenses canbe obtained on 
acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These licenses may also significantly increase the Company’s operating expenses.Regardless
 of  the  merit  of  particular  claims,  litigation  may  be  expensive,  time-consuming,  disruptive  to  the  Company’s  operations  and  distracting  tomanagement. In recognition of these conside
rations, the Company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation.In
 management’s  opinion,  there  is  not  at  least  a  reasonable  possibility  the  Company  may  have  incurred  a  material  loss,  or  a  material  loss  in  excess  of  arecorded accrual,
 with respect to loss contingencies, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights. However, the outcome of litigation isinherently uncertain.
Although management
 considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reportingperiod
 for  amounts  in  excess  of  management’s  expectations,  the  Company’s  consolidated  financial  statements  for  that  reporting  period  could  be  materiallyadversely
 affected.  Further,  such  an  outcome  could  result  in  significant  compensatory,  punitive  or  trebled  monetary  damages,  disgorgement  of  revenue  orprofits, remedial corporat
e measures or injunctive relief against the Company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.The
 Company  is  subject  to  laws  and  regulations  worldwide,  changes  to  which  could  increase  the  Company’s  costs  and  individually  or  in  theaggregate adversely affect the Company’s business.
The
 Company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas. These U.S. and foreign laws andregulations
 affect the Company’s activities including, but not limited to, in areas of labor, advertising, digital content, consumer protection, real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions,
 quality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement,tax,
 import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, anti-competition,environmental, health and safety.
By
 way of example, laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the Company operates areextensive
 and  subject  to  change.  Such  changes  could  include,  among  others,  restrictions  on  the  production,  manufacture,  distribution  and  use  of  devices,locking
 devices to a carrier’s network, or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier’s network. These devices are also subject to certification andregulation
 by  governmental  and  standardization  bodies,  as  well  as  by  cellular  network  carriers  for  use  on  their  networks.  These  certification  processes  areextensive and
 time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications, or delays in product shipment dates, or could precludethe Company from selling cer
tain products. Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K |

Compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction,further
 increasing the cost of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulationsor in
 their interpretation, could individually or in the aggregate make the Company’s products and services less attractive to the Company’s customers, delay theintroduction
 of new products in one or more regions, or cause the Company to change or limit its business practices. The Company has implemented policiesand
 procedures  designed  to  ensure  compliance  with  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  but  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  the  Company’s  employees,contractors, or age
nts will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures.The Company’s business is subject to the risks of interna
tional operations.The
 Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. Compliance with applicable U.S. and foreign laws andregulations,
 such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacyrequirements,
 environmental  laws,  labor  laws  and  anti-competition  regulations,  increases  the  costs  of  doing  business  in  foreign  jurisdictions.  Although  theCompany
 has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by the Company’s employees, contractors, or agentscould
 nevertheless occur. In some cases, compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country.Violations of these law
s and regulations could materially adversely affect the Company’s brand, international growth efforts and business.The
 Company  also  could  be  significantly  affected  by  other  risks  associated  with  international  activities  including,  but  not  limited  to,  economic  and  laborconditions,
 increased duties, taxes and other costs and political instability. Margins on sales of the Company’s products in foreign countries, and on sales ofproducts
 that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations, including duties,tariffs
 and antidumping penalties. The Company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain internationalmarkets. There can 
be no assurance the Company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.The
 Company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject tonumerous risks and uncertainties.
The
 Company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel.The
 Company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile
 venues  to  promote  brand  awareness  and  serve  as  vehicles  for  corporate  sales  and  marketing  activities.  Because  of  their  unique  design  elements,locations
 and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company’s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associatedwith the
 Company’s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease terminationcosts, write-offs of equipment and 
leasehold improvements and severance costs.Many
 factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the Company’s control, pose risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include,but
 are not limited to, macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity, as well as the Company’s inability to manage costsassociated
 with store construction and operation, the Company’s failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners, more challenging environmentsin
 managing retail operations outside the U.S., costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory, and the Company’s inability toobtain and renew leas
es in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.Investment
 in  new  business  strategies  and  acquisitions  could  disrupt  the  Company’s  ongoing  business  and  present  risks  not  originallycontemplated.
The
 Company  has  invested,  and  in  the  future  may  invest,  in  new  business  strategies  or  acquisitions.  Such  endeavors  may  involve  significant  risks  anduncertainties,
 including  distraction  of  management  from  current  operations,  greater  than  expected  liabilities  and  expenses,  inadequate  return  of  capital  andunidentified issues not di
scovered in the Company’s due diligence. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful.The Company’s business and reputation may be impacted by in
formation technology system failures or network disruptions.The
 Company may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions. These may be caused by natural disasters, accidents, powerdisruptions,
 telecommunications  failures,  acts  of  terrorism  or war,  computer  viruses,  physical or  electronic  break-ins,  or other  events  or disruptions.  Systemredundancy
 may  be  ineffective  or  inadequate,  and  the  Company’s  disaster  recovery  planning  may  not  be  sufficient  for  all  eventualities.  Such  failures  ordisruptions
 could, among other things, prevent access to the Company’s online stores and services, preclude retail store transactions, compromise Company orcustomer
 data,  and  result  in  delayed  or  cancelled  orders.  System  failures  and  disruptions  could  also  impede  the  manufacturing  and  shipping  of  products,delivery of online services, tra
nsactions processing and financial reporting.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 
13 
There  may  be  breaches  of  the  Company’s  information  technology  systems  that  materially  damage  business  partner  and  customer  relationships,curtail
 or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services, or subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal andoperational consequences.
The
 Company’s business requires it to use and store customer, employee and business partner personally identifiable information (“PII”). This may include,among
 other  information,  names,  addresses,  phone  numbers,  email  addresses,  contact  preferences,  tax  identification  numbers  and  payment  accountinformation.
 Although malicious attacks to gain access to PII affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk ofbeing targeted because of its high profi
le and the amount of PII it manages.The
 Company  requires  user  names  and  passwords  in  order  to  access  its  information  technology  systems.  The  Company  also  uses  encryption  andauthentication
 technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to Company data or accounts. As with all companies,these
 security measures are subject to third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management, or other irregularities. Forexample,
 third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, whichmay
 in turn be used to access the Company’s information technology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors accountsand systems for unusual activ
ity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which may result in the delay or loss of customer orders.The
 Company devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other security measures to protect its systems and data, but these securitymeasures
 cannot provide absolute security. To the extent the Company was to experience a breach of its systems and was unable to protect sensitive data,such
 a breach could materially damage business partner and customer relationships, and curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores andservices.
 Moreover, if a computer security breach affects the Company’s systems or results in the unauthorized release of PII, the Company’s reputation andbrand
 could be  materially damaged,  use of the  Company’s products  and services could  decrease,  and the Company could  be exposed  to a risk of loss orlitigation
 and possible liability. While the Company maintains insurance coverage that, subject to policy terms and conditions and subject to a significant self-insured retention, is designed to add
ress certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims thatmay arise in the continu
ally evolving area of cyber risk.The
 Company  is  also  subject  to  payment  card  association  rules  and  obligations  under  its  contracts  with  payment  card  processors.  Under  these  rules  andobligations,
 if  information  is  compromised,  the  Company  could  be  liable  to  payment  card  issuers  for  associated  expenses  and  penalties.  In  addition,  if  theCompany
 fails to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, the Company could incur significant fines orexperience a significant incre
ase in payment card transaction costs.The Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and in
ternational laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.The
 Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII. In many cases, these lawsapply
 not only to third-party transactions, but also may restrict transfers of PII among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions havepassed
 laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent fromjurisdiction
 to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require theCompany to change its
 business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.The
 Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of PII through its privacy policy, information provided on its website and press statements. Anyfailure by
 the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulationscould
 result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. Penalties could include ongoing audit requirements or significant legalliability.
The Company’s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key pe
rsonnel.Much
 of the Company’s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive teamand
 other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especiallyin Silicon Valley, where most of t
he Company’s key personnel are located.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K |

The  Company’s  business  may  be  impacted  by  political  events,  war,  terrorism,  public  health  issues,  natural  disasters  and  other  businessinterruptions.
War,
 terrorism,  geopolitical  uncertainties,  public  health  issues  and  other  business  interruptions  have  caused  and  could  cause  damage  or  disruption  tointernational commerce and the global economy, and thus could
 have a material adverse effect on the Company, its suppliers, logistics providers, manufacturingvendors and customers, includ
ing channel partners. The Company’s business operations are subject to interruption by, among others, natural disasters, whetheras
 a result of climate change or otherwise, fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostileacts,
 labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond its control. Such events could decrease demand for the Company’s products, make it difficultor
 impossible for the Company to make and deliver products to its customers, including channel partners, or to receive components from its suppliers, andcreate
 delays  and  inefficiencies  in  the  Company’s  supply  chain.  While  the  Company's  suppliers  are  required  to  maintain  safe  working  environments  andoperations,
 an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company's business and harm to the Company's reputation. Should majorpublic
 health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitationsin
 freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in theoperations
 of  the  Company’s  manufacturing  vendors  and  component  suppliers.  The  majority  of  the  Company’s  R&D  activities,  its  corporate  headquarters,information
 technology systems and other critical business operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are in locations thatcould
 be  affected  by natural  disasters.  In  the  event  of  a  natural  disaster,  the  Company  could  incur  significant  losses,  require  substantial  recovery  time  andexperience significant expe
nditures in order to resume operations.The Company expects its quarterly revenue and ope
rating results to fluctuate.The
 Company’s profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels.  The Company’s software, accessories, and service and support  contractsgenerally
 have higher gross margins than certain of the Company’s other products. Gross margins on the Company’s hardware products vary across productlines
 and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. TheCompany’s
 direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners. In addition, the Company’s grossmargin
 and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic orchannel
 mix, component cost increases, the strengthening U.S. dollar, price competition, or the introduction of new products, including those that have highercost structures with flat 
or reduced pricing.The Company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other
 quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, newproduct
 introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a majority of its net sales froma
 single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpecteddevelopments
 late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products, issues with new product introductions, an internal systemsfailure, or failure of one of the Co
mpany’s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.The Company’s stock price is subject to volatility.
The
 Company’s  stock  price  has  experienced  substantial  price  volatility  in  the  past  and  may  continue  to  do  so  in  the  future.  Additionally,  the  Company,  thetechnology
 industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways thatmay
 have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Companyrepurchases
 its own stock to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growthand
 profitability. The Company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that itscurrent
 share  repurchase  program  will  be  fully  consummated.  Future  dividends  are  subject  to  declaration  by  the  Company’s  Board  of  Directors,  and  theCompany’s
 share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to futuregrowth,
 profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverseimpact on investor confidence and e
mployee retention.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 
15 
The Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus local currencies.The
 Company’s  primary  exposure  to  movements  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  relates  to  non-U.S.  dollar-denominated  sales  and  operating  expensesworldwide.
 Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency-denominatedsales
 and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. Margins on salesof
 the Company’s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adverselyaffected
 by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise localprices to
 fully offset the dollar’s strengthening, or at all, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency-denominated salesand
 earnings.  Conversely,  a  strengthening  of  foreign  currencies  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar,  while  generally  beneficial  to  the  Company’s  foreign  currency-denominated
 sales  and  earnings,  could  cause  the  Company  to  reduce  international  pricing  and  incur  losses  on  its  foreign  currency  derivative  instruments,thereby
 limiting  the  benefit.  Additionally,  strengthening  of  foreign  currencies  may  also  increase  the  Company’s  cost  of  product  components  denominated  inthose currencies, thus adverse
ly affecting gross margins.The
 Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currencyexchange
 rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements inforeign exchange rates over the li
mited time the hedges are in place.The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in 
the market values of its investment portfolio.Given
 the global nature of its business, the Company has both domestic and international investments. Credit ratings and pricing of the Company’s investmentscan be negatively
 affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk or other factors. As a result, the value andliquidity
 of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized anysignificant losses on its cash,
 cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in a significant realized loss.The
 Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supplyagreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when econo
mic conditions worsen.The
 Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. The Company also sells itsproducts
 directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstandingtrade
 receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party financing arrangements or credit insurance. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectability riskon
 its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendornon-trade
 receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble finalproducts
 for  the  Company.  In  addition,  the  Company  has  made  prepayments  associated  with  long-term  supply  agreements  to  secure  supply  of  inventorycomponents.
 As of September  24, 2016 ,  a significant portion of the Company’s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers, and itsvendor
 non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily inAsia.
 While  the  Company  has  procedures  to  monitor  and  limit  exposure  to  credit  risk  on  its  trade  and  vendor  non-trade  receivables,  as  well  as  long-termprepayments, there
 can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.The
 Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional taxliabilities.
The Company is subject to taxes in the
 U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized.Due
 to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company’s effective tax rates could beaffected
 by  changes  in  the  mix  of  earnings  in  countries  with  differing  statutory  tax  rates,  changes  in  the  valuation  of  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities,  orchanges in tax laws or thei
r interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland.The
 Company  is  also  subject  to  the  examination  of  its  tax  returns  and  other  tax  matters  by  the  U.S.  Internal  Revenue  Service  (the  "IRS")  and  other  taxauthorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome
 resulting from these examinations to determine theadequacy
 of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase,particularly
 in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, theCompany’s financial condition, o
perating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K |

Properties The
 Company’s  headquarters  are  located  in  Cupertino,  California.  As  of September  24,  2016 ,  the  Company  owned  7.1  million  square  feet  and  leased22.3 million square feet
 of building space, primarily in the U.S. Additionally, the Company owned a total of 2,583 acres of land primarily in the U.S.As
 of September  24, 2016 ,  the Company owned facilities and land for R&D, corporate functions and data centers at various locations throughout the U.S.,including
 land in California that is being developed for the Company’s second corporate campus. Outside the U.S., the Company owned additional facilities andland for various purposes.
The
 Company believes its existing facilities and equipment, which are used by all operating segments, are in good operating condition and are suitable for theconduct
 of its business. The Company has invested in internal capacity and strategic relationships with outside manufacturing vendors and continues to makeinvestments in capital equ
ipment as needed to meet anticipated demand for its products.Item 3.
Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that have not been
 fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. In the opinionof
 management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recordedaccrual,
 with  respect  to  loss  contingencies  for  asserted  legal and  other  claims. However,  the  outcome  of  legal proceedings  and  claims brought  against  theCompany
 is subject to significant uncertainty. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more ofthese legal matters
 were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s consolidatedfinancial statements for that reporting period could
 be materially adversely affected. See the risk factor “ The

In April 2016, the  Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company's share repurchase program authorization from $140 billion to $175 billion of the Company’scommon stock. As of 
September 24, 2016 , $133 billion of the $175 billion had been utilized. The remaini ng $42 billion in the table represents the amount available torepurchase
 shares under the authorized repurchase program as of September  24, 2016 .  The Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquireany
 specific  number  of  shares.  Under  the  program,  shares  may  be  repurchased  in  privately  negotiated  and/or  open  market  transactions,  including  under  planscomplying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.

In  May 2016, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase arrangement ("ASR") to purchase up to $6.0 billion of the Company's common stock. InAugust
 2016, the purchase period for this ASR ended and an additional 12.3 million shares were delivered and retired. In total, 60.5 million shares were deliveredunder this ASR at an average repurchase price of $99.25.
(3)
In  August 2016, the Company entered into a new ASR to purchase up to $3.0 billion of the Company’s common stock. In exchange for an up-front payment of $3.0billion,
 the financial institution party to the arrangement committed to deliver shares to the Company during the ASR’s purchase period, which will end in or beforeNovember
 2016. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average price paid per share, will be determined at the end of the applicablepurchase period based on the volume weighted-average price of the Company’s common stock during that period.

2016
Highlights
Net
 sales  declined  8%  or  $18.1  billion during  2016  compared  to  2015,  primarily  driven  by  a  year-over-year  decrease  in  iPhone  net  sales  and  the  effect  ofweakness
 in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by an increase in Services. In April 2016, the Company announced a significantincrease

2015
Highlights
Net
 sales rose 28% or $50.9 billion during 2015 compared to 2014, driven by a year-over-year increase in iPhone net sales. iPhone net sales and unit sales in2015 increased in all of the Co
mpany’s reportable operating segments. The Company also experienced year-over-year net sales increases in Mac, Services andOther Products.
 Apple Watch, which launched during the third quarter of 2015, accounted for more than 100% of the year-over-year growth in net sales of OtherProducts.
 Net sales growth during 2015 was partially offset by the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and lower iPad netsales. Total
 net sales increased in each of the Company’s reportable operating segments, with particularly strong growth in Greater China where year-over-yearnet sales increased 84%.
In
 April  2015,  the  Company  announced  a  significant  increase  to  its  capital  return  program  by  raising  the  expected  total  size  of  the  program  to  $200  billionthrough March

The following table presents 
iPhone net sales and unit sales information for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions and units in tho usands):

211,884   (8 )% 231,218   37 % 169,219 iPhone
 net sales and unit sales decreased during 2016 compared to 2015. The Company believes the sales decline is due primarily to a lower rate of iPhoneupgrades
 during 2016 compared to 2015 and challenging macroeconomic conditions in a number of major markets in 2016. Average selling prices (“ASPs”) foriPhone
 were  lower  year-over-year  during  2016  due  primarily  to  a  different  mix  of  iPhones,  including  the  iPhone  SE  introduced  in  2016,  and  the  effect  ofweakness in most foreign c
urrencies relative to the U.S. dollar.The
 year-over-year growth in iPhone net sales and unit sales during 2015 primarily resulted from strong demand for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus during 2015. OverallASPs
 for iPhone increased during 2015 compared to 2014, due primarily to the introduction of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in September 2014, partially offset by theeffect of weakness in
 most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.iPad

45,590   (17 )% 54,856   (19 )% 67,977 iPad
 net sales decreased during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to lower unit sales and the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to theU.S.
 dollar, partially offset by higher ASPs due to a shift in mix to higher-priced iPads. The Company believes the decline in iPad sales is due in part to a longerrepurchase cycle for iPads 
and some level of cannibalization from the Company's other products.Net
 sales and unit sales for iPad declined during 2015 compared to 2014. The Company believes the decline in iPad sales is due in part to a longer repurchasecycle for iPads and some 
level of cannibalization from the Company's other products. iPad ASPs declined during 2015 compared to 2014, primarily as a result ofthe effect of we
akness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and a shift in mix to lower-priced iPads.Mac

 net sales and unit sales decreased during 2016 compared to 2015. The year-over-year decline in Mac unit sales during 2016 was at rates similar to theoverall market. The effect of weakne
ss in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar also negatively impacted Mac net sales.The
 year-over-year  growth  in  Mac  net  sales  and  unit  sales  during  2015  was  driven  by  strong  demand  for  Mac  portables.  Mac  ASPs  declined  during  2015compared to 2014 largely due to the effect of weakne

11 %    9 %    10 %The
 year-over-year increase in net sales of Services in 2016 was due primarily to growth from the App Store, licensing and AppleCare sales, partially offset bythe
 effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company received $548 million from SamsungElectronics Co., Ltd. relat
ed to its patent infringement lawsuit, which was recorded as licensing net sales within Services.The increase in net sales of Ser
vices during 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to growth from the App Store and licensing.Segment Operating Performance
The
 Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable operating segments consist of the Americas, Europe, GreaterChina,
 Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries, aswell
 as India,  the  Middle  East  and  Africa.  The  Greater  China segment  includes  China,  Hong  Kong  and Taiwan.  The  Rest of  Asia  Pacific  segment  includesAustralia
 and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable operating segments. Although the reportable operating segments providesimilar
 hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers anddistribution
 partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. Further information regarding the Company’s reportable operating segmentscan be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K

39.1 % 40.1 % 38.6 %Gross
 margin decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and, to a lesserextent, unfavorable leverage on fixed co
sts from lower net sales, partially offset by a favorable shift in mix to Services.The
 year-over-year increase in the gross margin percentage in 2015 was driven primarily by a favorable shift in mix to products with higher margins and, to alesser
 extent, by improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales. These positive factors were partially offset primarily by higher product cost structuresand, to a lesser extent, by the effect of weakness 
in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 
26 
The  Company  anticipates  gross  margin  during  the  first  quarter  of 2017 to  be  between  38% and  38.5%.  The  foregoing  statement  regarding  the  Company’sexpected
 gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2017 is  forward-looking and could differ from actual results. The Company’s future gross margins canbe
 impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors” and thosedescribed
 in  this  paragraph.  In  general,  the  Company  believes  gross  margins  will  remain  under  downward  pressure  due  to  a  variety  of  factors,  includingcontinued
 industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions, potential increases in thecost
 of components, and potential strengthening of the U.S. dollar, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potentialshift
 in the Company’s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. In response to competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to takeproduct
 pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company’s ability to manage product qualityand
 warranty  costs  effectively  and  to  stimulate  demand  for  certain  of  its  products.  Due  to  the  Company’s  significant  international  operations,  its  financialcondition and operating results, 
including gross margins, could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.Operating Expenses

Development
The
 year-over-year growth in R&D expense in 2016 and 2015 was driven primarily by an increase in headcount and related expenses, and material costs tosupport
 expanded R&D activities. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position inthe marketplace, and to the development of new and updated produ
cts that are central to the Company’s core business strategy.Selling,
General
and
Administra
tiveThe
 decrease in selling, general and administrative expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to lower discretionary expenditures and advertisingcosts,
 partially offset by an increase in headcount and related expenses. The year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense in 2015 wasprimarily due to inc
reased headcount and related expenses, and higher spending on marketing and advertising.Other Income/(Expense), Net

 year-over-year increase in other income/(expense), net during 2016 and 2015 was due primarily to higher interest income, partially offset by higher interestexpense
 on debt and higher expenses associated with foreign exchange activity. The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cashequivalents and marketable secu
rities was 1.73%, 1.49% and 1.11% in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K |

25.6 % 26.4 % 26.1 %The Company’s effective 
tax rates for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 differ from the statutory  federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreignearnings,
 a  substantial  portion  of  which  was  generated  by  subsidiaries  organized  in  Ireland,  for  which  no  U.S.  taxes  are  provided  when  such  earnings  areintended
 to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. The lower effective tax rate in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to greater R&D tax credits. Thehigher effective tax rate during 2015 co
mpared to 2014 was due primarily to higher foreign taxes.As
 of September  24, 2016 ,  the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses and tax credits of $4.1 billion anddeferred tax liabilities of $26.0
 billion. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a resultof
 certain  tax  planning  strategies,  together  with  future  reversals  of  existing  taxable  temporary  differences,  will  be  sufficient  to  fully  recover  the  deferred  taxassets.
 The  Company  will  continue  to  evaluate  the  realizability  of  deferred  tax  assets  quarterly  by  assessing  the  need  for  and  the  amount  of  a  valuationallowance.
During
 the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company reached a partial settlement with the IRS on its examination of the years 2010 through 2012. In connection withthis settlement, the Company recogn
ized a tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2016 that was not significant to its consolidated financial statements. All years priorto
 2013 are closed, except for the years 2010 through 2012 relating to R&D tax credits. In addition, the Company is subject to audits by state, local and foreigntax
 authorities. In major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 2003 generally remain open and could be subject to examination by thetaxing
 authorities. Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, theoutcome
 of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent withmanagement’s expectations, the Compan
y could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.On
 August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and2007
 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the "State Aid Decision"). The State Aid Decision ordersIreland
 to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through September 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as ofthe
 beginning of 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without meritand
 intends to appeal to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Ireland has also announced its intention to appeal the State AidDecision.
 While the European Commission announced a recovery amount of up to €13 billion, plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes subject torecovery
 is  to  be  calculated  by  Ireland  in  accordance  with  the  European  Commission's  guidance.  Once  the  recovery  amount  is  computed  by  Ireland,  theCompany
 anticipates  funding  it,  including  interest,  out  of  foreign  cash  into  escrow,  pending  conclusion  of  all  appeals.  The  Company  believes  that  anyincremental Irish corporate
 income taxes potentially due would be creditable against U.S. taxes.Recent Accounting Pronouncements

LeasesIn
 February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), which modified lease accounting for both lessees and lessors toincrease
 transparency  and  comparability  by  recognizing  lease  assets  and  lease  liabilities  by  lessees  for  those  leases  classified  as  operating  leases  underprevious
 accounting standards and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 will be effective for the Company beginning in its firstquarter

Recognition
In
 May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”), which amends the existing accountingstandards
 for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitledwhen
 products  are  transferred  to  customers.  ASU  2014-09  will  be  effective  for  the  Company  beginning  in  its  first  quarter  of  2019,  and  early  adoption  ispermitted. 
Subsequently,
 the FASB has issued the following standards related to ASU 2014-09: ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):Principal
 versus  Agent  Considerations  (“ASU  2016-08”);  ASU  No.  2016-10,  Revenue  from  Contracts  with  Customers  (Topic  606):  Identifying  PerformanceObligations

The new
 revenue standards may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the dateof
 adoption. The Company currently expects to adopt the new revenue standards in its first quarter of 2018 utilizing the full retrospective transition method. TheCompany does not expect adoption of the new revenue 
standards to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.Liquidity and Capital Resources

Manufacturing
Purchase
ObligationsThe
 Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing offinished
 products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typicallycovers
 periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent withindustry
 practice,  the  Company  acquires  components  through  a  combination  of  purchase  orders,  supplier  contracts,  and  open  orders  based  on  projecteddemand information. As of 
September 24, 2016 , the Company had manufacturing purchase ob ligations of $28.6 billion.Other
Purchase
Obligations
The
 Company’s  other  purchase  obligations  were  comprised  of  commitments  to  acquire  capital  assets,  including  product  tooling  and  manufacturing  processequipment,
 and  commitments  related  to  advertising,  licensing,  R&D,  internet  and  telecommunications  services,  energy  and  other  obligations.  As  ofSeptember 24, 2016 
, the Company had other purchase obligat ions of $6.6 billion.The
 Company’s other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist primarily of deferred tax liabilities, gross unrecognized tax benefits andthe
 related gross interest and penalties. As of September  24, 2016 ,  the Company had non-current deferred tax liabilities of $26.0 billion. Additionally, as ofSeptember
 24, 2016 ,  the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $7.7 billion and an additional $1.0 billion for gross interest and penalties classifiedas
 non-current liabilities. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timingof tax audit outcomes; therefore, such amounts are not 
included in the above contractual obligation table.Indemnification
The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system
 and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-partyintellectual
 property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could besubject
 to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. In the opinion of management, therewas
 not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of end-users of its operating system orapplication software for in
fringement of third-party intellectual property rights.The
 Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and mainland China.The
 iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certainconditions
 are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such rightwith subsequent changes to the guarantee liab
ility recognized within revenue.The
 Company  has  entered  into  indemnification  agreements  with  its  directors  and  executive  officers.  Under  these  agreements,  the  Company  has  agreed  toindemnify
 such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advanceexpenses
 incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of paymentsthe
 Company  could  be  required  to  make  under  these  agreements  due  to  the  limited  history  of  prior  indemnification  claims  and  the  unique  facts  andcircumstances
 involved  in  each  claim.  However,  the  Company  maintains  directors  and  officers  liability  insurance  coverage  to  reduce  its  exposure  to  suchobligations.
Critical Accounting Po
licies and EstimatesThe
 preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’sdiscussion and
 analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates thataffect the amounts reported in
 its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notesto Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of
 this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of theCompany’s
 consolidated financial statements.  Management  bases its estimates on historical experience  and on various other assumptions it believes to bereasonable
 under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual resultsmay differ from these estimates, and 
such differences may be material.Management
 believes  the  Company’s  critical  accounting  policies  and  estimates  are  those  related  to  revenue  recognition,  valuation  and  impairment  ofmarketable
 securities, inventory valuation, valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimation of purchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs,income
 taxes,  and  legal  and  other  contingencies.  Management  considers  these  policies  critical  because  they  are  both  important  to  the  portrayal  of  theCompany’s
 financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. TheCompany’s senior
 management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company’sBoard of Directors.

Revenue RecognitionNet
 sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories, and service and support contracts. TheCompany recognizes
 revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectionis probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been
 shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. Formost
 of the Company’s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to educationcustomers
 in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portionof
 the risk of loss on these sales during transit. For payment terms in excess of the Company’s standard payment terms, revenue is recognized as paymentsbecome
 due  unless  the  Company  has  positive  evidence  that  the  sales  price  is  fixed  or  determinable,  such  as  a  successful  history  of  collection,  withoutconcession,
 on  comparable  arrangements.  The  Company  recognizes  revenue  from  the  sale  of  hardware  products,  software  bundled  with  hardware  that  isessential
 to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accountingguidance.
 The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry-specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions:(i) standalone
 sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of thehardware.
For
 multi-element  arrangements  that  include  hardware  products  containing  software  essential  to  the  hardware  product’s  functionality,  undelivered  softwareelements
 that relate to the hardware product’s essential software and/or undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverablesbased
 on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue todeliverables:
 (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (“TPE”) and (iii) best estimate of selling price(“ESP”).
 VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable.ESPs reflect the Company
’s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.For
 sales of qualifying versions of iOS devices, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecifiedsoftware
 upgrades to the device’s essential software and/or non-software services free of charge. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for theunspecified
 software upgrade rights or the non-software services, revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the Company’s ESPs. Revenueallocated
 to the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services based on the Company’s ESPs is deferred and recognized on a straight-linebasis over the estimated period the 
software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided.The
 Company’s process for determining ESPs involves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon theunique
 facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Should future facts and circumstances change, the Company’s ESPs and the future rate of relatedamortization
 for unspecified software upgrades and non-software services related to future sales of these devices could change. Factors subject to changeinclude the
 unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services offered, the estimated value of unspecified software upgrade rights and non-softwareservices and the estimated per
iod unspecified software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided.The
 Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. For transactionsinvolving
 price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably andreliably
 estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. The Company’s policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated,revenue
 is  not  recognized  until  reliable  estimates  can  be  made  or  the  price  protection  lapses.  For  the  Company’s  other  customer  incentive  programs,  theestimated
 cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company alsorecords
 reductions  to  revenue  for  expected  future  product  returns  based  on  the  Company’s  historical  experience.  Future  market  conditions  and  producttransitions
 may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue. Additionally, certain customerincentive
 programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. Management’s estimates are based onhistorical
 experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems suchincentives,
 the  Company  would  be  required  to  record  additional  reductions  to  revenue,  which  would  have  an  adverse  impact  on  the  Company’s  operatingresults.

Valuation and Impairment of Marketable SecuritiesThe
 Company’s  investments  in  available-for-sale  securities  are  reported  at  fair  value.  Unrealized  gains  and  losses  related  to  changes  in  the  fair  value  ofsecurities
 are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value ofavailable-for-sale
 securities  impact  the  Company’s  net  income  only  when  such  securities  are  sold  or  an  other-than-temporary  impairment  is  recognized.Realized
 gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security’s cost basis. The Company regularly reviews itsinvestment
 portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the Company to record an impairment charge in theperiod
 any such determination is made. In making this determination, the Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fairvalue
 of a security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it will morelikely
 than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Company’s assessment of whether a security is other-than-temporarily
 impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security, which would have anadverse impact on th
e Company’s operating results.Inventory Valuation, Valuation of Manufacturing
-Related Assets and Estimation of Purchase Commitment Cancellation FeesThe
 Company must purchase components and build inventory in advance of product shipments and has invested in manufacturing-related assets, includingcapital
 assets  held  at  its  suppliers’  facilities.  In  addition,  the  Company  has  made  prepayments  to  certain  of  its  suppliers  associated  with  long-term  supplyagreements
 to secure supply of inventory components. The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-partyproducts
 held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed reviewof inventory that considers mu
ltiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels and componentcost
 trends. The Company also reviews its manufacturing-related capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstancesindicate
 the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an asset is not recoverable, it records an impairment lossequal to the amount by which the carry
ing value of such an asset exceeds its fair value.The industries in which the Company competes are subject to a
 rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. Incertain
 circumstances  the  Company  may  be  required  to  record  additional  write-downs  of  inventory  and/or  impairments  of  manufacturing-related  assets  orinventory
 prepayments. These circumstances include future demand or market conditions for the Company’s products being less favorable than forecasted,unforeseen
 technological  changes  or  changes  to  the  Company’s  product  development  plans  that  negatively  impact  the  utility  of  any  of  these  assets,  orsignificant
 deterioration in the financial condition of one or more of the Company’s suppliers that hold any of the Company’s manufacturing-related assets or towhom the Company has made an inventor
y prepayment. Such write-downs would adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results in theperiod when the ad
ditional write-downs were recorded.The
 Company  accrues  for  estimated  purchase  commitment  cancellation  fees  related  to  inventory  orders  that  have  been  cancelled  or  are  expected  to  becancelled.
 Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open ordersin
 each  case  based  on  projected  demand.  Manufacturing  purchase  obligations  typically  cover  the  Company’s  forecasted  component  and  manufacturingrequirements
 for periods up to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company’s products, a change in theCompany’s
 product development plans, or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company’s products, the Company may berequired
 to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees wereidentified and recorded.
Warranty Costs
The
 Company accrues for the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claimrates,
 historical and projected cost-per-claim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company’s typical experience. The Companyregularly
 reviews  these  estimates  and  the  current  installed  base  of  products  subject  to  warranty  protection  to  assess  the  appropriateness  of  its  recordedwarranty
 liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warrantyliabilities would be required and c
ould materially affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K |

Income TaxesThe
 Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results. The provision for income taxes is computed usingthe
 asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differencesbetween
 the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilitiesare measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to
 taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to berealized or settled. The Compan
y records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.The
 Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by thetaxing
 authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measuredbased on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% 
likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.Management
 believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies,together
 with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. In the event that the Companydetermines all
 or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance that wouldbe
 charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating theimpact
 of  uncertainties  in  the  application  of  GAAP  and  complex  tax  laws.  Resolution  of  these  uncertainties  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  management’sexpectations could hav
e a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.Legal and Other Contingencies
As
 discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to ConsolidatedFinancial
 Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies,” the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinarycourse of business. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has
 been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determinationof which
 requires significant judgment. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a materialloss,
 or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. However, the outcome of legalproceedings
 and claims brought against the Company is subject to significant uncertainty. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such anoutcome
 to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’sexpectations, the Company’s con
solidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K |

Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Ma rket RiskInterest Rate and Foreign Cur
rency Risk ManagementThe
 Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction withits
 underlying  foreign  currency  and  interest  rate  related  exposures.  Given  the  effective  horizons  of  the  Company’s  risk  management  activities  and  theanticipatory
 nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movementsin
 either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing ofgains and losses related to the under
lying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results.Interest Rate Risk
The
 Company’s  exposure  to  changes  in  interest  rates  relates  primarily  to  the  Company’s  investment  portfolio  and  outstanding  debt.  While  the  Company  isexposed to global interest rate flu
ctuations, the Company’s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S.interest
 rates affect the interest earned on the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well ascosts associated with hedg
ing and interest paid on the Company’s debt.The
 Company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the Company’s liquidity requirements. The Company usesa
 combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests inhighly-rated securities, and
 its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy requires investments generally to beinvestment
 grade,  with  the  primary  objective  of  minimizing  the  potential  risk  of  principal  loss.  To  provide  a  meaningful  assessment  of  the  interest  rate  riskassociated with the Company
’s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would haveon the value of the
 investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 24, 2016 and September
 26, 2015 ,  a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.9 billion and $4.3 billion incrementaldecline in the fair market
 value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.As
 of September  24, 2016 and September 26, 2015 ,  the  Company  had  outstanding  floating-  and  fixed-rate  notes  with  varying  maturities  for  an  aggregatecarrying
 amount of $78.9 billion and $55.8 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and may enter in the future, into interest rate swaps to manageinterest
 rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments orfloating-rate
 payments  into  fixed-rate  payments.  Gains  and  losses  on  these  instruments  are  generally  offset  by  the  corresponding  losses  and  gains  on  therelated
 hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company’s debt as of September 24, 2016 and 
September 26, 2015 to increase by $271  million and $200 million on an annualized basis, respectively.Further details regarding the Company’s debt
 is provided in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 6, “Debt.”Foreign Currency Risk
In
 general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening ofthe
 U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have toadjust local currency p
roduct pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.The
 Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated withcertain
 existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition,the
 Company has entered, and may enter in the future, into non-designated foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gainsand
 losses on its foreign-denominated debt issuances. The Company’s practice is to hedge a portion of its material foreign exchange exposures, typically for upto
 12  months.  However,  the  Company  may  choose  not  to  hedge  certain  foreign  exchange  exposures  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  including  but  not  limited  toaccounting considerations and the proh
ibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 
36 
To provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions, the Companyperformed
 a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consistedof
 using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expectedloss
 in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model isnot
 intended  to  represent  actual  losses  but  is  used  as  a  risk  estimation  and  management  tool.  The  model  assumes  normal  market  conditions.  Forecastedtransactions,
 firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model,the Company
 estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $434 million as of September 24, 2016 compared to a maximum one-day loss
 in fair value of $342 million as of September  26, 2015 .  Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the loss in fairvalue incurred on those instru
ments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.Actual
 future gains and losses associated with the Company’s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analysesperformed
 as  of September  24,  2016 due  to  the  inherent  limitations  associated  with  predicting  the  timing  and  amount  of  changes  in  interest  rates,  foreigncurrency exchanges rates and the Compan
y’s actual exposures and positions.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K |

 and PreparationThe
 accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Inthe
 opinion of the Company’s management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessaryfor
 fair  financial  statement  presentation.  The  preparation  of  these  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accountingprinciples
 (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements andaccompanying notes. Actual resu
lts could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements have beenreclassified to conform to the 
current period’s presentation.The
 Company’s fiscal year is the 52 or 53 -week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company’s fiscal years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 ended on 
September 24, 2016 , September 26, 2015 and  September  27, 2014 ,  respectively, and each spanned 52 weeks. An additional week is included in the firstfiscal
 quarter approximately every five or six years to  realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which will next occur in the first quarter of the Company'sfiscal
 year ending September 30, 2017. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscalyears ended in September and the associated qua
rters, months and periods of those fiscal years.During
 2016,  the  Company  adopted  an  accounting  standard  that  simplified  the  presentation  of  deferred  income  taxes  by  requiring  deferred  tax  assets  andliabilities
 be  classified  as  noncurrent  in  a  classified  statement  of  financial  position.  The  Company  has  adopted  this  accounting  standard  prospectively;accordingly,
 the prior period amounts in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets within this Annual Report on Form 10-K were not adjusted to conform tothe new accounting standard. The adoption of this a
ccounting standard was not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.Revenue Recognition
Net
 sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories, and service and support contracts. TheCompany recognizes
 revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectionis probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been
 shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. Formost
 of the Company’s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to educationcustomers
 in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portionof
 the risk of loss on these sales during transit. For payment terms in excess of the Company’s standard payment terms, revenue is recognized as paymentsbecome
 due  unless  the  Company  has  positive  evidence  that  the  sales  price  is  fixed  or  determinable,  such  as  a  successful  history  of  collection,  withoutconcession,
 on  comparable  arrangements.  The  Company  recognizes  revenue  from  the  sale  of  hardware  products,  software  bundled  with  hardware  that  isessential
 to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accountingguidance.
 The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions:(i) standalone
 sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of thehardware.
For
 the sale of most third-party products, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers because the Company establishesits
 own pricing for such products, retains related inventory risk for physical products, is the primary obligor to the customer and assumes the credit risk foramounts
 billed to its customers. For third-party applications sold through the App Store and Mac App Store and certain digital content sold through the iTunesStore,
 the Company does not determine the selling price of the products and is not the primary obligor to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts forsuch
 sales on a net basis by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains from each sale. The portion of the gross amount billed to customers that isremitted
 by  the  Company  to  third-party  app  developers  and  certain  digital  content  owners  is  not  reflected  in  the  Company’s  Consolidated  Statements  ofOperations.

The Company records deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the performance of services. This includes amountsthat
 have been deferred for unspecified and specified software upgrade rights and non-software services that are attached to hardware and software products.The
 Company sells gift cards redeemable at its retail and online stores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store, TVApp Store and iBooks Store for the purcha
se of digital content and software. The Company records deferred revenue upon the sale of the card, which is relievedupon
 redemption of the card by the customer. Revenue from AppleCare service and support contracts is deferred and recognized over the service coverageperiods.
 AppleCare service and support contracts typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support resources and diagnostic toolsoffered under the Company’s standard l
imited warranty.The
 Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. For transactionsinvolving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount
 to be refunded. For the Company’s other customer incentive programs,the
 estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program isoffered.
 The  Company  also  records  reductions  to  revenue  for  expected  future  product  returns  based  on  the  Company’s  historical  experience.  Revenue  isrecorded net
 of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remittedto the relevant government authority.

Multiple
DeliverablesFor
 multi-element  arrangements  that  include  hardware  products  containing  software  essential  to  the  hardware  product’s  functionality,  undelivered  softwareelements
 that relate to the hardware product’s essential software, and undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverablesbased
 on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue todeliverables:
 (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (“TPE”) and (iii) best estimate of selling price(“ESP”).
 VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable.ESPs
 reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. For multi-elementarrangements accounted
 for in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on theVSOE of each element, and if VSOE does not e
xist revenue is recognized when elements lacking VSOE are delivered.For sales of qualifying versions of
 iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide futureunspecified
 software  upgrades  to  the  device’s  essential  software  and/or  non-software  services  free  of  charge.  The  Company  has  identified  up  to three deliverables regular
ly included in arrangements involving the sale of these devices. The first deliverable, which represents the substantial portion of the allocatedsales
 price,  is  the  hardware  and  software  essential  to  the  functionality  of  the  hardware  device  delivered  at  the  time  of  sale.  The  second  deliverable  is  theembedded
 right  included  with  qualifying  devices  to  receive  on  a  when-and-if-available  basis,  future  unspecified  software  upgrades  relating  to  the  product’sessential
 software.  The  third  deliverable  is  the  non-software  services  to  be  provided  to  qualifying  devices.  The  Company  allocates  revenue  between  thesedeliverables using
 the relative selling price method. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for these deliverables, the allocation of revenue is basedon
 the Company’s ESPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software is recognized at the time of sale provided the otherconditions
 for revenue recognition have been met. Revenue allocated to the embedded unspecified software upgrade rights and the non-software services isdeferred
 and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided. Costof
 sales related to delivered hardware and related essential software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred toprovide
 non-software  services  are  recognized  as  cost  of  sales  as  incurred,  and  engineering  and  sales  and  marketing  costs  are  recognized  as  operatingexpenses as incurred.
The Company’s process for determining its ESP for deliverables without VSOE or TPE considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the
 unique factsand
 circumstances related to each deliverable including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company and market trends in the pricing for similar offerings,product
 specific business objectives, length of time a particular version of a device has been available, estimated cost to provide the non-software services andthe relative ESP of the upgrade right
s and non-software services as compared to the total selling price of the product.Shipping Costs
Amounts billed to customers
 related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and the Company’s shipping and handling costs are classified as cost ofsales.
Warranty Costs
The
 Company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized. The Companyassesses the adequacy of its accrued 
warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K |

Software Development CostsResearch
 and development (“R&D”) costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed aresubject
 to capitalization beginning when a product’s technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release tocustomers.
 In  most  instances,  the  Company’s  products  are  released  soon  after  technological  feasibility  has  been  established  and  as  a  result  softwaredevelopment costs were 
expensed as incurred.Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expe
nsed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses.Share-based Compensation
The Company recognizes expense related to share-based payment transactions in which it receives employee services in exchange for
 (a) equity instruments ofthe
 Company  or  (b)  liabilities  that  are  based  on  the  fair  value  of  the  Company’s  equity  instruments  or  that  may  be  settled  by  the  issuance  of  such  equityinstruments.
 Share-based compensation cost for restricted stock and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) is measured based on the closing fair market value of theCompany’s
 common  stock  on  the  date  of  grant.  The  Company  recognizes  share-based  compensation  cost  over  the  award’s  requisite  service  period  on  astraight-line
 basis for time-based  RSUs and on a graded  basis for RSUs that are contingent  on the achievement  of performance  conditions.  The Companyrecognizes a
 benefit from share-based compensation in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity if an excess tax benefit is realized. In addition, theCompany
 recognizes the indirect effects of share-based compensation on R&D tax credits, foreign tax credits and domestic manufacturing deductions in theConsolidated Statements of Operation
s. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, “Benefit Plans.”Income Taxes
The
 provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expectedfuture
 tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax creditcarryforwards.
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in whichthose
 tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amountthat is believed more l
ikely than not to be realized.The
 Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by thetaxing
 authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measuredbased on the largest benefit that has a greater than 
50% likelihood of being rea lized upon settlement. See Note 5, “Income Taxes” for additional information.Earnings Per Share
Basic
 earnings  per  share  is  computed  by  dividing  income  available  to  common  shareholders  by  the  weighted-average  number  of  shares  of  common  stockoutstanding during the period. Di
luted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number ofshares of
 common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstandingif the
 potentially dilutive securities had been issued. Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased by employees underthe
 Company’s employee stock purchase plan, unvested restricted stock and unvested RSUs. The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected indiluted
 earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the Company’scommon stock can result in
 a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K |

SecuritiesAll
 highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. The Company’s marketable debtand
 equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments atthe
 time of purchase and reevaluates the classifications at each balance sheet date. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-termor
 long-term based on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date. Marketable debt securities with maturities of 12 months or less are classified asshort-term
 and marketable  debt securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified as long-term.  Marketable equity securities, including mutualfunds,
 are classified as either short-term or long-term based on the nature of each security and its availability for use in current operations. The Company’smarketable
 debt and equity securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of accumulated othercomprehensive
 income  (“AOCI”)  in  shareholders’  equity,  with  the  exception  of  unrealized  losses  believed  to  be  other-than-temporary  which  are  reported  inearnings in the current period. The co
st of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.Derivative
Financial
Instruments
The Company accounts
 for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value.For
 derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion ofthe
 gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of AOCI in shareholders’ equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period orperiods
 during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, if any, is recognized inearnings
 in the current period. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected future cashflows on hedged
 transactions. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectivenessand are recognized in earnings.
For
 derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, both thenet gain or loss on the derivati
ve instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item are recognized in earnings in the current period.For
 derivative instruments and foreign currency debt that hedge the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates used for translation of the netinvestment
 in a foreign operation and that are designated as a net investment hedge, the net gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative instrument isreported
 in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Companyexcludes changes
 in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related tothis forward carry component a
re recognized in earnings in the current period.Derivatives that do not qual
ify as hedges are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the current period.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K |

Allowance for Doubtful AccountsThe
 Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors, including historical experience, age of the accountsreceivable balances, cred
it quality of the Company’s customers, current economic conditions and other factors that may affect the customers’ abilities to pay.Inventories
Inventories
 are  stated  at  the  lower  of  cost,  computed  using  the  first-in,  first-out  method  and  net  realizable  value.  Any  adjustments  to  reduce  the  cost  ofinventories
 to their net realizable value are recognized in earnings in the current period. As of September  24, 2016 and September 26, 2015 ,  the Company’sinventories consist primarily of finishe
d goods.Property, Plant and Equipment
Property,
 plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets,which
 for buildings is the lesser of 30  years or  the remaining life of the underlying building; between one to five years for  machinery and equipment, includingproduct
 tooling  and  manufacturing  process  equipment;  and  the  shorter  of  lease  terms  or  useful  life  for  leasehold  improvements.  The  Company  capitalizeseligible
 costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-usesoftware
 are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years .  Depreciation andamortization expense on property and equ
ipment was $8.3 billion , $9.2 billion and $6.9 billion during 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible 
AssetsThe
 Company reviews property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments and identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill and intangible assetswith
 indefinite useful lives, for impairment. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carryingamount
 of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cashflows
 the  assets  are  expected  to  generate.  If  property,  plant  and  equipment,  inventory  component  prepayments  and  certain  identifiable  intangibles  areconsidered to be impaired, the i
mpairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value.The
 Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, rather such assets are required to be tested for impairment at leastannually
 or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. The Company performs its goodwill and intangibleasset
 impairment  tests  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  each  year.  The  Company  did  not  recognize  any  impairment  charges  related  to  goodwill  or  indefinite  livedintangible
 assets during 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .  For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, the Company established reporting units based on its currentreporting structure. Goodwi
ll has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit. In 2016 and 2015 , the Company’s goodwill was primarily allocated to the Am
ericas and Europe reporting units.The
 Company amortizes its intangible assets with definite useful lives over their estimated useful lives and reviews these assets for impairment. The Companytypically amortizes its acquired inta
ngible assets with definite useful lives over periods from three to seven years . Fair Value Measurements
The
 Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fairvalue
 in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid totransfer a liability in
 an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets andliabilities,
 which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous  market in which the Company wouldtransact
 and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use to price the asset or liability, such as risks inherent invaluation techniques, transfer restrictions and
 credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measurefair
 value into  three  levels and  bases  the  categorization  within the  hierarchy upon  the  lowest level of  input that  is available  and significant  to  the fair valuemeasurement:
Level
1
– Quoted prices in ac tive markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level
2
–  Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilitiesin inactive markets,
 or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level

3
–  Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing theasset or liability.
Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 
48 
The Company’s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities were derived from quotedprices
 in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company’s debt instruments and allother
 financial instruments, all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings, were valued based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuationsusing significant input
s derived from or corroborated by observable market data.In accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure
 eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value.The Company has not elected the fair va
lue option for any eligible financial instruments.Foreign Currency Transl
ation and RemeasurementThe Company translates the assets and 
liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the endof
 each period. Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and lossesfrom
 these translations are recognized in foreign currency translation included in AOCI in shareholders’ equity. The Company’s subsidiaries that use the U.S.dollar
 as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property andnonmonetary assets 
and liabilities at historical rates.Note 2 – Financial Instruments

 Company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic reasons including, but not limited to, anticipation of creditdeterioration and duration management. The matur
ities of the Company’s long-term marketable securities generally range from one to five years . The
 Company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in nature. The Company typically investsin
 highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy generally requires investments tobe
 investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. Fair values were determined for each individual security in theinvestment
 portfolio. When evaluating an investment for other-than-temporary impairment the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent towhich
 fair  value  has  been  below  its  cost  basis,  the  financial  condition  of  the  issuer  and  any  changes  thereto,  changes  in  market  interest  rates  and  theCompany’s
 intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the investment’s cost basis. As ofSeptember 24, 2016 
, the Company does not consider any of it s investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired.Derivative Financial Instruments
The
 Company  may  use  derivatives  to  partially  offset  its  business  exposure  to  foreign  currency  and  interest  rate  risk on  expected  future  cash  flows,  on  netinvestments in certain fore
ign subsidiaries and on certain existing assets and liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for avariety
 of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be noassurance the hedges will off
set more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.To
 help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S.dollar
 may  hedge  a  portion  of  forecasted  foreign  currency  revenue,  and  subsidiaries  whose  functional  currency  is  not  the  U.S.  dollar  and  who  sell  in  localcurrencies
 may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The Company may enter intoforward
 contracts, option contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company typicallyhedges portions of its forecasted fore
ign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months . Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K |

To  help  protect  the  net  investment  in  a  foreign  operation  from  adverse  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  the  Company  may  enter  into  foreigncurrency forward and
 option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.In
 addition,  the  Company  may  use  non-derivative  financial  instruments,  such  as  its  foreign  currency-denominated  debt,  as  economic  hedges  of  its  netinvestments in certain fore
ign subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these instruments as net investment hedges.The Company may
 also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by there-measurement of cer
tain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.The
 Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options, or other instruments to manage interest rate risk. These instruments may offset a portion of changesin
 income or expense, or changes in fair value of the Company’s term debt or investments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow orfair value hedges. The Company’
s hedged interest rate transactions as of September 24, 2016 are expected to be recognized within 10 years . Cash
Flow
Hedges
The effective portions of cash flo
w hedges are recorded in AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cashflow
 hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferredgains and
 losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs arerecognized.
 Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized in other income/(expense), net in thesame
 period as the related income or expense is recognized. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of cash flow hedgesare recognized in other income/
(expense), net.Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it
 is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur inthe
 initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instrumentsare
 reclassified  immediately  into  other  income/(expense),  net.  Any  subsequent  changes  in  fair  value  of  such  derivative  instruments  are  reflected  in  otherincome/(expense), net unless they a
re re-designated as hedges of other transactions.Net

The
 effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. Theineffective portions and amounts ex

Value
Hedges
Gains
 and losses related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value ofthe underlying hedged item.
Non-Designated
Derivatives
Derivatives that
 are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the derivativerelates.
The
 Company records all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company’s accounting treatment for these derivative instruments isbased
 on  its  hedge  designation.  The  following  tables  show  the  Company’s  derivative  instruments  at  gross  fair  value  as  of September  24,  2016 and September 26, 2015

 amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding and do not represent the amount of theCompany’s
 exposure  to  credit  or  market  loss.  The  credit  risk  amounts  represent  the  Company’s  gross  exposure  to  potential  accounting  loss  on  derivativeinstruments
 that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency orinterest
 rates  at  each  respective  date.  The  Company’s  exposure  to  credit  loss  and  market  risk  will  vary  over  time  as  currency  and  interest  rates  change.Although
 the table above reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the Company’s derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associatedwith the
 exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments,together with the gains and losses on the unde
rlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.The
 Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with thesame
 counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received orposted
 when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assetsand
 derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The net cash collateral received by the Company related to derivativeinstruments
 under its collateral security arrangements  was $163  million as  of September  24, 2016 and $1.0 billion as  of September  26, 2015 ,  which wererecorded as accrued expenses in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets.Under
 master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, the Company is allowed to net settle transactionswith
 a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September  24, 2016 and September 26, 2015 ,  the potential effects of these rights of set-offassociated
 with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $1.5 billion 
and $2.2 billion , respectively, result ing in a net derivative asset of  $160 million and a net derivative  liability of $78 million , respectively. Accounts Receivable
Trade
Receivables
The
 Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, value-added resellers, smalland
 mid-sized  businesses  and  education,  enterprise  and  government  customers.  The  Company  generally  does  not  require  collateral  from  its  customers;however, the
 Company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on tradereceivables
 with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financingarrangements
 are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse orcredit risk sharing 
related to any of these arrangements.As of 
September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015 , the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accountedfor 
10% and 12% ,  respectively. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 63% and 71% of  trade receivables  as of September  24, 2016 and September 26, 2015

 tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidatedfinancial
 statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply totaxable income in the years 
in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.Uncertain Tax Positions
Tax
 positions are evaluated in a two-step process. The Company first determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained uponexamination.
 If a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in thefinancial statements. The tax pos
ition is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being real ized upon ultimate settlement. TheCompany
 classifies gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year asnon-current liabilities in the Cons
olidated Balance Sheets.As
 of September  24,  2016 ,  the  total  amount  of  gross  unrecognized  tax  benefits  was $7.7  billion ,  of  which $2.8  billion ,  if  recognized,  would  affect  theCompany’s
 effective  tax  rate.  As  of September  26,  2015 ,  the  total  amount  of  gross  unrecognized  tax  benefits  was $6.9  billion ,  of  which $2.5  billion ,  ifrecognized, would affect the Compan

 Company  includes  interest  and  penalties  related  to  unrecognized  tax  benefits  within  the  provision  for  income  taxes.  As  of September  24,  2016 and September
 26, 2015 ,  the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion ,  respectively, which is classified as non-currentliabilities in the
 Consolidated Balance Sheets. In connection with tax matters, the Company recognized interest and penalty expense in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 of $295 million 
, $709 million and $40 million , respectively. The
 Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. During the fourthquarter
 of 2016, the Company reached a partial settlement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) on its examination of the years 2010 through2012.
 In connection with this settlement, the Company recognized a tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2016 that was not significant to its consolidated financialstatements.
 All years prior to 2013 are closed, except for the years 2010 through 2012 relating to R&D tax credits. In addition, the Company is subject to auditsby
 state, local and foreign tax authorities. In major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 2003 generally remain open and could besubject to examination by the tax
ing authorities.The
 Company believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of taxaudits
 cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with its expectations, theCompany
 could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although timing of the resolution and/or closure ofaudits
 is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease (whether by payment, release or acombination of both) in the next 12 months by up to 
$850 million . On
 August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and2007
 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the "State Aid Decision"). The State Aid Decision ordersIreland
 to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through September 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as ofthe
 beginning of 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without meritand
 intends to appeal to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Ireland has also announced its intention to appeal the State AidDecision.
 While the European Commission announced a recovery amount of up to €13  billion ,  plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes subject torecovery
 is  to  be  calculated  by  Ireland  in  accordance  with  the  European  Commission's  guidance.  Once  the  recovery  amount  is  computed  by  Ireland,  theCompany
 anticipates  funding  it,  including  interest,  out  of  foreign  cash  into  escrow,  pending  conclusion  of  all  appeals.  The  Company  believes  that  anyincremental Irish corporate
 income taxes potentially due would be creditable against U.S. taxes.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K |

In April
 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization from $140 billion to $175 billion of the Company’s common stock, of
 which $133  billion had  been  utilized  as of September  24,  2016 .  The  Company’s  share  repurchase  program  does  not  obligate  it  to  acquire  any  specificnumber
 of shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complyingwith Rule 10b5-1 under the Secur
ities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K |

The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into accelerated share repurchase arrangements (“ASRs”) with financial institutions. In exchange for up-front
 payments, the financial institutions deliver shares of the Company’s common stock during the purchase periods of each ASR. The total number of sharesultimately
 delivered, and therefore the average repurchase price paid per share, is determined at the end of the applicable purchase period of each ASR basedon
 the volume weighted-average price of the Company’s common stock during that period. The shares received are retired in the periods they are delivered,and
 the up-front payments are accounted for as a reduction to shareholders’ equity in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets in the periods the paymentsare
 made. The Company reflects the ASRs as a repurchase of common stock in the period delivered for purposes of calculating earnings per share and asforward
 contracts indexed to its own common stock. The ASRs met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification, and therefore were not accounted for asderivative instruments.

“Number  of Shares” represents those shares delivered in the beginning of the purchase period and does not represent the final number of shares to be deliveredunder
 the ASR. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average repurchase price paid per share, will be determined at the end of thepurchase period based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock during that period. The
 August 2016 ASR purchase period will end inor before November 2016.

2014 Employee Stock Plan
In
 the second quarter of 2014, shareholders approved the 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”) and terminated the Company’s authority to grant newawards
 under  the  2003  Employee  Stock  Plan  (the  “2003  Plan”).  The  2014  Plan  provides  for  broad-based  equity  grants  to  employees,  including  executiveofficers, and permits
 the granting of RSUs, stock grants, performance-based awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights, as well as cash bonus awards.RSUs
 granted under the 2014 Plan generally vest over four  years ,  based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’scommon
 stock on a one -for-one basis. Each share issued with respect to RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan reduces the number of shares available for grantunder the plan by 
two shares. RSUs cancelled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant underthe
 2014 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs cancelled or shares withheld. Currently, all RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan have dividendequivalent
 rights (“DERs”), which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the samevesting and
 other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. Upon approvalof the 2014 Plan, the Company reserved 
385 million shares plus the number of shares rema ining that were reserved but not issued under the 2003 Plan. Sharessubject
 to outstanding awards under the 2003 Plan that expire, are cancelled or otherwise terminate, or are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations withrespect to
 RSUs, will also be available for awards under the 2014 Plan. As of September 24, 2016 , approximately 386.4 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2014 Plan.

2003 Employee Stock PlanThe
 2003 Plan is a shareholder approved plan that provided for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers. The 2003 Plan permittedthe
 granting  of  incentive  stock  options,  nonstatutory  stock  options,  RSUs,  stock  appreciation  rights,  stock  purchase  rights  and  performance-based  awards.Options
 granted under the 2003 Plan generally expire seven to ten years after  the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four  years , based on
 continued employment, with either annual, semi-annual or quarterly vesting. RSUs granted under the 2003 Plan generally vest over two to four years , based
 on continued employment and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one -for-one basis. All RSUs, other than RSUsheld
 by the Chief Executive Officer, granted under the 2003 Plan have DERs. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as thecorresponding
 unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. In the second quarter of 2014, the Company terminated theauthority to grant new awards under the 2003 P
lan.1997 Director Stock Plan
The
 1997 Director Stock Plan (the “Director Plan”) is a shareholder approved plan that (i) permits the Company to grant awards of RSUs or stock options to theCompany’s
 non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board of Directors and automaticannual
 grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change the relative mixture of stockoptions and
 RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the Company’s common stock subject tothese
 grants without shareholder approval. Each share issued with respect to RSUs granted under the Director Plan reduces the number of shares available forgrant
 under the plan by two shares. The Director Plan expires November  9, 2019 .  All RSUs granted under the Director Plan are entitled to DERs. DERs aresubject
 to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying sharesvest. As of 
September 24, 2016 , approximately 1.1 million shares were reserved for  future issuance under the Director Plan.Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans
During
 the three months ended September  24, 2016 ,  Section 16 officers Timothy D. Cook, Angela Ahrendts, Luca Maestri, Daniel Riccio, Philip Schiller andJeffrey
 Williams had equity trading plans in place in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. An equity trading plan is a written documentthat

cquired pursuant to the Company’s employee and director equity plans.Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The
 Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan  (the  “Purchase  Plan”)  is  a  shareholder  approved  plan  under  which  substantially  all  employees  may  purchase  theCompany’s common stock through
 payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the  lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the beginning or the end ofsix 
-month offering periods. An employee’s payroll deductions under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of the  employee’s compensation and employees maynot
 purchase more than $25,000 of  stock during any calendar year. As of September  24, 2016 ,  approximately 47.0  million shares  were reserved for futureissuance under the Purchase Plan.

 fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $5.1  billion , $4.8 billion and $3.4 billion for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 ,  respectively. The majority ofRSUs
 that vested in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 were  net-share settled such that the Company withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees’ minimumstatutory
 obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheldwere
 approximately 15.9  million , 14.1 million and 15.6 million for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 ,  respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on theirrespective
 vesting dates as determined by the Company’s closing stock price. Total payments for the employees’ tax obligations to taxing authorities were $1.7 billion 
, $1.6 billion and $1.2 billion in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 ,  respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of CashFlows. These net-share settlements had the effect of
 share repurchases by the Company as they reduced the number of shares that would have otherwise beenissued as a result of the vesting and d
id not represent an expense to the Company.Share-based Compensation

 and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-partyintellectual
 property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could besubject
 to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. In the opinion of management, therewas
 not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of end-users of its operating system orapplication software for in
fringement of third-party intellectual property rights.The
 Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and mainland China.The
 iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certainconditions
 are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such rightwith subsequent changes to the guarantee liab
ility recognized within revenue.The
 Company  has  entered  into  indemnification  agreements  with  its  directors  and  executive  officers.  Under  these  agreements,  the  Company  has  agreed  toindemnify
 such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advanceexpenses
 incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of paymentsthe
 Company  could  be  required  to  make  under  these  agreements  due  to  the  limited  history  of  prior  indemnification  claims  and  the  unique  facts  andcircumstances
 involved  in  each  claim.  However,  the  Company  maintains  directors  and  officers  liability  insurance  coverage  to  reduce  its  exposure  to  suchobligations.
Concentrations in the Available Sources of 
Supply of Materials and ProductAlthough
 most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, a number of components are currently obtainedfrom
 single or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication andmedia
 devices and personal computers. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are attimes
 subject to industry-wide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operatingresults.
The
 Company  uses  some  custom  components  that  are  not  commonly  used  by  its  competitors,  and  new  products  introduced  by  the  Company  often  utilizecustom
 components  available  from  only  one  source.  When  a  component  or  product  uses  new  technologies,  initial  capacity  constraints  may  exist  until  thesuppliers’
 yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed orconstrained,
 or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s financial condition and operating resultscould
 be materially adversely affected. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the timerequired
 to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability ofthese
 components  at  acceptable  prices,  or  at  all,  may  be  affected  if  those  suppliers  concentrated  on  the  production  of  common  components  instead  ofcomponents customized to meet the Compan
y’s requirements.The Company
 has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend orrenew
 these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases thatcould materially adversely affec
t its financial condition and operating results.Substantially
 all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration ofthis manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these
 outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced suppliers
 of components and manufacturers for many of the Company’s products. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners onmanufacturing
 schedules,  the  Company’s  operating  results  could  be  adversely  affected  if  its  outsourcing  partners  were  unable  to  meet  their  productioncommitments. The Company’
s manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days . Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K |

Other Off-Balance Sheet CommitmentsOperating
Leases
The
 Company  leases  various  equipment  and  facilities,  including  retail  space,  under  noncancelable  operating  lease  arrangements.  The  Company  does  notcurrently
 utilize any other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. As of September  24, 2016 ,  the Company’s total future minimum lease payments undernoncancelable
 operating  leases  were $7.6  billion .  The  Company's  retail  store  and  other  facility  leases  are  typically  for  terms  not  exceeding 10  years and generally contain multi-year re

The Company
 is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully adjudicated, asfurther
 discussed  in  Part  I,  Item  1A  of  this  Form  10-K  under  the  heading  “Risk  Factors”  and  in  Part  I,  Item  3  of  this  Form  10-K  under  the  heading  “LegalProceedings.”
 In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material lossin excess of
 a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain.Therefore,
 although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against theCompany
 in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s consolidated financial statements for that reporting periodcould be materially adversely a
ffected.Apple

v.
Samsung
Electron
ics
Co.,
Ltd.,
et
al.On August 24, 2012, a jury returned a verdict a
warding the Company $1.05 billion in its lawsuit against Samsung Elec tronics Co., Ltd. and affiliated parties in theUnited
 States  District  Court,  Northern  District  of  California,  San  Jose  Division.  On  March  6,  2014,  the  District  Court  entered  final  judgment  in  favor  of  theCompany in the amoun
t of approximately $930 million . On May 18,  2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed in part, and reversed in part,the decision of the Distr
ict Court. As a result, the Court of Appeals ordered entry of final judgment on damages in the amount of approximately $548 million , with the
 District Court to determine supplemental damages and interest, as well as damages owed for products subject to the reversal in part. Samsung paid $548 million 
to the Company in December 2015, which was included in  net sales in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. Because the case remainssubject
 to  further  proceedings,  the  Company  has  not  recognized  any  further  amounts  in  its  results  of  operations.  On  October  11,  2016,  the  United  StatesSupreme Court heard arguments in Sa
msung’s request for appeal related to the $548 million in damages. Note 11 – Segment Information and Geog
raphic DataThe
 Company  reports  segment  information  based  on  the  “management”  approach.  The  management  approach  designates  the  internal  reporting  used  bymanagement for making decision
s and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable operating segments.The
 Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable operating segments consist of the Americas, Europe, GreaterChina,
 Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries, aswell
 as India,  the  Middle  East  and  Africa.  The  Greater  China segment  includes  China,  Hong  Kong  and Taiwan.  The  Rest of  Asia  Pacific  segment  includesAustralia
 and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable operating segments. Although the reportable operating segments providesimilar
 hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers anddistribution
 partners  and  the  unique  market  dynamics  of  each  geographic  region.  The  accounting  policies  of  the  various  segments  are  the  same  as  thosedescribed in Note 1, “Summ
ary of Significant Accounting Policies.”Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K |

The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable operating segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments aregenerally
 based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for eachsegment includes net
 sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generallyincluded in the geographic segment 
in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certainexpenses
 managed outside the reportable operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such asR&D,
 corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managedgeneral and administrative 
costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.The following table show

lders of Apple Inc.We have audited the accompanying conso

 of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September  24, 2016 . These financial statements are
 the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements basedon our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the
 standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that weplan
 and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  financial  statements  are  free  of  material  misstatement.  An  audit  includesexamining,
 on  a  test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements.  An  audit  also  includes  assessing  the  accountingprinciples

Report of Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and Shareho

 have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September  24, 2016 ,  based on criteria established in Internal 
Control
–
IntegratedFramework
issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  (2013  framework)  (“the  COSO  criteria”).  Apple  Inc.’smanagement
 is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control overfinancial
 reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express anopinion on the Company’s inte
rnal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We
 conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that weplan
 and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  maintained  in  all  materialrespects.
 Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testingand
 evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considerednecessary in the circum
stances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A company’s internal cont
rol over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation
 of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  A  company’s  internal  control  overfinancial
 reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflectthe
 transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permitpreparation
 of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are beingmade
 only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of  the  company;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  ortimely detection of unauthorized a
cquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because
 of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  ofeffectiveness
 to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliancewith the policies or procedur
es may deteriorate.In
 our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September  24, 2016 ,  based on the COSOcriteria.
We
 also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the 2016 consolidated  financialstatements of Apple Inc. and our report dated 
October 26, 2016 expressed an unqu alified opinion thereon.

Item 9.Changes in and Disagreements with Accountan ts on Accounting and Financial DisclosureNone.
Item 9A.
Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and P
roceduresBased
 on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principalfinancial
 officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Actwere
 effective as of September  24, 2016 to  provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files orsubmits
 under  the  Exchange  Act  is  (i)  recorded,  processed,  summarized  and  reported  within  the  time  periods  specified  in  the  SEC  rules  and  forms  and(ii) accumulated and
 communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allowtimely decisions regarding require
d disclosure.Inherent Limitations
 Over Internal ControlsThe
 Company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  thepreparation
 of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company’s internalcontrol over financial repor
ting includes those policies and procedures that: 
(i)
pertain  to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’sassets;
(ii)
provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  withGAAP,
 and  that  the  Company’s  receipts  and  expenditures  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  the  Company’smanagement and directors; and
(iii)
provide  reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assetsthat could have a material effect on the finan
cial statements.Management,
 including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s internal controls will prevent ordetect
 all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that theobjectives
 of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits ofcontrols
 must  be  considered  relative  to  their  costs.  Because  of  the  inherent  limitations  in  all control  systems,  no  evaluation  of  internal  controls  can  provideabsolute
 assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in futureperiods
 are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliancewith the policies or procedur
es may deteriorate.Management’s Annual Report on Inte
rnal Control Over Financial ReportingThe
 Company’s management  is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate  internal control over financial reporting  (as defined  in Rule 13a-15(f)under
 the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on thecriteria
 set  forth  in  Internal  Control  –  Integrated  Framework  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  (2013framework).
 Based  on  the  Company’s  assessment,  management  has  concluded  that  its  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  effective  as  ofSeptember
 24, 2016 to  provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordancewith
 GAAP. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the Company’s internal controlover financial reporting, 
which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial 
ReportingThere
 were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2016 ,  which were identified in connection withmanagement’s
 evaluation required by paragraph (d) of rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likelyto materially affect, t

APPLE INC. 2014 EMPLOYEE STOCK PLAN
RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD
1. 
General .  These Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award (these “ Terms ”)  apply to a particular restricted stock unitaward
 (the “ Award ”)  granted by Apple Inc., a California corporation (the “ Company ”),  and are incorporated by reference in the Notice of Grant(the
 “ Grant  Notice ”)  corresponding  to  that  particular  grant.  The  recipient  of  the  Award  identified  in  the  Grant  Notice  is  referred  to  as  the  “Participant 
.”  The effective date of grant of the Award as set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to as the “ Award Date .”  The Award was grantedunder
 and is subject to the provisions of the Apple Inc. 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “ Plan ”).  Capitalized terms are defined in the Plan if notdefined herein. The Award has been granted to
 the Participant in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other form of compensation otherwise payable orto be paid to the Participant. The Grant Notice and these Terms are collectively referred to as the “ 
Award Agreement ” applicable to the Award. 2. 
     Stock Units . As  used herein, the term “ Stock Unit ” shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement which is deemed for bookkeeping purposes
 to be equivalent to one outstanding share of the Company’s Common Stock (“ Share ”)  solely for purposes of the Plan and this AwardAgreement.
 The Stock Units shall be used solely as a device for the determination of the payment to eventually be made to the Participant if suchStock Units vest pursuant to this Award Agreement. The Stock Units shall not be treated as property or as a trust fund of any kind.
3. 
     Vesting .  Subject to Section 8 below, the Award shall vest and become nonforfeitable as set forth in the Grant Notice. (Each vestingdate set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to herein as a “ 
Vesting Date ”). 4. 
     Continuance of Employment .  The vesting schedule requires continued employment or service through each applicable VestingDate as a condition to the vesting of the applicab
le installment of the Award and the rights and benefits under this Award Agreement. Employment orservice
 for only a portion of the vesting period, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any proportionate vesting or avoid ormitigate a termination of rights and benefits upon or followi
ng a Termination of Service as provided in Section 8 below and in the Plan.Nothing
 contained in this Award Agreement or the Plan constitutes an employment or service commitment by the Company, affects theParticipant’s
 status  as an employee at will who is subject  to termination  with or without cause, confers upon the Participant  any right  to remainemployed
 by or in service to the Company or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Company or any Subsidiary at any time toterminate
 such  employment  or  services,  or  affects  the  right  of  the  Company  or  any  Subsidiary  to  increase  or  decrease  the  Participant’s  othercompensation
 or benefits. Nothing in this paragraph, however, is intended to adversely affect any independent contractual right of the Participantwithout his or her consent thereto.
5. 
     Dividend and Voting Rights . (
a)         Limitations  on Rights Associated with Stock Units .  The Participant  shall have no rights  as a shareholder  of theCompany,
 no dividend rights (except as expressly provided in Section 5(b) with respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights) and no voting rights, withrespect
 to the Stock Units or any Shares underlying or issuable in respect of such Stock Units until such Shares are actually issued to and held ofrecord
 by the Participant. No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the record date is prior to the date ofissuance of the stock certificate or book entry evidencing such Shares.
1

(b)         Dividend  Equivalent Rights Distributions .  As of any date that the Company pays an ordinary cash dividend on itsCommon
 Stock, the Company shall credit the Participant with a dollar amount equal to (i) the per share cash dividend paid by the Company on itsCommon
 Stock on such date, multiplied by (ii) the total number of Stock Units (with such total number adjusted pursuant to Section 11 of the Plan)subject
 to the Award that are outstanding immediately prior to the record date for that dividend (a “ Dividend  Equivalent Right ”).  Any DividendEquivalent
 Rights credited pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 5(b) shall be subject to the same vesting, payment and other terms,conditions
 and restrictions as the original Stock Units to which they relate; provided, however, that the amount of any vested Dividend EquivalentRights
 shall be paid in cash. No crediting of Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be made pursuant to this Section 5(b) with respect to any Stock Unitswhich, immediately prior to the record date for that dividend, have either bee
n paid pursuant to Section 7 or terminated pursuant to Section 8.6. 
     Restrictions on Transfer .  Except as provided in Section 4(c) of the Plan, neither the Award, nor any interest therein or amount orShares payable in
 respect thereof may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of, alienated or encumbered, either voluntarilyor involuntarily.
7. 
     Timing and Manner of Payment of Stock Units . On  or as soon as administratively practical following each vesting of the applicableportion
 of the total Award pursuant to Section 3 or Section 8 (and in all events not later than two and one-half (2 ½) months after such vestingevent),
 the Company shall deliver to the Participant a number of Shares (either by delivering one or more certificates for such Shares or by enteringsuch
 Shares in book entry form, as determined by the Company in its discretion) equal to the number of Stock Units subject to the Award that veston
 the  applicable  Vesting  Date,  less  Tax-Related  Items  (as  defined  in  Section  11  below),  unless  such  Stock  Units  terminate  prior  to  the  givenVesting
 Date pursuant to Section 8. The Company’s obligation to deliver Shares or otherwise make payment with respect to vested Stock Units issubject to
 the condition precedent that the Participant or other person entitled under the Plan to receive any Shares with respect to the vested StockUnits
 deliver to the Company any representations or other documents or assurances required pursuant to Section 13(c) of the Plan. The Participantshall have no further rights with respect to any Stock Units that are paid or that terminate pursuant to Section 8.
8. 
     Effect of Termination of Service .  Except as expressly provided below in this Section 8, the Participant’s Stock Units (as well as therelated
 Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall terminate to the extent such Stock Units have not become vested prior to the Participant’s Termination ofService,
 meaning  the  first  date  the  Participant  is  no  longer  employed  by  or  providing  services  to  the  Company  or  one  of  its  Subsidiaries  (the  “Severance
 Date ”),  regardless of the reason for the Participant’s Termination of Service, whether with or without cause, voluntarily or involuntarily.Notwithstanding
 the foregoing, in the event the Participant’s Termination of Service is due to the Participant’s Disability at a time when Stock Unitsremain
 outstanding and unvested under the Award, (a) the Award shall vest with respect to the number of Stock Units determined by multiplying (i)the
 number of then-outstanding and unvested Stock Units subject to the Award that would have otherwise vested pursuant to Section 3 on the nextVesting Date following the Severance Date but for
 such Termination of Service, by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of daysthat
 have elapsed between the Vesting Date that immediately preceded the Severance Date (or, in the case of a Termination of Service prior to theinitial
 Vesting  Date,  the  Vesting  Commencement  Date)  and  the  Severance  Date,  and  the  denominator  of  which  shall  be   the  number  of  daysbetween the Vesting Date that immediately preced
ed the Severance Date (or, in the case of a Termination of Service prior to the initial Vesting Date,the
 Vesting Commencement Date) and the next Vesting Date following the Severance Date that would have occurred but for such Termination ofService; and
 (b) any Stock Units (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) that are not vested after giving effect to the foregoing clause (a)shall
 terminate on the Severance Date. Further, in the event the Participant’s Termination of Service is due to the Participant’s death, any then-outstanding
 and unvested Stock Units subject to the Award shall be fully vested as of the Severance Date, and any Dividend Equivalent Rightscredited
 to the Participant shall be paid. If any unvested Stock Units are terminated hereunder, such Stock Units (as well as the related DividendEquivalent
 Rights) shall automatically terminate and be cancelled as of the applicable Severance Date without payment of any consideration by theCompany and without any other action by the Particip
ant or the Participant’s personal representative, as the case may be.2

9.      Recoupment .  Notwithstanding  any other  provision  herein,  the Award and any Shares or other  amount  or property  that  may beissued,
 delivered or paid in respect of the Award, as well as any consideration that may be received in respect of a sale or other disposition of anysuch
 Shares  or  property,  shall  be  subject  to  any  recoupment,  “clawback”  or  similar  provisions  of  applicable  law,  as  well  as  any  recoupment  or“clawback”
 policies  of  the  Company  that  may  be  in  effect  from  time  to  time.  In  addition,  the  Company  may  require  the  Participant  to  deliver  orotherwise
 repay to the Company the Award and any Shares or other amount or property that may be issued, delivered or paid in respect of theAward,
 as well as any consideration that may be received in respect of a sale or other disposition of any such Shares or property, if the Companyreasonably determines that one or more of the following has occ
urred:(a)
during the peri od of the Participant’s employment or service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the “ Employment Period ”),
 the Participant has committed a felony (under the laws of the United States or any relevant state, or a similar crime or offenseunder the applicable laws of any rel
evant foreign jurisdiction);(b)
during  the Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has committed or engaged in a breach of confidentiality, oran
 unauthorized  disclosure  or  use  of  inside  information,  customer  lists,  trade  secrets  or  other  confidential  information  of  theCompany or any of its Subsidiaries;
(c)
during the  Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has committed or engaged in an act of theft, embezzlementor fraud, or materially breached any agreement to which the Participant is a party with the Comp
any or any of its Subsidiaries.10. 
     Adjustments Upon Specified Events .  Upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the Company’s stock contemplated bySection
 11  of  the  Plan  (including,  without  limitation,  an  extraordinary  cash  dividend  on  such  stock),  the  Committee  shall  make  adjustments  inaccordance
 with such section in the number of Stock Units then outstanding and the number and kind of securities that may be issued in respect ofthe Award. No such adjustment
 shall be made with respect to any ordinary cash dividend for which Dividend Equivalent Rights are credited pursuantto Section 5(b).
11. 
     Responsibility  for Taxes .  The  Participant  acknowledges  that,  regardless  of  any  action  the  Company  and/or  the  Participant’semployer
 (the “ Employer ”)  take  with  respect  to  any  or  all  income  tax  (including  U.S.  federal,  state  and  local  tax  and/or  non-U.S.  tax),  socialinsurance, payroll tax, payment on account
 or other tax-related items related to the Participant’s participation in the Plan and legally applicable to theParticipant or deemed by the Company
 or the Employer to be an appropriate charge to the Participant even if technically due by the Company or theEmployer
 (“ Tax-Related  Items ”),  the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Participant’s responsibility and may exceed theamount
 actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. The Participant further acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (i) makeno representations or undertakings regarding the treatment
 of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Award, including the grantof
 the Stock Units, the vesting of the Stock Units, the delivery of Shares, the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired at vesting and the receipt ofany
 dividends and/or Dividend Equivalent Rights; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or anyaspect
 of  the  Award  to  reduce  or  eliminate  the  Participant’s  liability  for  Tax-Related  Items  or  achieve  any  particular  tax  result.  Further,  if  theParticipant
 is  or  becomes  subject  to  tax  in  more  than  one  jurisdiction,  the  Participant  acknowledges  that  the  Company  and/or  the  Employer  (orformer employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or acco
unt for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.Prior
 to the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Participant shall pay or make arrangements satisfactory tothe
 Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Participant authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, ortheir
 respective  agents,  at  their  discretion  and  pursuant  to  such  procedures  as  they  may  specify  from  time  to  time,  to  satisfy  any  applicablewithholding oblig
ations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:3

(a)     withholding from any wages or other cash compensati on payable to the Participant by the Company and/or the Employer;(b)     
withholding otherwise de liverable Shares and/or from otherwise payable Dividend Equivalent Rights to be issued or paid uponvesting/settlement of the Award;
(c) 
    arranging for the sale of Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant (on the Participant’s behalf and at the Participant’sdirection pursuant to this authorization), includi
ng selling Shares as part of a block trade with other Participants in the Plan; or(d)     
withholding from the proceeds of the sale of Shares acqu ired upon vesting/settlement of the Award.Notwithsta
nding the foregoing, if the Participant is an officer of the Company who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, thenthe
 Company  must  satisfy  any  withholding  obligations  arising  upon  the  occurrence  of  a  taxable  or  tax  withholding  event,  as  applicable,by
 withholding Shares otherwise deliverable or an amount otherwise payable upon settlement of Dividend Equivalent Rights pursuant tomethod
 (b),  unless  the  Board  or  the  Committee  determines  in  its  discretion  to  satisfy  the  obligation  for  Tax-Related  Items  by  one  or  acombination of methods (a), (b), (c), and (d) above.
Depending
 on the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimumstatutory
 withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates.  If the maximum rate is used, any over-withheld
 amount will be refunded to the Participant in cash by the Company or Employer (with no entitlement to the Common Stock equivalent) or ifnot
 refunded, the Participant may seek a refund from the local tax authorities. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding anumber
 of Shares as described herein, for tax purposes, the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to thevested
 Stock  Units,  notwithstanding  that  a  number  of  the  Shares  are  held  back  solely  for  the  purpose  of  paying  the  Tax-Related  Items.  TheParticipant shall pay to the Company and/or the Employ
er any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company and/or the Employer may be requiredto
 withhold or account for as a result of the Participant’s participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. TheCompany may
 refuse to issue or deliver to the Participant any Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares if the Participant fails to comply with theParticipant’s obligations in co
nnection with the Tax-Related Items.12.

 means or request the Participant’s consent to participate in the Plan by electronic means. The Participant hereby consents to receive allapplicable

 stock unit award (the “ Award ”)  granted by Apple Inc., a California corporation (the “ Company ”),  and are incorporated by reference inthe
 Notice of Grant (the “ Grant Notice ”)  corresponding to that particular grant. The recipient of the Award identified in the Grant Notice is referredto
 as the “ Participant .”  The effective date of grant of the Award as set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to as the “ Award  Date .”  The Awardwas

 or to be paid to the Participant. The Grant Notice and these Terms (including Exhibit  A hereto,  incorporated herein by this reference) arecollectively referred to as the “ 
Award Agreement ” applicable to the Award. 2. 
     Stock Units . As  used herein, the term “ Stock Unit ” shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement which is deemed for bookkeeping purposes
 to be equivalent to one outstanding share of the Company’s Common Stock (“ Share ”)  solely for purposes of the Plan and this AwardAgreement.
 The Stock Units shall be used solely as a device for the determination of the payment to eventually be made to the Participant if suchStock Units vest pursuant to this Award Agreement. The Stock Units shall not be treated as property or as a trust fund of any kind.
3. 
     Vesting .  Subject to Section 8 below, the Award shall vest and become nonforfeitable as set forth in the Grant Notice and Exhibit A hereto. (The vesting date set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to herein as a “ 
Vesting Date ”). 4. 
     Continuance  of Employment .  The  vesting  schedule  requires  continued  employment  or  service  through  the  Vesting  Date  as  acondition
 to  the  vesting  of  the  Award  and the  rights  and benefits  under  this  Award  Agreement.  Employment  or  service  for  only a portion  of  thevesting period, eve
n if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any proportionate vesting or avoid or mitigate a termination of rights andbenefits upon or following a Terminatio
n of Service as provided in Section 8 below and in the Plan.Nothing
 contained in this Award Agreement or the Plan constitutes an employment or service commitment by the Company, affects theParticipant’s
 status  as an employee at will who is subject  to termination  with or without cause, confers upon the Participant  any right  to remainemployed
 by or in service to the Company or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Company or any Subsidiary at any time toterminate
 such  employment  or  services,  or  affects  the  right  of  the  Company  or  any  Subsidiary  to  increase  or  decrease  the  Participant’s  othercompensation
 or benefits. Nothing in this paragraph, however, is intended to adversely affect any independent contractual right of the Participantwithout his or her consent thereto.
5. 
     Dividend and Voting Rights . (
a)         Limitations  on Rights Associated with Stock Units .  The Participant  shall have no rights  as a shareholder  of theCompany,
 no dividend rights (except as expressly provided in Section 5(b) with respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights) and no voting rights, withrespect to the Stock Units or any Shares underlying or issuable i
n respect of such Stock Units until such Shares are actually issued to and held of1

record by the Participant. No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the record date is prior to the date ofissuance of the stock certificate or book entry evidencing such Shares.
(
b)         Dividend  Equivalent Rights Distributions .  As of any date that the Company pays an ordinary cash dividend on itsCommon
 Stock, the Company shall credit the Participant with a dollar amount equal to (i) the per share cash dividend paid by the Company on itsCommon
 Stock on such date, multiplied by (ii) the total target number of Stock Units (with such total number adjusted pursuant to Section 11 of thePlan)
 subject  to  the  Award  that  are  outstanding  immediately  prior  to  the  record  date  for  that  dividend  (a  “ Dividend  Equivalent  Right ”).  AnyDividend Equivale
nt Rights credited pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 5(b) shall be subject to the same vesting, payment and otherterms,
 conditions  and  restrictions  as  the  original  Stock  Units  to  which  they  relate;  provided,  however,  that  the  amount  of  any  vested  DividendEquival
ent Rights shall be paid in cash. For purposes of clarity, the percentage of the Dividend Equivalent Rights that are paid will correspond to thepercentage
 of  the  total  target  number  of  Stock  Units  that  vest  on  the  Vesting  Date,  after  giving  effect  to Exhibit  A .  No  crediting  of  DividendEquivalent
 Rights shall be made pursuant to this Section 5(b) with respect to any Stock Units which, immediately prior to the record date for thatdividend, have either been pa
id pursuant to Section 7 or terminated pursuant to Section 8 or Exhibit A . 6.

     Timing and Manner of Payment of Stock Units .  On or as soon as administratively practical following the vesting of the Awardpursuant
 to Section 3 or Section 8 (and in all events not later than two and one-half (2 ½) months after such vesting event), the Company shalldeliver to
 the Participant a number of Shares (either by delivering one or more certificates for such Shares or by entering such Shares in book entryform,
 as determined by the Company in its discretion) equal to the number of Stock Units subject to the Award that vest on the Vesting Date, lessTax-Related
 Items  (as  defined  in  Section  11  below),  unless  such  Stock  Units  terminate  prior  to  the  Vesting  Date  pursuant  to  Section  8.  TheCompany’s
 obligation to deliver Shares or otherwise make payment with respect to vested Stock Units is subject to the condition precedent that theParticipant
 or  other  person  entitled  under  the  Plan  to  receive  any  Shares  with  respect  to  the  vested  Stock  Units  deliver  to  the  Company  anyrepresentations
 or other documents or assurances required pursuant to Section 13(c) of the Plan. The Participant shall have no further rights withrespect to any Stock Units that are paid or that terminate pursuant to Section 8.

 the first date the Participant is no longer employed by or providing services to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries (the “ Severance Date 
”),  regardless of the reason for the Participant’s Termination of Service, whether with or without cause, voluntarily or involuntarily. In the eventthe
 Participant’s  Severance  Date  is  the  result  of  the  Participant’s  Termination  of  Service  due  to  the  Participant’s  death  or  Disability,  and  theSeverance
 Date occurs prior to the Vesting Date, on the Vesting Date the Award shall vest with respect to a number of Stock Units determined bymultiplying
 (i)  the  Stock  Units  subject  to  the  Award  that  would  have  otherwise  vested  pursuant  to  the  Award  on  such  Vesting  Date  but  for  theTermination
 of  Service  and  to  the  extent  the  applicable  performance-based  vesting  requirement  is  satisfied,  by  (ii)  the  Severance  Fraction(determined
 as set forth below). Any Stock Units that are unvested on the Severance Date and that are not eligible to vest on the Vesting Datefollowing
 the  Severance  Date  pursuant  to  the  preceding  sentence  shall  terminate  as  of  the  Severance  Date,  and  any  Stock  Units  that  remainoutstandi
ng and unvested after giving effect to the preceding sentence shall terminate as of the Vesting Date. The “ Severance Fraction ” means a fraction, the numerator of which shall be determined by subtracting the number of days remaining in the Performance Period on the Severance Date
from the total
 number of days in the Performance Period, and the denominator of which shall be the total number of days in the Performance Period.If
 any unvested Stock Units are terminated pursuant to this Award Agreement, such Stock Units (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights)shall automatically terminate and be cance
lled as of the applicable Severance Date (or, to the extent the applicable performance-based2

 or other tax-related items related to the Participant’s participation in the Plan and legally applicable to theParticipant or deemed by the Company

 of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Award, including the grantof
 the Stock Units, the vesting of the Stock Units, the delivery of Shares, the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired at vesting and the receipt ofany

PERFORMANCE AWARDEXHIBIT A
PERFORMANCE VESTING REQUIREMENTS
The
 Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) subject to the Award that will vest on the Vesting Date will be determined basedon the Company’s relative total sharehold
er return (“ TSR ”) Percentile for the Performance Period. The percentage of the Stock Units (and related Divide
nd Equivalent Rights) that vest on the Vesting Date will be determined as follows:•
If the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [ ] ([ ]) percentile or greater, [ ] ([ ]%) of the target Stock Unitswill vest on the Vesting Date.
•
If the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [ ] ([ ]) percentile, [ ] ([ ]%) of the target Stock Units will veston the Vesting Date.
•
If the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [ ] ([ ]) percentile, [ ] ([ ]%) of the target Stock Units will veston the Vesting Date.
•
If the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is below the [ ] ([ ]) percentile, [ ] ([ ]%) of the Stock Units will vest onthe Vesting Date.
For TSR
 Percentile performance for the Performance Period between the levels indicated above, the portion of the Stock Units that will veston
 the Vesting Date will be determined on a straight-line basis ( i.e.
 , linearly interpolated) between the two nearest vesting percentages indicatedabove.
Notwithstanding
 the foregoing, if the Company’s TSR for the Performance  Period is negative, in no event shall more than one hundredpercent (100%) of the target Stock Units vest.
The
 number of Stock Units that vest on the Vesting Date will be rounded to the nearest whole unit, and the balance of the Stock Units willnot vest and will terminate on that Vesting Date.
For purposes of the Award, the following definitio
ns will apply:•
“ TSR Percentile ”  means the percentile ranking of the Company’s TSR among the TSRs for the Comparison Group members forthe
 Performance  Period.  In  determining  the  Company’s  TSR  Percentile  for  the  Performance  Period,  in  the  event  that  theCompany’
s TSR for the Performance Period is equal to the TSR(s) of one or more other Comparison Group members for that sameperiod,
 the Company’s TSR Percentile ranking will be determined by ranking the Company’s TSR for that period as being greaterthan such other Comparison Group members.
•
“ Comparison Group ”  means the Company and each other company included in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index on the first dayof
 the Performance Period and, except as provided below, the common stock (or similar equity security) of which continues to belisted or
 traded on a national securities exchange through the last trading day of the Performance Period. In the event a member ofthe
 Comparison  Group  files  for  bankruptcy  or  liquidates  due  to  an  insolvency,  such  company  shall  continue  to  be  treated  as  aCompariso
n Group member, and such company’s Ending Price will be treated as $0 if the common stock (or similar equity security)of such company is no longer listed or traded on a nation

exchange on the last trading day of the Performance Period. In the event of a formation of a new parent company by a ComparisonGroup member,
 substantially all of the assets and liabilities of which consist immediately after the transaction of the equity interestsin
 the original Comparison Group member or the assets and liabilities of such Comparison Group member immediately prior to thetransactio
n, such new parent company shall be substituted for the Comparison Group member to the extent (and for such period oftime)
 as its common stock (or similar equity securities) are listed or traded on a national securities exchange but the common stock(or
 similar  equity  securities)  of  the  original  Comparison  Group  member  are  not.  In  the  event  of  a  merger  or  other  businesscombination of two Comparison G
roup members (including, without limitation, the acquisition of one Comparison Group member, orall or
 substantially all of its assets, by another Comparison Group member), the surviving, resulting or successor entity, as the casemay
 be, shall continue to be treated as a member of the Comparison Group, provided that the common stock (or similar equitysecurity)
 of such entity is listed or traded on a national securities exchange through the last trading day of the Performance Period.With
 respect  to  the  preceding  two  sentences,  the  applicable  stock  prices  shall  be  equitably  and  proportionately  adjusted  to  theextent (if any) necessary to preserve the intended incentives of the awards and mitig
ate the impact of the transaction.•
“ TSR ”  shall be determined with respect to the Company and any other Comparison Group member by dividing: (a) the sum of (i)the
 difference obtained by subtracting the applicable Beginning Price from the applicable Ending Price plus (ii) all dividends andother
 distributions during the Performance Period by (b) the applicable Beginning Price. Any non-cash distributions shall be valuedat
 fair market value. For the purpose of determining TSR, the value of dividends and other distributions shall be determined bytreating them as reinvested in additional shares of stock at the closin
g market price on the date of distribution.•
“ Beginning Price ”  means, with respect to the Company and any other Comparison Group member, the average of the closingmarket
 prices  of  such  company’s  common  stock  on  the  principal  exchange  on  which  such  stock  is  traded  for  the  twenty  (20)consecutive
 trading  days  ending  with  the  last  trading  day  before  the  beginning  of  the  Performance  Period.  For  the  purpose  ofdetermining
 Beginning Price, the value of dividends and other distributions shall be determined by treating them as reinvested inadditional shares of stock at the closing market price on the date of distributio
n.•
“ Ending  Price ”  means,  with  respect  to  the  Company  and  any  other  Comparison  Group  member,  the  average  of  the  closingmarket
 prices  of  such  company’s  common  stock  on  the  principal  exchange  on  which  such  stock  is  traded  for  the  twenty  (20)consecutive
 trading days ending on the last trading day of the Performance Period. For the purpose of determining Ending Price,the
 value of dividends and other distributions shall be determined by treating them as reinvested in additional shares of stock at theclosing market price on the date of distribution.
With
 respect to the computation of TSR, Beginning Price, and Ending Price, there shall also be an equitable and proportionate adjustmentto
 the  extent  (if  any)  necessary  to  preserve  the  intended  incentives  of  the  awards  and  mitigate  the  impact  of  any  stock  split,  stock  dividend  orreverse
 stock split occurring during the Performance Period (or during the applicable 20-day period in determining Beginning Price or Ending Price,as the case may be).
