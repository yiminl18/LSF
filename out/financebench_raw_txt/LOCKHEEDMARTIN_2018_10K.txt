ITEM  1.    Business
General
We are a global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of
advanced technology systems, products and services. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics, system
integration and cybersecurity services. We serve both U.S. and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil and commercial
applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government. In 2018, 70% of our $53.8 billion in net sales were from the U.S.
Government, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor (including 60% from the Department of Defense (DoD)), 28% were from international
customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) and 2% were from U.S. commercial and other customers. Our
main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cybersecurity.
We operate in an environment characterized by both complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures in the U.S. and globally. A
significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our
products and services, and placing security capability quickly into the hands of our U.S. and international customers at affordable prices. Recognizing that our
customers are resource constrained, we are endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio domestically in a disciplined manner with a focus on adjacent
markets close to our core capabilities, as well as growing our international sales. We continue to focus on affordability initiatives. We also expect to continue
to innovate and invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements for our customers and invest in our people so that we have the technical skills
necessary to succeed.
We operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space. We organize our
business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered.
Aeronautics
In 2018, our Aeronautics business segment generated net sales of $21.2 billion, which represented 40% of our total consolidated net sales. Aeronautics’
customers include the military services, principally the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy, and various other government agencies of the U.S. and other countries.
In 2018, U.S. Government customers accounted for 63%, international customers accounted for 36% and U.S. commercial and other customers accounted for
1% of Aeronautics’ net sales. Net sales from Aeronautics’ combat aircraft products and services represented 32%, 31% and 28% of our total consolidated net
sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016.
Aeronautics is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft,
including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Aeronautics’ major programs include:
•F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter - international multi-role, multi-variant, fifth generation stealth fighter;
•C-130 Hercules - international tactical airlifter;
•F-16 Fighting Falcon - low-cost, combat-proven, international multi-role fighter; and
•F-22 Raptor - air dominance and multi-mission fifth generation stealth fighter.
The F-35 program is our largest program, generating 27% of our total consolidated net sales, as well as 68% of Aeronautics’ net sales in 2018. The F-35
program consists of development contracts, multiple production contracts, and sustainment activities. The development contracts are being performed
concurrently with the production contracts. Concurrent performance of development and production contracts is used for complex programs to test aircraft,
shorten the time to field systems and achieve overall cost savings. In April 2018, we completed the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) flight
testing portion of the development contract and began the next phase of development in support of phased capability improvements and modernization of the
F-35 air system. This next phase of development work is being performed separately from the basic SDD contract as part of the Joint Program Office’s
Continuous Capability Development and Delivery (C2D2) strategy. In December 2018, the DoD officially approved the F-35 program to begin the formal
Initial Operational Test & Evaluation (IOT&E) phase. Testing is expected to be completed during 2019. The data will be analyzed by the U.S. Government as
part of their evaluation to transition the F-35 program from Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) into full-rate production at the end of 2019.
Production of the aircraft is expected to continue for many years given the U.S. Government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the U.S.
Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Navy; commitments from our eight international partners and
3
Table of Contents
three international customers; as well as expressions of interest from other countries. In 2018, we delivered 91 aircraft, including 37 to international
customers, resulting in total deliveries of 357 production aircraft as of December 31, 2018. We have 396 production aircraft in backlog as of December 31,
2018, including orders from our international partners. For additional information on the F-35 program, see “Status of the F‑35 Program” in Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Aeronautics produces and provides support and sustainment services for the C-130J Super Hercules, as well as upgrades and support services for the
legacy C-130 Hercules worldwide fleet. We delivered 25 C-130J aircraft in 2018, including two to international customers. We have 78 aircraft in our backlog
as of December 31, 2018 with advanced funding from customers for additional C-130J aircraft not currently in backlog. Our C-130J backlog extends into
2022.
In June 2018, we received a contract from the U.S. Government for the sale of new production Block 70 F-16 aircraft for the Royal Bahraini Air Force
and in December 2018, Slovakia signed a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) to procure 14 new production F-16 Block 70/72 aircraft. We are
transitioning F-16 production to Greenville, South Carolina to support the production programs and other emerging F-16 production requirements.
Additionally, Aeronautics continues to provide service-life extension, modernization and other upgrade programs for our customers’ F‑16 aircraft, with
existing contracts continuing for several years. We continue to seek additional international opportunities to deliver additional aircraft.
Aeronautics continues to provide modernization and sustainment activities for the U.S. Air Force’s F-22 aircraft fleet. The modernization program
comprises upgrading existing systems requirements, developing new systems requirements, adding capabilities and enhancing the performance of the weapon
systems. The sustainment program consists of sustaining the weapon systems of the F-22 fleet, providing training systems, customer support, integrated
support planning, supply chain management, aircraft modifications and heavy maintenance, systems engineering and support products.
In addition to the aircraft programs discussed above, Aeronautics is involved in advanced development programs incorporating innovative design and
rapid prototype applications. Our Advanced Development Programs (ADP) organization, also known as Skunk Works®, is focused on future systems,
including unmanned and manned aerial systems and next generation capabilities for advanced strike, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, situational
awareness and air mobility. We continue to explore technology advancement and insertion into our existing aircraft. We also are involved in numerous
network-enabled activities that allow separate systems to work together to increase effectiveness and we continue to invest in new technologies to maintain
and enhance competitiveness in military aircraft design, development and production.
Missiles and Fire Control
In 2018, our MFC business segment generated net sales of $8.5 billion, which represented 16% of our total consolidated net sales. MFC’s customers
include the military services, principally the U.S. Army, and various government agencies of the U.S. and other countries, as well as commercial and other
customers. In 2018, U.S. Government customers accounted for 72%, international customers accounted for 26% and U.S. commercial and other customers
accounted for 2% of MFC’s net sales.
MFC provides air and missile defense systems; tactical missiles and air-to-ground precision strike weapon systems; logistics; fire control systems;
mission operations support, readiness, engineering support and integration services; manned and unmanned ground vehicles; and energy management
solutions. MFC also has contracts with the U.S. Government for various classified programs. MFC’s major programs include:

Competition
Our broad portfolio of products and services competes both domestically and internationally against products and services of other large aerospace and
defense companies, as well as numerous smaller competitors. Changes within the industry we operate in, such as vertical integration by our peers, could
negatively impact us. We often form teams with our competitors in efforts to provide our customers with the best mix of capabilities to address specific
requirements. In some areas of our business, customer
5
Table of Contents
requirements are changing to encourage expanded competition. Principal factors of competition include the value of our products and services to the
customer; technical and management capability; the ability to develop and implement complex, integrated system architectures; total cost of ownership; our
demonstrated ability to execute and perform against contract requirements; and our ability to provide timely solutions. Technological advances in such areas
as additive manufacturing, cloud computing, advanced materials, autonomy, robotics, and big data and new business models such as commercial access to
space are enabling new factors of competition for both traditional and non-traditional competitors.
The competition for international sales is generally subject to U.S. Government stipulations (e.g., export restrictions, market access, technology transfer,
industrial cooperation and contracting practices). We may compete against U.S. and non-U.S. companies (or teams) for contract awards by international
governments. International competitions also may be subject to different laws or contracting practices of international governments that may affect how we
structure our bid for the procurement. In many international procurements, the purchasing government’s relationship with the U.S. and its industrial
cooperation programs are also important factors in determining the outcome of a competition. It is common for international customers to require contractors
to comply with their industrial cooperation regulations, sometimes referred to as offset requirements, and we have entered into foreign offset agreements as
part of securing some international business. For more information concerning offset agreements, see “Contractual Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Intellectual Property
We routinely apply for and own a substantial number of U.S. and foreign patents related to the products and services we provide. In addition to owning a
large portfolio of patents, we own other intellectual property, including trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and know-how. Unpatented research,
development and engineering skills also make an important contribution to our business. We also license intellectual property to and from third parties. The
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) provide that the U.S. Government has licenses in
our intellectual property and that of our subcontractors and suppliers, including patents, that are developed in performance of government contracts or with
government funding, and it may use or authorize others, including competitors, to use such intellectual property, commonly referred to as government use
rights. See the discussion of matters related to our intellectual property within Item 1A - Risk Factors. Foreign governments may also have certain rights in
patents and other intellectual property developed in performance of foreign government contracts. Although our intellectual property rights in the aggregate
are important to the operation of our business, we do not believe that any existing patent, license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that
its loss or termination would have a material adverse effect on our business taken as a whole.
Raw Materials and Seasonality
Some of our products require relatively scarce raw materials. Historically, we have been successful in obtaining the raw materials and other supplies
needed in our manufacturing processes. We seek to manage raw materials supply risk through long-term contracts and by maintaining an acceptable level of
the key materials in inventories.
Aluminum and titanium are important raw materials used in certain of our Aeronautics and Space programs. Long-term agreements have helped enable a
continued supply of aluminum and titanium. Carbon fiber is an important ingredient in composite materials used in our Aeronautics programs, such as the F-
35 aircraft. We have been advised by some suppliers that pricing and the timing of availability of materials in some commodities markets can fluctuate
widely. These fluctuations may negatively affect the price and availability of certain materials. While we do not anticipate material problems regarding the
supply of our raw materials and believe that we have taken appropriate measures to mitigate these variations, if key materials become unavailable or if pricing
fluctuates widely in the future, it could result in delay of one or more of our programs, increased costs or reduced operating profits.
No material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal. Various factors can affect the distribution of our sales between accounting periods,
including the timing of government awards, the availability of government funding, product deliveries and customer acceptance.
Government Contracts and Regulations
Our business is heavily regulated. We contract with numerous U.S. Government agencies and entities, principally all branches of the U.S. military and
NASA. We also contract with similar government authorities in other countries and they regulate our international efforts. Additionally, our commercial
aircraft products are required to comply with U.S. and international regulations governing production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation
approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety.
6
Table of Contents
We must comply with, and are affected by, laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. Government and other
governments’ contracts, including foreign governments. These laws and regulations, among other things:
•require certification and disclosure of all cost or pricing data in connection with certain types of contract negotiations;
•impose specific and unique cost accounting practices that may differ from U.S. GAAP;
•impose acquisition regulations, which may change or be replaced over time, that define which costs can be charged to the U.S. Government, how and
when costs can be charged, and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain U.S. Government and foreign contracts;
•require specific security controls to protect U.S. Government controlled unclassified information and restrict the use and dissemination of information
classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products, services and technical data; and
•require the review and approval of contractor business systems, defined in the regulations as: (i) Accounting System; (ii) Estimating System; (iii) Earned
Value Management System, for managing cost and schedule performance on certain complex programs; (iv) Purchasing System; (v) Material
Management and Accounting System, for planning, controlling and accounting for the acquisition, use, issuing and disposition of material; and (vi)
Property Management System.
The U.S. Government and other governments may terminate any of our government contracts and subcontracts either at its convenience or for default
based on our performance. If a contract is terminated for convenience, we generally are protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on
the contract and profit on those costs. If a contract is terminated for default, we generally are entitled to payments for our work that has been accepted by the
U.S. Government or other governments; however, the U.S. Government and other governments could make claims to reduce the contract value or recover its
procurement costs and could assess other special penalties. For more information regarding the U.S. Government’s and other governments’ right to terminate
our contracts, see Item 1A - Risk Factors. For more information regarding government contracting laws and regulations, see Item 1A - Risk Factors as well as
“Critical Accounting Policies - Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations. For more information on the risks of doing work internationally, see Item 1A - Risk Factors. Additionally, the U.S. Government may also enter
into unilateral contract actions. This can affect our ability to negotiate mutually agreeable contract terms.
A portion of our business is classified by the U.S. Government and cannot be specifically described. The operating results of these classified contracts are
included in our consolidated financial statements. The business risks and capital requirements associated with classified contracts historically have not
differed materially from those of our other U.S. Government contracts. Our internal controls addressing the financial reporting of classified contracts are
consistent with our internal controls for our non-classified contracts.
Our operations are subject to and affected by various federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations regarding the
discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise regulating the protection of the environment. While the extent of our financial exposure cannot in all
cases be reasonably estimated, the costs of environmental compliance have not had, and we do not expect that these costs will have, a material adverse effect
on our earnings, financial position and cash flow, primarily because substantially all of our environmental costs are allowable in establishing the price of our
products and services under our contracts with the U.S. Government. For information regarding these matters, including current estimates of the amounts that
we believe are required for remediation or cleanup to the extent that they are probable and estimable, see “Critical Accounting Policies - Environmental
Matters” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and “Note 14 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and
Contingencies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. See also the discussion of environmental matters within Item 1A - Risk Factors.
Backlog
At December 31, 2018, our backlog was $130.5 billion compared with $105.5 billion at December 31, 2017. Backlog is converted into sales in future
periods as work is performed or deliveries are made. We expect to recognize approximately 38% of our backlog over the next 12 months and approximately
66% over the next 24 months as revenue, with the remainder recognized thereafter.
Our backlog includes both funded (firm orders for our products and services for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the
customer) and unfunded (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated) amounts. We do not include unexercised options or potential orders under
indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity agreements in our backlog. If any of our contracts with firm orders were to be terminated, our backlog would be
reduced by the expected value of the unfilled orders of such contracts. Funded backlog was $86.4 billion at December 31, 2018, as compared to $74.1 billion
at December 31, 2017. For backlog related to each of our business segments, see “Business Segment Results of Operations” in Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Research and Development
We conduct research and development (R&D) activities using our own funds (referred to as company-funded R&D or independent research and
development (IR&D)) and under contractual arrangements with our customers (referred to as customer-funded R&D) to enhance existing products and
services and to develop future technologies. R&D costs include basic research, applied research, concept formulation studies, design, development, and
related test activities. Company-funded R&D costs charged to cost of sales totaled $1.3 billion in 2018, $1.2 billion in 2017 and $988 million in 2016. See
“Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” (under the caption “Research and development and similar costs”) included in our Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Employees
At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 105,000 employees, about 93% of whom were located in the U.S. Approximately 21% of our employees
are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various unions. A number of our existing collective bargaining agreements expire in any given year.
Historically, we have been successful in negotiating renewals to expiring agreements without any material disruption of operating activities. Management
considers employee relations to be good.

ITEM  1A.    Risk Factors
An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties. We seek to identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business,
but risk and uncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted. The outcome of one or more of these risks could have a material effect on our
operating results, financial position, or cash flows. You should carefully consider the following factors, in addition to the other information contained in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase our common stock or debt securities.
We depend heavily on contracts with the U.S. Government for a substantial portion of our business.
We derived 70% of our total net sales from the U.S. Government in 2018, including 60% from the Department of Defense (DoD). We expect to continue
to derive most of our sales from work performed under U.S. Government contracts. Those contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of
Congressional appropriations. Congress usually appropriates funds on a fiscal year (FY) basis even though contract performance may extend over many
years. Consequently, contracts are often partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. If we
incur costs in excess of funds obligated on a contract, we may be at risk for reimbursement of those costs unless and until additional funds are obligated to the
contract.
As discussed within “Industry Considerations-U.S. Government Funding” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations, on January 25, 2019 Congress passed and the President signed legislation that fully funds the U.S. Government through February 15, 2019,
ending a partial government shutdown which did not include our largest customer, the DoD, but did include other customers such as NASA. The underlying
budget impasse remains, and it is possible that there will be a further partial shutdown or shutdowns. As noted above, while the corporation’s largest
customer, the DoD, is funded through the end of the government FY 2019 and thus would not be affected by another shutdown, limiting the direct impact of
any future shutdown or shutdowns on Lockheed Martin, other customers, such as NASA, are not. In the event of future shutdowns, we may continue to work
on unfunded contracts to seek to maintain their projected cost and schedule profiles which, although we would anticipate being paid when the shutdown ends,
would put us at risk of nonpayment. Further there may be indirect impacts such as the potential diversion of funds from the DoD and the fact that the
Departments of State and Commerce cease to timely process export licenses. While in the recent shutdown there were procedures in place to process on an
emergency basis licenses involving direct support to the military, humanitarian aid, or other similar emergencies, there was a growing backlog of non-
emergency applications. We anticipate that this will occur again in any future shutdown. While the impact on Lockheed Martin of the recent shutdown was
not material, were a future shutdown to occur and continue for an extended period, this might not be the case. In addition, the President has not yet submitted
a budget proposal for FY 2020 to Congress. If an annual appropriations bill is not enacted for FY 2020 or beyond, the U.S. Government may operate under a
continuing resolution, restricting new contract or program starts and additional government shutdowns, which might involve all government agencies, could
arise. In addition, continued budget uncertainty and the risk of future sequestration cuts remain unless the Budget Control Act is repealed or significantly
modified.
The F-35 is our largest program and represented 27% of our total net sales in 2018 and is expected to represent a higher percentage of our sales in future
years. A decision to cut spending or reduce planned orders would have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Given the size and
complexity of the F-35 program, we anticipate that there will be continual reviews related to aircraft performance, program schedule, cost, and requirements
as part of the DoD, Congressional, and international partners’ oversight and budgeting processes. Current program challenges include, but are not limited to,
supplier and partner performance (including the potential that a decision by the U.S. Government not to allow deliveries of aircraft to Turkey could disrupt the
substantial supplier activity in our Turkish supply chain), software development, receiving funding for production contracts on a timely basis, executing
future flight tests and findings resulting from testing and operating the aircraft, level of cost associated with life-cycle operations and sustainment and
warranties and continuing to reduce the unit cost of producing aircraft and achieve cost targets.
Based upon our diverse range of defense, homeland security and information technology products and services, generally we believe that this makes it
less likely that cuts in any specific contract or program will have a long-term effect on our business. However, termination of multiple or large programs or
contracts could adversely affect our business and future financial performance. Potential changes in funding priorities may afford new or additional
opportunities for our businesses in terms of existing, follow-on or replacement programs. While we would expect to compete and be well positioned as the
incumbent on existing programs, we may not be successful or the replacement programs may be funded at lower levels.

Table of Contents
We are subject to a number of procurement laws and regulations. Our business and reputation could be adversely affected if we fail to comply with
these laws.
We must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts.
Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and impose certain risks and costs on our business. A violation of
specific laws and regulations, by us, our employees, others working on our behalf, a supplier or a venture partner, could harm our reputation and result in the
imposition of fines and penalties, the termination of our contracts, suspension or debarment from bidding on or being awarded contracts, loss of our ability to
export products or services and civil or criminal investigations or proceedings.
In some instances, these laws and regulations impose terms or rights that are different from those typically found in commercial transactions. For
example, the U.S. Government may terminate any of our government contracts and subcontracts either at its convenience or for default based on our
performance. Upon termination for convenience of a fixed-price type contract, typically we are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered items,
reimbursement for allowable costs for work-in-process and an allowance for profit on the contract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would
have resulted in a loss.
Upon termination for convenience of a cost-reimbursable contract, we normally are entitled to reimbursement of allowable costs plus a portion of the fee
where allowable costs include our cost to terminate agreements with our suppliers and subcontractors. The amount of the fee recovered, if any, is related to
the portion of the work accomplished prior to termination and is determined by negotiation. We attempt to ensure that adequate funds are available by
notifying the customer when its estimated costs, including those associated with a possible termination for convenience, approach levels specified as being
allotted to its programs. As funds are typically appropriated on a fiscal year basis and as the costs of a termination for convenience may exceed the costs of
continuing a program in a given fiscal year, occasionally programs do not have sufficient funds appropriated to cover the termination costs if the government
were to terminate them for convenience. Under such circumstances, the U.S. Government could assert that it is not required to appropriate additional funding.
A termination arising out of our default may expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and
orders. In addition, on those contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor, the U.S. Government could terminate a prime
contract under which we are a subcontractor, notwithstanding the quality of our services as a subcontractor. In the case of termination for default, the U.S.
Government could make claims to reduce the contract value or recover its procurement costs and could assess other special penalties. However, under such
circumstances we have rights and remedial actions under laws and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).
In addition, certain of our U.S. Government contracts span one or more base years and multiple option years. The U.S. Government generally has the
right not to exercise option periods and may not exercise an option period for various reasons. However, the U.S. Government may exercise option periods,
even for contracts for which it is expected that our costs may exceed the contract price or ceiling.
U.S. Government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Defense Contract Management Agency and various agency Inspectors
General, routinely audit and investigate government contractors. These agencies review a contractor’s performance under its contracts, its cost structure, its
business systems and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. The U.S. Government has the ability to decrease or withhold certain
payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate. Additionally, any costs found to be misclassified may be subject to repayment. We
have unaudited and/or unsettled incurred cost claims related to past years, which places risk on our ability to issue final billings on contracts for which
authorized and appropriated funds may be expiring.
If an audit or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including
reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or terminations, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, penalties, fines and suspension, or
prohibition from doing business with the U.S. Government. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made
against us. Similar government oversight exists in most other countries where we conduct business.
Our profitability and cash flow may vary based on the mix of our contracts and programs, our performance, our ability to control costs and evolving
U.S. Government procurement policies.
Our profitability and cash flow may vary materially depending on the types of government contracts undertaken, the nature of products produced or
services performed under those contracts, the costs incurred in performing the work, the achievement of other performance objectives and the stage of
performance at which the right to receive fees is determined, particularly under award and incentive-fee contracts. Our backlog includes a variety of contract
types and represents the sales we expect to recognize for our products and services in the future. Contract types primarily include fixed-price and cost-
reimbursable contracts.
10
Table of Contents
Under fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates
upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixed-price contracts have a performance-based
component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance.
Cost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on
the amount that has been funded. Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-
plus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer’s assessment of our
performance against a predetermined set of criteria, such as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts
provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e.,
incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e., incentive based on performance). The fixed-
fee in a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed-fee does not vary with actual costs.
Contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges are typically cost-reimbursable. In these cases, the associated
financial risks primarily relate to a reduction in fees and the program could be canceled if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Other contracts
in backlog are for the transition from development to production (e.g., Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contracts), which includes the challenge of starting
and stabilizing a manufacturing production and test line while the final design is being validated. These generally are cost-reimbursable or fixed-price
incentive-fee contracts. Generally, if our costs exceed the contract target cost or are not allowable under the applicable regulations, we may not be able to
obtain reimbursement for all costs and may have our fees reduced or eliminated. There are also contracts for production, as well as operations and
maintenance of the delivered products, that have the challenge of achieving a stable production and delivery rate, while maintaining operability of the product
after delivery. These contracts are mainly fixed-price.
The failure to perform to customer expectations and contract requirements may result in reduced fees or losses and affect our financial performance in
that period. Under each type of contract, if we are unable to control costs, our operating results could be adversely affected, particularly if we are unable to
justify an increase in contract value to our customers. Cost overruns or the failure to perform on existing programs also may adversely affect our ability to
retain existing programs and win future contract awards.
The U.S. Government could implement policies that could negatively impact our profitability. Changes in procurement policy favoring more incentive-
based fee arrangements, different award fee criteria or government contract negotiation offers based upon the customer’s view of what our costs should be (as
compared to our actual costs) may affect the predictability of our profit rates. Our customers also may pursue non-traditional contract provisions in
negotiation of contracts. In some circumstances, the U.S. Government is proposing positions that are inconsistent with the FAR and existing practice.
The DoD is currently seeking the views of experts and interested parties within the U.S. Government and the private sector regarding revising policies
and procedures for contract financing, performance incentives, and associated regulations for DoD contracts and we have no assurance regarding what
changes will be proposed, if any, and their impact on our working capital and cash flow. Earlier changes proposed by the DoD and later withdrawn would
have had a negative impact on the timing of our cash flows.
Additionally, the U.S. Government is taking increasingly aggressive positions under the FAR and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement
(DFARS) both as to what intellectual property they believe government use rights apply and to acquire broad license rights. If the U.S. Government is
successful in these efforts, this could affect our ability to compete and to obtain access to and use certain supplier intellectual property.
Increased competition and bid protests in a budget-constrained environment may make it more difficult to maintain our financial performance and
customer relationships.
A substantial portion of our business is awarded through competitive bidding. The U.S. Government increasingly has relied upon competitive contract
award types, including indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity and other multi-award contracts, which have the potential to create pricing pressure and
increase our cost by requiring that we submit multiple bids and proposals. Multi-award contracts require that we make sustained efforts to obtain task orders
under the contract. Additionally, recent competitive bids have not contained cost realism evaluation criteria leading to our competitors taking aggressive
pricing positions. The competitive bidding process entails substantial costs and managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be
awarded to us or may be split among competitors. Additionally, the U.S. Government may fail to award us large competitive contracts in an effort to maintain
a broader industrial base. Following award, we may encounter significant expenses, delays, contract modifications or bid protests from unsuccessful bidders
on new program awards. Unsuccessful bidders may protest in
11
Table of Contents
the hope of being awarded a subcontract for a portion of the work in return for withdrawing the protest. Bid protests could result in significant expenses to us,
contract modifications or even loss of the contract award. Even where a bid protest does not result in the loss of a contract award, the resolution can extend
the time until the contract activity can begin and, as a result, delay our recognizing sales. We also may not be successful in our efforts to protest or challenge
any bids for contracts that were not awarded to us and we could incur significant time and expense in such efforts.
We are experiencing increased competition while, at the same time, many of our customers are facing budget pressures, trying to do more with less by
cutting costs, identifying more affordable solutions, performing certain work internally rather than hiring a contractor, and reducing product development
cycles. Recent acquisitions in our industry, particularly vertical integration by tier-1 prime contractors, could also result in increased competition. Therefore, it
is critical we maintain strong customer relationships and seek to understand the priorities of their requirements in this price competitive environment.
In international sales, we face substantial competition from both U.S. manufacturers and international manufacturers whose governments sometime
provide research and development assistance, marketing subsidies and other assistance for their products. Additionally, our competitors are also focusing on
increasing their international sales. To remain competitive, we consistently must maintain strong customer relationships and provide superior performance,
advanced technology solutions and service at an affordable cost and with the agility that our customers require to satisfy their mission objectives.
We are the prime contractor on most of our contracts and if our subcontractors, suppliers or teaming agreement or venture partners fail to perform
their obligations, our performance and our ability to win future business could be harmed.
For most of our contracts we rely on other companies to provide materials, major components and products, and to perform a portion of the services that
we provide to our customers. Such arrangements may involve subcontracts, teaming arrangements, ventures or supply agreements with other companies upon
which we rely (contracting parties). There is a risk that the contracting party does not perform and we may have disputes with our contracting parties,
including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed, the workshare provided to that party, customer concerns about the other party’s
performance, our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders, or our hiring the personnel of a subcontractor, teammate or venture partner or
vice versa. In addition, changes in the economic environment, including defense budgets, trade sanctions and constraints on available financing, may
adversely affect the financial stability of our contracting parties and their ability to meet their performance requirements or to provide needed supplies on a
timely basis as might their inability to perform profitably in the current highly competitive and budget constrained environment. We could also be adversely
affected by reputational issues experienced by our teammates that are outside of our control, which could adversely affect our ability to compete for contract
awards. A failure, for whatever reason, by one or more of our contracting parties to provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services on
a timely basis, according to specifications, or at all, may affect our ability to perform our obligations and require that we transition the work to other
companies. Contracting party performance deficiencies may result in additional costs or delays in product deliveries and affect our operating results and could
result in a customer terminating our contract for default or convenience. A default termination could expose us to liability and affect our ability to compete for
future contracts and orders. Additionally, our efforts to increase the efficiency of our operations and improve the affordability of our products and services
could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain suppliers.
International sales may pose different risks.
In 2018, 28% of our total net sales were from international customers. We have a strategy to continue to grow international sales, inclusive of sales of F-
35 aircraft to our international partners and other countries. International sales are subject to numerous political and economic factors, regulatory
requirements, significant competition, taxation, and other risks associated with doing business in foreign countries. Our exposure to such risks may further
increase if our international sales grow as we anticipate.
Our international business is conducted through foreign military sales (FMS) to international customers or by direct commercial sales (DCS) to such
customers. In 2018, approximately 63% of our sales to international customers were FMS and about 37% were DCS. These transaction types differ as FMS
transactions entail agreements between the U.S. Government and our international customers through which the U.S. Government purchases products or
services from us on behalf of the foreign customer with our contract with the U.S. Government being subject to the FAR and the DFARS. In contrast, DCS
transactions represent sales by us directly to international customers and are not subject to the FAR or the DFARS. All sales to international customers are
subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, without limitation, import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, investments, taxation,
repatriation of earnings, exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations, and the anti-boycott provisions
of the U.S. Export Administration Act. While we have stringent policies in place to comply with such laws and regulations, failure by us, our employees or
others working on our behalf to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities, including suspension,
debarment from bidding for or performing government contracts, or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We
frequently team with international subcontractors and suppliers who are also exposed to similar risks.
12
Table of Contents
While international sales, whether contracted as FMS or DCS, present risks that are different and potentially greater than those encountered in our U.S.
business, DCS with international customers may impose even greater risks. DCS transactions involve direct commercial relationships with parties with whom
we have less familiarity and where there may be significant cultural differences. Additionally, international procurement rules and regulations, contract laws
and regulations, and contractual terms differ from those in the U.S. and are less familiar to us and may treat as criminal matters issues, which in the U.S.
would be civil. International regulations may be interpreted by foreign courts less bound by precedent and with more discretion; these interpretations
frequently have terms less favorable to us than the FAR. Export and import and currency risk also may be increased for DCS with international customers.
While these risks are potentially greater than those encountered in our U.S. business, we seek to price our products and services commensurate with the risk
profile on DCS with international customers.
Our international business is highly sensitive to changes in regulations (including tariffs, sanctions, embargoes, export and import controls and other trade
restrictions), political environments or security risks that may affect our ability to conduct business outside of the U.S., including those regarding investment,
procurement, taxation and repatriation of earnings. We continue to evaluate the potential effect of the United Kingdom’s (UK) planned departure from the
European Union (EU) (commonly referred to as Brexit) on our business operations and financial results, including the impacts if the UK fails to reach an
agreement with the EU on Brexit by the March 29, 2019 deadline. We anticipate that the most probable near-term effects are likely to reflect the pressure
Brexit is placing on the UK government, which may influence the government’s ability to make decisions on large complex programs of the type we perform.
Brexit may also have adverse tax effects on movement of products or sustainment activities between the UK and EU. Additionally, Brexit may impact the
value of the pound sterling. If the pound sterling were to remain depressed against the U.S. dollar, this could negatively impact the ability of the UK
government to afford our products. Currently, we do not anticipate that Brexit will have a material impact on our operations or our financial results. While we
have operations in the UK, these operations have little activity between the UK and the EU (e.g., sales, supply chain, or reliance on personnel). Additionally,
our practice is to substantially hedge all of our currency exposure. Therefore, we do not have material currency exposure to the pound sterling or the euro.
Additionally, Congress may act to prevent or impose conditions upon the sale or delivery of our products, such as F-35 aircraft to Turkey, and discussions
in Congress may result in sanctions on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Our international business also may be impacted by changes in foreign national
priorities, foreign government budgets, global economic conditions, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Sales of military products are also
affected by defense budgets and U.S. foreign policy, including trade restrictions, and there could be significant delays or other issues in reaching definitive
agreements for announced programs and international customer priorities could change. Additionally, the timing of orders from our international customers
can be less predictable than for our U.S. customers and may lead to fluctuations in the amount reported each year for our international sales.
In conjunction with defense procurements, some international customers require contractors to comply with industrial cooperation regulations, including
entering into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements. Recently, certain customers have increased their demands for
greater offset commitment levels and higher-value content, including the transfer of technologies and local production and economic development.
Expectations as to offset commitments may exceed existing local technical capability. Offset agreements may require in-country purchases, technology
transfers, local manufacturing support, investments in foreign joint ventures and financial support projects as an incentive or as a condition to a contract
award. In some countries, these offset agreements may require the establishment of a venture with a local company, which must control the venture. The costs
to satisfy our offset obligations are included in the estimates of our total costs to complete the contract and may impact our profitability and cash flows. The
ability to recover investments that we make is generally dependent upon the successful operation of ventures that we do not control and may involve products
and services that are dissimilar to our business activities. In these and other situations, we could be liable for violations of law for actions taken by these
entities such as laws related to anti-corruption, import and export, taxation, and anti-boycott restrictions. Offset agreements generally extend over several
years and may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements which are typically subjective and can be
outside our control.
Our efforts to minimize the likelihood and impact of adverse cybersecurity incidents and to protect data and intellectual property may not be
successful and our business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats or other disruptions.
We routinely experience various cybersecurity threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure, unauthorized attempts to gain access to our
company sensitive information, and denial-of-service attacks as do our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and venture partners. We have a Computer
Incident Response Team (CIRT) which has among its responsibilities defending against such attacks. Additionally, we conduct regular periodic training of our
employees as to the protection of sensitive
13
Table of Contents
information which includes training intended to prevent the success of “phishing” attacks. We experience similar security threats at customer sites that we
operate and manage.
The threats we face vary from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries, including nation states,
which target us and other defense contractors because we protect national security information. If we are unable to protect sensitive information, including
complying with evolving data privacy regulations, our customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of our threat mitigation and
detection processes and procedures, and depending on the severity of the incident, our customers’ data, our employees’ data, our intellectual property, and
other third party data (such as teammates, venture partners, subcontractors, suppliers and vendors) could be compromised. As a consequence of their
persistence, sophistication and volume, we may not be successful in defending against all such attacks. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats
and the national security aspects of much of the data we protect, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.
In addition to cyber threats, we experience threats to the security of our facilities and employees and threats from terrorist acts as do our customers,
suppliers, subcontractors, venture partners and entities we acquire with whom we typically work cooperatively to seek to minimize the impact of cyber
threats, other security threats or business disruptions. However, we must rely on the safeguards put in place by these entities, as well as other entities, which
we do not control, who have access to our information, and may affect the security of our information. These entities have varying levels of cybersecurity
expertise and safeguards, and their relationships with government contractors, such as Lockheed Martin, may increase the likelihood that they are targeted by
the same cyber threats we face. We have approximately 16,000 direct suppliers and even more indirect suppliers with a wide variety of systems and
cybersecurity capabilities and we may not be successful in preventing adversaries from exploiting possible weak links in our supply chain. We also must rely
on this supply chain for detecting and reporting cyber incidents, which could affect our ability to report or respond to cybersecurity incidents in a timely
manner.
The costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. Additionally, some cyber
technologies we develop under contract for our customers, particularly those related to homeland security, may raise potential liabilities related to intellectual
property and civil liberties, including privacy concerns, which may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means or involve reputational risk. Our
enterprise risk management program includes threat detection and cybersecurity mitigation plans, and our disclosure controls and procedures address
cybersecurity and include elements intended to ensure that there is an analysis of potential disclosure obligations arising from security breaches. We also
maintain compliance programs to address the potential applicability of restrictions on trading while in possession of material, nonpublic information generally
and in connection with a cybersecurity breach.
If we fail to manage acquisitions, divestitures, equity investments and other transactions successfully or if acquired entities or equity investments fail
to perform as expected, our financial results, business and future prospects could be harmed.
In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate companies, and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions,
divestitures, ventures and other investments. We seek to identify acquisition or investment opportunities that will expand or complement our existing products
and services or customer base, at attractive valuations. We often compete with other companies for the same opportunities. To be successful, we must conduct
due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies; negotiate transaction terms; complete and close complex transactions; integrate
acquired companies and employees; and realize anticipated operating synergies efficiently and effectively. Acquisition, divestiture, venture and investment
transactions often require substantial management resources and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business. Unidentified or
identified but un-indemnified pre-closing liabilities could affect our future financial results, particularly successor liability under procurement laws and
regulations such as the False Claims Act or Truth in Negotiations Act, anti-corruption, tax, import-export and technology transfer laws which provide for civil
and criminal penalties and the potential for debarment. We also may incur unanticipated costs or expenses, including post-closing asset impairment charges,
expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, employee retention, transaction-related or other litigation, and other liabilities. Any of the foregoing
could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
Ventures and other noncontrolling investments operate under shared control with other parties. Depending on our rights and percentage of ownership, we
may consolidate the financial results of such entities or account for our interests under the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting for
nonconsolidated ventures and investments, we recognize our share of the operating profit or loss of these ventures in our results of operations. Our operating
results may be affected by the performance of businesses over which we do not exercise control, which includes the inability to prevent strategic decisions
that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result, we may not be successful in achieving the growth or other
intended benefits of strategic investments. Our joint ventures face many of the same risks and uncertainties as we do. The most significant impact of our
equity investments is in our Space business segment where approximately 20% of its 2018 operating profit was derived from its share of earnings from equity
method investees, particularly that in United Launch Alliance (ULA).
14
Table of Contents
During 2018, we recognized a non-cash asset impairment charge of $110 million related to our equity method investee, Advanced Military Maintenance,
Repair and Overhaul Center LLC (AMMROC). We are continuing to monitor this investment, in light of ongoing performance, business base and economic
issues and we may have to record our portion of additional charges, or an impairment of our investment, or both, should the carrying value of our investment
exceed its fair value. See “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Additionally, through our Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund, we make investments in companies (both within the U.S. and in other countries) that we
believe are developing disruptive technologies applicable to our core businesses and new initiatives important to Lockheed Martin. These investments may be
in the forms of common or preferred stock, convertible debt securities or investments in funds. Typically, we hold a non-controlling interest and, therefore, are
unable to influence strategic decisions by these companies and may have limited visibility into their activities, which may result in our not realizing the
intended benefits of the investments. We have also begun investing in funds we believe invest in such companies. We have less influence and visibility as a
non-controlling investor in a fund.
There can be no assurance that we will continue to increase our dividend or to repurchase shares of our common stock at current levels.
The payment of cash dividends and share repurchases is subject to limitations under applicable laws and the discretion of our Board of Directors and is
determined after considering current conditions, including earnings, other operating results and capital requirements. Our payment of dividends and share
repurchases could vary from historical practices or our stated expectations. Decreases in asset values or increases in liabilities, including liabilities associated
with benefit plans and assets and liabilities associated with taxes, can reduce net earnings and stockholders’ equity. A deficit in stockholders’ equity could
limit our ability to pay dividends and make share repurchases under Maryland state law in the future. In addition, the timing and amount of share repurchases
under board approved share repurchase plans is within the discretion of management and will depend on many factors, including results of operations, capital
requirements and applicable law.
Our business involves significant risks and uncertainties that may not be covered by indemnity or insurance.
A significant portion of our business relates to designing, developing and manufacturing advanced defense and technology products and systems. New
technologies may be untested or unproven. Failure of some of these products and services could result in extensive loss of life or property damage.
Accordingly, we may incur liabilities that are unique to our products and services. In some but not all circumstances, we may be entitled to certain legal
protections or indemnifications from our customers, either through U.S. Government indemnifications under Public Law 85-804 or the Price-Anderson Act,
qualification of our products and services by the Department of Homeland Security under the SAFETY Act provisions of the Homeland Security Act of 2002,
contractual provisions or otherwise. We endeavor to obtain insurance coverage from established insurance carriers to cover these risks and liabilities. The
amount of insurance coverage that we maintain may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities. Existing coverage may be canceled while we remain
exposed to the risk and it is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all operational risks, natural hazards and liabilities. For example, we are limited
in the amount of insurance we can obtain to cover certain natural hazards such as earthquakes, fires or extreme weather conditions. We have significant
operations in geographic areas prone to these risks, such as in California, Florida and Texas. Even if insurance coverage is available, we may not be able to
obtain it at a price or on terms acceptable to us. Additionally, disputes with insurance carriers over coverage terms or the insolvency of one or more of our
insurance carriers may significantly affect the amount or timing of our cash flows.
Substantial costs resulting from an accident; failure of or defect in our products or services; natural catastrophe or other incident; or liability arising from
our products and services in excess of any legal protection, indemnity, and our insurance coverage (or for which indemnity or insurance is not available or not
obtained) could adversely impact our financial condition, cash flows, or operating results. Any accident, failure of, or defect in our products or services, even
if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively affect our reputation among our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete
effectively. It also could affect the cost and availability of adequate insurance in the future.
Pension funding and costs are dependent on several economic assumptions which if changed may cause our future earnings and cash flow to
fluctuate significantly as well as affect the affordability of our products and services.
Many of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical and life insurance plans, and other postemployment plans
(collectively, postretirement benefit plans). The impact of these plans on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record for our
postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because the calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions
including interest rates and rates of return on plan assets, other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity (also known as mortality) and employee
turnover, as well as the timing of cash funding. Changes in these factors, including actual returns on plan assets, may also affect our plan funding, cash flow
and
15
Table of Contents
stockholders’ equity. In addition, the funding of our plans and recovery of costs on our contracts, as described below, may also be subject to changes caused
by legislative or regulatory actions.
With regard to cash flow, we make substantial cash contributions to our plans as required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(ERISA), as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). We generally are able to recover these contributions related to our plans as allowable
costs on our U.S. Government contracts, including FMS. During 2017, the revision to U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) rules to harmonize
the measurement and period assignment of the pension cost allocable to government contracts with the PPA was fully transitioned. However, there is still a
lag between the time when we contribute cash to our plans under pension funding rules and when we recover pension costs under CAS.
For more information on how these factors could impact earnings, financial position, cash flow and stockholders’ equity, see “Critical Accounting
Policies - Postretirement Benefit Plans” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and “Note 11 –
Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Environmental costs could affect our future earnings as well as the affordability of our products and services.
Our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations. We are involved
in environmental remediation at some of our facilities, some of our former facilities, and at third-party-owned sites where we have been designated a
potentially responsible party. In addition, we could be affected by future regulations imposed or claims asserted in response to concerns over climate change,
other aspects of the environment or natural resources. We have an ongoing, comprehensive sustainability program to reduce the effects of our operations on
the environment.
We manage and have managed various U.S. Government-owned facilities on behalf of the U.S. Government. At such facilities, environmental
compliance and remediation costs historically have been the responsibility of the U.S. Government. We have relied, and continue to rely with respect to past
practices, upon U.S. Government funding to pay such costs, notwithstanding efforts by some U.S. Government representatives to limit this responsibility.
Although the U.S. Government remains responsible for capital and operating costs associated with environmental compliance, responsibility for fines and
penalties associated with environmental noncompliance typically is borne by either the U.S. Government or the contractor, depending on the contract and the
relevant facts. Some environmental laws include criminal provisions. An environmental law conviction could affect our ability to be awarded future or
perform under existing U.S. Government contracts.
We have incurred and will continue to incur liabilities under various federal, state, local and foreign statutes for environmental protection and
remediation. The extent of our financial exposure cannot in all cases be reasonably estimated at this time. Among the variables management must assess in
evaluating costs associated with these cases and remediation sites generally are the status of site assessment, extent of the contamination, impacts on natural
resources, changing cost estimates, evolution of technologies used to remediate the site, continually evolving environmental standards and cost allowability
issues, including varying efforts by the U.S. Government to limit allowability of our costs in resolving liability at third party-owned sites. For information
regarding these matters, including current estimates of the amounts that we believe are required for environmental remediation to the extent probable and
estimable, see “Critical Accounting Policies - Environmental Matters” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations and “Note 14 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
We are involved in a number of legal proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty.
Our business may be adversely affected by the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. As required
by GAAP, we estimate loss contingencies and establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably
estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our
assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a liability or as a reserve against assets in our financial statements. For a description of our
current legal proceedings, see Item 3 - Legal Proceedings along with “Note 14 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies” included in our Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop new products and technologies, efficiently produce existing products and maintain a qualified
workforce.
Many of the products and services we provide are highly engineered and involve sophisticated technologies with related complex manufacturing and
system integration processes. Our customers’ requirements change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, our future performance depends, in part, on our ability
to adapt to changing customer needs rapidly, identify emerging technological trends, develop and manufacture innovative products and services and bring
those offerings to market quickly at cost-effective
16
Table of Contents
prices. Due to the complex nature of the products and services we offer, we may experience technical difficulties during the development of new products or
technologies. These technical difficulties could result in delays and higher costs, which may negatively impact our financial results, until such products or
technologies are fully developed. See “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
details about losses incurred on certain development programs. Additionally, there can be no assurance that our developmental projects will be successful or
meet the needs of our customer.
Additionally, our competitors may develop new technology, or offerings, or more efficient ways to produce existing products that could cause our
existing offerings to become obsolete. If we fail in our development projects or if our new products or technologies fail to achieve customer acceptance, our
ability to procure new contracts could be unsuccessful and this could negatively impact our financial results.
Due to the specialized nature of our business, our future performance is highly dependent upon our ability to maintain a workforce with the requisite
skills in multiple areas including: engineering, science, manufacturing, information technology, cybersecurity, business development and strategy and
management. Our operating performance is also dependent upon personnel who hold security clearances and receive substantial training in order to work on
certain programs or tasks. Additionally, as we expand our operations internationally, it is increasingly important to hire and retain personnel with relevant
experience in local laws, regulations, customs, traditions and business practices.
We face a number of challenges that may affect personnel retention such as our endeavors to increase the efficiency of our operations and improve the
affordability of our products and services such as workforce reductions and consolidating and relocating certain operations. Additionally, a substantial portion
of our workforce (including personnel in leadership positions) are retirement-eligible or nearing retirement. We previously amended certain of our defined
benefit pension plans for non-union employees to freeze future retirement benefits. The freeze, which will be completed January 1, 2020, may encourage
retirement-eligible personnel (generally age 55 or older) to choose to retire earlier than anticipated.
To the extent that we lose experienced personnel, it is critical that we develop other employees, hire new qualified personnel, and successfully manage
the transfer of critical knowledge. Competition for personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in hiring or retaining personnel with the requisite skills
or clearances. We increasingly compete with commercial technology companies outside of the aerospace and defense industry for qualified technical, cyber
and scientific positions as the number of qualified domestic engineers is decreasing and the number of cyber professionals is not keeping up with demand. To
the extent that these companies grow at a faster rate or face fewer cost and product pricing constraints, they may be able to offer more attractive compensation
and other benefits to candidates or our existing employees. To the extent that the demand for skilled personnel exceeds supply, we could experience higher
labor, recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees; we could experience difficulty in performing our contracts if we were unable
to do so. We also must manage leadership development and succession planning throughout our business. While we have processes in place for management
transition and the transfer of knowledge, the loss of key personnel, coupled with an inability to adequately train other personnel, hire new personnel or
transfer knowledge, could significantly impact our ability to perform under our contracts.
Approximately 21% of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various unions. Historically, where employees are covered
by collective bargaining agreements with various unions, we have been successful in negotiating renewals to expiring agreements without any material
disruption of operating activities. However, this does not assure that we will be successful in our efforts to negotiate renewals of our existing collective
bargaining agreements in the future. If we encounter difficulties with renegotiations or renewals of collective bargaining arrangements or are unsuccessful in
those efforts, we could incur additional costs and experience work stoppages. Union actions at suppliers can also affect us. Any delays or work stoppages
could adversely affect our ability to perform under our contracts, which could negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.
Our estimates and projections may prove to be inaccurate and certain of our assets may be at risk of future impairment.
The accounting for some of our most significant activities is based on judgments and estimates, which are complex and subject to many variables. For
example, accounting for sales using the percentage-of-completion method requires that we assess risks and make assumptions regarding schedule, cost,
technical and performance issues for thousands of contracts, many of which are long-term in nature. Additionally, we initially allocate the purchase price of
acquired businesses based on a preliminary assessment of the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For significant acquisitions we
may use a one-year measurement period to analyze and assess a number of factors used in establishing the asset and liability fair values as of the acquisition
date and could result in adjustments to asset and liability balances.
We have $10.8 billion of goodwill assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018 from previous acquisitions, which
represents approximately 24% of our total assets. These goodwill assets are subject to annual impairment
17
Table of Contents
testing and more frequent testing upon the occurrence of certain events or significant changes in circumstances that indicate goodwill may be impaired. If we
experience changes or factors arise that negatively affect the expected cash flows of a reporting unit, we may be required to write off all or a portion of the
reporting unit’s related goodwill assets. The carrying value and fair value of our Sikorsky reporting unit are closely aligned. Therefore, any business
deterioration, contract cancellations or terminations, or market pressures could cause our sales, earnings and cash flows to decline below current projections
and could cause goodwill and intangible assets to be impaired. Additionally, Sikorsky may not perform as expected, or demand for its products may be
adversely affected by global economic conditions, including oil and gas trends that are outside of our control.
Future changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws, including those with retroactive effect, and audits by tax authorities could result in unanticipated increases in
our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flows. The amount of net deferred tax assets will change periodically based on several factors, including the
measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligations, actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans, and future changes in tax laws.
Actual financial results could differ from our judgments and estimates. See “Critical Accounting Policies” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations and “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies and use of estimates.

ITEM 2.    Properties
At December 31, 2018, we owned or leased building space (including offices, manufacturing plants, warehouses, service centers, laboratories and other
facilities) at approximately 380 locations primarily in the U.S. Additionally, we manage or occupy approximately 15 government-owned facilities under lease
and other arrangements. At December 31, 2018, we had significant operations in the following locations:
•Aeronautics - Palmdale, California; Marietta, Georgia; Greenville, South Carolina; and Fort Worth, Texas.
•Missiles and Fire Control - Camden, Arkansas; Ocala and Orlando, Florida; Lexington, Kentucky; and Grand Prairie, Texas.
•Rotary and Mission Systems - Colorado Springs, Colorado; Shelton and Stratford, Connecticut; Orlando and Jupiter, Florida; Moorestown/Mt. Laurel,
New Jersey; Owego and Syracuse, New York; Manassas, Virginia; and Mielec, Poland.
•Space - Sunnyvale, California; Denver, Colorado; Valley Forge, Pennsylvania; and Reading, England.
•Corporate activities - Bethesda, Maryland.
The following is a summary of our square feet of floor space owned, leased, or utilized by business segment at December 31, 2018 (in millions):
  Owned  Leased  Government-

ITEM  3.    Legal Proceedings
We are a party to or have property subject to litigation and other proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business, including matters arising
under provisions relating to the protection of the environment and are subject to contingencies related to certain businesses we previously owned. These types
of matters could result in fines, penalties, compensatory or treble damages or non-monetary sanctions or relief. We believe the probability is remote that the
outcome of each of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the corporation as a whole, notwithstanding that the unfavorable resolution of any
matter may have a material effect on our net earnings in any particular interim reporting period. We cannot predict the outcome of legal or other proceedings
with certainty.
We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign requirements for protection of the environment, including those for discharge of hazardous materials
and remediation of contaminated sites. Due in part to the complexity and pervasiveness of these requirements, we are a party to or have property subject to
various lawsuits, proceedings and remediation obligations. The extent of our financial exposure cannot in all cases be reasonably estimated at this time.
For information regarding the matters discussed above, including current estimates of the amounts that we believe are required for remediation or clean-
up to the extent estimable, see “Critical Accounting Policies - Environmental Matters” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations and “Note 14 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to various audits and investigations by the U.S. Government to determine whether our operations are
being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. U.S. Government investigations of us, whether relating to government contracts or
conducted for other reasons, could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines or penalties being imposed upon us,
suspension, proposed debarment, debarment from eligibility for future U.S. Government contracting, or suspension of export privileges. Suspension or
debarment could have a material adverse effect on us because of our dependence on contracts with the U.S. Government. U.S. Government investigations
often take years to complete and many result in no adverse action against us. We also provide products and services to customers outside of the U.S., which
are subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations and foreign procurement policies and practices. Our compliance with local regulations or applicable U.S.
Government regulations also may be audited or investigated.

606), as amended, in the first quarter of 2018 (see “ Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies ” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).
(b) Our operating profit and net earnings from continuing operations and earnings per share from continuing operations were affected by severance and restructuring charges
of $96 million ($76 million, or $0.26 per share, after tax) in 2018, severance charges of $80 million ($52 million or $0.17 per share, after tax) in 2016; severance charges
of $82 million ($53 million  or $0.17 per share, after tax) in 2015. See “Note 15 – Severance and Restructuring Char ges” inclu ded in our Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for a discussion of 2018 and 2016 severance and restructuring char ges.
(c) The impact of our postretir ement benefit plans can cause our operating profit, net earnings, cash flows and certain amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets to
fluctuate. Accordingly , our net earnings were affecte d by a net FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $1.0 billion  in 2018 , $876 million  in 2017 , $902 million  in 2016 , $400
million in 2015 , and $317 million in 2014 . We made pension contrib utions of $5.0 billion in 2018, $46 million in 2017, $23 million in 2016, $5 million in 2015 (for our
Sikorsky plan) and $2.0 billion in 2014 (for our legacy plans), and these contributions caused fluctuations in our operating cash flows and cash balance between each of
those years. See “Critical Accounting Policies - Postr etirement Benefit Plans” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
for more information.
(d) In 2017, we recorded a previously deferred non-cash gain of $198 million  related to properties sold in 2015 as a result of completing our remaining obligations, which
increased net earnings from continuing operations by $122 million  ($0.42  per share).
(e) In 2017 , we recorded a net one-time tax charge of $2.0 billion  ($6.77  per share) , substantially all of which was non-cash, primarily related to the estimated impact of the
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (see “Note 9 – Income Taxes” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). This charge along with our annual re-measurement
adjustment related to our postretirement benefit plans of $1.4 billion resulted in a deficit in our total equity as of December 31, 2017.

ITEM 7.    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Business Overview
We are a global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of
advanced technology systems, products and services. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics, system
integration and cybersecurity services. We serve both U.S. and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil and commercial
applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government. In 2018, 70% of our $53.8 billion in net sales were from the U.S.
Government, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor (including 60% from the Department of Defense (DoD)), 28% were from international
customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) and 2% were from U.S. commercial and other customers. Our
main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cybersecurity.
We operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space. We organize our
business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered.
We operate in an environment characterized by both complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures in the U.S. and globally. A
significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our
products and services, and placing security capability quickly into the hands of our U.S. and international customers at affordable prices. Recognizing that our
customers are resource constrained, we are endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio domestically in a disciplined manner with a focus on adjacent
markets close to our core capabilities, as well as growing our international sales. We continue to focus on affordability initiatives. We also expect to continue
to innovate and invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements for our customers and invest in our people so that we have the technical skills
necessary to succeed without limiting our ability to return a substantial portion of our free cash flow to our investors in the form of dividends and share
repurchases. We define free cash flow as cash from operations as determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), less capital
expenditures as presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows.
2019 Financial Trends
We expect our 2019 net sales to increase in the mid-single digit range from 2018 levels. The projected growth is driven by increased production and
sustainment on the F-35 program at Aeronautics and key contract awards and increased volume in the tactical and strike missiles business at MFC. Total
business segment operating profit margin in 2019 is expected to be approximately 10.8%; and cash from operations is expected to be greater than or equal to
$7.4 billion. The preliminary outlook for 2019 assumes the U.S. Government continues to support and fund our key programs. Changes in circumstances may
require us to revise our assumptions, which could materially change our current estimate of 2019 net sales, operating margin and cash flows.
We expect the net 2019 FAS/CAS pension benefit to be approximately $1.5 billion based on a 4.25% discount rate (a 62.5 basis point increase from the
end of 2017), a negative 5.00% return on plan assets in 2018, a 7.00% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets in future years (a 50 basis point
decrease from the end of 2017), and the revised longevity assumptions released during the fourth quarter of 2018 by the Society of Actuaries. As a result of
our $5.0 billion in contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2018, we do not expect to make contributions to our qualified defined
benefit pension plans in 2019.
Portfolio Shaping Activities
We continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We accomplish this in
part by our independent research and development activities and through acquisition, divestiture and internal realignment activities.
We selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments at attractive valuations that will expand or complement our current portfolio and
allow access to new customers or technologies. We also may explore the divestiture of businesses that no longer meet our needs or strategy or that could
perform better outside of our organization. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate targets and enter into agreements
regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures, ventures and equity investments.

Divestiture of the Information Systems & Global Solutions Business
On August 16, 2016, we divested our former Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS) business, which merged with Leidos Holdings, Inc.
(Leidos), in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction (the “Transaction”). As a result of the Transaction, we recognized a net gain of approximately $1.3 billion,
including $1.2 billion recognized in 2016. In 2017, we recognized an additional gain of $73 million, which reflects certain post-closing adjustments, including
certain tax adjustments and the final determination of net working capital. For additional information, see “Note 3 – Acquisition and Divestitures” included in
our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Consolidation of AWE Management Limited
On August 24, 2016, we increased our ownership interest in the AWE Management Limited (AWE) joint venture, which operates the United Kingdom’s
nuclear deterrent program, from 33% to 51%. Consequently, we began consolidating AWE and our operating results include 100% of AWE’s sales and 51%
of its operating profit. Prior to increasing our ownership interest, we accounted for our investment in AWE using the equity method of accounting. Under the
equity method, we recognized only 33% of AWE’s earnings or losses and no sales. Accordingly, prior to August 24, 2016, the date we obtained control, we
recorded 33% of AWE’s net earnings in our operating results and subsequent to August 24, 2016, we recognized 100% of AWE’s sales and 51% of its
operating profit.
For additional information, see “Note 3 – Acquisition and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Industry Considerations
U.S. Government Funding
For the first time in nearly a decade, the DoD began the government fiscal year (FY) with a full-year appropriation. Congress passed, and the President
signed into law an appropriation act that provides $685 billion in funding for the DoD for FY 2019, which is comprised of $617 billion in base funding and
$68 billion for the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) account to support the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT). The appropriation adheres to the
Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA of 2018), which provided an additional $80 billion for national defense over two years in FY 2018 and FY 2019.
However, the U.S. Government has not yet passed full-year appropriations for all agencies. A majority of U.S. Government agencies operated under
continuing resolution funding measures through December 21, 2018. Congress was unable to reach an agreement on full-year appropriations prior to its
expiration. Consequently, a majority of U.S. Government agencies were shutdown through January 25, 2019 when an agreement was reached to provide
funding under a continuing resolution funding measure through February 15, 2019. These agencies may be subject to future shutdowns if new appropriations
are not passed prior to the expiration of the current continuing resolution.
The President has not yet submitted the budget proposal for FY 2020 to Congress due to administrative delays associated with the partial government
shutdown that began on December 22, 2018 and ended on January 25, 2019. Once submitted, Congress must approve or revise the President’s FY 2020
budget proposal through enactment of appropriations bills and other policy legislation, which would then require final approval from the President.
Currently, U.S. defense spending in FY 2020 and FY 2021 remains subject to statutory spending limits established by the Budget Control Act of 2011
(Budget Control Act). The Budget Control Act spending limits were modified for fiscal years 2013 through 2019 by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of
2012, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, and most recently the BBA of 2018. However, these acts do not alter the
spending limits beyond FY 2019. As currently enacted, the Budget Control Act limits defense spending to $576 billion (including approximately $550 billion
for DoD) for FY 2020 with a modest increase to $590 billion (including approximately $563 billion for DoD) in 2021. The President’s defense budget
estimates for FY 2020 and beyond exceed the spending limits established by the Budget Control Act. As a result, continued budget uncertainty and the risk of
future sequestration cuts remain unless the Budget Control Act is repealed or significantly modified. See also the discussion of U.S. Government funding
risks within Item 1A - Risk Factors.

International Business
A key component of our strategic plan is to grow our international sales. To accomplish this growth, we continue to focus on strengthening our
relationships internationally through partnerships and joint technology efforts. We conduct business with international customers through each of our business
segments through either FMS or direct sales to international customers.
International customers accounted for 36% of Aeronautics’ 2018 net sales. There continues to be strong international interest in the F-35 program, which
includes commitments from the U.S. Government and eight international partner countries and four international customers, as well as expressions of interest
from other countries. The U.S. Government and the eight partner countries continue to work together on the design, testing, production, and sustainment of
the F-35 program. The international commitment to the program continues to grow. During 2018, the government of Belgium announced its decision to
purchase 34 F-35 aircraft. Additionally in 2018, we finalized the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) 11 contract with the DoD at $11.5 billion of funding for
the production of 141 F-35 aircraft. This award includes international F-35 partners and FMS customers. Other areas of international expansion at our
Aeronautics business segment include the F-16 program. During 2018, we received a $1.1 billion contract from the U.S. Government to produce 16 new
production F-16 Block 70 aircraft for the Royal Bahraini Air Force. The Undefinitized Contract Action (UCA) award represents the first F-16 Block 70 sale
and the first F-16 production program to be performed in Greenville, South Carolina. Additionally, in December 2018, Slovakia signed a Letter of Offer and
Acceptance (LOA) to procure 14 new production F-16 Block 70/72 aircraft and we were awarded a contract to upgrade 84 F-16 aircraft for the Greek
Ministry of Defence.
In 2018, international customers accounted for 26% of MFC’s net sales. Our MFC business segment continues to generate significant international
interest, most notably in the air and missile defense product line, which produces the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and Terminal High Altitude
Area Defense (THAAD) systems. The PAC-3 is an advanced missile defense system designed to intercept incoming airborne threats. We have ongoing PAC-3
programs for production and sustainment activities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, the Republic of Korea, Japan and Taiwan. Additionally
during 2018, the U.S. and Swedish officials formalized an agreement to provide PAC-3 missiles to Sweden. THAAD is an integrated system designed to
protect against high altitude ballistic missile threats. UAE is an international customer for THAAD, and other countries in the Middle East, Europe and the
Asia-Pacific region have also expressed interest in our air and missile defense systems, including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Additionally, we continue to
see international demand for our tactical missile and fire control products, where we received orders for Hellfire missile systems from the Netherlands and
Japan, precision fires systems from Romania, as well as interest from Poland, where we will be submitting a proposal for a Multiple Launch Rocket System
(MLRS). Other MFC international customers include the United Kingdom, Germany, India, Kuwait, and Bahrain.
In 2018, international customers accounted for 26% of RMS’ net sales. Our RMS business segment continues to experience international interest in the
Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System. We perform activities in the development, production, modernization, ship integration, test and lifetime support for
ships of international customers such as Japan, Spain, Republic of Korea, and Australia. We have ongoing programs in Canada and Chile for combat systems
equipment upgrades on Halifax-class and Type 23 frigates. In our training and logistics solutions portfolio, we have active programs and pursuits in the
United Kingdom, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Canada, Egypt, Singapore, and Australia. In addition, Sikorsky adds a significant international component to
the RMS business segment with an installed base of over 1,000 aircraft internationally. We have active development, production, and sustainment support of
the S-70i Black Hawk® and MH-60 Seahawk® aircraft to foreign military customers, including Chile, Australia, Denmark, Taiwan, the Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia and Colombia. Commercial aircraft are sold to customers in the oil and gas industry, emergency medical evacuation, search and rescue fleets, and VIP
customers in over 30 countries.
International customers accounted for 16% of Space’s 2018 net sales. Our Space business segment includes the operations of AWE, which operates the
United Kingdom’s nuclear deterrent program. The work at AWE covers the entire life cycle, from initial concept, assessment and design, through component
manufacture and assembly, in-service support and decommissioning and disposal. In addition, Space has international contracts with the Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia and Japan to design and manufacture geostationary communication satellites using the A2100 satellite platform.

Status of the F-35 Program
The F-35 program primarily consists of production contracts, sustainment activities, and new development efforts. Production of the aircraft is expected
to continue for many years given the U.S. Government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S.
Navy; commitments from our eight international partners and three international customers; as well as expressions of interest from other countries.
During 2018, the F-35 program completed several milestones both domestically and internationally. The U.S. Government continued testing the
aircraft, including ship trials, mission and weapons systems evaluations, and the F-35 fleet recently surpassed 175,000 flight hours. In April 2018, we
completed the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) flight testing portion of the development contract and began the next phase of development in
support of phased capability improvements and modernization of the F-35 air system. This next phase of development work is being performed separately
from the basic SDD contract as part of the Joint Program Office’s Continuous Capability Development and Delivery (C2D2) strategy. On June 11, we
delivered the 300th production F-35 aircraft, demonstrating the F-35 program’s continued progress and longevity. The first 300 F-35 aircraft delivered to U.S.
and international customers include 197 F-35A variants, 75 F-35B variants, and 28 F-35C variants. In December 2018, the DoD officially approved the F-35
program to begin the formal Initial Operational Test & Evaluation (IOT&E) phase. Testing is expected to be completed during 2019. The data will be
analyzed by the U.S. Government as part of their evaluation to transition the F-35 program from LRIP into full-rate production at the end of 2019.
Several milestones were also achieved with our U.S. Government and international customers. First, United Kingdom’s F-35B carried out the first trials
with UK-built weapons. This represents a key part of the work-up toward Initial Operating Capability efforts. Second, F-35Cs’ participated in Integrated
Flight Operations aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln. Third, a U.S. Marine Corps F-35B conducted the first combat strike in the U.S. Central Command area
of responsibility in support of Operation Freedom’s Sentinel in Afghanistan on September 27. Fourth, the Royal Navy landed the F-35B on the HMS Queen
Elizabeth.
On September 28, we finalized the LRIP 11 contract with the DoD at $11.5 billion for the production and delivery of 141 F-35 aircraft at the lowest per
aircraft price in program history. In November 2018, the U.S. Government awarded an aggregate $22.7 billion UCA Block Buy for the production of 252 F-
35 aircraft in order to provide greater production efficiency, stability and cost savings. As of December 31, 2018, we have delivered 357 production aircraft to
our U.S. and international partners, and we have 396 production aircraft in backlog, including orders from our international partners.
Given the size and complexity of the F-35 program, we anticipate that there will be continual reviews related to aircraft performance, program schedule,
cost, and requirements as part of the DoD, Congressional, and international partners’ oversight and budgeting processes. Current program challenges include,
but are not limited to, supplier and partner performance, software development, level of cost associated with life cycle operations and sustainment and
warranties, receiving funding for production contracts on a timely basis, executing future flight tests, findings resulting from testing and operating the aircraft.

Consolidated Results of Operations
Since our operating cycle is primarily long term and involves many types of contracts for the design, development and manufacture of products and
related activities with varying delivery schedules, the results of operations of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of sales and profits, may not be
indicative of future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results among years should be reviewed in this context. All per share amounts
cited in these discussions are presented on a “per diluted share” basis, unless otherwise noted. Our consolidated results of operations were as follows (in
millions, except per share data):
  2018 2017 2016
Net sales  $ 53,762 $ 49,960 $ 47,290

Total diluted earnings per common share  $ 17.59 $ 6.75 $ 17.07
(a) For the year ended December 31, 2018, operating profit includes a non-cash asset impairment charge of $110 million  related to our equity method investee , Advanced
Military Main tenance, Repair and Overhaul Center LLC (AMMROC). For the year ended December 31, 2017, operating profit includes a $64 million  charge, which
represents our portion of a non-cash asset impairment charge recorded by AMMROC (see “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies ” included in our Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for more inform ation). For the year ended December 31, 2017, operating profit includes a previously deferred non-cash gain of
approximately $198 million  related to properties sold in 2015 (see “Note 8 – Property , Plant and Equipment, net” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for more information). For the year ended December 31, 2016, operating profit includes a non-cash gain on the step acquisition of AWE of approximately
$104 million  (see “ Note 3 – Acquisition and Divestitures ” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information).
(b) In 2017 , we recorded a net one-time tax charge of $2.0 billion  ($6.77  per share) , substantially all of which was non-cash, primarily related to the estimated impact of the
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. See “Income Tax Expense” section below and “Note 9 – Income T axes” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information.
Certain amounts reported in other income, net, primarily our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees, are included in the operating profit
of our business segments. Accordingly, such amounts are included in our discussion of our business segment results of operations.

Net Sales
We generate sales from the delivery of products and services to our customers. Our consolidated net sales were as follows (in millions):
  2018  2017  2016 
Products  $ 45,005  $ 42,502  $ 40,081 
% of total net sales  83.7%  85.1%  84.8%
Services  8,757  7,458  7,209 
% of total net sales  16.3%  14.9%  15.2%
Total net sales  $ 53,762  $ 49,960  $ 47,290 
Substantially all of our contracts are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-
cost method, we record net sales on contracts over time based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract, as well as our estimate of the
profit to be earned at completion. The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated net sales should be read in tandem with the subsequent
discussion of changes in our consolidated cost of sales and our business segment results of operations because changes in our sales are typically accompanied
by a corresponding change in our cost of sales due to the nature of the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method.
Product Sales
Product sales increased $2.5 billion, or 6%, in 2018 as compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher product sales of about $1.2 billion at
Aeronautics, $1.0 billion at MFC and $315 million at RMS. Higher product sales at Aeronautics was primarily due to higher production volume for the F-35
program and higher volume on modernization contracts for the F-16 program. The increase at MFC was primarily due to increased volume for tactical and
strike missiles programs (primarily classified programs and precision fires). The increase at RMS was primarily due to increased production volume for
integrated warfare systems and sensors (IWSS) programs (primarily radar surveillance systems).
Product sales increased $2.4 billion, or 6%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher product sales of about $1.9 billion at
Aeronautics and $340 million at MFC. The increase in product sales at Aeronautics was primarily attributable to higher sales for the F-35 program due to
increased production volume and higher sales for the C-130 program due to increased production volume and aircraft configuration mix, partially offset by a
decrease in sales for the C-5 program due to lower production volume. Higher product sales at MFC was primarily due to an increase in sales for air and
missile defense programs due to higher volume (primarily Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)), higher sales for tactical and strike missile
programs due to product configuration mix (primarily precision fires) and increased volume (primarily classified programs), and higher sales for sensor and
global sustainment programs due to increased volume (primarily Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN®) and SNIPER®).
Service Sales
Service sales increased $1.3 billion, or 17%, in 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily due to an increase in service sales of about $605 million at
Aeronautics, $270 million at RMS, and $245 million at Space. The increase in service sales at Aeronautics was primarily due to higher sustainment volume
for the F-35 and F-22 programs. Higher service sales at RMS was primarily due to increased volume for C6ISR (command, control, communications,
computers, cyber, combat systems, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) and IWSS programs. The increase in service sales at Space was primarily
due to increased volume on government satellite services.
Service sales increased $249 million, or 3%, in 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in service sales of about $200 million at
Aeronautics, $155 million at MFC and $70 million at RMS. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in service sales of about $180 million at
Space. The increase in service sales at Aeronautics was primarily due to increased volume on sustainment activities (primarily the F-35 and C-130 programs).
Higher service sales at MFC was primarily attributable to increased volume on sustainment activities (primarily Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and
Special Operations Forces Contractor Logistics Support Services (SOF CLSS)). Higher service sales at RMS was primarily due to increased volume on
sustainment activities at Sikorsky. The decrease in service sales at Space was primarily due to lower launch related volume for space transportation programs,
partially offset by increased volume for government satellite services.

Table of Contents
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales, for both products and services, consist of materials, labor, subcontracting costs, an allocation of indirect costs (overhead and general and
administrative), as well as the costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain
contracts with international customers. For each of our contracts, we monitor the nature and amount of costs at the contract level, which form the basis for
estimating our total costs to complete the contract. Our consolidated cost of sales were as follows (in millions):
  2018  2017  2016 
Cost of sales – products  $ (40,293)  $(38,417)  $(36,394) 
% of product sales  89.5%  90.4%  90.8%
Cost of sales – services  (7,738)  (6,673)  (6,423) 
% of service sales  88.4%  89.5%  89.1%
Severance and restructuring charges  (96)  —  (80) 
Other unallocated, net  1,639  1,501  1,008 
Total cost of sales  $ (46,488)  $(43,589)  $(41,889) 
The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated cost of sales for products and services should be read in tandem with the preceding
discussion of changes in our consolidated net sales and our business segment results of operations. We have not identified any developing trends in cost of
sales for products and services that would have a material impact on our future operations.
Product Costs
Product costs increased approximately $1.9 billion, or 5%, in 2018 as compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to increased product costs of
about $1.2 billion at Aeronautics and $820 million at MFC. Higher product costs at Aeronautics was primarily due to higher production volume for the F-35
program and higher volume on modernization contracts for the F-16 program. The increase in product costs at MFC was primarily due to increased volume
for tactical and strike missiles programs (primarily classified programs and precision fires).
Product costs increased approximately $2.0 billion, or 6%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased product costs of
about $1.5 billion at Aeronautics and $315 million at MFC. The increase in product costs at Aeronautics was primarily due to increased volume on aircraft
production for the F-35 program and higher cost for the C-130 program due to increased production volume and aircraft configuration mix, partially offset by
a decrease in cost for the C-5 program due to lower production volume. Higher product costs at MFC was primarily attributable to an increase in cost for
tactical and strike missile programs due to product configuration mix (primarily precision fires) and increased volume (classified programs) and higher
product costs for air and missile defense programs due to contract mix (primarily PAC-3) and higher volume (primarily THAAD).
Service Costs
Service costs increased approximately $1.1 billion, or 16%, in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to increased service costs of about $535 million at
Aeronautics, $215 million at RMS, and $170 million at Space. The increase in service costs at Aeronautics was primarily due to higher sustainment volume
for the F-35 and F-22 programs. Higher service costs at RMS were primarily due to increased volume for various C6ISR and IWSS programs. The increase in
service costs at Space was primarily due to increased volume on government satellite services.
Service costs increased approximately $250 million, or 4%, in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to increased service costs of about $230 million at
Aeronautics and $150 million at MFC. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of about$135 million at Space. Higher service costs at Aeronautics
was primarily due to increased volume on sustainment activities (primarily the F-35 and C-130 programs). Higher service costs at MFC was primarily
attributable to higher volume on sustainment activities (primarily PAC-3 and SOF CLSS). The decrease in service costs at Space was primarily due to lower
launch related volume for space transportation programs, partially offset by increased volume for government satellite services.

Restructuring Charges
2018 Actions
During 2018, we recorded charges totaling $96 million ($76 million, or $0.26 per share, after tax) related to certain severance and restructuring actions at
our RMS business segment. These charges consist of $75 million of severance costs for the planned elimination of certain positions through either voluntary
or involuntary actions and $21 million of asset impairment charges associated with our decision to consolidate certain operations. Upon separation,
terminated employees will receive lump-sum severance payments primarily based on years of service, a majority of which we expect to pay by the end of
2019. These actions resulted from a strategic review of our RMS business segment and are intended to improve the efficiency of our operations and better
align our organization and cost structure with changing economic conditions. We expect to recover a portion of the severance and restructuring charges
through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. Government and other customers in future periods, which will be included in RMS’ operating
results. During 2018, we paid approximately $33 million in severance payments associated with these actions.
2016 Actions
During 2016, we recorded severance charges totaling approximately $80 million related to our Aeronautics business segment. The charges consisted of
severance costs associated with the planned elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions. Upon separation, terminated
employees receive lump-sum severance payments primarily based on years of service, the majority of which are expected to be paid over the next several
quarters. As of the end of the first quarter of 2017, we had substantially paid the severance costs associated with these actions.
Other Unallocated, Net
Other unallocated, net primarily includes the FAS/CAS operating adjustment as described in the “Business Segment Results of Operations” section
below, stock-based compensation and other corporate costs. These items are not allocated to the business segments and, therefore, are excluded from the cost
of sales for products and services. Other unallocated, net was a net reduction to expense of $1.6 billion in 2018, $1.5 billion in 2017 and $1.0 billion in 2016.
The increase in net reduction in expense from 2018 to 2017 and 2017 to 2016 was primarily attributable to fluctuations in the FAS/CAS operating
adjustment of $1.8 billion in 2018, $1.6 billion in 2017 and $1.3 billion in 2016, partially offset by fluctuations in other costs associated with various
corporate items, none of which were individually significant. The increase in the FAS/CAS operating adjustment over the periods was primarily attributable
to an increase in U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) pension cost due to the impact of phasing in CAS Harmonization. See “Critical
Accounting Policies - Postretirement Benefit Plans” discussion below for more information on our CAS pension cost. Additionally, the increase in net
reduction to expense in 2017 as compared to 2016 was driven by corporate overhead costs reclassified during 2016 from our former IS&GS business to other
unallocated, net. See “Note 3 – Acquisition and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about
costs reclassified to other unallocated, net.
Other Income, Net
Other income, net primarily includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees and gains or losses for acquisitions and divestitures.
Other income, net in 2018 was $60 million, compared to $373 million in 2017 and $487 million in 2016. The decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 was
primarily attributable to the recognition in 2018 of a non-cash asset impairment charge of $110 million ($83 million, or $0.29 per share, after tax) related to
our equity method investee, AMMROC, decreased earnings generated by equity method investees, and the recognition in 2017 of a previously deferred non-
cash gain of approximately $198 million related to properties sold in 2015. The decrease in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to decreased
earnings generated by equity method investees and recognition in 2017 of our portion of a non-cash asset impairment charge recorded by our equity method
investee, AMMROC. These decreases were partially offset by the recognition in 2017 of a previously deferred non-cash gain of approximately $198 million
related to properties sold in 2015, which was greater than the net gain of $104 million recognized in the third quarter of 2016 on the step acquisition of AWE.

Interest Expense
Interest expense in 2018 was $668 million, compared to $651 million in 2017 and $663 million in 2016. The slight increase in interest expense in 2018
resulted primarily from increased interest expense on interest rate swaps and commercial paper, partially offset by our scheduled repayment of $750 million
of debt during 2018. The decrease in interest expense in 2017 resulted primarily from our scheduled repayment of $952 million of debt during 2016. See
“Capital Structure, Resources and Other” included within “Liquidity and Cash Flows” discussion below and “Note 10 – Debt” included in our Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our debt.
Other Non-Operating Expense, Net
Other non-operating expense, net primarily includes the non-service cost components of FAS pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense
(i.e., interest cost, expected return on plan assets, net actuarial gains or losses, and amortization of prior service cost or credits) related to our postretirement
benefit plans. Other non-operating expense, net in 2018 decreased slightly compared to 2017 primarily due to fluctuations in other costs associated with
various items, none of which were individually significant. Other non-operating expense, net increased $376 million from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to
higher non-service cost components of FAS expense related to a lower discount rate and lower expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
Income Tax Expense
Our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 13.6% for 2018, 64.0% for 2017, and 23.0% for 2016. On December 22, 2017, the
President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act, among other things, lowered the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%
effective January 1, 2018. Consequently, we wrote down our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 by $2.0 billion to reflect the estimated impact of
the Tax Act. We recorded a corresponding net one-time charge of $2.0 billion ($6.77 per share), substantially all of which was non-cash, primarily related to
enactment of the Tax Act, the re-measurement of certain net deferred tax assets using the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate (approximately $1.9 billion), a
deemed repatriation tax (approximately $43 million), and a reduction in the U.S. manufacturing benefit (approximately $81 million) as a result of our decision
to accelerate contributions to our pension fund in 2018 in order to receive a tax deduction in 2017. The net one-time charge related to the Tax Act increased
our 2017 effective income tax rate by 37.5 percentage points. Our effective income tax rate and cash tax payments in years after 2017 are expected to benefit
materially from the enactment of the Tax Act. As of December 22, 2018, we completed our accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the
Tax Act and did not identify any material changes to the provisional, net, one-time charge for the year ended December 31, 2017, related to the Tax Act.
We recognized a new tax benefit in 2018 of $61 million related to the deduction for foreign derived intangible income enacted by the Tax Act, which
reduced our effective income tax rate by 1.0 percentage point. We also recognized a tax benefit of $61 million in 2018, which reduced our effective income
tax rate by 1.0 percentage point, from our change in a tax accounting method reflecting a 2012 Court of Federal Claims decision, which held that the tax basis
in certain assets should be increased and realized upon the assets’ disposition.
The rates for all periods benefited from tax deductions for dividends paid to our defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan
feature, and the U.S. research and development (R&D) tax credit. The Tax Act repealed the U.S. manufacturing benefit for years after 2017. The U.S.
manufacturing benefit for 2017 was insignificant, compared to a reduction of our effective tax rate by 2.5 percentage points for 2016. The 2017 benefit was
reduced by $81 million because of our 2017 decision after enactment of the Tax Act to make accelerated contributions of cash in 2018 to our defined benefit
pension plans. The R&D tax credit reduced our effective tax rate by 2.4 percentage points in 2018 and 2.2 percentage points in both 2017 and 2016. The rate
for 2016 also benefited from the nontaxable gain recorded in connection with the consolidation of AWE.
In addition, the rates for 2018, 2017, and 2016 benefited from tax benefits related to employee share-based payment awards, which are now recorded in
earnings as income tax benefit or expense, effective with the adoption of an accounting standard update during 2016. Accordingly, we recognized additional
income tax benefits of $55 million, $106 million, and $152 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, which reduced our effective
income tax rate by 0.9 percentage points, 2.0 percentage points, and 3.2 percentage points.
Future changes in tax laws could significantly impact our provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, our deferred tax asset and liability
balances, and stockholders’ equity. The amount of net deferred tax assets will change periodically based on several factors, including the measurement of our
postretirement benefit plan obligations, actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans, and future changes in tax laws.

Net Earnings from Continuing Operations
We reported net earnings from continuing operations of $5.0 billion ($17.59 per share) in 2018, $1.9 billion ($6.50 per share) in 2017 and $3.7 billion
($12.08 per share) in 2016. Both net earnings and earnings per share from continuing operations were affected by the factors mentioned above. Earnings per
share also benefited from a net decrease of approximately 3.0 million common shares outstanding from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 as a result
of share repurchases, partially offset by share issuance under our stock-based awards and certain defined contribution plans. From December 31, 2016 to
December 31, 2017 earnings per share benefited from a decrease of approximately 5.0 million common shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases,
partially offset by share issuance under our stock-based awards and certain defined contribution plans.
Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations
We reported net earnings from discontinued operations related to the 2016 divestiture of the IS&GS business of $73 million ($0.25 per share) in 2017 and
$1.5 billion ($4.99 per share) in 2016. Net earnings from discontinued operations in 2017 reflects certain post-closing adjustments, including final working
capital and tax adjustments. Net earnings from discontinued operations in 2016 included an initial net gain of approximately $1.2 billion recognized as a
result of the divestiture of the IS&GS business.
Net Earnings
We reported net earnings of $5.0 billion ($17.59 per share) in 2018, $2.0 billion ($6.75 per share) in 2017 and $5.2 billion ($17.07 per share) in 2016.
Business Segment Results of Operations
We operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, MFC, RMS and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and
services offered. The financial information in the following tables includes the results of businesses we have acquired from their respective dates of
acquisition and excludes businesses included in discontinued operations (see “Note 3 – Acquisition and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements) for all years presented. Net sales of our business segments exclude intersegment sales as these activities are eliminated in consolidation.
Operating profit of our business segments includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees because the operating activities of the
equity method investees are closely aligned with the operations of our business segments. United Launch Alliance (ULA), results of which are included in our
Space business segment, is one of our largest equity method investees. Operating profit of our business segments excludes the FAS/CAS operating adjustment
for our qualified defined benefit pension plans (described below); the adjustment from CAS to the FAS service cost component for all other postretirement
benefit plans; expense for stock-based compensation; the effects of items not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance,
such as charges related to goodwill impairments (see “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements)
and significant severance and restructuring actions (see “Note 15 – Severance and Restructuring Charges” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements); gains or losses from significant divestitures (see “Note 3 – Acquisition and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements); the effects of certain legal settlements; corporate costs not allocated to our business segments; and other miscellaneous corporate activities.
These items are included in the reconciling item “Unallocated items” between operating profit from our business segments and our consolidated operating
profit.
Our business segments’ results of operations include pension expense only as calculated under U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards, which we
refer to as CAS pension cost. We recover CAS pension cost through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts and, therefore, the
CAS pension cost is recognized in each of our business segments’ net sales and cost of sales. Our consolidated operating profit in our consolidated financial
statements must present the service cost component of FAS pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense calculated in accordance with FAS
requirements under U.S. GAAP. The operating portion of the net FAS/CAS operating adjustment represents the difference between the service cost
component of FAS pension expense and the CAS pension cost recorded in our business segments’ results of operations. The non-service FAS pension and
other postretirement benefit plan cost component is included in other non-operating expenses, net on our consolidated statement of earnings. As a result, to
the extent that CAS pension cost exceeds the service cost component of FAS pension expense, which occurred for 2018, 2017 and 2016, we have a favorable
FAS/CAS operating adjustment.

(a) On August 24, 2016, our ownership interest in the A WE joint venture increased from 33% to 51% and we were required to change our accounting for this investment from
the equity method to consolidation. As a result of the increased ownership interest, we recognized a non-cash gain of $127 million  at our Space business segment, which
increased net earnings from continuing operations by $104 million  ($0.34  per share) in 2016. See “Note 3 – Acquisition and Divestitures ” included in our Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for more information).
(b) The FAS/CAS operating adjustment represents the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension expense and total pension costs recoverable on U.S.

(a) We record the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost as part of other non-operating expense, net in the consolidated statement of earnings. The non-
service cost components in the table above relate only to our qualified defined benefit pension plans. We incurred total non-service costs for our qualified defined benefit
pension plans in the table above, along with similar costs for our other postretirement benefit plans of $67 million , $109 million , and $123 million  for the years ended
2018, 2017 and 2016.
We recover CAS pension cost through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts and, therefore, recognize CAS pension cost
in each of our business segment’s net sales and cost of sales. Our consolidated financial statements must present FAS pension and other postretirement benefit
plan expense calculated in accordance with FAS requirements under U.S. GAAP. The operating portion of the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents
the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension expense and CAS pension cost. The non-service FAS pension cost component is included
in other non-operating expense, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. The net FAS/CAS pension adjustment increases or decreases CAS pension
cost to equal total FAS pension expense (both service and non-service).
The following segment discussions also include information relating to backlog for each segment. Backlog was approximately $130.5 billion,
$105.5 billion and $103.5 billion at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. These amounts included both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding has
been both authorized and appropriated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated). Backlog does
not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts. Funded backlog was approximately
$86.4 billion at December 31, 2018.
Management evaluates performance on our contracts by focusing on net sales and operating profit and not by type or amount of operating expense.
Consequently, our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit, consistent with our approach for managing the
business. This approach is consistent throughout the life cycle of our contracts, as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales
and operating profit and monitors performance on our contracts in a similar manner through their completion.
We regularly provide customers with reports of our costs as the contract progresses. The cost information in the reports is accumulated in a manner
specified by the requirements of each contract. For example, cost data provided to a customer for a product would typically align to the subcomponents of that
product (such as a wing-box on an aircraft) and for services would align to the type of work being performed (such as aircraft sustainment). Our contracts
generally allow for the recovery of costs in the pricing of our products and services. Most of our contracts are bid and negotiated with our customers under
circumstances in which we are required to disclose our estimated total costs to provide the product or service. This approach for negotiating contracts with our
U.S. Government customers generally allows for the recovery of our costs. We also may enter into long-term supply contracts for certain materials or
components to coincide with the production schedule of certain products and to ensure their availability at known unit prices.
Many of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract, we identify and monitor risks to
the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the
contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g.,
the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation
agreements required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the
ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase
during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding
36
Table of Contents
the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates
may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract
and may affect the profit booking rate.
We have a number of programs that are designated as classified by the U.S. Government which cannot be specifically described. The operating results of
these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results and are subjected to the same oversight and internal controls as our
other programs.
Our net sales are primarily derived from long-term contracts for products and services provided to the U.S. Government as well as FMS contracted
through the U.S. Government. We recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services.
For performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress
towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it
best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. For performance obligations in which control does not continuously
transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied.
Changes in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales or
operating profit resulting from varying production activity levels or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes in segment operating profit are
typically based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract.
In addition, comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margins may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit
booking rates on our contracts accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically
referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely,
conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to complete and a reduction in the profit booking rate.
Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating
profit and margins may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters,
cost recoveries on restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of
contractual matters; severance and restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating results;
reserves for disputes; asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets. Segment operating profit and items such as risk retirements, reductions of profit
booking rates or other matters are presented net of state income taxes.
As previously disclosed, we have a program, EADGE-T, to design, integrate, and install an air missile defense command, control, communications,
computers – intelligence (C4I) system for an international customer that has experienced performance matters and for which we have periodically accrued
reserves. In 2017, we revised our estimated costs to complete the EADGE-T contract as a consequence of ongoing performance matters and recorded an
additional charge of $120 million ($74 million or $0.25 per share, after tax) at our RMS business segment, which resulted in cumulative losses of
approximately $260 million on this program. As of December 31, 2018, cumulative losses remained at approximately $260 million. We continue to monitor
program requirements and our performance. At this time, we do not anticipate additional charges that would be material to our operating results or financial
condition.
We have two commercial satellite programs, for the delivery of three satellites in total, to international customers at our Space business segment, for
which we have experienced performance issues related to the development and integration of a modernized LM 2100 satellite platform. These programs
require the development of new satellite technology to enhance the LM 2100’s power, propulsion and electronics, among other items. The enhanced LM 2100
satellite platform is expected to benefit other commercial and government satellite programs. We have periodically revised our estimated costs to complete
these developmental commercial programs. We have recorded cumulative losses of approximately $380 million through December 31, 2018. In 2018, we
recorded losses of approximately $75 million ($56 million, or $0.20 per share, after tax). While these losses reflect our estimated total losses on the programs,
we will continue to incur general and administrative costs each period until we complete these programs. These programs remain developmental and further
challenges in the delivery and integration of new satellite technology, anomalies discovered during system testing requiring repair or rework, further schedule
delays and potential penalties could require that we record additional loss reserves which could be material to our operating results. We previously disclosed
that, as we did not meet the July 2018 delivery requirement for two satellites, the customer could seek to exercise termination rights. One of the satellites has
now been launched, eliminating this risk. As the other is expected to launch in the first half of 2019, we believe it unlikely that the customer will seek to do
so. Were the customer to seek to exercise a termination right and be successful in this effort, we would have to refund the payments we have received and pay
certain penalties. On the third satellite, we currently anticipate delivery before the date upon which the customer could seek to exercise a termination right
although we may have to pay certain penalties and have sought to address this possibility in our reserves.

We are responsible for designing, developing and installing an upgraded turret for the Warrior Capability Sustainment Program. In 2018, we revised our
estimated costs to complete the program as a consequence of performance issues, and recorded a charge of approximately $85 million ($64 million, or $0.22
per share, after tax) at our MFC business segment, which resulted in cumulative losses of approximately $140 million on this program as of December 31,
2018. We may continue to experience issues related to customer requirements and our performance under this contract and have to record additional
charges. However, based on the losses already recorded and our current estimate of the sales and costs to complete the program, at this time we do not
anticipate that additional losses, if any, would be material to our operating results or financial condition.
Our consolidated net adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other items, net of state income taxes,
increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.9 billion in 2018, $1.6 billion in 2017 and $1.4 billion in 2016. The increase in consolidated net
adjustments in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to increases in profit booking rate adjustments at our MFC, RMS, and Space business segments,
partially offset by a decrease at our Aeronautics business segment. The increase in our consolidated net adjustments in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily
due to an increases in profit booking rate adjustments at our Aeronautics and Space business segments, partially offset by a decrease at our RMS business
segment. The consolidated net adjustments for 2018 are inclusive of approximately $900 million in unfavorable items, which include reserves for
performance matters on the Warrior Capability Sustainment Program at MFC, various programs at RMS, and commercial satellite programs at Space. The
consolidated net adjustments for 2017 are inclusive of approximately $800 million in unfavorable items, which include reserves for performance matters on
the EADGE-T contract, Vertical Launching System (VLS) program and other programs at RMS and on commercial satellite programs at Space. The
consolidated net adjustments for 2016 are inclusive of approximately $535 million in unfavorable items, which include reserves for performance matters on
the EADGE-T contract at RMS and on commercial satellite programs at Space.
Aeronautics
Our Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of
advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Aeronautics’ major programs include
the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, C‑130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor. Aeronautics’ operating results included the following (in
millions):
  2018  2017  2016 
Net sales  $ 21,242  $ 19,410  $ 17,293 
Operating profit  2,272  2,176  1,845 
Operating margin  10.7%  11.2%  10.7%
Backlog at year-end  $ 55,601  $ 35,692  $ 34,999 
2018 compared to 2017
Aeronautics’ net sales in 2018 increased $1.8 billion, or 9%, compared to 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of
approximately $1.5 billion for the F-35 program due to increased volume on production and sustainment, partially offset by lower volume on development
activities; about $300 million for other programs due to higher volume (primarily ADP); about $210 million for the F-16 program due to increased volume on
modernization contracts; and about $110 million for the F-22 program due to increased sustainment volume. These increases were partially offset by a
decrease of approximately $130 million for the C-130 program primarily due to lower volume on sustainment activities and about $130 million for the C-
5 program due to lower volume as deliveries under the current production modernization program were completed in the third quarter of 2018.
Aeronautics’ operating profit in 2018 increased $96 million, or 4%, compared to 2017. Operating profit increased approximately $250 million for the F-
35 program due to increased volume on higher margin production contracts and new development activities and better performance on sustainment. This
increase was partially offset by a decrease of about $65 million for the C-130 program due to lower risk retirements and lower sustainment volume; about $60
million for the F-16 program due to lower risk retirements; and about $35 million for the C-5 program due to lower risk retirements and lower production
volume. Adjustments not related to volume, primarily net profit booking rate adjustments, were about $175 million lower in 2018 compared to 2017.
2017 compared to 2016
Aeronautics’ net sales in 2017 increased $2.1 billion, or 12%, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of
approximately $2.0 billion for the F-35 program due to increased volume on production and sustainment; about $155 million for the C-130 program primarily
due to increased production volume and due to aircraft configuration mix; and about
38
Table of Contents
$95 million for the F-22 program due to higher volume on aircraft modernization programs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of
approximately $195 million for the C-5 program due to lower production volume.
Aeronautics’ operating profit in 2017 increased $331 million, or 18%, compared to 2016. Operating profit increased approximately $300 million for the
F-35 program due to increased volume on aircraft production and sustainment activities and higher risk retirements and about $85 million for the F-
16 program due to higher risk retirements partially offset by lower volume on aircraft modernization programs. These increases were partially offset by a
decrease of about $30 million due to lower equity earnings from an investee. Adjustments not related to volume, primarily net profit booking rate
adjustments, were about $245 million higher in 2017 compared to 2016.
Backlog
Backlog increased in 2018 compared to 2017 and in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to higher orders on F-35 production and sustainment
programs.
Trends
We currently expect Aeronautics’ 2019 net sales to increase in the high-single digit percentage range as compared to 2018 driven by the increased
volume on the F-35 program. Operating profit is also expected to increase in the high-single digit percentage range, resulting in comparable operating profit
margins in 2019 as compared to 2018.
Missiles and Fire Control
Our MFC business segment provides air and missile defense systems; tactical missiles and air-to-ground precision strike weapon systems; logistics; fire
control systems; mission operations support, readiness, engineering support and integration services; manned and unmanned ground vehicles; and energy
management solutions. MFC’s major programs include PAC‑3, THAAD, MLRS, Hellfire, JASSM, Javelin, Apache, SNIPER®, LANTIRN® and Special
Operations Forces Global Logistics Support Services (SOF GLSS). MFC’s operating results included the following (in millions):
  2018  2017  2016 
Net sales  $ 8,462  $ 7,282  $ 6,789 
Operating profit  1,248  1,034  1,004 
Operating margin  14.7%  14.2%  14.8%
Backlog at year-end  $ 21,363  $ 17,729  $ 14,204 
2018 compared to 2017
MFC’s net sales in 2018 increased $1.2 billion, or 16%, compared to the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales
of approximately $925 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to increased volume (primarily classified programs and precision fires); and about
$185 million for sensors and global sustainment programs due to increased volume (primarily LANTIRN, SNIPER, and Apache).
MFC’s operating profit in 2018 increased $214 million, or 21%, compared to 2017. Operating profit increased approximately $140 million for tactical
and strike missile programs due to reserves which were recorded in 2017 but did not recur in 2018 (primarily Joint Air to Ground Missile (JAGM)), higher
risk retirements (primarily precision fires and Hellfire) and higher volume (primarily precision fires); and about $50 million for sensors and global
sustainment programs due to higher risk retirements and higher volume (primarily LANTIRN, SNIPER, and Apache), after charges of approximately $85
million previously recorded in 2018 for performance matters on the Warrior Capability Sustainment Program. Adjustments not related to volume, including
net profit booking rate adjustments and other items, were about $200 million higher in 2018 compared to 2017.
2017 compared to 2016
MFC’s net sales in 2017 increased $493 million, or 7%, compared to 2016. The increase was attributable to higher net sales of approximately
$205 million for integrated air and missile defense programs due to contract mix on certain programs (primarily PAC-3) and increased volume on certain
programs (primarily THAAD); and about $135 million for sensors and global sustainment programs due to increased volume (primarily SOF GLSS and
LANTIRN and SNIPER); and about $110 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to product configuration mix (primarily precision fires) and
increased volume (primarily classified programs).
39
Table of Contents
MFC’s operating profit in 2017 increased $30 million, or 3%, compared to 2016. Operating profit increased about $85 million for integrated air and
missile defense programs due to increased volume (primarily THAAD), contract mix (primarily PAC-3), and a reserve recorded in fiscal year 2016 for a
contractual matter that did not recur in 2017; and about $85 million for sensors and global sustainment programs due to increased risk retirements and higher
volume (primarily LANTIRN and SNIPER). These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $120 million for tactical and strike missile
programs due to lower risk retirements (primarily precision fires and Hellfire) and the establishment of a reserve on a program. Adjustments not related to
volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other items, were about $10 million higher in 2017 compared to 2016.
Backlog
Backlog increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher orders on PAC-3, precision fires, and other tactical missiles programs. Backlog
increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to higher orders on Hellfire, precision fires and PAC-3.
Trends
We currently expect MFC’s net sales to increase in the low-double digit percentage range in 2019 as compared to 2018 driven by key contract awards in
2018 and higher volume in the tactical and strike missiles business. Operating profit is expected to increase in the high-single digit percentage range in 2019
as compared to 2018 driven by the increase in sales volume. Operating profit margin for 2019 is expected to be slightly lower than 2018 levels.
Rotary and Mission Systems
Our RMS business segment provides design, manufacture, service and support for a variety of military and commercial helicopters; ship and submarine
mission and combat systems; mission systems and sensors for rotary and fixed-wing aircraft; sea and land-based missile defense systems; radar systems; the
Littoral Combat Ship (LCS); simulation and training services; and unmanned systems and technologies. In addition, RMS supports the needs of government
customers in cybersecurity and delivers communication and command and control capabilities through complex mission solutions for defense applications.
RMS’ major programs include Black Hawk and Seahawk helicopters, Aegis Combat System (Aegis), LCS, CH-53K King Stallion helicopter, VH-
92A helicopter program, Advanced Hawkeye Radar System, and the Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) contract.
Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2017, we realigned certain programs within the RMS business segment to align with changes in management
structure. RMS’ operating results included the following (in millions):
  2018  2017  2016 
Net sales  $ 14,250  $ 13,663  $ 13,595 
Operating profit  1,302  902  845 
Operating margin  9.1%  6.6%  6.2%
Backlog at year-end  $ 31,320  $ 30,030  $ 29,029 
2018 compared to 2017
RMS’ net sales in 2018 increased $587 million, or 4%, compared to 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately
$525 million for IWSS programs due to higher volume (primarily radar surveillance systems programs and Multi Mission Surface Combatant); and about
$250 million for C6ISR programs due to higher volume on multiple programs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $270
million for Sikorsky helicopter programs, which reflect lower volume for Black Hawk production, partially offset by higher volume for CH-53K King
Stallion development and for mission systems programs.
RMS’ operating profit in 2018 increased $400 million, or 44%, compared to 2017. Operating profit increased approximately $185 million for C6ISR
programs due to charges of $120 million for performance matters on the EADGE-T contract, recorded in 2017 but which did not recur in 2018, and due to
higher risk retirements (primarily undersea systems programs); about $155 million for Sikorsky helicopter programs due to better cost performance across the
Sikorsky portfolio and better cost performance on the Multi-Year IX contract; and about $105 million for IWSS programs due to higher risk retirements and
higher volume (primarily Aegis). Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other items, were about $185 million
higher in 2018 compared to 2017.

Table of Contents
2017 compared to 2016
RMS’ net sales in 2017 increased $68 million, or 1%, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to approximately $85 million for
training and logistics services programs due to higher volume; about $55 million for IWSS programs due to higher volume (primarily Aegis); and about $40
million for Sikorsky helicopter programs due to certain adjustments recorded in 2016 required to account for the acquisition, partially offset by lower volume
on certain helicopter programs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of about $100 million for C6ISR programs due to lower volume.
RMS’ operating profit in 2017 increased $57 million, or 7%, compared to 2016. Operating profit increased about $120 million for Sikorsky helicopter
programs due to certain adjustments recorded in 2016 required to account for the acquisition; and about $30 million for IWSS programs due to higher volume
and increased risk retirements, partially offset by a $20 million charge for performance matters on the Vertical Launching System (VLS) program. This
increase was offset by a decrease of $105 million for C6ISR programs primarily due to a net $95 million increase for charges for performance matters on the
EADGE-T contract. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other items, were about $45 million lower in 2017
compared to 2016.
Backlog
Backlog increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher orders on IWSS and C6ISR programs. Backlog increased in 2017 compared to 2016
primarily due to a new multi-year award at Sikorsky.
Trends
We currently expect RMS’ net sales to be slightly above 2018 levels. Operating profit is also expected to be slightly above 2018 levels resulting in
similar operating profit margins in 2019 as compared to 2018.
Space
Our Space business segment is engaged in the research and development, design, engineering and production of satellites, strategic and defensive missile
systems and space transportation systems. Space provides network-enabled situational awareness and integrates complex space and ground-based global
systems to help our customers gather, analyze, and securely distribute critical intelligence data. Space is also responsible for various classified systems and
services in support of vital national security systems. Space’s major programs include the Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM), AWE, Orion Multi-
Purpose Crew Vehicle (Orion), Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) and Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next Gen OPIR) system, Global
Positioning System (GPS) III, Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF), and The Mobile User Objective System (MUOS). Operating profit for our
Space business segment includes our share of earnings for our investment in ULA, which provides expendable launch services to the U.S. Government.
Space’s operating results included the following (in millions):
  2018  2017  2016 
Net sales  $ 9,808  $ 9,605  $ 9,613 
Operating profit  1,055  980  1,288 
Operating margin  10.8%  10.2%  13.4%
Backlog at year-end  $ 22,184  $ 22,042  $ 25,226 
2018 compared to 2017
Space’s net sales in 2018 increased $203 million, or 2%, compared to 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately
$225 million for strategic and missile defense programs due to higher volume (primarily AWE and FBM) and about $65 million for the Orion program due to
higher volume. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $70 million for commercial satellite programs due to lower volume and
about $25 million for government satellite programs due to lower volume.
Space’s operating profit in 2018 increased $75 million, or 8%, compared to 2017. Operating profit increased approximately $40 million for commercial
satellite programs, which reflect a lower amount of charges recorded for performance matters on certain programs; and about $30 million for government
satellite programs primarily due to higher volume and higher risk retirements for government satellite services. Adjustments not related to volume, including
net profit booking rate adjustments and other items, were about $30 million higher in 2018 compared to 2017.

Table of Contents
2017 compared to 2016
Space’s net sales in 2017 were comparable with 2016. The slight decrease was attributable to a decrease of approximately $300 million for space
transportation programs due to a reduction in launch-related events; about $245 million for government satellite programs (primarily AEHF and SBIRS) due
to lower volume; approximately $190 million across other programs (including the Orion program) due to lower volume; and about $90 million for
commercial satellite programs due to lower volume. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of approximately $810 million due to a full year of
net sales from AWE in 2017 compared to four months of sales in 2016, which we began consolidating during the third quarter of 2016.
Space’s operating profit in 2017 decreased $308 million, or 24%, compared to 2016. Operating profit decreased $127 million due to the pre-tax gain
recorded in 2016 related to the consolidation of AWE; about $95 million for lower equity earnings from ULA; about $30 million for space transportation
programs due to a reduction in launch-related events; about $35 million for government satellite programs (primarily SBIRS and AEHF) due to a charge for
performance matters and lower volume; and a net decrease of about $35 million related to charges recorded in 2017 for performance matters on certain
commercial satellite programs. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other items, were about $20 million
higher in 2017 compared to 2016.
Equity earnings
Total equity earnings recognized by Space (primarily ULA) represented approximately $210 million, $205 million and $325 million, or 20%, 21% and
25% of this business segment’s operating profit during 2018, 2017 and 2016.
Backlog
Backlog increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to new orders on government satellite programs, specifically Next Gen OPIR and GPS III.
Backlog decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to lower orders for government satellite programs, partially offset by higher orders on the Orion
program.
Trends
We currently expect Space's 2019 net sales to be comparable to 2018 levels. Operating profit in 2019 is expected to decrease in the low-double digit
percentage range as compared to 2018 driven by lower equity earnings in 2019 compared to 2018. As a result, operating profit margin in 2019 is expected to
decrease from 2018 levels.
Liquidity and Cash Flows
We have a balanced cash deployment strategy to enhance stockholder value and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when
they arise. Consistent with that strategy, we have continued to invest in our business, including capital expenditures, independent research and development
and, selective business acquisitions and investments, while returning cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases, and managing our debt
levels, maturities and interest rates and pension obligations.
We have generated strong operating cash flows, which have been the primary source of funding for our operations, capital expenditures, debt service and
repayments, dividends, share repurchases and postretirement benefit plan contributions. Our strong operating cash flows enabled our Board of Directors to
approve two key cash deployment initiatives in September 2018. First, we increased our dividend rate in the fourth quarter by 10% to $2.20 per share.
Second, the Board of Directors approved a $1.0 billion increase to our share repurchase program. Inclusive of this increase, the total remaining authorization
for future common share repurchases under our program was $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2018.
We expect our cash from operations will continue to be sufficient to support our operations and anticipated capital expenditures for the foreseeable future.
However, we expect to continue to issue commercial paper backed by our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility to manage the timing of cash flows. We also
have additional access to credit markets, if needed, for liquidity or general corporate purposes, and letters of credit to support customer advance payments and
for other trade finance purposes such as guaranteeing our performance on particular contracts. See our “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” section
below for a discussion on available financial resources.
We made contributions of $5.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2018, including required and discretionary contributions. As a
result of these contributions, we do not expect to make contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2019. We funded these contributions in
2018 using a mix of cash on hand and commercial paper.

Table of Contents
During 2016, we received a one-time, tax-free special cash payment of approximately $1.8 billion as a result of the divestiture of the IS&GS business in
the third quarter of 2016. We used the proceeds to repay $500 million of long-term notes at their scheduled maturity and paid $484 million in dividends with a
portion of this cash. The remainder was used for share repurchases.
Cash received from customers, either from the payment of invoices for work performed or for advances in excess of costs incurred, is our primary source
of cash. We generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. However, we may determine to fund customer programs
ourselves pending government appropriations and are doing so with increased frequency. If we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on the contract, we
may be at risk for reimbursement of the excess costs.
Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. We generally bill and collect cash
more frequently under cost-reimbursable contracts, which represent approximately 38% of the sales we recorded in 2018, as we are authorized to bill as the
costs are incurred. A number of our fixed-price contracts may provide for performance-based payments, which allow us to bill and collect cash as we perform
on the contract. The amount of performance-based payments and the related milestones are encompassed in the negotiation of each contract. The timing of
such payments may differ from our incurrence of costs related to our contract performance, thereby affecting our cash flows.
The U.S. Government has indicated that it would consider progress payments as the baseline for negotiating payment terms on fixed-price contracts,
rather than performance-based payments. In contrast to negotiated performance-based payment terms, progress payment provisions correspond to a
percentage of the amount of costs incurred during the performance of the contract. While the total amount of cash collected on a contract is the same,
performance-based payments have had a more favorable impact on the timing of our cash flows. In addition, our cash flows may be affected if the U.S.
Government decides to withhold payments on our billings. While the impact of withholding payments delays the receipt of cash, the cumulative amount of
cash collected during the life of the contract will not vary.
The majority of our capital expenditures for 2018 and those planned for 2019 are for equipment, facilities infrastructure and information technology.
Expenditures for equipment and facilities infrastructure are generally incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. For
example, we have projects underway in our Aeronautics business segment for facilities and equipment to support higher production of the F-35 combat
aircraft, and we have projects underway to modernize certain of our facilities. We also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support
programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software.
The following table provides a summary of our cash flow information followed by a discussion of the key elements (in millions):
  2018 2017 2016
Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year  $ 2,861 $ 1,837 $ 1,090

Cash and cash equivalents at end of year  $ 772 $ 2,861 $ 1,837
Operating Activities
2018 compared to 2017
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $3.3 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to contributions of $5.0 billion to our qualified
defined benefit pension plans in 2018 and an increase in cash used for working capital of $974 million, partially offset by an increase in net earnings and a
decrease in income tax payments. The increase in cash used for working capital was largely driven by the timing of cash collections for the F-35 program and
Sikorsky helicopter programs. We received net income tax refunds of $41 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to making net income
tax payments of $1.1 billion during the year ended December 31, 2017. Net refunds in 2018 were primarily the result a 2017 net operating loss carryback
arising from our accelerated pension contributions. Our effective income tax rate and cash tax payments in 2018 benefited
43
Table of Contents
materially from the enactment of the Tax Act in 2017. We made interest payments of approximately $635 million and approximately $610 million during the
years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.
2017 compared to 2016
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $1.3 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a decrease in cash used for working capital, a
reduction in cash paid for income taxes and a reduction in cash paid for severance. The decrease in cash used for working capital was largely driven by timing
of cash collections (primarily PAC-3, THAAD, LANTIRN and SNIPER, and Sikorsky helicopter programs). We made net income tax payments of
$1.1 billion and $1.3 billion during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. We made interest payments of approximately $610 million and
approximately $600 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. In addition, cash provided by operating activities during the year ended
December 31, 2016 included cash generated by IS&GS of approximately $310 million as we retained this cash as part of the divestiture.
Investing Activities
Net cash used for investing activities decreased $72 million in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to approximately $105 million of cash received as
part of the final settlement of net working capital in connection with the 2016 divestiture of our IS&GS business and cash received for various other items,
none of which were individually significant, partially offset by higher capital expenditures. Net cash used for investing activities increased $162 million in
2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to higher capital expenditures and cash proceeds received in 2016 related to properties sold.
Capital expenditures amounted to $1.3 billion in 2018, $1.2 billion in 2017 and $1.1 billion in 2016. The majority of our capital expenditures were for
equipment and facilities infrastructure that generally are incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. We also incur
capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the
development or purchase of internal-use-software.
Financing Activities
Net cash used for financing activities decreased $153 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to $600 million of net proceeds from the issuance
of commercial paper and a reduction in cash used for repurchases of common stock, partially offset by the repayment of long-term debt in 2018 and an
increase in dividend payments.
Net cash used for financing activities increased $848 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the receipt of a one-time special cash payment in
2016 from the divestiture of the IS&GS business and higher dividend payments in 2017, partially offset by the repayment of long-term debt in 2016 and a
reduction in cash used for repurchases of common stock.
In November 2018, we repaid $750 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 1.85% according to their scheduled maturities. In September
2016, we repaid $500 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 2.13% according to their scheduled maturities. In May 2016, we repaid $452
million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 7.65% according to their scheduled maturities.
For additional information about our debt financing activities see the “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” discussion below and “Note 10 – Debt”
included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
We paid dividends totaling $2.3 billion ($8.20 per share) in 2018, $2.2 billion ($7.46 per share) in 2017 and $2.0 billion ($6.77 per share) in 2016. We
paid quarterly dividends of $2.00 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2018 and $2.20 per share during the fourth quarter of 2018; $1.82 per
share during each of the first three quarters of 2017 and $2.00 per share during the fourth quarter of 2017; and $1.65 per share during each of the first three
quarters of 2016 and $1.82 per share during the fourth quarter of 2016.
We paid $1.5 billion, $2.0 billion and $2.1 billion to repurchase 4.7 million, 7.1 million and 8.9 million shares of our common stock during 2018, 2017
and 2016.

Capital Structure, Resources and Other
At December 31, 2018, we held cash and cash equivalents of $772 million that was generally available to fund ordinary business operations without
significant legal, regulatory, or other restrictions.
Our outstanding debt, net of unamortized discounts and issuance costs, amounted to $14.1 billion at December 31, 2018 and is mainly in the form of
publicly-issued notes that bear interest at fixed rates. As of December 31, 2018, we had $1.5 billion of short-term borrowings due within one year, of which
approximately $900 million was composed of scheduled debt maturity due in November 2019 and approximately $600 million was composed of commercial
paper borrowings with a weighted-average rate of 2.89%. During 2017, we borrowed and fully repaid amounts under our commercial paper programs. There
were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants contained
in our debt and credit agreements.
We actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable. We
review changes in financial market and economic conditions to manage the types, amounts and maturities of our indebtedness. We may at times refinance
existing indebtedness, vary our mix of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs.
On occasion, our customers may seek deferred payment terms to purchase our products. In connection with these transactions, we may, at our customer’s
request, enter into arrangements for the non-recourse sale of customer receivables to unrelated third–party financial institutions. For accounting purposes,
these transactions are not discounted and are treated as a sale of receivables as we have no continuing involvement. The sale proceeds from the financial
institutions are reflected in our operating cash flows on the statement of cash flows. We sold approximately $532 million in 2018 and $698 million in 2017 of
customer receivables. There were no gains or losses related to sales of these receivables.
Revolving Credit Facilities
On August 24, 2018, we entered into a new $2.5 billion revolving credit facility (the 5-year Facility) with various banks and concurrently terminated our
existing $2.5 billion revolving credit facility. The 5‑year Facility has an expiration date of August 24, 2023 and is available for general corporate purposes.
The undrawn portion of the 5-year Facility is also available to serve as a backup facility for the issuance of commercial paper. We may request and the banks
may grant, at their discretion, an increase in the borrowing capacity under the 5-year Facility of up to an additional $500 million. There were no borrowings
outstanding under the 5-year Facility as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.
Borrowings under the 5-year Facility are unsecured and bear interest at rates based, at our option, on a Eurodollar Rate or a Base Rate, as defined in the
5-year Facility’s agreement. Each bank’s obligation to make loans under the 5-year Facility is subject to, among other things, our compliance with various
representations, warranties, and covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to encumber assets and a covenant
not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the 5‑year Facility agreement.
Long-Term Debt
In November 2018, we repaid $750 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 1.85% according to their scheduled maturities.
In September 2017, we issued notes totaling approximately $1.6 billion with a fixed interest rate of 4.09% maturing in September 2052 (the New Notes)
in exchange for outstanding notes totaling approximately $1.4 billion with fixed interest rates ranging from 4.70% to 8.50% maturing 2029 to 2046 (the Old
Notes). In connection with the exchange of principal, we paid a premium of $237 million, substantially all of which was in the form of New Notes. This
premium will be amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the New Notes using the effective interest method. We may, at our option, redeem
some or all of the New Notes at any time by paying the principal amount of notes being redeemed plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid
interest. Interest on the New Notes is payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year and began on March 15, 2018. The New Notes are unsecured
senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
In September 2016, we repaid $500 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 2.13% according to their scheduled maturities. In May 2016,
we repaid $452 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 7.65% according to their scheduled maturities. We also had related variable interest rate
swaps with a notional amount of $450 million mature, which did not have a significant impact on net earnings or comprehensive income.

We have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to provide for the issuance of
an indeterminate amount of debt securities.
Total Equity
Our total equity was $1.4 billion at December 31, 2018 compared to a deficit of $776 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in equity was primarily
due to net earnings of $5.0 billion, recognition of previously deferred postretirement benefit plan amounts of $1.2 billion, and employee stock activity of
$406 million (including the impacts of stock option exercises, ESOP activity and stock-based compensation), partially offset by the annual December 31 re-
measurement adjustment related to our postretirement benefit plans of $501 million, the repurchase of 4.7 million common shares for $1.5 billion; and
dividends declared of $2.3 billion during the year.
As we repurchase our common shares, we reduce common stock for the $1 of par value of the shares repurchased, with the excess purchase price over
par value recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. If additional paid-in capital is reduced to zero, we record the remainder of the excess purchase
price over par value as a reduction of retained earnings. Due to the volume of repurchases made under our share repurchase program, additional paid-in
capital was reduced to zero, with the remainder of the excess purchase price over par value of $1.1 billion recorded as a reduction of retained earnings in
2018.
Contractual Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
At December 31, 2018, we had contractual commitments to repay debt, make payments under operating leases, settle obligations related to agreements to
purchase goods and services and settle tax and other liabilities. Capital lease obligations were not material. Payments due under these obligations and
commitments are as follows (in millions):

Total contractual cash obligations  $ 80,525 $ 25,927$ 26,967$ 5,640$ 21,991
(a) Total debt includes scheduled principal payments and the repayment of commercial paper and excludes approximately $13 million of debt issued by a consolidated joint
venture as we do not guarantee the debt.
The table above excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for our qualified defined benefit pension plans. For additional information about our
future minimum contributions for these plans, see “Note 11 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Amounts related to other liabilities represent the contractual obligations for certain long-term liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2018. Such amounts
mainly include expected payments under non-qualified pension plans, environmental liabilities and deferred compensation plans.
Purchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or
nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages. Such agreements and contracts may, for example, be related
to direct materials, obligations to subcontractors and outsourcing arrangements. Total purchase obligations for operating activities in the preceding table
include approximately $45.9 billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our U.S. Government customers.
The U.S. Government generally would be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related
contracts “for convenience” under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), subject to available funding. This also would be true in cases where we perform
subcontract work for a prime contractor under a U.S. Government contract. The termination for convenience language also may be included in contracts with
foreign, state and local governments. We also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions, including contracts
with commercial customers.
Purchase obligations in the preceding table for capital expenditures generally include facilities infrastructure, equipment and information technology.

We also may enter into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products
and services from certain customers in foreign countries. These agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign
country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use
cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in-country projects and the purchase by third parties (e.g.,
our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies
from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, establishment of ventures with local companies and building or leasing facilities
for in-country operations. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately
applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the
original amount in the offset agreement. Satisfaction of our offset obligations are included in the estimates of our total costs to complete the contract and may
impact our sales, profitability and cash flows. Our ability to recover investments on our consolidated balance sheet that we make to satisfy offset obligations
is generally dependent upon the successful operation of ventures that we do not control and may involve products and services that are dissimilar to our
business activities. At December 31, 2018, the notional value of remaining obligations under our outstanding offset agreements totaled approximately $12.1
billion, which primarily relate to our Aeronautics, MFC and RMS business segments, most of which extend through 2044. To the extent we have entered into
purchase or other obligations at December 31, 2018 that also satisfy offset agreements, those amounts are included in the preceding table. Offset programs
usually extend over several years and may provide for penalties, estimated at approximately $1.5 billion at December 31, 2018, in the event we fail to perform
in accordance with offset requirements. While historically we have not been required to pay material penalties, resolution of offset requirements are often the
result of negotiations and subjective judgments.
In connection with our 50% ownership interest of ULA, we and The Boeing Company (Boeing) were previously required to provide ULA an additional
capital contribution if ULA was unable to make required payments under its inventory supply agreement with Boeing. In the fourth quarter of 2018, ULA
fully satisfied its obligations under this inventory supply agreement and we no longer have any obligation to provide ULA an additional capital contribution
under this agreement.
We have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds issued on our behalf by financial institutions, and directly issued guarantees to third
parties primarily relating to advances received from customers and the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts. Letters of credit and surety bonds
generally are available for draw down in the event we do not perform. In some cases, we may guarantee the contractual performance of third parties such as
venture partners. At December 31, 2018, we had the following outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and third-party guarantees (in millions):

and 5” category are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation.
At December 31, 2018, third-party guarantees totaled $850 million, of which approximately 65% related to guarantees of contractual performance of
ventures to which we currently are or previously were a party. This amount represents our estimate of the maximum amount we would expect to incur upon
the contractual non-performance of the venture, venture partners or divested businesses. Generally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable
us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a venture partner.
In determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current
and former venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements all of which include a guarantee as required by the FAR. There were no material
amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.

Critical Accounting Policies
Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition
The majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government and international customers (including foreign military
sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) for the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced
technology systems, products and services. We provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.
Under fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates
upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixed-price contracts have a performance-based
component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance.
Cost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on
the amount that has been funded. Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-
plus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer’s assessment of our
performance against a predetermined set of criteria, such as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts
provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e.,
incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e., incentive based on performance). The fixed-
fee in a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed-fee does not vary with actual costs.
We account for a contract after it has been approved by all parties to the arrangement, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are
identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.
We assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts. When making this determination, we consider
factors such as whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same time or were negotiated with an overall profit objective. If
combined, we treat the combined contracts as a single contract for revenue recognition purposes.
We evaluate the products or services promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for as having one or
more performance obligations. The products and services in our contracts are typically not distinct from one another due to their complex relationships and
the significant contract management functions required to perform under the contract. Accordingly, our contracts are typically accounted for as one
performance obligation. In limited cases, our contracts have more than one distinct performance obligation, which occurs when we perform activities that are
not highly complex or interrelated or involve different product lifecycles. Significant judgment is required in determining performance obligations, and these
decisions could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period. We classify net sales as products or services on our consolidated
statements of earnings based on the predominant attributes of the performance obligations.
We determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the products or services being provided under
the contract. For contracts where a portion of the price may vary we estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount, which is included in the
transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. We analyze the risk of a significant
revenue reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk.
At the inception of a contract we estimate the transaction price based on our current rights and do not contemplate future modifications (including
unexercised options) or follow-on contracts until they become legally enforceable. Contracts are often subsequently modified to include changes in
specifications, requirements or price, which may create new or change existing enforceable rights and obligations. Depending on the nature of the
modification, we consider whether to account for the modification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a separate contract. Generally, modifications
to our contracts are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration and interrelated tasks provided in the context of the contract.
Therefore, such modifications are accounted for as if they were part of the existing contract and recognized as a cumulative adjustment to revenue.
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated standalone
selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation. The standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell the product
or service to a customer on a standalone basis (i.e., not bundled with any other products or services). Our contracts with the U.S. Government, including FMS
contracts, are subject to the Federal Acquisition
48
Table of Contents
Regulations (FAR) and the price is typically based on estimated or actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. As a result of these regulations, the standalone
selling price of products or services in our contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts are typically equal to the selling price stated in the contract.
For non-U.S. Government contracts with multiple performance obligations, we evaluate whether the stated selling prices for the products or services
represent their standalone selling prices. We primarily sell customized solutions unique to a customer’s specifications. When it is necessary to allocate the
transaction price to multiple performance obligations, we typically use the expected cost plus a reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling
price of each product or service. We occasionally sell standard products or services with observable standalone sales transactions. In these situations, the
observable standalone sales transactions are used to determine the standalone selling price.
We recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. In determining when
performance obligations are satisfied, we consider factors such as contract terms, payment terms and whether there is an alternative future use of the product
or service. Substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers
continuously to the customer. For contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts, this continuous transfer of control of the work in process to the
customer is supported by clauses in the contract that allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay us for costs incurred plus a
reasonable profit, and take possession of any work in process. Our non-U.S. Government contracts, primarily international direct commercial contracts,
typically do not include termination for convenience provisions. However, continuous transfer of control to our customer is supported and, if our customer
were to terminate the contract for reasons other than our non-performance, we would have the right to recover damages which would include, among other
potential damages, the right to payment for our work performed to date plus a reasonable profit to deliver products or services that do not have an alternative
use to us.
For performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of
progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts
because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of
progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the
performance obligation(s). For performance obligations to provide services to the customer, revenue is recognized over time based on costs incurred or the
right to invoice method (in situations where the value transferred matches our billing rights) as our customer receives and consumes the benefits.
For performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each
performance obligation is fully satisfied. This coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service, which typically occurs
upon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service, given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point.
Significant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales and costs, including the profit booking rate. At the outset of a long-term
contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, as well as variable consideration, and
assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of sales and total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a
newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material,
labor, subcontractor, overhead, general and administrative and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as
offset or localization agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers
risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit
booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the
contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract or may increase the variable consideration we expect to receive on the contract.
Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase or our estimates of variable consideration we
expect to receive decrease. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. When
estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract
level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.
Comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates
on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure progress towards completion.
Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance
obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase
in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are
recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating
49
Table of Contents
profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the
positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets.
Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions, which are
excluded from segment operating results; reserves for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.
Other Contract Accounting Considerations
The majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S.
Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for
goods and services under U.S. Government contracts. For example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, interest expense and certain
advertising and public relations activities are unallowable and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into advance agreements
with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the
environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and
administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the U.S. Government.
We closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. Costs incurred and
allocated to contracts are reviewed for compliance with U.S. Government regulations by our personnel and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit
Agency.
Postretirement Benefit Plans
Overview
Many of our employees participate in qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical and life insurance plans and other
postemployment plans (collectively, postretirement benefit plans - see “Note 11 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements). The majority of our accrued benefit obligations relate to our qualified defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life
insurance plans. We recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the net funded status of these postretirement benefit plans under GAAP as either an asset or a liability
on our consolidated balance sheets. The GAAP funded status represents the difference between the fair value of each plan’s assets and the benefit obligation
of the plan. The GAAP benefit obligation represents the present value of the estimated future benefits we currently expect to pay to plan participants based on
past service.
In June 2014, we amended certain of our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for non-union employees, comprising the majority of
our benefit obligations, to freeze future retirement benefits. The calculation of retirement benefits under the affected defined benefit pension plans is
determined by a formula that takes into account the participants’ years of credited service and average compensation. The freeze takes effect in two stages. On
January 1, 2016, the pay-based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefits was frozen so that future pay increases, annual incentive
bonuses or other amounts earned for or related to periods after December 31, 2015 are not used to calculate retirement benefits. On January 1, 2020, the
service-based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefits will also be frozen so that participants will no longer earn further credited
service for any period after December 31, 2019. When the freeze is complete, the majority of our salaried employees will have transitioned to an enhanced
defined contribution retirement savings plan.
Additionally, in recent years we have taken other actions to mitigate the effect of our defined benefit pension plan on our financial results. For example,
in December 2018, a Lockheed Martin qualified defined benefit pension plan purchased two contracts from insurance companies covering $2.6 billion of our
outstanding defined benefit pension obligations.
First, in December 2018, an upfront cash payment of $810 million was made to an insurance company in exchange for a contract (referred to as a buy-in
contract) that will reimburse the plan for all future benefit payments related to $770 million of the plan’s outstanding defined benefit pension obligations for
approximately 9,000 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries. On December 31, 2018, the approximately 9,000 retirees and beneficiaries and the buy-in contract were
spun-off to another plan, with the buy-in contract the sole asset of that plan. Under the arrangement, the plan remains responsible for paying the benefits for
the covered retirees and beneficiaries and the insurance company will reimburse the plan as those benefits are paid. As a result, there is no net ongoing cash
flow to the plan for the covered retirees and beneficiaries as the cost of providing the benefits is funded by the buy-in contract, effectively locking in the cost
of the benefits and eliminating future volatility of the benefit obligation. The buy-in contract was purchased using assets from the pension trust and is
accounted for at fair value as an investment of the trust. This transaction had no impact on our 2018 FAS pension expense or CAS pension cost. The
difference of approximately $40 million between the amount paid to the insurance company and the amount of the pension obligations funded by the buy-in
contract was recognized through the re-measurement of the related benefit obligations in other comprehensive loss in equity and will be amortized
50
Table of Contents
to FAS pension expense in future periods. We intend to begin the termination process for this plan during 2019, and at conclusion convert the buy-in contract
to a buy-out contract, thus relieving us of liability for the pension obligations related to the covered population. The buy-out conversion, expected to occur as
early as 2020, will require recognition of a settlement loss in earnings at that time, which we currently estimate will be approximately $350 million. A
subsequent cash recovery is anticipated from the U.S. Government.
Also, during December 2018, we purchased an irrevocable group annuity contract from an insurance company (referred to as a buy-out contract) for
$1.82 billion to settle $1.76 billion of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations related to certain U.S. retirees and beneficiaries. The group annuity
contract was purchased using assets from the pension trust. As a result of this transaction, we were relieved of all responsibility for these pension obligations
and the insurance company is now required to pay and administer the retirement benefits owed to approximately 32,000 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries, with
no change to the amount, timing or form of monthly retirement benefit payments. Although the transaction was treated as a settlement for accounting
purposes, we did not recognize a loss on the settlement in earnings associated with the transaction because total settlements during 2018 for this plan were
less than this plan’s service and interest cost in 2018. Accordingly, the transaction had no impact on our 2018 FAS pension expense or CAS pension cost, and
the difference of approximately $60 million between the amount paid to the insurance company and the amount of the pension obligations settled was
recognized in other comprehensive loss and will be amortized to FAS pension expense in future periods.
Notwithstanding these actions, the impact of these plans and benefits on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record and the
funded status for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because those calculations are sensitive to funding levels as well as
changes in several key economic assumptions, including interest rates, actual rates of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including
participant longevity and employee turnover, as well as the timing of cash funding.
Actuarial Assumptions
The plan assets and benefit obligations are measured at the end of each year or more frequently, upon the occurrence of certain events such as a
significant plan amendment, settlement or curtailment. The amounts we record are measured using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon key
assumptions such as discount rates, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, participant longevity, employee turnover and the health care cost
trend rates for our retiree medical plans. The assumptions we make affect both the calculation of the benefit obligations as of the measurement date and the
calculation of net periodic benefit cost in subsequent periods. When reassessing these assumptions we consider past and current market conditions and make
judgments about future market trends. We also consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to
plan participants.
We continue to use a single weighted average discount rate approach when calculating our consolidated benefit obligations related to our defined benefit
pension plans resulting in 4.250% at December 31, 2018, compared to 3.625% at December 31, 2017 and 4.125% at December 31, 2016. We utilized a single
weighted average discount rate of 4.250% when calculating our benefit obligations related to our retiree medical and life insurance plans at December 31,
2018, compared to 3.625% at December 31, 2017 and 4.00% at December 31, 2016. We evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate single
weighted average discount rate, including results from cash flow models, quoted rates from long-term bond indices and changes in long-term bond rates over
the past year. As part of our evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on corporate bonds rated AA or better selected to match our projected
postretirement benefit plan cash flows.
We utilized an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.00% at December 31, 2018 compared to 7.50% for both December 31, 2017 and
December 31, 2016. The long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected long-term rate of return on the funds invested or to be invested, to
provide for the benefits included in the benefit obligations. This assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the
anticipated long-term allocation of plan assets, the historical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses and the potential to outperform market index
returns. The difference between the long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption we select and the actual return on plan assets in any given year affects
both the funded status of our benefit plans and the calculation of FAS pension expense in subsequent periods. Although the actual return in any specific year
likely will differ from the assumption, the average expected return over a long-term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption. Any
variance in a given year should not, by itself, suggest that the assumption should be changed. Patterns of variances are reviewed over time, and then combined
with expectations for the future. As a result, changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate.
In both October 2018 and 2017, the Society of Actuaries published revised longevity assumptions that refined its prior studies. We used the revised
assumptions indicating a shortened longevity in our December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 re-measurements of benefit obligation. The publications
were a refinement to assumptions the Society of Actuaries published in previous years, beginning in 2014.

Our stockholders’ equity has been reduced cumulatively by $14.3 billion from the annual year-end measurements of the funded status of postretirement
benefit plans. The cumulative non-cash, after-tax reduction primarily represents net actuarial losses resulting from declines in discount rates, investment
losses and updated longevity. A market-related value of our plan assets, determined using actual asset gains or losses over the prior three year period, is used
to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. These cumulative actuarial losses will be amortized to expense using the corridor
method, where gains and losses are recognized to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of plan assets or benefit obligations, over the average future
service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans of approximately nine years as of December 31, 2018. This amortization period is
expected to extend (approximately double) in 2020 when our non-union pension plans are completely frozen to use the average remaining life expectancy of
the participants instead of average future service. During 2018, $1.2 billion of these amounts was recognized as a component of postretirement benefit plans
expense and about $908 million is expected to be recognized as expense in 2019.
The discount rate and long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions we select at the end of each year are based on our best estimates and judgment.
A change of plus or minus 25 basis points in the 4.250% discount rate assumption at December 31, 2018, with all other assumptions held constant, would
have decreased or increased the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of 2018 by approximately $1.4 billion, which
would result in an after-tax increase or decrease in stockholders’ equity at the end of the year of approximately $1.1 billion. If the 4.250% discount rate at
December 31, 2018 that was used to compute the expected 2019 FAS pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis
points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of FAS pension expense projected for 2019 would be lower or higher by
approximately $120 million. If the 7.00% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption at December 31, 2018 that was used to compute the
expected 2019 FAS pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held
constant, the amount of FAS pension expense projected for 2019 would be lower or higher by approximately $85 million. Each year, differences between the
actual plan asset return and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets impacts the measurement of the following year’s FAS expense. Every 100
basis points difference in return during 2018 between our negative actual rate of return of approximately 5.00% and our expected long-term rate of return of
7.50% impacted 2019 expected FAS pension expense by approximately $20 million.
Funding Considerations
We made contributions of $5.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2018. There were no material contributions to our qualified
defined benefit pension plans in 2017 and 2016. Funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in a manner consistent with CAS and in
accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA).
Contributions to our defined benefit pension plans are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government
contracts, including FMS, and are recognized in our cost of sales and net sales. CAS govern the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and
recoverable under contracts with the U.S. Government, including FMS. We recovered $2.4 billion in 2018, $2.2 billion in 2017, and $2.0 billion in 2016 as
CAS pension costs. Effective February 27, 2012 and fully transitioned to in 2017, the CAS rules were revised to better align the recovery of pension costs,
including prepayment credits, on U.S. Government contracts with the minimum funding requirements of the PPA (referred to as CAS Harmonization).
Pension cost recoveries under CAS occur in different periods from when pension contributions are made under the PPA. Amounts contributed in excess
of the CAS pension costs recovered under U.S. Government contracts are considered to be prepayment credits under the CAS rules. As of December 31,
2018, our prepayment credits were approximately $8.5 billion as compared to $6.3 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase was due to our cash
contributions of $5.0 billion in 2018 compared to our $2.4 billion in CAS recoveries. Cash contributions in excess of the recovery of CAS pension costs under
U.S. Government contracts increases the prepayment credit balance. The prepayment credit balance will also increase or decrease based on our actual
investment return on plan assets.
Trends
We made contributions of $5.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2018, including required and discretionary contributions. As a
result of these contributions, we do not expect to make contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2019. We anticipate recovering
approximately $2.6 billion of CAS pension cost in 2019 allowing us to recuperate a portion of our CAS prepayment credits.
We expect our 2019 FAS pension expense to be $1.1 billion; compared to our 2018 FAS pension expense of $1.4 billion. The impact of the higher FAS
discount rate of 4.25% for 2019 versus 3.625% for 2018 was partly offset by our negative actual rate of investment return in 2018 of approximately 5.00%
versus our expected long-term rate of return of 7.50%. We expect a FAS/CAS
52
Table of Contents
pension benefit in 2019 of about $1.5 billion, as compared to $1.0 billion in 2018, due to the lower 2019 FAS pension expense and higher 2019 CAS pension
cost as compared to 2018.
Environmental Matters
We are a party to various agreements, proceedings and potential proceedings for environmental remediation issues, including matters at various sites
where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP). At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the total amount of liabilities recorded on our
consolidated balance sheet for environmental matters was $864 million and $920 million. We have recorded receivables totaling $750 million and $799
million at December 31, 2018 and 2017 for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services for
agencies of the U.S. Government, as discussed below. The amount that is expected to be allocated to our non-U.S. Government contracts or that is determined
to not be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts has been expensed through cost of sales. We project costs and recovery of costs over approximately
20 years.
We enter into agreements (e.g., administrative consent orders, consent decrees) that document the extent and timing of some of our environmental
remediation obligations. We also are involved in environmental remediation activities at sites where formal agreements either do not exist or do not quantify
the extent and timing of our obligations. Environmental remediation activities usually span many years, which makes estimating the costs more judgmental
due to, for example, changing remediation technologies. To determine the costs related to clean up sites, we have to assess the extent of contamination, effects
on natural resources, the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation, and evolving environmental standards.
We perform quarterly reviews of environmental remediation sites and record liabilities and receivables in the period it becomes probable that a liability
has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated (see the discussion under “Environmental Matters” in “Note 1 – Significant Accounting
Policies” and “Note 14 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We consider the
above factors in our quarterly estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for environmental remediation activities, which
results in the calculation of a range of estimates for a particular environmental remediation site. We do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and
timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. Given the required level of judgment and estimation, it is likely that materially
different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change (e.g., a change in environmental standards or a
change in our estimate of the extent of contamination).
Under agreements reached with the U.S. Government, most of the amounts we spend for environmental remediation are allocated to our operations as
general and administrative costs. Under existing U.S. Government regulations, these and other environmental expenditures relating to our U.S. Government
business, after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other PRPs, are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services. As a result,
most of the expenditures we incur are included in our net sales and cost of sales according to U.S. Government agreement or regulation, regardless of the
contract form (e.g. cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). We continually evaluate the recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing, among other
factors, U.S. Government regulations, our U.S. Government business base and contract mix, our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs, and recent
efforts by some U.S. Government representatives to limit such reimbursement.
In addition to the proceedings and potential proceedings discussed above, California previously established a maximum level of the contaminant
hexavalent chromium in drinking water of 10 parts per billion (ppb). This standard was successfully challenged by the California Manufacturers and
Technology Association (CMTA) for failure to conduct the required economic feasibility analysis. In response to the court’s ruling, the State Water Resources
Control Board (State Board), a branch of the California Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew the hexavalent chromium standard from the published
regulations, leaving only the 50 ppb standard for total chromium. The State Board has indicated it will work to re-establish a hexavalent chromium standard.
If the standard for hexavalent chromium is re‑established at 10 ppb or above, it will not have a material impact on our existing environmental remediation
costs in California. Further, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) is considering whether to regulate hexavalent chromium.
California is also reevaluating its existing drinking water standard of 6 ppb for perchlorate, and the U.S. EPA is taking steps to regulate perchlorate in
drinking water. If substantially lower standards are adopted, in either California or at the federal level for perchlorate or for hexavalent chromium, we expect a
material increase in our estimates for environmental liabilities and the related assets for the portion of the increased costs that are probable of future recovery
in the pricing of our products and services for the U.S. Government. The amount that would be allocable to our non-U.S. Government contracts or that is
determined not to be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts would be expensed, which may have a material effect on our earnings in any particular
interim reporting period.
As disclosed above, we may record changes in the amount of environmental remediation liabilities as a result of our quarterly reviews of the status of our
environmental remediation sites, which would result in a change to the corresponding environmental
53
Table of Contents
remediation receivables and a charge to earnings. For example, if we were to determine that the liabilities should be increased by $100 million, the
corresponding receivables would be increased by approximately $87 million, with the remainder recorded as a charge to earnings. This allocation is
determined annually, based upon our existing and projected business activities with the U.S. Government.
We cannot reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental remediation sites with which we are involved. There are a
number of former operating facilities we are monitoring or investigating for potential future environmental remediation. In some cases, although a loss may
be probable, it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activities because of uncertainties (e.g.,
assessing the extent of the contamination). During any particular quarter, such uncertainties may be resolved, allowing us to estimate and recognize the initial
liability to remediate a particular former operating site. The amount of the liability could be material. Upon recognition of the liability, a portion will be
recognized as a receivable with the remainder charged to earnings, which may have a material effect in any particular interim reporting period.
If we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a PRP, we expect that the actual costs of environmental
remediation will be shared with other liable PRPs. Generally, PRPs that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site
remediation and usually agree among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for environmental investigation and remediation.
Under existing environmental laws, responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and, therefore, we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such
remediation. In the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue
rights of cost recovery or contribution from the other PRPs. The amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental
costs we have incurred through insurance or from other PRPs, which we are required to pursue by agreement and U.S. Government regulation.
Goodwill
The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of
acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses.
Our goodwill balance was $10.8 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. We perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth
quarter or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Such events or changes in
circumstances may include a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate of our industry, a decline in our market
capitalization, operating performance indicators, competition, reorganizations of our business, U.S. Government budget restrictions or the disposal of all or a
portion of a reporting unit. Our goodwill has been allocated to and is tested for impairment at a level referred to as the reporting unit, which is our business
segment level or a level below the business segment. The level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires us to determine whether the operations
below the business segment constitute a self-sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly
reviews the operating results.
We may use both qualitative and quantitative approaches when testing goodwill for impairment. For selected reporting units where we use the qualitative
approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment.
Based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further
evaluation is necessary. Otherwise we perform a quantitative impairment test. We perform quantitative tests for most reporting units at least once every three
years. However, for certain reporting units we may perform a quantitative impairment test every year.
To perform the quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a
reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds
its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a
combination of a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values and
values observed in recent business acquisitions. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including the amount and timing of
expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and relevant transaction
multiples. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are based on our best estimate of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering factors such
as general market conditions, U.S. Government budgets, existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, changes in
working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. The discount rates utilized in the DCF analysis are based on the respective
reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure (equity and debt) and
represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent
54
Table of Contents
in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. The carrying value of each reporting unit includes the assets and liabilities employed in its operations,
goodwill and allocations of amounts held at the business segment and corporate levels.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units. The results of that test indicated that for
each of our reporting units, including Sikorsky, no impairment existed. As of the date of our annual impairment test, the carrying value of our Sikorsky
reporting unit includes goodwill of $2.7 billion and exceeds its fair value by a margin of approximately 20%. The carrying value and fair value of our
Sikorsky reporting unit is closely aligned. Therefore, any business deterioration, changes in timing of orders, contract cancellations or terminations, or
negative changes in market factors could cause our sales, earnings and cash flows to decline below current projections. Similarly, market factors utilized in
the impairment analysis, including long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and transaction
multiples, could negatively impact the fair value of our reporting units. Based on our assessment of these circumstances, we have determined that goodwill at
our Sikorsky reporting unit is at risk for impairment should there be deterioration of projected cash flows, negative changes in market factors or a significant
increase in the carrying value of the reporting unit.
Impairment assessments inherently involve management judgments regarding a number of assumptions such as those described above. Due to the many
variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions could have a
material effect on the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets from acquired businesses are recognized at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition and consist of customer programs,
trademarks, customer relationships, technology and other intangible assets. Customer programs include values assigned to major programs of acquired
businesses and represent the aggregate value associated with the customer relationships, contracts, technology and trademarks underlying the associated
program and are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value, which ranges from nine to 20 years.
Acquired intangibles deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment testing. This testing compares carrying value to
fair value and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. Finite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over the
applicable useful lives, ranging from three to 20 years, based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit as reflected by future
net cash inflows. We perform an impairment test of finite-lived intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may be
impaired. Should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a finite-lived intangible may be impaired, the sum of the undiscounted
future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group would be compared to the asset group’s carrying value. Should the asset group’s carrying
amount exceed the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, we would determine the fair value of the asset group and record an impairment loss in net
earnings.
The carrying value of our Sikorsky business includes an indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset of $887 million as of December 31, 2018. In the
fourth quarter of 2018, we performed the annual impairment test for the Sikorsky indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset and the results indicated that no
impairment existed. As of the date of our annual impairment test, the Sikorsky trademark exceeded its carrying value by a margin of approximately 5%.
Additionally, our Sikorsky business has finite-lived customer program intangible assets with carrying values of $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2018. Any
business deterioration, contract cancellations or terminations, or negative changes in market factors could cause our sales to decline below current projections.
Based on our assessment of these circumstances, we have determined that our Sikorsky intangible assets are at risk for impairment should there be any
business deterioration, contract cancellations or terminations, or negative changes in market factors.

ITEM  7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We maintain active relationships with a broad and diverse group of U.S. and international financial institutions. We believe that they provide us with
sufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct our business. We continue to closely monitor the financial market environment and
actively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse developments with any single credit provider while ensuring
availability of, and access to, sufficient credit resources.
Our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market prices on certain equity securities. Our financial
instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate long-term debt and commercial paper. The estimated fair value of our
outstanding debt was $15.4 billion at December 31, 2018 and the outstanding principal amount was $15.3 billion, excluding unamortized discounts and
issuance costs of $1.2 billion. A 10% change in the level of interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt at
December 31, 2018.
We use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We
do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. We transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with
changing foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign
currency exchange rates change. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the British pound sterling, the euro, the Canadian dollar and the
Australian dollar. These contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated
with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As a result, we do not have material foreign currency exposure, including exposure to the pound sterling or
euro should there be material foreign currency fluctuations due to the United Kingdom departing from the European Union (commonly referred to as Brexit).
We designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. We also are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing
activities. For fixed rate borrowings, we may use variable interest rate swaps, effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings indexed
to LIBOR in order to reduce the amount of interest paid. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges. For variable rate borrowings, we may use fixed
interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on
earnings. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. We also may enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify
for hedge accounting, which are intended to mitigate certain economic exposures.
The classification of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and its
resulting designation. Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to the effective portion of hedges are either reflected in earnings
and largely offset by corresponding adjustments to the hedged items or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the
hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are attributable to the ineffective portion of the hedges, or of
derivatives that are not considered to be highly effective hedges, if any, are immediately recognized in earnings. The aggregate notional amount of our
outstanding interest rate swaps at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign
currency hedges at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $3.5 billion and $4.1 billion. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the net fair value of our derivative
instruments was not material (see “Note 16 – Fair Value Measurements” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). A 10% unfavorable
exchange rate movement of our foreign currency contracts would not have a material impact on the aggregate net fair value of such contracts or our
consolidated financial statements. Additionally, as we enter into foreign currency contract to hedge foreign currency exposure on underlying transactions we
believe that any movement on our foreign currency contracts would be offset by movement on the underlying transactions and, therefore, when taken together
do not create material risk.
We evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have acceptable
credit risk at the time the agreements are executed. Our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across several banks. We periodically
monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties. We do not hold or issue derivative
financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
We maintain a separate trust that includes investments to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2018,
investments in the trust totaled $1.3 billion and are reflected at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet in other noncurrent assets. The trust holds
investments in marketable equity securities and fixed-income securities that are exposed to price changes and changes in interest rates. A portion of the
liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans supported by the trust is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock and
certain market indices. Changes in the value of the liabilities have the effect of partially offsetting the impact of changes in the value of the trust. Both the
change in the fair value of the trust and the change in the value of the liabilities are recognized on our consolidated statements of earnings in other
unallocated, net and were not material for the year ended December 31, 2018.

fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Corporation at December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Corporation’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 8, 2019 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.
Adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation changed its method for accounting for revenue from contracts with
customers in the consolidated financial statements due to the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), as
amended, using the full retrospective adoption method.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the
Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to
those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also
included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies
Organization – We are a global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and
sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific,
logistics, system integration and cybersecurity services. We serve both U.S. and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil
and commercial applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government.
Basis of presentation – Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of subsidiaries we control and variable interest entities if we are the
primary beneficiary. We eliminate intercompany balances and transactions in consolidation. Our receivables, inventories, customer advances and amounts in
excess of costs incurred and certain amounts in other current liabilities primarily are attributable to long-term contracts or programs in progress for which the
related operating cycles are longer than one year. In accordance with industry practice, we include these items in current assets and current liabilities. Unless
otherwise noted, we present all per share amounts cited in these consolidated financial statements on a “per diluted share” basis. Certain prior period amounts
have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation. The discussion and presentation of the operating results of our business segments have been
impacted by the following recent events.
Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), as amended
(commonly referred to as ASC 606), which changed the way we recognize revenue for certain contracts and significantly expanded disclosures about revenue
recognition. In addition, effective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2017-07, Compensation-Retirement Benefits (715): Improving the Presentation of Net
Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, which changed the statement of earnings presentation of certain components of pension
and other postretirement benefit plan expense. The amounts for all periods presented in this Form 10-K have been adjusted to reflect these new methods of
accounting.
On August 16, 2016, we completed the divestiture of the Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS) business, which merged with a subsidiary of
Leidos Holdings, Inc. (Leidos) in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction. Accordingly, the operating results of the IS&GS business have been classified as
discontinued operations on our consolidated statements of earnings for all prior periods presented. However, the 2016 cash flows of the IS&GS business have
not been reclassified in our consolidated statements of cash flows as we retained the cash as part of the Transaction. See “Note 3 – Acquisition and
Divestitures” for additional information about the divestiture of the IS&GS business.
On August 24, 2016, we increased our ownership interest in the AWE Management Limited (AWE) joint venture, which operates the United Kingdom’s
nuclear deterrent program, from 33% to 51%. Consequently, we began consolidating AWE and our operating results include 100% of AWE’s sales and 51%
of its operating profit. Prior to increasing our ownership interest, we accounted for our investment in AWE using the equity method of accounting. Under the
equity method, we recognized only 33% of AWE’s earnings or losses and no sales. Accordingly, prior to August 24, 2016, the date we obtained control, we
recorded 33% of AWE’s net earnings in our operating results and subsequent to August 24, 2016, we recognized 100% of AWE’s sales and 51% of its
operating profit. See “Note 3 – Acquisition and Divestitures” for additional information about the change in ownership of AWE.
Use of estimates – We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In doing
so, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We
base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results
may differ materially from these estimates. Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include, but are not
limited to, accounting for sales and cost recognition, postretirement benefit plans, environmental receivables and liabilities, evaluation of goodwill and other
assets for impairment, income taxes including deferred income taxes, fair value measurements and contingencies.
Revenue Recognition – The majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government and international customers
(including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) for the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and
sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.
63
Table of Contents
Under fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates
upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixed-price contracts have a performance-based
component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance.
Cost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on
the amount that has been funded. Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-
plus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer’s assessment of our
performance against a predetermined set of criteria, such as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts
provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e.,
incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e., incentive based on performance). The fixed-
fee in a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed-fee does not vary with actual costs.
We account for a contract after it has been approved by all parties to the arrangement, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are
identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.
We assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts. When making this determination, we consider
factors such as whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same time or were negotiated with an overall profit objective. If
combined, we treat the combined contracts as a single contract for revenue recognition purposes.
We evaluate the products or services promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for as having one or
more performance obligations. The products and services in our contracts are typically not distinct from one another due to their complex relationships and
the significant contract management functions required to perform under the contract. Accordingly, our contracts are typically accounted for as one
performance obligation. In limited cases, our contracts have more than one distinct performance obligation, which occurs when we perform activities that are
not highly complex or interrelated or involve different product lifecycles. Significant judgment is required in determining performance obligations, and these
decisions could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period. We classify net sales as products or services on our consolidated
statements of earnings based on the predominant attributes of the performance obligations.
We determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the products or services being provided under
the contract. For contracts where a portion of the price may vary we estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount, which is included in the
transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. We analyze the risk of a significant
revenue reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk.
At the inception of a contract we estimate the transaction price based on our current rights and do not contemplate future modifications (including
unexercised options) or follow-on contracts until they become legally enforceable. Contracts are often subsequently modified to include changes in
specifications, requirements or price, which may create new or change existing enforceable rights and obligations. Depending on the nature of the
modification, we consider whether to account for the modification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a separate contract. Generally, modifications
to our contracts are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration and interrelated tasks provided in the context of the contract.
Therefore, such modifications are accounted for as if they were part of the existing contract and recognized as a cumulative adjustment to revenue.
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated standalone
selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation. The standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell the product
or service to a customer on a standalone basis (i.e., not bundled with any other products or services). Our contracts with the U.S. Government, including FMS
contracts, are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and the price is typically based on estimated or actual costs plus a reasonable profit
margin. As a result of these regulations, the standalone selling price of products or services in our contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts are
typically equal to the selling price stated in the contract.
For non-U.S. Government contracts with multiple performance obligations, we evaluate whether the stated selling prices for the products or services
represent their standalone selling prices. We primarily sell customized solutions unique to a customer’s specifications. When it is necessary to allocate the
transaction price to multiple performance obligations, we typically use the expected cost plus a reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling
price of each product or service. We occasionally
64
Table of Contents
sell standard products or services with observable standalone sales transactions. In these situations, the observable standalone sales transactions are used to
determine the standalone selling price.
We recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. In determining when
performance obligations are satisfied, we consider factors such as contract terms, payment terms and whether there is an alternative future use of the product
or service. Substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers
continuously to the customer. For contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts, this continuous transfer of control of the work in process to the
customer is supported by clauses in the contract that allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay us for costs incurred plus a
reasonable profit, and take possession of any work in process. Our non-U.S. Government contracts, primarily international direct commercial contracts,
typically do not include termination for convenience provisions. However, continuous transfer of control to our customer is supported and, if our customer
were to terminate the contract for reasons other than our non-performance, we would have the right to recover damages which would include, among other
potential damages, the right to payment for our work performed to date plus a reasonable profit to deliver products or services that do not have an alternative
use to us.
For performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of
progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts
because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of
progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the
performance obligation(s). For performance obligations to provide services to the customer, revenue is recognized over time based on costs incurred or the
right to invoice method (in situations where the value transferred matches our billing rights) as our customer receives and consumes the benefits.
For performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each
performance obligation is fully satisfied. This coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service, which typically occurs
upon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service, given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point.
Backlog (i.e., unfulfilled or remaining performance obligations) represents the sales we expect to recognize for our products and services for which
control has not yet transferred to the customer. For our cost-reimbursable and fixed-priced-incentive contracts, the estimated consideration we expect to
receive pursuant to the terms of the contract may exceed the contractual award amount. The estimated consideration is determined at the outset of the contract
and is continuously reviewed throughout the contract period. In determining the estimated consideration, we consider the risks related to the technical,
schedule and cost impacts to complete the contract and an estimate of any variable consideration. Periodically, we review these risks and may increase or
decrease backlog accordingly. As the risks on such contracts are successfully retired, the estimated consideration from customers may be reduced, resulting in
a reduction of backlog without a corresponding recognition of sales. As of December 31, 2018, our ending backlog was $130.5 billion. We expect to
recognize approximately 38% of our backlog over the next 12 months and approximately 66% over the next 24 months as revenue, with the remainder
recognized thereafter.
For arrangements with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts, we generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the
customer. Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. Typical payment terms under
fixed-price contracts with the U.S. Government provide that the customer pays either performance-based payments (PBPs) based on the achievement of
contract milestones or progress payments based on a percentage of costs we incur. For the majority of our international direct commercial contracts to deliver
complex systems, we typically receive advance payments prior to commencement of work, as well as milestone payments that are paid in accordance with the
terms of our contract as we perform. We recognize a liability for payments in excess of revenue recognized, which is presented as a contract liability on the
balance sheet. The portion of payments retained by the customer until final contract settlement is not considered a significant financing component because
the intent is to protect the customer from our failure to adequately complete some or all of the obligations under the contract. Payments received from
customers in advance of revenue recognition are not considered to be significant financing components because they are used to meet working capital
demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract.
For fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts, we present revenues recognized in excess of billings as contract assets on the balance sheet. Amounts
billed and due from our customers under both contract types are classified as receivables on the balance sheet.
Significant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales and costs, including the profit booking rate. At the outset of a long-term
contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, as well as variable consideration, and
assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of sales and total costs to
65
Table of Contents
complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and
associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead, general and administrative and the
estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset or localization agreements, required under certain contracts
with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements,
schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we
successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract
or may increase the variable consideration we expect to receive on the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs
to complete the contract increase or our estimates of variable consideration we expect to receive decrease. All of the estimates are subject to change during
the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the
transaction price, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.
Comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates
on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure progress towards completion.
Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance
obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase
in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are
recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably
or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries
on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual
matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating results; reserves for disputes; certain asset
impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.
Our consolidated net adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other items, increased segment operating
profit by approximately $1.9 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.4 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016. These adjustments increased net earnings by approximately
$1.5 billion ($5.23 per share), $1.1 billion ($3.79 per share), and $910 million ($3.00 per share) in 2018, 2017 and 2016. We recognized net sales from
performance obligations satisfied in prior periods of approximately $2.0 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.4 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016, which primarily relate
to changes in profit booking rates that impacted revenue.
As previously disclosed, we have a program, EADGE-T, to design, integrate, and install an air missile defense command, control, communications,
computers – intelligence (C4I) system for an international customer that has experienced performance matters and for which we have periodically accrued
reserves. In 2017, we revised our estimated costs to complete the EADGE-T contract as a consequence of ongoing performance matters and recorded an
additional charge of $120 million ($74 million or $0.25 per share, after tax) at our Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) business segment, which resulted in
cumulative losses of approximately $260 million on this program. As of December 31, 2018, cumulative losses remained at approximately $260 million. We
continue to monitor program requirements and our performance. At this time, we do not anticipate additional charges that would be material to our operating
results or financial condition.
We have two commercial satellite programs, for the delivery of three satellites in total, to international customers at our Space business segment, for
which we have experienced performance issues related to the development and integration of a modernized LM 2100 satellite platform. These programs
require the development of new satellite technology to enhance the LM 2100’s power, propulsion and electronics, among other items. The enhanced LM 2100
satellite platform is expected to benefit other commercial and government satellite programs. We have periodically revised our estimated costs to complete
these developmental commercial programs. We have recorded cumulative losses of approximately $380 million through December 31, 2018. In 2018, we
recorded losses of approximately $75 million ($56 million, or $0.20 per share, after tax). While these losses reflect our estimated total losses on the programs,
we will continue to incur general and administrative costs each period until we complete these programs. These programs remain developmental and further
challenges in the delivery and integration of new satellite technology, anomalies discovered during system testing requiring repair or rework, further schedule
delays and potential penalties could require that we record additional loss reserves which could be material to our operating results. We previously disclosed
that, as we did not meet the July 2018 delivery requirement for two satellites, the customer could seek to exercise termination rights. One of the satellites has
now been launched, eliminating this risk. As the other is expected to launch in the first half of 2019, we believe it unlikely that the customer will seek to do
so. Were the customer to seek to exercise a termination right and be successful in this effort, we would have to refund the payments we have received and pay
certain penalties. On the third satellite, we currently anticipate delivery before the date upon which the customer could seek to exercise a termination right
although we may have to pay certain penalties and have sought to address this possibility in our reserves.

We are responsible for designing, developing and installing an upgraded turret for the Warrior Capability Sustainment Program. In 2018, we revised our
estimated costs to complete the program as a consequence of performance issues, and recorded a charge of approximately $85 million ($64 million, or $0.22
per share, after tax) at our Missiles and Fire Control (MFC) business segment, which resulted in cumulative losses of approximately $140 million on this
program as of December 31, 2018. We may continue to experience issues related to customer requirements and our performance under this contract and have
to record additional charges. However, based on the losses already recorded and our current estimate of the sales and costs to complete the program, at this
time we do not anticipate that additional losses, if any, would be material to our operating results or financial condition.
Research and development and similar costs – We conduct research and development (R&D) activities using our own funds (referred to as company-
funded R&D or independent research and development (IR&D)) and under contractual arrangements with our customers (referred to as customer-funded
R&D) to enhance existing products and services and to develop future technologies. R&D costs include basic research, applied research, concept formulation
studies, design, development, and related test activities. Company-funded R&D costs are allocated to customer contracts as part of the general and
administrative overhead costs and generally recoverable on our customer contracts with the U.S. Government. Customer-funded R&D costs are charged
directly to the related customer contract. Substantially all R&D costs are charged to cost of sales as incurred. Company-funded R&D costs charged to cost of
sales totaled $1.3 billion in 2018, $1.2 billion in 2017 and $988 million in 2016.
Stock-based compensation – Compensation cost related to all share-based payments is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of
the award. We generally recognize the compensation cost ratably over a three-year vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures. At each reporting date, the
number of shares is adjusted to the number ultimately expected to vest.
Income taxes – We calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as from operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using
enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid.
We periodically assess our tax exposures related to periods that are open to examination. Based on the latest available information, we evaluate our tax
positions to determine whether the position will more likely than not be sustained upon examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or other taxing
authorities. If we cannot reach a more-likely-than-not determination, no benefit is recorded. If we determine that the tax position is more likely than not to be
sustained, we record the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized when the tax position is settled. We record interest and penalties
related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense on our consolidated statements of earnings. Interest and penalties were not material.
Cash and cash equivalents – Cash equivalents include highly liquid instruments with original maturities of 90 days or less.
Receivables – Receivables, net represent our unconditional right to consideration under the contract and include amounts billed and currently due from
customers. The amounts are stated at their net estimated realizable value. There were no significant impairment losses related to our receivables in 2018,
2017, or 2016.
On occasion, our customers may seek deferred payment terms to purchase our products. In connection with these transactions, we may, at our customer’s
request, enter into arrangements for the non-recourse sale of customer receivables to unrelated third–party financial institutions. For accounting purposes,
these transactions are not discounted and are treated as a sale of receivables as we have no continuing involvement. The sale proceeds from the financial
institutions are reflected in our operating cash flows on the statement of cash flows. We sold approximately $532 million in 2018 and $698 million in 2017 of
customer receivables. There were no gains or losses related to sales of these receivables.
Contract assets – Contract assets include unbilled amounts typically resulting from sales under contracts when the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost
method of revenue recognition is utilized and revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer. The amounts may not exceed their estimated net
realizable value. Contract assets are classified as current based on our contract operating cycle.
Inventories – We record inventories at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the utility of
our inventories have diminished through damage, deterioration, obsolescence, changes in price or other causes, a loss is recognized in the period in which it
occurs. We capitalize labor, material, subcontractor and overhead costs as work-in-process for contracts where control has not yet passed to the customer. In
addition, we capitalize costs incurred to fulfill a contract in advance of contract award in inventories as work-in-process if we determine that contract award is
probable. We determine the costs of other product and supply inventories by using the first-in first-out or average cost methods.
67
Table of Contents
Contract liabilities – Contract liabilities (formerly referred to as customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred) include advance payments
and billings in excess of revenue recognized. Contract liabilities are classified as current based on our contract operating cycle and reported on a contract-by-
contract basis, net of revenue recognized, at the end of each reporting period.
Property, plant and equipment – We record property, plant and equipment at cost. We provide for depreciation and amortization on plant and
equipment generally using accelerated methods during the first half of the estimated useful lives of the assets and the straight-line method thereafter. The
estimated useful lives of our plant and equipment generally range from 10 to 40 years for buildings and five to 15 years for machinery and equipment. No
depreciation expense is recorded on construction in progress until such assets are placed into operation. Depreciation expense related to plant and equipment
was $759 million in 2018, $760 million in 2017, and $747 million in 2016.
We review the carrying amounts of long-lived assets for impairment if events or changes in the facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying
amounts may not be recoverable. We assess impairment by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the related asset grouping to its
carrying amount. If an asset is determined to be impaired, we recognize an impairment charge in the current period for the difference between the fair value of
the asset and its carrying amount.
Capitalized software – We capitalize certain costs associated with the development or purchase of internal-use software. The amounts capitalized are
included in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the resulting
software, which ranges from two to six years. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, capitalized software totaled $447 million and $424 million, net of
accumulated amortization of $2.1 billion and $2.0 billion. No amortization expense is recorded until the software is ready for its intended use. Amortization
expense related to capitalized software was $106 million in 2018, $123 million in 2017 and $136 million in 2016.
Goodwill – The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the
date of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses.
Our goodwill balance was $10.8 billion at both December 31, 2018 and 2017. We perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the
fourth quarter or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Such events or
changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate of our industry, a decline in
our market capitalization, operating performance indicators, competition, reorganizations of our business, U.S. Government budget restrictions or the disposal
of all or a portion of a reporting unit. Our goodwill has been allocated to and is tested for impairment at a level referred to as the reporting unit, which is our
business segment level or a level below the business segment. The level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires us to determine whether the
operations below the business segment constitute a self-sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management
regularly reviews the operating results.
We may use either a qualitative or quantitative approach when testing a reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment. For selected reporting units where we
use the qualitative approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of
goodwill impairment. Based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying
amount, no further evaluation is necessary. Otherwise we perform a quantitative impairment test. We perform quantitative tests for most reporting units at
least once every three years. However, for certain reporting units we may perform a quantitative impairment test every year.
For the quantitative impairment test we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting
unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair
value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a
combination of a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values and
values observed in recent business acquisitions. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including the amount and timing of
expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and relevant transaction
multiples. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are based on our best estimate of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering factors such
as general market conditions, U.S. Government budgets, existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, changes in
working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. The discount rates utilized in the DCF analysis are based on the respective
reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure (equity and debt) and
represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. The
carrying value of each reporting unit includes the assets and liabilities employed in its operations, goodwill and allocations of certain assets and liabilities held
at the business segment and corporate levels.

Table of Contents
During the fourth quarters of 2018, 2017 and 2016, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units. The results of our
annual impairment tests of goodwill indicated that no impairment existed.
Intangible assets – Intangible assets from acquired businesses are recognized at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition and consist of
customer programs, trademarks, customer relationships, technology and other intangible assets. Customer programs include values assigned to major
programs of acquired businesses and represent the aggregate value associated with the customer relationships, contracts, technology and trademarks
underlying the associated program and are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value, which
ranges from nine to 20 years. Acquired intangibles deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment testing. This
testing compares carrying value to fair value and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. Finite-lived intangibles are
amortized to expense over the applicable useful lives, ranging from three to 20 years, based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic
benefit as reflected by future net cash inflows. We perform an impairment test of finite-lived intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate their carrying value may be impaired.
Postretirement benefit plans – Many of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans and we provide certain health care and life
insurance benefits to eligible retirees (collectively, postretirement benefit plans). GAAP requires that the amounts we record related to our postretirement
benefit plans be computed, based on service to date, using actuarial valuations that are based in part on certain key economic assumptions we make, including
the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity (also known as
mortality), health care cost trend rates and employee turnover, each as appropriate based on the nature of the plans.
A market-related value of our plan assets, determined using actual asset gains or losses over the prior three year period, is used to calculate the amount of
deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. These asset gains or losses, along with those resulting from adjustments to our benefit obligation, will be
amortized to expense using the corridor method, where gains and losses are recognized to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of plan assets or benefit
obligations, over the average future service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans of approximately nine years as of December 31,
2018. This amortization period is expected to extend (approximately double) in 2020 when our non-union pension plan is frozen to use the average remaining
life expectancy of the participants instead of average future service.
We recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans under GAAP as either an asset recorded within other
noncurrent assets or a liability recorded within noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The GAAP funded status is measured as the
difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. The funded status under the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), is calculated on a different basis than under GAAP.
Environmental matters – We record a liability for environmental matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be
reasonably estimated. The amount of liability recorded is based on our estimate of the costs to be incurred for remediation at a particular site. We do not
discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. Our environmental
liabilities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets within other liabilities, both current and noncurrent. We expect to include a substantial portion of
environmental costs in our net sales and cost of sales in future periods pursuant to U.S. Government agreement or regulation. At the time a liability is
recorded for future environmental costs, we record a receivable for estimated future recovery considered probable through the pricing of products and
services to agencies of the U.S. Government, regardless of the contract form (e.g., cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). We continuously evaluate the
recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing, among other factors, U.S. Government regulations, our U.S. Government business base and
contract mix, our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs, and recent efforts by some U.S. Government representatives to limit such reimbursement.
We include the portion of those environmental costs expected to be allocated to our non-U.S. Government contracts, or that is determined to not be
recoverable under U.S. Government contracts, in our cost of sales at the time the liability is established. Our environmental receivables are recorded on our
consolidated balance sheets within other assets, both current and noncurrent. We project costs and recovery of costs over approximately 20 years.
Investments in marketable securities – Investments in marketable securities consist of debt and equity securities which are recorded at fair value. As of
December 31, 2018 and 2017, the fair value of our investments totaled $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion and was included in other noncurrent assets on our
consolidated balance sheets. Our investments are held in a separate trust, which includes investments to fund our deferred compensation plan liabilities. Net
losses on these securities were $67 million in 2018 compared to net gains on these securities of $150 million in 2017 and $66 million in 2016. Gains and
losses on these investments are included in other unallocated, net within cost of sales on our consolidated statements of earnings in order to align the
classification of changes in the market value of investments held for the plan with changes in the value of the corresponding plan liabilities.

Table of Contents
Equity method investments – Investments where we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but do not control, are accounted for under the
equity method of accounting and are included in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Significant influence typically exists if we have a
20% to 50% ownership interest in the investee. Under this method of accounting, our share of the net earnings or losses of the investee is included in
operating profit in other income, net on our consolidated statements of earnings since the activities of the investee are closely aligned with the operations of
the business segment holding the investment. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amounts of such investments may be impaired. If a decline in the value of an equity method investment is determined to be other
than temporary, a loss is recorded in earnings in the current period. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, our equity method investments totaled $1.2 billion
and $1.4 billion, which primarily are composed of our investment in the United Launch Alliance (ULA) joint venture, and the Advanced Military
Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul Center (AMMROC) joint venture. Our share of net earnings related to our equity method investees was $119 million in
2018, $207 million in 2017 and $443 million in 2016, of which approximately $210 million, $205 million and $325 million was included in our Space
business segment operating profit.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, equity earnings included a non-cash asset impairment charge of $110 million ($83 million, or $0.29 per share,
after tax) related to our equity method investee, AMMROC. During the year ended December 31, 2017, equity earnings included a charge recorded in the first
quarter of 2017 of approximately $64 million ($40 million, or $0.14 per share, after tax), which represented our portion of a non-cash asset impairment
related to certain long-lived assets held by AMMROC. We are continuing to monitor this investment in light of ongoing performance, business base and
economic issues and we may have to record our portion of additional charges, or an impairment of our investment, or both, should the carrying value of our
investment exceed its fair value. These charges could adversely affect our results of operations.
Derivative financial instruments – We use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency
exchange rates and interest rates. We do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. We transact business globally and are
subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that
change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change. These contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in
our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. We also
are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities. For fixed rate borrowings, we may use variable interest rate
swaps, effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings in order to reduce the amount of interest paid. These swaps are designated as
fair value hedges. For variable rate borrowings, we may use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings
in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on earnings. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. We also may enter into derivative
instruments that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting, which are intended to mitigate certain economic exposures.
We record derivatives at their fair value. The classification of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives is dependent on our
intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation. Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to the effective portion of
hedges are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustments to the hedged items or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated
other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are attributable to the
ineffective portion of the hedges or of derivatives that are not considered to be highly effective hedges, if any, are immediately recognized in earnings. The
aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion. The aggregate notional
amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $3.5 billion and $4.1 billion. The fair values of our outstanding
interest rate swaps and foreign currency hedges at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were not significant. Derivative instruments did not have a material impact
on net earnings and comprehensive income during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The impact of derivative instruments on our
consolidated statements of cash flows is included in net cash provided by operating activities. Substantially all of our derivatives are designated for hedge
accounting. See “Note 16 – Fair Value Measurements” for more information on the fair value measurements related to our derivative instruments.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606, which replaces existing revenue recognition guidance and outlines a single set of comprehensive
principles for recognizing revenue under GAAP. Among other things, ASC 606 requires entities to assess the products or services promised in contracts with
customers at contract inception to determine the appropriate unit at which to record revenues, which is referred to as a performance obligation. Revenue is
recognized when control of the promised products or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity
expects to be entitled to in
70
Table of Contents
exchange for those products or services. Prior to the adoption of ASC 606, we recognized the majority of our revenues using the percentage-of-completion
method of accounting. Based on the nature of products provided or services performed, revenue was recorded as costs were incurred (the percentage-of-
completion cost-to-cost method) or as units were delivered (the percentage-of-completion units-of-delivery method). For most of our contracts, the customer
obtains control or receives benefits as we perform on the contract. As a result, under ASC 606 revenue is recognized over time utilizing the percentage-of-
completion cost-to-cost method. This change generally results in an acceleration of revenue for contracts that were historically accounted for using the
percentage-of-completion units-of-delivery method as revenues are now recognized earlier in the performance period as we incur costs. For more information
on our policy for recognizing revenue under ASC 606, see “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” Significant programs impacted by these changes
include the C-130J and C-5 programs in our Aeronautics business segment; tactical missile programs (Hellfire and Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile
(JASSM)), Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3), and fire control programs (LANTIRN® and SNIPER®) in our MFC business segment; the Black Hawk®
and Seahawk® helicopter programs in our RMS business segment; and commercial satellite programs in our Space business segment.
We adopted ASC 606 using the full retrospective method, which means we applied the new standard to each prior year presented in our financial
statements going back to January 1, 2016, with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2016 for contracts that were in process at
that point in time. Accordingly, the amounts for all periods presented in this Form 10‑K have been adjusted to reflect the impacts of ASC 606.
Compensation-Retirement Benefits
Effective January 1, 2018, we also adopted ASU 2017-07, which changed the income statement presentation of certain components of net periodic
benefit cost related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. ASU 2017-07 requires entities to record only the service cost component
of FAS pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense in operating profit and the non-service cost components of FAS pension and other
postretirement benefit plan expense (i.e., interest cost, expected return on plan assets, net actuarial gains or losses, and amortization of prior service cost or
credits) as part of non-operating expense. Previously, we recorded all components of net periodic benefit cost in operating profit as part of cost of sales. We
adopted ASU 2017-07 using the retrospective method, which means we applied the new standard to each prior period presented in our financial statements
going back to January 1, 2016.

Effective January 1, 2018, we also adopted ASU 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain
Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which provides entities an option to reclassify certain tax effects as a result of the Tax Act from
accumulated other comprehensive income or loss to retained earnings. The adoption of ASU 2018-02 increased our AOCL at January 1, 2018 by $2.4 billion
with a corresponding increase to retained earnings by the same amount with zero impact to total equity. The reclassification was primarily related to the
impact of U.S. tax reform on deferred tax assets associated with net actuarial losses (and prior service credits) resulting from our defined benefit pension and
other postretirement benefit plans that were originally recorded in AOCL within equity. Those amounts were originally recorded net of deferred tax benefits
based on the federal statutory income tax rate in effect at the time they were recorded. GAAP requires entities to remeasure deferred tax assets and liabilities
as a result of a change in tax laws or rates, with the impacts reflected in earnings. Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we remeasured the deferred tax
assets associated with our AOCL using the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate under the Tax Act, with the impacts of the remeasurement recorded as a one-
time charge to earnings. Prior to ASU 2018-02, GAAP required the original deferred tax amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or
loss, to remain at the old tax rate despite the fact that its related deferred tax asset or liability was remeasured as a result of the Tax Act. ASU 2018-02 allows
entities to record a one-time reclassification of these tax effects between accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and retained earnings. We
reclassify the impact of the income tax effects of tax reform from AOCL in the period in which they occur.
Compensation—Retirement Benefits—Defined Benefit Plans—General
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, Compensation—Retirement Benefits—Defined Benefit Plans—General (Topic 715-20): Disclosure
Framework—Changes to the Disclosure Requirements For Defined Benefit Plans. The new standard modifies the disclosure requirements for employers that
sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans by removing and adding certain disclosures for these plans. The effective date is our fiscal year
ending December 31, 2020 with early adoption permitted and requires application on a retrospective basis. The adoption will not have a material effect on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements
Derivatives and Hedging
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), which eliminates the requirement to separately measure and
report hedge ineffectiveness. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We adopted the
new standard on January 1, 2019. We do not expect a significant impact to our consolidated assets and liabilities, net earnings, or cash flows as a result of
adopting this new standard.
Leases
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability on the
balance sheet for most lease arrangements and expands disclosures about leasing arrangements for both lessees and lessors, among other items. The new
standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, which makes the new standard effective for us on January 1, 2019. We may apply the
transition provisions of ASU 2016-02, as amended, either at the beginning of the earliest period presented in our fiscal year 2019 Form 10-K, which would be
January 1, 2017, or on the effective date of adoption, which would be January 1, 2019. Among other requirements, the transition provisions require the lessee
to recognize a right-of-use asset and liability for most existing lease arrangements on the date the transition provisions are applied. We have elected to apply
the transition provisions of this new standard on January 1, 2019. Therefore, periods prior to the effective date of adoption will continue to be reported using
current GAAP (ASC 840).
We commenced our evaluation of the impact of the new lease accounting standard in late 2016 by evaluating its impact on selected contracts. With this
baseline understanding, we developed a project plan to evaluate numerous contracts across our corporation, develop processes and tools to implement the new
standard and identify and design changes to internal controls by January 1, 2019. We have successfully identified and classified our lease population and we
continued to perform under this project plan through the end of 2018. The majority of our existing lease arrangements are classified as operating leases, which
will continue to be classified as operating under the new standard. Upon adoption of the new standard on January 1, 2019, we will record a right-of-use asset
and lease liability, both with an approximate balance of $1.1 billion, on our balance sheet for all of our lease arrangements. We do not anticipate that adoption
of the new standard will have a significant impact on our net earnings or cash flows.

Note 2 – Earnings Per Share
The weighted average number of shares outstanding used to compute earnings per common share were as follows (in millions):
  2018 2017 2016
Weighted average common shares outstanding for basic computations  284.5 287.8 299.3
Weighted average dilutive effect of equity awards  2.3 2.8 3.8
Weighted average common shares outstanding for diluted computations  286.8 290.6 303.1
We compute basic and diluted earnings per common share by dividing net earnings by the respective weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for the periods presented. Our calculation of diluted earnings per common share also includes the dilutive effects for the assumed vesting of
outstanding restricted stock units (RSUs), performance stock units (PSUs) and exercise of outstanding stock options based on the treasury stock method.
There were no significant anti-dilutive equity awards for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.
Note 3 – Acquisition and Divestitures
Consolidation of AWE Management Limited
On August 24, 2016, we increased our ownership interest in the AWE joint venture, which operates the United Kingdom’s nuclear deterrent program,
from 33% to 51%. Consequently, we began consolidating AWE and our operating results include 100% of AWE’s sales and 51% of its operating profit. Prior
to increasing our ownership interest, we accounted for our investment in AWE using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, we
recognized only 33% of AWE’s earnings or losses and no sales. Accordingly, prior to August 24, 2016, the date we obtained control, we recorded 33% of
AWE’s net earnings in our operating results and subsequent to August 24, 2016, we recognized 100% of AWE’s sales and 51% of its operating profit.
We accounted for this transaction as a “step acquisition” (as defined by U.S. GAAP), which requires us to consolidate and record the assets and liabilities
of AWE at fair value. Accordingly, we recorded intangible assets of $243 million related to customer relationships, $32 million of net liabilities, and
noncontrolling interests of $107 million. The intangible assets are being amortized over a period of eight years in accordance with the underlying pattern of
economic benefit reflected by the future net cash flows. In 2016, we recognized a non-cash net gain of $104 million associated with obtaining a controlling
interest in AWE, which consisted of a $127 million pretax gain recognized in the operating results of our Space business segment and $23 million of tax-
related items at our corporate office. The gain represented the fair value of our 51% interest in AWE, less the carrying value of our previously held investment
in AWE and deferred taxes. The gain was recorded in other income, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. The fair value of AWE (including the
intangible assets), our controlling interest, and the noncontrolling interests were determined using the income approach.
Divestiture of the Information Systems & Global Solutions Business
On August 16, 2016, we divested our former IS&GS business, which merged with Leidos, in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction (the “Transaction”). The
Transaction was completed in a multi-step process pursuant to which we initially contributed the IS&GS business to Abacus Innovations Corporation
(Abacus), a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin created to facilitate the Transaction, and the common stock of Abacus was distributed to
participating Lockheed Martin stockholders through an exchange offer. Under the terms of the exchange offer, Lockheed Martin stockholders had the option
to exchange shares of Lockheed Martin common stock for shares of Abacus common stock. At the conclusion of the exchange offer, all shares of Abacus
common stock were exchanged for 9,369,694 shares of Lockheed Martin common stock held by Lockheed Martin stockholders that elected to participate in
the exchange. The shares of Lockheed Martin common stock that were exchanged and accepted were retired, reducing the number of shares of our common
stock outstanding by approximately 3%. Following the exchange offer, Abacus merged with a subsidiary of Leidos, with Abacus continuing as the surviving
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Leidos. As part of the merger, each share of Abacus common stock was automatically converted into one share
of Leidos common stock. We did not receive any shares of Leidos common stock as part of the Transaction and do not hold any shares of Leidos or Abacus
common stock following the Transaction. Based on an opinion of outside tax counsel, subject to customary qualifications and based on factual
representations, the exchange offer and merger will qualify as tax-free transactions to Lockheed Martin and its stockholders, except to the extent that cash was
paid to Lockheed Martin stockholders in lieu of fractional shares.
In connection with the Transaction, Abacus borrowed an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.84 billion under term loan facilities with third
party financial institutions, the proceeds of which were used to make a one-time special cash payment of $1.80 billion to Lockheed Martin and to pay
associated borrowing fees and expenses. The entire special cash payment was used to repay debt, pay dividends and repurchase stock during the third and
fourth quarters of 2016. The obligations under the Abacus term loan facilities were guaranteed by Leidos as part of the Transaction.

Table of Contents
As a result of the Transaction, we recognized a net gain of approximately $1.3 billion, including $1.2 billion recognized in 2016. The net gain represents
the $2.5 billion fair value of the shares of Lockheed Martin common stock exchanged and retired as part of the exchange offer, plus the $1.8 billion one-time
special cash payment, less the net book value of the IS&GS business of about $3.0 billion at August 16, 2016 and other adjustments of about $100 million. In
2017, we recognized an additional gain of $73 million, which reflects certain post-closing adjustments, including certain tax adjustments and the final
determination of net working capital.
We classified the operating results of our former IS&GS business as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with
U.S. GAAP, as the divestiture of this business represented a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. However, the cash
flows generated by the IS&GS business have not been reclassified in our consolidated statements of cash flows as we retained this cash as part of the
Transaction.
The operating results, prior to the August 16, 2016 divestiture date, of the IS&GS business that have been reflected within net earnings from discontinued
operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 are as follows (in millions):
Net sales  $ 3,410 
Cost of sales  (2,953) 
Severance charges  (19) 
Gross profit  438 
Other income, net  16 
Operating profit  454 
Earnings from discontinued operations before income taxes  454 
Income tax expense  (147) 
Net gain on divestiture of discontinued operations  1,205 
Net earnings from discontinued operations  $ 1,512 
The operating results of the IS&GS business reported as discontinued operations are different than the results previously reported for the IS&GS business
segment. Results reported within net earnings from discontinued operations only include costs that were directly attributable to the IS&GS business and
exclude certain corporate overhead costs that were previously allocated to the IS&GS business. As a result, we reclassified $82 million in 2016 of corporate
overhead costs from the IS&GS business to other unallocated, net on our consolidated statement of earnings.
Additionally, we retained all assets and obligations related to the pension benefits earned by former IS&GS business salaried employees through the date
of divestiture. Therefore, the non-service portion of net pension costs (e.g., interest cost, actuarial gains and losses and expected return on plan assets) for
these plans have been reclassified from the operating results of the IS&GS business segment and reported as a reduction to the FAS/CAS pension adjustment.
These net pension costs were $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The service portion of net pension costs related to IS&GS business’s
salaried employees that transferred to Leidos were included in the operating results of the IS&GS business classified as discontinued operations because such
costs are no longer incurred by us.
Significant severance charges related to the IS&GS business were historically recorded at the Lockheed Martin corporate office. These charges have been
reclassified into the operating results of the IS&GS business, classified as discontinued operations, and excluded from the operating results of our continuing
operations. The amount of severance charges reclassified were $19 million in 2016.
Financial information related to cash flows generated by the IS&GS business, such as depreciation and amortization, capital expenditures, and other non-
cash items, included in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016 were not significant.

Total acquired intangibles  $ 4,468 $ (974)  $ 3,494  $ 4,494 $ (697)  $ 3,797
Acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense primarily on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives: customer
programs, from nine to 20 years; customer relationships, from four to 10 years; and other intangibles, from three to 10 years.
Amortization expense for acquired finite-lived intangible assets was $296 million, $312 million and $284 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Estimated
future amortization expense is as follows: $285 million in 2019; $263 million in 2020; $256 million in 2021; $253 million in 2022; $250 million in 2023 and
$1.3 billion thereafter.
With the acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (Sikorsky), we recorded customer contractual obligations of $507 million. Customer contractual
obligations represent liabilities on certain development programs where the expected costs exceed the expected sales under contract. These liabilities are
liquidated in accordance with the underlying economic pattern of the contractual obligations, as reflected by the estimated future net cash outflows incurred
on the associated contracts. As of December 31, 2018, we have recognized approximately $325 million in net sales related to customer contractual
obligations. As of December 31, 2018, the estimated liquidation of the customer contractual obligation is approximated as follows: $70 million in 2019,
$45 million in 2020, $15 million in 2021, $30 million in 2022, $5 million in 2023 and $17 million thereafter.

Note 5 – Information on Business Segments
We operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, MFC, RMS and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and
services offered. Following is a brief description of the activities of our business segments:
•Aeronautics – Engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft,
including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies.
•Missiles and Fire Control – Provides air and missile defense systems; tactical missiles and air-to-ground precision strike weapon systems; logistics; fire
control systems; mission operations support, readiness, engineering support and integration services; manned and unmanned ground vehicles; and energy
management solutions.
•Rotary and Mission Systems – Provides design, manufacture, service and support for a variety of military and commercial helicopters; ship and
submarine mission and combat systems; mission systems and sensors for rotary and fixed-wing aircraft; sea and land-based missile defense systems;
radar systems; the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS); simulation and training services; and unmanned systems and technologies. In addition, RMS supports the
needs of customers in cybersecurity and delivers communications and command and control capability through complex mission solutions for defense
applications.
•Space – Engaged in the research and development, design, engineering and production of satellites, space transportation systems, and strategic, advanced
strike, and defensive systems. Space provides network-enabled situational awareness and integrates complex space and ground global systems to help our
customers gather, analyze and securely distribute critical intelligence data. Space is also responsible for various classified systems and services in support
of vital national security systems. Prior to August 24, 2016, the date we obtained control of AWE we accounted for the venture using the equity method
of accounting with 33% of AWE’s earnings or losses recognized by Space. Subsequent to August 24, 2016, we obtained control of AWE and 100% of
AWE’s sales and 51% of AWE’s earnings have been included in our consolidated results of operations. Accordingly, the consolidated results of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 do not reflect a full year of AWE operations. Operating profit for our Space business segment also
includes our share of earnings for our investment in ULA, which provides expendable launch services to the U.S. Government.
The financial information in the following tables includes the results of businesses we have acquired from their respective dates of acquisition and
excludes businesses included in discontinued operations (see “Note 3 – Acquisition and Divestitures”) for all years presented. Net sales of our business
segments exclude intersegment sales as these activities are eliminated in consolidation.
Operating profit of our business segments includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees as the operating activities of the equity
method investees are closely aligned with the operations of our business segments. ULA, results of which are included in our Space business segment, is our
primary equity method investee. Operating profit of our business segments excludes the FAS/CAS operating adjustment for our qualified defined benefit
pension plans (described below); the adjustment from CAS to FAS service cost component for all other postretirement benefit plans; expense for stock-based
compensation; the effects of items not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance, such as charges related to significant
severance and restructuring actions (see “Note 15 – Severance and Restructuring Charges”) and goodwill impairments; gains or losses from significant
divestitures; the effects of certain legal settlements; corporate costs not allocated to our business segments; and other miscellaneous corporate activities. These
items are included in the reconciling item “Unallocated items” between operating profit from our business segments and our consolidated operating profit.
See “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” (under the caption “Use of Estimates”) for a discussion related to certain factors that may impact the
comparability of net sales and operating profit of our business segments.
Our business segments’ results of operations include pension expense only as calculated under U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS),
which we refer to as CAS pension cost. We recover CAS pension cost through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts and,
therefore, the CAS pension cost is recognized in each of our business segments’ net sales and cost of sales. Our consolidated operating profit in our
consolidated financial statements must present the service cost component of FAS pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense calculated in
accordance with FAS requirements under U.S. GAAP. The operating portion of the net FAS/CAS operating adjustment represents the difference between the
service cost component of FAS pension expense and the CAS pension cost recorded in our business segments’ results of operations. The non-service FAS
pension and other postretirement benefit plan cost component is included in other non-operating expenses, net on our consolidated statement of earnings.

(a) On August 24, 2016, our ownership interest in the A WE joint venture increased from 33% to 51% and we were required to change our accounting for this investment from
the equity method to consolidation. As a result of the increased ownership interest, we recognized a non-cash gain of $127 million  at our Space business segment, which
increased net earnings from continuing operations by $104 million  ($0.34  per share) in 2016. See “ Note 3 – Acquisition and Divestitures ” for more information.
(b) The FAS/CAS operating adjustment represents the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension expense and total pension costs recoverable on U.S.

(a) We record the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost as part of other non-operating expense, net in the consolidated statement of earnings. The non-
service cost components in the table above relate only to our qualified defined benefit pension plans. We incurred total non-service costs for our qualified defined benefit
pension plans in the table above, along with similar costs for our other postretirement benefit plans of $67 million , $109 million , and $123 million  for the years ended
2018, 2017 and 2016.
We recover CAS pension cost through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts and, therefore, recognize CAS pension cost
in each of our business segment’s net sales and cost of sales. Our consolidated financial statements must present FAS pension and other postretirement benefit
plan expense calculated in accordance with FAS requirements under U.S. GAAP. The operating portion of the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents
the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension expense and CAS pension cost. The non-service FAS pension cost component is included
in other non-operating expense, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. The net FAS/CAS pension adjustment increases or decreases CAS pension
cost to equal total FAS pension expense (both service and non-service).

Table of Contents
Contract assets are net of $30.2 billion and $19.9 billion of customer advances and progress payments as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. Contract assets
increased $1.5 billion during 2018, primarily due to the recognition of revenue related to the satisfaction or partial satisfaction of performance obligations
during 2018 for which we have not yet billed. There were no significant impairment losses related to our contract assets during 2018 and 2017. We expect to
bill our customers for the majority of the December 31, 2018 contract assets during 2019.
Contract liabilities decreased $537 million during 2018, primarily due to revenue recognized in excess of payments received on these performance
obligations. During 2018, we recognized $3.9 billion of our contract liabilities at December 31, 2018 as revenue. During 2017, we recognized $3.3 billion of
our contract liabilities at December 31, 2017 as revenue. During 2016, we recognized $3.7 billion of our contract liabilities at December 31, 2016 as revenue.
Note 7 – Inventories

Finished goods  390 492
Total inventories  $ 2,997 $ 2,878
Work-in-process inventories at December 31, 2018 and 2017 included general and administrative costs of $53 million and $112 million. General and
administrative costs incurred and recorded in inventories totaled $1.9 billion in 2018, $2.0 billion in 2017 and $1.9 billion in 2016. General and administrative
costs charged to cost of sales from inventories totaled $2.0 billion in both 2018 and 2017 and $1.9 billion in 2016.
Costs incurred to fulfill a contract in advance of the contract being awarded are included in inventories as work-in-process if we determine that those
costs relate directly to a contract or to an anticipated contract that we can specifically identify and contract award is probable, the costs generate or enhance
resources that will be used in satisfying performance obligations, and the costs are recoverable (referred to as pre-contract costs). Pre-contract costs that are
initially capitalized in inventory are generally recognized as cost of sales consistent with the transfer of products and services to the customer upon the receipt
of the anticipated contract. All other pre-contract costs, including start-up costs, are expensed as incurred. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, $443 million
and $466 million of pre-contract costs were included in inventories.

Total foreign income tax expense  54 52 27
Total income tax expense  $ 792 $ 3,356 $ 1,093
(a) Represents one-time charge in 2017 primarily due to the re-measurement of certain net deferred tax asset s using the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate and a deemed
repatriation tax, and true-up to this char ge in 2018.
On December 22, 2017, the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act, among other things, lowered the U.S. corporate
income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Consequently, we wrote down our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 by
$2.0 billion to reflect the estimated impact of the Tax Act. We recorded a corresponding net one-time charge of $2.0 billion ($6.77 per share), substantially all
of which was non-cash, primarily related to enactment of the Tax Act, the re-measurement of certain net deferred tax assets using the lower U.S. corporate
income tax rate, a deemed repatriation tax, and a reduction in the U.S. manufacturing benefit as a result of our decision to accelerate contributions to our
pension fund in 2018 in order to receive a tax deduction in 2017.
We applied the guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 when accounting for the enactment-date effects of the Tax Act in 2017 and throughout 2018.
At December 31, 2017, we had substantially completed our provisional analysis of the income tax effects of the Tax Act and recorded a reasonable estimate in
2017 of such effects. During 2018, we refined our calculations, evaluated changes in interpretations and assumptions that we had made, applied additional
guidance issued by the U.S. Government, and evaluated actions and related accounting policy decisions we have made. As of December 22, 2018, we
completed our accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the Tax Act and did not identify any material changes to the provisional, net,
one-time charge for the year ended December 31, 2017, related to the Tax Act.
State income taxes are included in our operations as general and administrative costs and, under U.S. Government regulations, are allowable costs in
establishing prices for the products and services we sell to the U.S. Government. Therefore, a substantial portion of state income taxes is included in our net
sales and cost of sales. As a result, the impact of certain transactions on our operating profit and of other matters presented in these consolidated financial
statements is disclosed net of state income taxes. Our total net state income tax expense was $83 million for 2018, $103 million for 2017, and $112 million for
2016.

(a) Includes a deferred tax re-measurement and transition tax true-up in 2018 and one-time charge in 2017 primarily due to the re-measurement of certain net deferred tax
assets using the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate and a deemed repatriation tax.
(b) Includes a reduction in our 2017 manufacturing benefit as a result of our decision to accelerate contribu tions to our pension funds in 2018. The Tax Act repealed the
manufacturing benefit for years after 2017.
(c) Recognized tax benefit of $61 million  in 2018 from our change in a tax accounting method related to restoration of tax basis.
Tax benefits from U.S. research and development (R&D) tax credits were $138 million in 2018, $115 million in 2017, and $107 million in 2016.
We recognized a new tax benefit of $61 million in 2018 from the deduction for foreign derived intangible income enacted by the Tax Act. The Tax Act
repealed the U.S. manufacturing deduction for years after 2017. Therefore, there was no U.S. manufacturing benefit in 2018. Tax benefits from the U.S.
manufacturing deduction were $7 million in 2017 and $117 million in 2016.
We receive a tax deduction for dividends paid on shares of our common stock held by certain of our defined contribution plans with an employee stock
ownership plan feature. The benefit of the tax deduction has declined, principally due to the lower tax rate in 2018.
In 2016, we adopted the accounting standard update for employee share-based payment awards on a prospective basis. Accordingly, we recognized
additional income tax benefits of $55 million in 2018, $106 million in 2017, and $152 million in 2016.
We also recognized a tax benefit of $61 million in 2018 from our change in a tax accounting method reflecting a 2012 Court of Federal Claims decision,
which held that the tax basis in certain assets should be increased and realized upon the assets’ disposition. The 2016 income tax rate also benefited from the
nontaxable gain recorded in connection with the consolidation of AWE.
We participate in the IRS Compliance Assurance Process program. Examinations of the years 2017 and 2018 remain under IRS review.

fund in order to receive a deduction in 2017.
(c) A valuation allowance was provided against certain foreign company deferred tax assets arising from carryforwards of unused tax benefits.
As of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, our liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits were not material.
We and our subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the statute of
limitations is no longer open for U.S. federal or non-U.S. income tax examinations for the years before 2015, other than with respect to refunds.
We received net federal and foreign income tax refunds of $41 million in 2018, primarily due to a 2017 net operating loss carryback arising from our
accelerated pension contributions. Our federal and foreign income tax payments, net of refunds received, were $1.1 billion in 2017 and $1.3 billion in 2016.

Revolving Credit Facilities
On August 24, 2018, we entered into a new $2.5 billion revolving credit facility (the 5-year Facility) with various banks and concurrently terminated our
existing $2.5 billion revolving credit facility. The 5‑year Facility has an expiration date of August 24, 2023 and is available for general corporate purposes.
The undrawn portion of the 5-year Facility is also available to serve as a backup facility for the issuance of commercial paper. We may request and the banks
may grant, at their discretion, an increase in the borrowing capacity under the 5-year Facility of up to an additional $500 million. There were no borrowings
outstanding under the 5-year Facility as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.
Borrowings under the 5-year Facility are unsecured and bear interest at rates based, at our option, on a Eurodollar Rate or a Base Rate, as defined in the
5-year Facility’s agreement. Each bank’s obligation to make loans under the 5-year Facility is subject to, among other things, our compliance with various
representations, warranties, and covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to encumber assets and a covenant
not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the 5‑year Facility agreement. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we were in compliance with all
covenants contained in the 5-year Facility agreement, as well as in our debt agreements.
Long-Term Debt
In November 2018, we repaid $750 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 1.85% according to their scheduled maturities.
In September 2017, we issued notes totaling approximately $1.6 billion with a fixed interest rate of 4.09% maturing in September 2052 (the New Notes)
in exchange for outstanding notes totaling approximately $1.4 billion with fixed interest rates ranging from 4.70% to 8.50% maturing 2029 to 2046 (the Old
Notes). In connection with the exchange of principal, we paid a premium of $237 million, substantially all of which was in the form of New Notes. This
premium will be amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the New Notes using the effective interest method. We may, at our option, redeem
some or all of the New Notes at any time by paying the principal amount of notes being redeemed plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid
interest. Interest on the New Notes is payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year and began on March 15,
89
Table of Contents
2018. The New Notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated
indebtedness.
We made interest payments of approximately $635 million, $610 million and $600 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016,
respectively.
In September 2016, we repaid $500 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 2.13% according to their scheduled maturities. In May 2016,
we repaid $452 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 7.65% according to their scheduled maturities. We also had related variable interest rate
swaps with a notional amount of $450 million mature, which did not have a significant impact on net earnings or comprehensive income.
Short-Term Debt and Commercial Paper
As of December 31, 2018, we had $1.5 billion of short-term borrowings due within one year, of which approximately $900 million was composed of
scheduled debt maturity due in November 2019 and approximately $600 million was composed of commercial paper borrowings with a weighted-average
rate of 2.89%. During 2017, we borrowed and fully repaid amounts under our commercial paper programs. There were no commercial paper borrowings
outstanding as of December 31, 2017. We expect to continue to issue commercial paper backed by our $2.5 billion 5‑year Facility to manage the timing of
cash flows.
Note 11 – Postretirement Benefit Plans
Defined Benefit Pension Plans and Retiree Medical and Life Insurance Plans
Many of our employees are covered by qualified defined benefit pension plans and we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible
retirees (collectively, postretirement benefit plans). We also sponsor nonqualified defined benefit pension plans to provide for benefits in excess of qualified
plan limits. Non-union employees hired after December 2005 do not participate in our qualified defined benefit pension plans, but are eligible to participate in
a qualified defined contribution plan in addition to our other retirement savings plans. They also have the ability to participate in our retiree medical plans, but
we do not subsidize the cost of their participation in those plans as we do with employees hired before January 1, 2006. Over the last few years, we have
negotiated similar changes with various labor organizations such that new union represented employees do not participate in our defined benefit pension
plans. In June 2014, we amended certain of our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for non-union employees, comprising the majority of
our benefit obligations, to freeze future retirement benefits. The calculation of retirement benefits under the affected defined benefit pension plans is
determined by a formula that takes into account the participants’ years of credited service and average compensation. The freeze takes effect in two stages. On
January 1, 2016, the pay-based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefits was frozen so that future pay increases, annual incentive
bonuses or other amounts earned for or related to periods after December 31, 2015 are not used to calculate retirement benefits. On January 1, 2020, the
service-based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefits will also be frozen so that participants will no longer earn further credited
service for any period after December 31, 2019. When the freeze is complete, the majority of our salaried employees will have transitioned to an enhanced
defined contribution retirement savings plan.
We have made contributions to trusts established to pay future benefits to eligible retirees and dependents, including Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary
Association trusts and 401(h) accounts, the assets of which will be used to pay expenses of certain retiree medical plans. We use December 31 as the
measurement date. Benefit obligations as of the end of each year reflect assumptions in effect as of those dates. Net periodic benefit cost is based on
assumptions in effect at the end of the respective preceding year.
The rules related to accounting for postretirement benefit plans under GAAP require us to recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the funded status of our
postretirement benefit plans as either an asset or a liability on our consolidated balance sheets. The funded status is measured as the difference between the
fair value of the plan’s assets and the benefit obligation of the plan.

(a) Total net periodic benefit cost associated with our qualified defined benefit plans represents pension expense calculated in accordance with GAAP (FAS pension expense).
We are required to calculate pension expense in accordance with both GAAP and CAS rules, each of which results in a different calculated amount of pension expense.
The CAS pension cost is recovered through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts and, therefore, is recognized in net sales and cost of
sales for products and services. We include the difference between FAS pension service cost and CAS pension cost, referred to as the FAS/CAS operating adjustment, as a
component of other unallocated, net on our consolidated statements of earnings (see Note 5 – Information on Business Segments ).

In December 2018, an upfront cash payment of $810 million was made to an insurance company in exchange for a contract (referred to as a buy-in
contract) that will reimburse the plan for all future benefit payments related to $770 million of the plan’s outstanding defined benefit pension obligations for
approximately 9,000 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries. On December 31, 2018, the approximately 9,000 retirees and beneficiaries and the buy-in contract were
spun-off to another plan, with the buy-in contract the sole asset of that plan. Under the arrangement, the plan remains responsible for paying the benefits for
the covered retirees and beneficiaries and the insurance company will reimburse the plan as those benefits are paid. As a result, there is no net ongoing cash
flow to the plan for the covered retirees and beneficiaries as the cost of providing the benefits is funded by the buy-in contract, effectively locking in the cost
of the benefits and eliminating future volatility of the benefit obligation. The buy-in contract was purchased using assets from the pension trust and is
accounted for at fair value as an investment of the trust. This transaction had no impact on our 2018 FAS pension expense or CAS pension cost. The
difference of approximately $40 million between the amount paid to the insurance company and the amount of the pension obligations funded by the buy-in
contract was recognized through the re-measurement of the related benefit obligations in other comprehensive loss in equity and will be amortized to FAS
pension expense in future periods. We intend to begin the termination process for this plan during 2019, and at conclusion convert the buy-in contract to a
buy-out contract, thus relieving us of liability for the pension obligations related to the covered population. The buy-out conversion, expected to occur as
early as 2020, will require recognition of a settlement loss in earnings at that time, which we currently estimate will be approximately $350 million. A
subsequent cash recovery is anticipated from the U.S. Government.
Also, during December 2018, we purchased an irrevocable group annuity contract from an insurance company (referred to as a buy-out contract) for
$1.82 billion to settle $1.76 billion of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations related to certain U.S. retirees and beneficiaries. The group annuity
contract was purchased using assets from the pension trust. As a result of this transaction, we were relieved of all responsibility for these pension obligations
and the insurance company is now required to pay and administer the retirement benefits owed to approximately 32,000 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries, with
no change to the amount, timing or form of monthly retirement benefit payments. Although the transaction was treated as a settlement for accounting
purposes, we did not recognize a loss on the settlement in earnings associated with the transaction because total settlements during 2018 for this plan were
less than this plan’s service and interest cost in 2018. Accordingly, the transaction had no impact on our 2018 FAS pension expense or CAS pension cost, and
the difference of approximately $60 million between the amount paid to the insurance company and the amount of the pension obligations settled was
recognized in other comprehensive loss and will be amortized to FAS pension expense in future periods.

The accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) for all qualified defined benefit pension plans was $43.3 billion and $48.5 billion at December 31, 2018 and
2017, of which $43.3 billion and $48.5 billion related to plans where the ABO was in excess of plan assets. The ABO represents benefits accrued without
assuming future compensation increases to plan participants.

(c) Represents prepaid pension assets, which are included on our consolidated balance sheets in other noncurrent assets.
We also sponsor nonqualified defined benefit plans to provide benefits in excess of qualified plan limits. The aggregate liabilities for these plans at
December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, which also represent the plans’ unfunded status. We have set aside certain assets totaling
$425 million and $530 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 in a separate trust which we expect to be used to pay obligations under our nonqualified
defined benefit plans. In accordance with GAAP, those assets may not be used to offset the amount of the benefit obligation similar to the postretirement
benefit plans in the table above. The unrecognized net actuarial losses at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $505 million and $646 million. The unrecognized
prior service credit at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $48 million and $61 million. The expense associated with these plans totaled $123 million in 2018,
$126 million in 2017 and $125 million in 2016. We also sponsor a small number of other postemployment plans and foreign benefit plans. The aggregate
liability for the other postemployment plans was $46 million and $60 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. The expense for the other postemployment
plans, as well as the liability and expense associated with the foreign benefit plans, was not material to our results of operations, financial position or cash
flows. The actuarial assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and expense associated with our nonqualified defined benefit plans and
postemployment plans are similar to those assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and expense related to our qualified defined benefit pension
plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans as described below.

Table of Contents
We expect that approximately $1.2 billion, or about $908 million net of tax, of actuarial losses and net prior service credit related to postretirement
benefit plans included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at the end of 2018 to be recognized in net periodic benefit cost during 2019. Of this amount,
$1.1 billion, or $841 million net of tax, relates to our qualified defined benefit plans and is included in our expected 2019 pension expense of $1.1 billion.
Actuarial Assumptions
The actuarial assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations at December 31 of each year and to determine the net periodic benefit cost for each
subsequent year, were as follows:
  Qualified Defined Benefit
Pension Plans   Retiree Medical and
Life Insurance Plans
  2018 2017 2016  2018 2017 2016
Weighted average discount rate  4.250% 3.625% 4.125%  4.250% 3.625% 4.000%
Expected long-term rate of return on assets  7.00% 7.50% 7.50%  7.00% 7.50% 7.50%
Rate of increase in future compensation levels (for
applicable bargained pension plans)  4.50% 4.50% 4.50%       
Health care trend rate assumed for next year         8.25% 8.50% 8.75%
Ultimate health care trend rate         5.00% 5.00% 5.00%
Year that the ultimate health care trend rate is reached        2032 2032 2032
The increase in the discount rate from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 resulted in a decrease in the projected benefit obligations of our
qualified defined benefit pension plans of approximately $3.5 billion at December 31, 2018. The decrease in the discount rate from December 31, 2016 to
December 31, 2017 resulted in an increase in the projected benefit obligations of our qualified defined benefit pension plans of approximately $2.9 billion at
December 31, 2017.
The long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected long-term rate of earnings on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the
benefits included in the benefit obligations. That assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term
allocation of plan assets, the historical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses and the potential to outperform market index returns.
Plan Assets
Investment policies and strategies – Lockheed Martin Investment Management Company (LMIMCo), our wholly-owned subsidiary, has the fiduciary
responsibility for making investment decisions related to the assets of our postretirement benefit plans. LMIMCo’s investment objectives for the assets of
these plans are (1) to minimize the net present value of expected funding contributions; (2) to ensure there is a high probability that each plan meets or
exceeds our actuarial long-term rate of return assumptions; and (3) to diversify assets to minimize the risk of large losses. The nature and duration of benefit
obligations, along with assumptions concerning asset class returns and return correlations, are considered when determining an appropriate asset allocation to
achieve the investment objectives. Investment policies and strategies governing the assets of the plans are designed to achieve investment objectives within
prudent risk parameters. Risk management practices include the use of external investment managers; the maintenance of a portfolio diversified by asset
class, investment approach and security holdings; and the maintenance of sufficient liquidity to meet benefit obligations as they come due.
LMIMCo’s investment policies require that asset allocations of postretirement benefit plans be maintained within the following approximate ranges:
Asset ClassAsset Allocation
Ranges
Cash and cash equivalents 0-20%
Equity 15-65%
Fixed income 10-60%
Alternative investments:

Fair value measurements – The rules related to accounting for postretirement benefit plans under GAAP require certain fair value disclosures related to
postretirement benefit plan assets, even though those assets are not separately presented on our consolidated balance sheets. The following table presents the
fair value of the assets (in millions) of our qualified defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans by asset category and their level
within the fair value hierarchy, which has three levels based on the uncertainty of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values
determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets, Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs and
Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs. Certain other investments are measured at their Net Asset Value (NAV) per share
and do not have readily determined values and are thus not subject to leveling in the fair value hierarchy. The NAV is the total value of the fund divided by
the number of the fund’s shares outstanding. We recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the date of the change in circumstances
that causes the transfer.

mandate guidelines or to hedge risks to the extent of a plan’ s current exposure to such risks. Most derivative transactions are settled on a daily basis.
(b) Level 3 investments include $810 million  related to the buy-in contract discussed above.
(c) Certain investments that are valued using the NA V per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy and are included

Table of Contents
Valuation techniques – Cash equivalents are mostly comprised of short-term money-market instruments and are valued at cost, which approximates fair
value.
U.S. equity securities and international equity securities categorized as Level 1 are traded on active national and international exchanges and are valued at
their closing prices on the last trading day of the year. For U.S. equity securities and international equity securities not traded on an active exchange, or if the
closing price is not available, the trustee obtains indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. These securities are categorized as
Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor or categorized as Level 3 if the custodian obtains uncorroborated quotes from a
broker or investment manager.
Commingled equity funds categorized as Level 1 are traded on active national and international exchanges and are valued at their closing prices on the
last trading day of the year. For commingled equity funds not traded on an active exchange, or if the closing price is not available, the trustee obtains
indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. These securities are categorized as Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated
quotes from a pricing vendor.
Fixed income investments categorized as Level 2 are valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data (e.g., interest
rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals and credit spreads), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with
similar characteristics. Fixed income investments are categorized as Level 3 when valuations using observable inputs are unavailable. The trustee typically
obtains pricing based on indicative quotes or bid evaluations from vendors, brokers or the investment manager. In addition, certain other fixed income
investments categorized as Level 3 are valued using a discounted cash flow approach. Significant inputs include projected annuity payments and the discount
rate applied to those payments.
Certain commingled equity funds, consisting of equity mutual funds, are valued using the NAV. The NAV valuations are based on the underlying
investments and typically redeemable within 90 days.
Private equity funds consist of partnership and co-investment funds. The NAV is based on valuation models of the underlying securities, which includes
unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data. These funds typically have redemption periods between eight and 12
years.
Real estate funds consist of partnerships, most of which are closed-end funds, for which the NAV is based on valuation models and periodic appraisals.
These funds typically have redemption periods between eight and 10 years.
Hedge funds consist of direct hedge funds for which the NAV is generally based on the valuation of the underlying investments. Redemptions in hedge
funds are based on the specific terms of each fund, and generally range from a minimum of one month to several months.
Contributions and Expected Benefit Payments
The funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with ERISA, as amended by the PPA, and in a manner consistent
with CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules. We made contributions of $5.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2018, including required
and discretionary contributions. As a result of these contributions, we do not expect to make contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in
2019.
The following table presents estimated future benefit payments, which reflect expected future employee service, as of December 31, 2018 (in millions):

Defined Contribution Plans
We maintain a number of defined contribution plans, most with 401(k) features, that cover substantially all of our employees. Under the provisions of our
401(k) plans, we match most employees’ eligible contributions at rates specified in the plan documents. Our contributions were $658 million in 2018, $613
million in 2017 and $617 million in 2016, the majority of which were funded using our common stock. Our defined contribution plans held approximately
33.3 million and 35.5 million shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Note 12 – Stockholders’ Equity
At December 31, 2018 and 2017, our authorized capital was composed of 1.5 billion shares of common stock and 50 million shares of series preferred
stock. Of the 283 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2018, 281 million shares were considered outstanding for
consolidated balance sheet presentation purposes; the remaining shares were held in a separate trust. Of the 285 million shares of common stock issued and
outstanding as of December 31, 2017, 284 million shares were considered outstanding for consolidated balance sheet presentation purposes; the remaining
shares were held in a separate trust. No shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding at December 31, 2018 or 2017.
Repurchases of Common Stock
During 2018, we repurchased 4.7 million shares of our common stock for $1.5 billion. During 2017 and 2016, we paid $2.0 billion and $2.1 billion to
repurchase 7.1 million and 8.9 million shares of our common stock.
On September 27, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a $1.0 billion increase to our share repurchase program. Inclusive of this increase, the total
remaining authorization for future common share repurchases under our program was $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2018. As we repurchase our common
shares, we reduce common stock for the $1 of par value of the shares repurchased, with the excess purchase price over par value recorded as a reduction of
additional paid-in capital. If additional paid-in capital is reduced to zero, we record the remainder of the excess purchase price over par value as a reduction of
retained earnings. Due to the volume of repurchases made under our share repurchase program, additional paid-in capital was reduced to zero, with the
remainder of the excess purchase price over par value of $1.1 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion recorded as a reduction of retained earnings in 2018, 2017
and 2016.
Dividends
We paid dividends totaling $2.3 billion ($8.20 per share) in 2018, $2.2 billion ($7.46 per share) in 2017 and $2.0 billion ($6.77 per share) in 2016. We
paid quarterly dividends of $2.00 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2018 and $2.20 per share during the fourth quarter of 2018; $1.82 per
share during each of the first three quarters of 2017 and $2.00 per share during the fourth quarter of 2017; and $1.65 per share during each of the first three
quarters of 2016 and $1.82 per share during the fourth quarter of 2016.

Note 13 – Stock-Based Compensation
During 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded non-cash stock-based compensation expense totaling $173 million, $158 million and $149 million, which is
included as a component of other unallocated, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. The net impact to earnings for the respective years was $137
million, $103 million and $97 million.
As of December 31, 2018, we had $101 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested awards, which is expected to be recognized over
a weighted average period of 1.8 years. We received cash from the exercise of stock options totaling $43 million, $71 million and $106 million during 2018,
2017 and 2016. In addition, our income tax liabilities for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were reduced by $75 million, $203 million and $219 million due to recognized
tax benefits on stock-based compensation arrangements.
Stock-Based Compensation Plans
Under plans approved by our stockholders, we are authorized to grant key employees stock-based incentive awards, including options to purchase
common stock, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, PSUs or other stock units. The exercise price of options to purchase common stock may not be less than the
fair market value of our stock on the date of grant. No award of stock options may become fully vested prior to the third anniversary of the grant and no
portion of a stock option grant may become vested in less than one year. The minimum vesting period for restricted stock or stock units payable in stock is
three years. Award agreements may provide for shorter or pro-rated vesting periods or vesting following termination of employment in the case of death,
disability, divestiture, retirement, change of control or layoff. The maximum term of a stock option or any other award is 10 years.
At December 31, 2018, inclusive of the shares reserved for outstanding stock options, RSUs and PSUs, we had approximately nine million shares
reserved for issuance under the plans. At December 31, 2018, approximately five million of the shares reserved for issuance remained available for grant
under our stock-based compensation plans. We issue new shares upon the exercise of stock options or when restrictions on RSUs and PSUs have been
satisfied.
RSUs
The following table summarizes activity related to nonvested RSUs:

Forfeited  (24)  282.07 
Nonvested at December 31, 2018  563  $ 271.23 
In 2018, we granted certain employees approximately 0.4 million RSUs with a weighted average grant-date fair value of $353.99 per RSU. The grant-
date fair value of these RSUs is equal to the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date less a discount to reflect the delay in payment of
dividend-equivalent cash payments that are made only upon vesting, which is generally three years from the grant date. We recognize the grant-date fair value
of RSUs, less estimated forfeitures, as compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period, which is shorter than the vesting period if the employee
is retirement eligible on the date of grant or will become retirement eligible before the end of the vesting period.

Stock Options
We generally recognize compensation cost for stock options ratably over the three-year vesting period. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were 1.8
million (weighted average exercise price of $79.76) and 2.2 million (weighted average exercise price of $82.71) stock options outstanding. All of the stock
options outstanding are vested as of December 31, 2018 and have a weighted average remaining contractual life of approximately 1.9 years and an aggregate
intrinsic value of $326 million. There were 0.4 million (weighted average exercise price of $94.63) stock options exercised during 2018. We have not granted
stock options to employees since 2012. The intrinsic value of all stock options exercised was $104 million, $139 million, and $172 million in 2018, 2017 and
2016.
PSUs
In 2018, we granted certain employees PSUs with an aggregate target award of approximately 0.1 million shares of our common stock. The PSUs vest
three years from the grant date based on continuous service, with the number of shares earned (0% to 200% of the target award) depending upon the extent to
which we achieve certain financial and market performance targets measured over the period from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020. About half of
the PSUs were valued at $354.60 per PSU in a manner similar to RSUs mentioned above as the financial targets are based on our operating results. We
recognize the grant-date fair value of these PSUs, less estimated forfeitures, as compensation expense ratably over the vesting period based on the number of
awards expected to vest at each reporting date. The remaining PSUs were valued at $420.75 per PSU using a Monte Carlo model as the performance target is
related to our total shareholder return relative to our peer group. We recognize the grant-date fair value of these awards, less estimated forfeitures, as
compensation expense ratably over the vesting period.
Note 14 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies
We are a party to or have property subject to litigation and other proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business, including matters arising
under provisions relating to the protection of the environment and are subject to contingencies related to certain businesses we previously owned. These types
of matters could result in fines, penalties, compensatory or treble damages or non-monetary sanctions or relief. We believe the probability is remote that the
outcome of each of these matters, including the legal proceedings described below, will have a material adverse effect on the corporation as a whole,
notwithstanding that the unfavorable resolution of any matter may have a material effect on our net earnings in any particular interim reporting period.
Among the factors that we consider in this assessment are the nature of existing legal proceedings and claims, the asserted or possible damages or loss
contingency (if estimable), the progress of the case, existing law and precedent, the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers, our experience in
similar cases and the experience of other companies, the facts available to us at the time of assessment and how we intend to respond to the proceeding or
claim. Our assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings or claims progress.
Although we cannot predict the outcome of legal or other proceedings with certainty, where there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have
been incurred, GAAP requires us to disclose an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss or make a statement that such an estimate cannot be
made. We follow a thorough process in which we seek to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, and only if we are unable to make such an
estimate do we conclude and disclose that an estimate cannot be made. Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated below in our discussion of legal proceedings,
a reasonably possible loss or range of loss associated with any individual legal proceeding cannot be estimated.
Legal Proceedings
As a result of our acquisition of Sikorsky, we assumed the defense of and any potential liability for two civil False Claims Act lawsuits pending in the
U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. In October 2014, the U.S. Government filed a complaint in intervention in the first suit, which was
brought by qui tam relator Mary Patzer, a former Derco Aerospace (Derco) employee. In May 2017, the U.S. Government filed a complaint in intervention in
the second suit, which was brought by qui tam relator Peter Cimma, a former Sikorsky Support Services, Inc. (SSSI) employee. In November 2017, the Court
consolidated the cases into a single action for discovery and trial.
The U.S. Government alleges that Sikorsky and two of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Derco and SSSI, violated the civil False Claims Act and the Truth
in Negotiations Act in connection with a contract the U.S. Navy awarded to SSSI in June 2006 to support the Navy’s T-34 and T-44 fixed-wing turboprop
training aircraft. SSSI subcontracted with Derco, primarily to procure and manage spare parts for the training aircraft. The U.S. Government contends that
SSSI overbilled the Navy on the contract as the result of Derco’s use of prohibited cost-plus-percentage-of-cost pricing to add profit and overhead costs as a
percentage of the price of the spare parts that Derco procured and then sold to SSSI. The U.S. Government also alleges that Derco’s claims to SSSI, SSSI’s
claims to the Navy, and SSSI’s yearly Certificates of Final Indirect Costs from 2006 through 2012 were false and that SSSI
100
Table of Contents
submitted inaccurate cost or pricing data in violation of the Truth in Negotiations Act for a sole-sourced, follow-on “bridge” contract. The U.S. Government’s
complaints assert common law claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment.
The U.S. Government further alleged violations of the Anti-Kickback Act and False Claims Act based on a monthly “chargeback,” through which SSSI
billed Derco for the cost of certain SSSI personnel, allegedly in exchange for SSSI’s permitting a pricing arrangement that was “highly favorable” to Derco.
On January 12, 2018, the Corporation filed a partial motion to dismiss intended to narrow the U.S. Government’s claims, including by seeking dismissal of
the Anti-Kickback Act allegations. The Corporation also moved to dismiss Cimma as a party under the False Claims Act’s first-to-file rule, which permits
only the first relator to recover in a pending case. The District Court granted these motions, in part, on July 20, 2018, dismissing the Government’s claims
under the Anti-Kickback Act and dismissing Cimma as a party to the litigation.
Before the District Court’s July 20, 2018 ruling, the U.S. Government sought damages of approximately $52 million, subject to trebling, plus statutory
penalties. We do not know what effect, if any, the ruling will have on the U.S. Government’s calculation of damages. We believe that we have legal and
factual defenses to the U.S. Government’s remaining claims. Although we continue to evaluate our liability and exposure, we do not currently believe that it
is probable that we will incur a material loss. If, contrary to our expectations, the U.S. Government prevails in this matter and proves damages at or near
$52 million and is successful in having such damages trebled, the outcome could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a
liability is recognized and on our cash flows for the period in which any damages are paid.
On April 24, 2009, we filed a declaratory judgment action against the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority and its Capital Construction
Company (collectively, the MTA) asking the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to find that the MTA is in material breach of our
agreement based on the MTA’s failure to provide access to sites where work must be performed and the customer-furnished equipment necessary to complete
the contract. The MTA filed an answer and counterclaim alleging that we breached the contract and subsequently terminated the contract for alleged default.
The primary damages sought by the MTA are the costs to complete the contract and potential re-procurement costs. While we are unable to estimate the cost
of another contractor to complete the contract and the costs of re-procurement, we note that our contract with the MTA had a total value of $323 million, of
which $241 million was paid to us, and that the MTA is seeking damages of approximately $190 million. We dispute the MTA’s allegations and are defending
against them. Additionally, following an investigation, our sureties on a performance bond related to this matter, who were represented by independent
counsel, concluded that the MTA’s termination of the contract was improper. Finally, our declaratory judgment action was later amended to include claims for
monetary damages against the MTA of approximately $95 million. This matter was taken under submission by the District Court in December 2014, after a
five-week bench trial and the filing of post-trial pleadings by the parties. We continue to await a decision from the District Court. Although this matter relates
to our former IS&GS business, we retained the litigation when we divested IS&GS in 2016.
As previously disclosed, on August 16, 2016, we divested our former IS&GS business segment to Leidos Holdings, Inc. (Leidos) in a transaction which
resulted in IS&GS, now known as Leidos Innovations Corporation (Leidos Innovations), becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Leidos (the Transaction). In
the Transaction, Leidos acquired IS&GS’ interest in Mission Support Alliance, LLC (MSA), a joint venture that holds a prime contract to provide
infrastructure support services at the Department of Energy’s Hanford facility and the liabilities related to Lockheed Martin’s participation in MSA. Included
within the liabilities assumed were those associated with ongoing investigations by the Department of Energy and the Department of Justice (DOJ) related to
work performed at Hanford (the Investigations). In the Transaction, Lockheed Martin transferred to Leidos a reserve slightly in excess of $38 million
Lockheed Martin had established with respect to its potential liability and that of its affiliates arising out of the Investigations and agreed to indemnify Leidos
Innovations with respect to the liabilities assumed for damages to Leidos Innovations and an enumerated list of subsidiaries of Leidos Innovations related to
the Investigations for 100% of amounts in excess of this reserve up to $64 million and 50% of amounts in excess of $64 million.
In the Investigations, DOJ issued a number of Civil Investigative Demands to MSA, Lockheed Martin and the subsidiary of Lockheed Martin that
performed information technology services for MSA, as well as current and former employees of each of these entities. The Investigations relate primarily to
information technology services performed by a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin under a subcontract to MSA. DOJ recently stated that they are preparing to
file a complaint alleging Civil False Claims Act violations. We cannot reasonably estimate our exposure at this time, but it is possible that a settlement or
judgment against any of the parties being investigated could implicate Lockheed Martin’s indemnification obligations as described above. At present, in view
of what we believe to be the strength of the defenses, Leidos’ assumption of the liabilities and structure of the indemnity, we do not believe it probable that
we will incur a material loss.
Environmental Matters
We are involved in proceedings and potential proceedings relating to soil, sediment, surface water, and groundwater contamination, disposal of hazardous
waste, and other environmental matters at several of our current or former facilities and at third-party sites where we have been designated as a potentially
responsible party (PRP). A substantial portion of environmental
101
Table of Contents
costs will be included in our net sales and cost of sales in future periods pursuant to U.S. Government regulations. At the time a liability is recorded for future
environmental costs, we record a receivable for estimated future recovery considered probable through the pricing of products and services to agencies of the
U.S. Government, regardless of the contract form (e.g., cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). We continually evaluate the recoverability of our environmental
receivables by assessing, among other factors, U.S. Government regulations, our U.S. Government business base and contract mix, our history of receiving
reimbursement of such costs, and efforts by some U.S. Government representatives to limit such reimbursement. We include the portion of those
environmental costs expected to be allocated to our non-U.S. Government contracts, or that is determined not to be recoverable under U.S. Government
contracts, in our cost of sales at the time the liability is established.
At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the aggregate amount of liabilities recorded relative to environmental matters was $864 million and $920 million, most
of which are recorded in other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We have recorded receivables totaling $750 million and $799 million
at December 31, 2018 and 2017, most of which are recorded in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets, for the estimated future recovery
of these costs, as we consider the recovery probable based on the factors previously mentioned. We project costs and recovery of costs over approximately 20
years.
Environmental remediation activities usually span many years, which makes estimating liabilities a matter of judgment because of uncertainties with
respect to assessing the extent of the contamination as well as such factors as changing remediation technologies and changing regulatory environmental
standards. There are a number of former and present operating facilities that we are monitoring or investigating for potential future remediation. We perform
quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites and the related liabilities and receivables. Additionally, in our quarterly reviews, we
consider these and other factors in estimating the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remediation activities, and record a liability
when it is probable that a loss has occurred and the loss can be reasonably estimated. The amount of liability recorded is based on our estimate of the costs to
be incurred for remediation at a particular site. We do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or
cannot be reliably determined. We reasonably cannot determine the extent of our financial exposure in all cases as, although a loss may be probable or
reasonably possible, in some cases it is not possible at this time to estimate the loss or reasonably possible loss or range of loss.
We also pursue claims for recovery of costs incurred or for contribution to site cleanup costs against other PRPs, including the U.S. Government, and are
conducting remediation activities under various consent decrees, orders, and agreements relating to soil, groundwater, sediment, or surface water
contamination at certain sites of former or current operations. Under agreements related to certain sites in California and New York, the U.S. Government
reimburses us an amount equal to a percentage, specific to each site, of expenditures for certain remediation activities in the U.S. Government’s capacity as a
PRP under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA).
In addition to the proceedings and potential proceedings discussed above, California previously established a maximum level of the contaminant
hexavalent chromium in drinking water of 10 parts per billion (ppb). This standard was successfully challenged by the California Manufacturers and
Technology Association (CMTA) for failure to conduct the required economic feasibility analysis. In response to the court’s ruling, the State Water Resources
Control Board (State Board), a branch of the California Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew the hexavalent chromium standard from the published
regulations, leaving only the 50 ppb standard for total chromium. The State Board has indicated it will work to re-establish a hexavalent chromium standard.
If the standard for hexavalent chromium is re‑established at 10 ppb or above, it will not have a material impact on our existing environmental remediation
costs in California. Further, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) is considering whether to regulate hexavalent chromium.
California is also reevaluating its existing drinking water standard of 6 ppb for perchlorate, and the U.S. EPA is taking steps to regulate perchlorate in
drinking water. If substantially lower standards are adopted, in either California or at the federal level for perchlorate or for hexavalent chromium, we expect a
material increase in our estimates for environmental liabilities and the related assets for the portion of the increased costs that are probable of future recovery
in the pricing of our products and services for the U.S. Government. The amount that would be allocable to our non-U.S. Government contracts or that is
determined not to be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts would be expensed, which may have a material effect on our earnings in any particular
interim reporting period.
Operating Leases
We rent certain equipment and facilities under operating leases. Certain major plant facilities and equipment are furnished by the U.S. Government under
short-term or cancelable arrangements. Our total rental expense under operating leases was $247 million, $169 million and $202 million for 2018, 2017 and
2016. Future minimum lease commitments at December 31, 2018 for long-term non-cancelable operating leases were $1.3 billion ($305 million in 2019,
$184 million in 2020, $147 million in 2021, $114 million in 2022, $88 million in 2023 and $459 million in later years).

Table of Contents
Letters of Credit, Surety Bonds and Third-Party Guarantees
We have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds issued on our behalf by financial institutions, and directly issued guarantees to third
parties primarily relating to advances received from customers and the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts. Letters of credit and surety bonds
generally are available for draw down in the event we do not perform. In some cases, we may guarantee the contractual performance of third parties such as
venture partners. We had total outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and third-party guarantees aggregating $3.6 billion at December 31, 2018 and $3.3
billion at December 31, 2017. Third-party guarantees do not include guarantees of subsidiaries and other consolidated entities.
At December 31, 2018 and 2017, third-party guarantees totaled $850 million and $750 million, of which approximately 65% and 62% related to
guarantees of contractual performance of ventures to which we currently are or previously were a party. This amount represents our estimate of the maximum
amount we would expect to incur upon the contractual non-performance of the venture, venture partners or divested businesses. Generally, we also have
cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a venture partner.
In determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current
and former venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements all of which include a guarantee as required by the FAR. There were no material
amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.
United Launch Alliance
In connection with our 50% ownership interest of ULA, we and The Boeing Company (Boeing) were previously required to provide ULA an additional
capital contribution if ULA was unable to make required payments under its inventory supply agreement with Boeing. In the fourth quarter of 2018, ULA
fully satisfied its obligations under this inventory supply agreement and we no longer have any obligation to provide ULA an additional capital contribution
under this agreement.
Our share of ULA’s net earnings are reported as equity in net earnings (losses) of equity investees in other income, net on our consolidated statements of
earnings. Our investment in ULA totaled $687 million and $794 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017.
Note 15 – Severance and Restructuring Charges
2018 Actions
During 2018, we recorded charges totaling $96 million ($76 million, or $0.26 per share, after tax) related to certain severance and restructuring actions
at our RMS business segment. These charges consist of $75 million of severance costs for the planned elimination of certain positions through either
voluntary or involuntary actions and $21 million of asset impairment charges associated with our decision to consolidate certain operations. Upon separation,
terminated employees will receive lump-sum severance payments primarily based on years of service, a majority of which we expect to pay by the end of
2019. These actions resulted from a strategic review of our RMS business segment and are intended to improve the efficiency of our operations and better
align our organization and cost structure with changing economic conditions. We expect to recover a portion of the severance and restructuring charges
through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. Government and other customers in future periods, which will be included in RMS’ operating
results. During 2018, we paid approximately $33 million in severance payments associated with these actions.
2016 Actions
During 2016, we recorded severance charges totaling approximately $80 million related to our Aeronautics business segment. The charges consisted of
severance costs associated with the planned elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions. Upon separation, terminated
employees receive lump-sum severance payments primarily based on years of service, the majority of which are expected to be paid over the next several
quarters. As of the end of the first quarter of 2017, we had substantially paid the severance costs associated with these actions.

Assets measured at NAV             
Other commingled funds  18     19    
Substantially all assets measured at fair value, other than derivatives, represent investments held in a separate trust to fund certain of our non-qualified
deferred compensation plans and are recorded in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets. The fair values of mutual funds and certain other
securities are determined by reference to the quoted market price per unit in active markets multiplied by the number of units held without consideration of
transaction costs. The fair values of U.S. Government and other securities are determined using pricing models that use observable inputs (e.g., interest rates
and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. The
fair values of derivative instruments, which consist of foreign currency exchange forward and interest rate swap contracts, primarily are determined based on
the present value of future cash flows using model-derived valuations that use observable inputs such as interest rates, credit spreads and foreign currency
exchange rates.
In addition to the financial instruments listed in the table above, we hold other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables,
accounts payable and debt and commercial paper. The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable approximated their
fair values. The estimated fair value of our outstanding debt and commercial paper was $15.4 billion and $16.8 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The
outstanding principal amount was $15.3 billion and $15.5 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, excluding $1.2 billion of unamortized discounts and
issuance costs. The estimated fair values of our outstanding debt were determined based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets (Level 2).

(a) The sum of the quarterly earnings per share amounts do not equal the earnings per share amounts included on our consolidated statements of earnings. The difference in
2018  relates to the timing of our share repurchases. In addition to the timing of our share repurchases, the difference in 2017 was primarily due to the net loss in the fourth
quarter causin g any potentially dilutive securities to have an anti-dilutive effect, which resulted in the weighted average shares outstanding for basic and dilutive earnings
per share being equivalent.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control system is
designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
consolidated financial statements for external purposes.
Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. This assessment
was based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
(2013 framework). Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2018.
Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which is below.
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and
15d‑15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2018 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Regarding Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Lockheed Martin Corporation
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited Lockheed Martin Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO
criteria). In our opinion, Lockheed Martin Corporation (the Corporation) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2018, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated
balance sheets of the Corporation as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes and our report dated February 8, 2019 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Total 4,855,629  $ 79.76  7,596,723  
(1) Column (a) includes, as of December 31, 2018 : 1,411,295 shares that have been granted as restricted stock units (RSUs), 651,636 shares that could be earned pursuant to
grants of performance stock units (PSUs) (assuming the maximum number of PSUs are earned and payable at the end of the three-year performance period) and 1,773,965
shares granted as options under the Lockheed Martin Corporation 2011 Incentive Performance Award Plan (2011 IPA Plan) or predecessor plans and 19,660 shares
granted as options and 115,101 stock units payable in stock or cash under the Lockheed Martin Corporatio n Amended and Restated Directors Equity Plan (Directors Plan)
or predecessor plans for non-employee directors. Column (c) includes, as of December 31, 2018 , 4,706,450 shares available for future issuance under the 201 1 IPA Plan as
options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, RSUs or PSUs and 408,320 shares available for future issuance under the Directors Plan as stock options and
stock units. Of the 408,320  shares available for grant under the Directors Plan on December 31, 2018 , 5,172 are units issuable pursuant to grants made on January 31,
2019, which vest 50 perce nt on June 30 and 50 percent on December 31 following the grant date. Vested  stock units are payable to directors upon their termination of
service from our Board, except that directors who have satisfied the stock ownership guidelines may elect to have payment of awards made after January 1, 2018
beginning on March 31 following the vesting of the award. The weighted average price does not take into account shares issued pursuant to RSUs or PSUs.
(2) The shares represent annual incentive bonuses and Long-T erm Incentive Performance (LTIP) payments earned and voluntarily deferred by employees. The deferred
amounts are payable under the Deferred Management Incentive Compensation Plan (DMICP). Deferred amounts are credited as phantom stock units at the closing price
of our stock on the date the deferral is effective. Amounts equal to our dividend are credited as stock units at the time we pay a dividend. Following termination of
employment, a number of shares of stock equal to the number of stock units credited to the employee’ s DMICP account are distributed to the employee. There is no
discount or value transfer on the stock distributed. Distributions may be made from newly issued shares or shares purchased on the open market. Historically , all
distributions have come from shares held in a separate trust and, therefore, do not further dilute our common shares outstanding. As a result, these shares also were not
considered in calculating the total weighted average exercise price in the table. Because the DMICP shares are outstanding, they should be included in the denominator
(and not the numerator) of a dilution calculation.

SECTION 1. Purpose.
The purpose of this Plan is to benefit the Corporation’s stockholders by encouraging high levels of performance by individuals who contribute to the
success of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries and to enable the Corporation and its Subsidiaries to attract, motivate, retain and reward talented and
experienced individuals. This purpose is to be accomplished by providing eligible employees with an opportunity to obtain or increase their proprietary
interest in the Corporation and thereby align their interests with those of the Corporation’s stockholders, and by providing eligible employees with additional
incentives to join or remain with the Corporation and its Subsidiaries.

combination thereof, or (iii) any one or more segments or business units of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries, in either case as the Committee

days of the applicable event.
SECTION 3. Eligibility.
Any one or more Awards may be granted to any individual who is an Employee on the Date of Grant and who is designated by the Committee to
receive an Award, provided that no individual who beneficially owns Stock possessing five percent or more of the combined voting power of all classes of
stock of the Corporation shall be eligible to participate in this Plan.
SECTION 4. Awards.
(a) Type of Awards. The Committee may grant any of the following types of Awards, either singly or in combination with other Awards:
(1) Nonqualified Stock Options. A Nonqualified Stock Option is an Award in the form of an option to purchase Stock that is not intended to
comply with the requirements of Code Section 422 or any successor provision of the Code. The exercise price of each Nonqualified Stock Option
granted under this Plan shall be not less than the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the Date of Grant of the Option. All Nonqualified Stock Options
shall be treated as Performance-Based Awards subject to the applicable restrictions under Section 4(b).
4
(2) Incentive Stock Options. An Incentive Stock Option is an Award in the form of an option to purchase Stock that is intended to comply
with the requirements of Code Section 422 or any successor provision of the Code. The exercise price of each Incentive Stock Option granted under
this Plan shall be not less than the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the Date of Grant of the Option. To the extent that the aggregate “fair market
value” of Stock with respect to which one or more incentive stock options first become exercisable by a Participant in any calendar year exceeds
$100,000, taking into account both Stock subject to Incentive Stock Options under this Plan and stock subject to incentive stock options under all
other plans of the Corporation or of other entities referenced in Code Section 422(d)(1), the options shall be treated as Nonqualified Stock Options.
For this purpose, the “fair market value” of the Stock subject to options shall be determined as of the Date of Grant of the Options. All Incentive
Stock Options shall be treated as Performance-Based Awards subject to the applicable restrictions under Section 4(b).
(3) Stock Appreciation Rights. A Stock Appreciation Right or SAR is an Award in the form of a right to receive, upon surrender of the right,
but without other payment, an amount based on appreciation in the value of Stock over a base price established in the Award, payable in cash, Stock
or such other form or combination of forms of payout, at times and upon conditions as may be approved by the Committee. The minimum base price
of a SAR granted under this Plan shall be the Fair Market Value of the underlying Stock on the Date of Grant of the SAR, or, in the case of a SAR
related to an Option (whether already outstanding or concurrently granted), the exercise price of the related Option. All SARs shall be treated as
Performance-Based Awards subject to the applicable restrictions under Section 4(b).
(4) Restricted Stock. Restricted Stock is an Award of shares of Stock of the Corporation that are issued, but subject to restrictions on transfer
and/or such other restrictions on incidents of ownership as the Committee may determine. Awards of Restricted Stock to Executive Officers that are
either granted or vest upon attainment of one or more of the Performance Goals shall only be granted as Performance-Based Awards subject to the
applicable restrictions under Section 4(b).
(5) Stock Units. A Stock Unit is an Award payable in cash or Stock and represented by a bookkeeping entry where the amount represented
by the bookkeeping entry for each Stock Unit equals the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the Date of Grant and which amount shall be
subsequently increased or decreased to reflect the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on any date from the Date of Grant up to the date the Stock
Unit is paid to the Participant in cash or Stock. Stock Units are not outstanding shares of Stock and do not entitle a Participant to voting or other
rights with respect to Stock; provided, however, that an Award of Stock Units may provide for the crediting of Dividend Equivalents or the crediting
of additional Stock Units based on the value of dividends paid on Stock while the Award is outstanding, subject in each case to the vesting, forfeiture
and Performance Goals applicable to the underlying Stock Units. Awards of Stock Units to Executive Officers that are either granted or vest upon
attainment of one or more of the Performance Goals shall only be granted as Performance-Based Awards subject to the applicable restrictions under
Section 4(b).
(6) Cash-Based Awards. Cash-Based Awards are Awards that provide Participants with the opportunity to earn a cash payment based upon
the level of performance of the Corporation relative to one or more Performance Goals established by the Committee for an award cycle of more
than one but not more than five years. For each award cycle, the Committee shall determine the size of the Awards, the Performance Goals, the
performance targets as to each of the Performance Goals, the level or levels of achievement necessary for award payments and the weighting of the
Performance Goals, if more than one Performance Goal is applicable. Cash-Based Awards to Executive Officers that are either granted or become
vested, exercisable or payable based on attainment of one or more Performance Goals shall only be granted as Performance-Based Awards subject to
the applicable restrictions under Section 4(b).
(b) Special Performance-Based Awards. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any of the types of Awards listed in Section 4(a) may be
granted as awards that satisfy the requirements for “performance-based compensation” within the meaning of Code Section 162(m) (“Performance-Based
Awards”), the grant, vesting, exercisability or payment of which depends on the degree of achievement of the Performance Goals relative to pre-
5
established target levels. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 4(b) to the contrary, any Option or SAR shall be subject only to the requirements
of Section 4(b)(1) and Sections 4(c)(1) and (2) below in order for such Awards to satisfy the requirements for Performance-Based Awards under this
Section 4(b) (with such Awards referred to as a “Qualifying Option” or a “Qualifying Stock Appreciation Right,” respectively). With the exception of any
Qualifying Option or Qualifying Stock Appreciation Right, an Award that is intended to satisfy the requirements of this Section 4(b) shall be designated as a
Performance-Based Award at the time of grant. Nothing in this Plan shall limit the ability of the Committee to grant Options or SARs with an exercise price
or a base price greater than Fair Market Value on the Date of Grant or to make the vesting of the Options or SARs subject to Performance Goals or other
business objectives or conditions.
(1) Eligible Class. The eligible class of persons for Awards under this Section 4(b) shall be all Employees.
(2) Performance Goals. The performance goals for any Awards under this Section 4(b) (other than Qualifying Options and Qualifying Stock
Appreciation Rights) shall be, on an absolute, average or relative basis, one or more of the Performance Goals. The specific performance target(s)
with respect to Performance Goal(s) will be established by the Committee in advance of the deadlines applicable under Code Section 162(m) and
while the performance relating to the Performance Goal(s) remains substantially uncertain.
(3) Committee Certification. Before any Performance-Based Award under this Section 4(b) (other than Qualifying Options and Qualifying
Stock Appreciation Rights) is paid, the Committee must certify in writing (by resolution or otherwise) that the applicable Performance Goal(s) and
any other material terms of the Performance-Based Award were satisfied; provided, however, that a Performance-Based Award may be paid without
regard to the satisfaction of the applicable Performance Goal in the event of a Change in Control as provided in Section 7(b).
(4) Terms and Conditions of Awards; Committee Discretion to Reduce Performance Awards. The Committee shall have discretion to
determine the conditions, restrictions or other limitations, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Plan and Code Section 162(m), on the
payment of individual Performance-Based Awards under this Section 4(b). To the extent set forth in an Award Agreement, the Committee may
reserve the right to reduce the amount payable in accordance with any standards or on any other basis (including the Committee's discretion), as the
Committee may determine.
(5) Adjustments for Material Changes. The Committee shall have the right to specify any adjustment that it deems necessary or appropriate
to any Performance Goals and/or performance targets to take into account or exclude any extraordinary gain or loss or other event that is considered
an extraordinary item under GAAP, provided the Committee exercises this right to specify the adjustment at the time the Performance Goals and/or
performance targets are established under this Section 4(b). In addition, the Committee shall have the right to specify any adjustment that it deems
necessary or appropriate to take into account or exclude any other gain or loss or event recognized under any accounting policy or practice affecting
the Corporation and/or any Performance Goals or performance targets, provided the Committee exercises this right to exclude or take such gain or
loss or event into account at the time the related Performance Goals and/or performance targets are established under this Section 4(b).
(6) Interpretation. Except as specifically provided in this Section 4(b), the provisions of this Plan and any Award Agreement shall be
interpreted and administered by the Committee in a manner consistent with the requirements for qualification of Performance-Based Awards granted
to Executive Officers as “performance-based compensation” under Code Section 162(m) and the regulations thereunder.
6
(c) Individual Limits.
(1) Share-Based Awards. The maximum number of shares of Stock that are issuable under this Plan pursuant to Options, SARs payable in
shares of Stock, Restricted Stock and Stock Units payable in shares of Stock (described under Section 4(a)(5)) that are granted as Performance-
Based Awards during any calendar year to any Participant shall not exceed 1,000,000, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 7; provided, that
the maximum number of shares of Stock that may be granted as Restricted Stock Awards during any calendar year to any Participant under this Plan
(including as Performance-Based Awards) shall not exceed 750,000 shares, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 7. Awards that are canceled
during the year shall be counted against these limits.
(2) Share Unit and Cash Only SAR Awards. The aggregate number of Share Units that are issuable as Stock Units payable in cash only or
SARs payable in cash only during any calendar year to any Participant as Performance-Based Awards shall not exceed 300,000, subject to
adjustment as provided in Section 7. Awards that are canceled due to expiration or forfeiture during the year shall be counted against this limit.
(3) Cash-Based Awards. The aggregate amount of compensation to be paid to any Participant in respect of those Cash-Based Awards that
are granted during any calendar year as Performance-Based Awards shall not exceed $10,000,000.
(d) Maximum Term of Awards. No Award that contemplates exercise or conversion may be exercised or converted to any extent, and no other Award
that defers vesting, shall remain outstanding and unexercised, unconverted or unvested more than ten years after the Date of Grant of the Award.
(e) Code Section 409A. It is the intent of the Corporation that no Award under this Plan be subject to taxation under Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code.
Accordingly, if the Committee determines that an Award granted under this Plan is subject to Section 409A of the Code, such Award shall be interpreted and
administered to meet the requirements of Sections 409A(a)(2), (3) and (4) of the Code and thus to be exempt from taxation under Section 409A(a)(1) of the
Code. 
(f) Out-of-the-Money Options or Stock Appreciation Rights. In no event shall the Corporation pay cash or other consideration for Options where at
the time of payment the exercise price of the Option is less than the Fair Market Value of the Stock underlying the Option or pay cash or other consideration
for SARs where at the time of payment the base price established in the Award is less than the Fair Market Value of the Stock underlying the SAR.
SECTION 5. Shares of Stock and Share Units Available Under Plan.
(a) Aggregate Share Limit for Share-Based Awards. Subject to adjustment as provided in this Section 5 or Section 7, the maximum number of shares
of Stock that may be subject to Options (including Incentive Stock Options), SARs payable in shares of Stock, Restricted Stock and Stock Units payable in
shares of Stock granted or issued under this Plan is 12,000,000, plus the number of shares of Stock reserved for future awards under the Predecessor Plan as
of February 24, 2011, plus the number of shares of Stock subject to awards outstanding under the Predecessor Plan as of February 24, 2011 that thereafter are
unexercised, unconverted or undistributed as a result of termination, expiration or forfeiture of the award, whether or not the individual holding the award
received or was credited with benefits of ownership (such as dividends, Dividend Equivalents or voting rights) during the period in which the individual's
ownership was restricted or otherwise not vested, including shares of Stock subject to Restricted Stock Awards that are subsequently reacquired by the
Corporation due to termination, expiration or forfeiture.
(b) Restriction on Recycling or Reissue of Shares and Share Units. Shares of Stock issued upon the exercise of an Award or the vesting of an Award
may not be used for a subsequent Award under this Plan. Any unexercised, unconverted or undistributed portion of any Award made under this Plan or any
stock-based award under the Predecessor Plan resulting from termination, expiration or forfeiture of that Award shall again be available
7
for Award under Section 5(a), whether or not the Participant has received or been credited with benefits of ownership (such as dividends, Dividend
Equivalents or voting rights) during the period in which the Participant's ownership was restricted or otherwise not vested. Shares of Stock that are issued
pursuant to Restricted Stock Awards and subsequently reacquired by the Corporation due to termination, expiration or forfeiture of the Award also shall be
available for reissuance under this Plan. Shares of Stock subject to an Award that are reacquired by the Corporation to satisfy a withholding obligation of the
Participant shall not be available for reissue. With respect to SARs payable in shares of Stock, the number of shares of Stock subject to an Award shall be
counted against the number of shares of Stock available for issuance under this Plan regardless of the number of shares of Stock actually issued to settle the
SARs upon exercise.
(c) Interpretive Issues. Additional rules for determining the number of shares of Stock or Share Units authorized under this Plan or available for
grant or issuance from time to time may be adopted by the Committee, as it deems necessary or appropriate.
(d) Source of Shares; No Fractional Shares. The Stock that may be issued pursuant to an Award under this Plan may be authorized but unissued
Stock or Stock acquired by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, subsequently or in anticipation of a transaction under this Plan, in the open market or in
privately negotiated transactions. No fractional shares of Stock shall be issued under this Plan, but fractional interests may be accumulated pursuant to the
terms of an Award.
(e) Consideration. The Stock issued under this Plan may be issued (subject to Section 10(d)) for any lawful form of consideration, the value of which
equals the par value of the Stock or such greater or lesser value as the Committee, consistent with Sections 10(d), may require.
(f) Purchase or Exercise Price; Withholding. The exercise or purchase price (if any) of the Stock issuable pursuant to any Award and any withholding
obligation under applicable tax laws shall be paid in cash or, subject to the Committee's express authorization and the terms, restrictions, conditions and
procedures as the Committee may in its sole discretion impose (subject to Section 10(d)), any one or combination of (i) cash, (ii) the delivery of shares of
Stock, (iii) a reduction in the number of Shares of Stock issuable or cash payable pursuant to such Award, (iv) the delivery of a promissory note or other
obligation for the future payment in money, or (v) in the case of purchase price only, labor or service as an Employee to be performed or actually performed.
In the case of a payment by the means described in clause (ii) or (iii) above, the Stock to be so delivered or offset shall be determined by reference to the Fair
Market Value of the Stock on the date as of which the payment or offset is made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Insider shall be permitted to satisfy the
purchase or exercise price or withholding obligation with respect to an Award by using a method of payment otherwise authorized under this Plan or an
Award Agreement if such method of payment would constitute a personal loan under Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act. If an Award Agreement to a
Participant who is not an Insider authorizes a method of payment that would constitute a personal loan under Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act and the
Participant subsequently becomes an Insider, then the payment method will no longer be available to the Participant and the Committee shall take whatever
steps are necessary to make such payment method void as to such Participant, including but not limited to requiring the immediate payment of any note or
loan previously obtained in connection with an Award.
(g) Cashless Exercise. Subject to any restrictions on Insiders pursuant to Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act, the Committee may permit the exercise
of an Award and payment of any applicable withholding tax in respect of an Award by delivery of notice, subject to the Corporation's receipt from a third
party of payment (or commitment to make payment) in full in cash for the exercise price and the applicable withholding prior to issuance of Stock, in the
manner and subject to the procedures as may be established by the Committee.
SECTION 6. Award Agreements.
Each Award under this Plan shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement in a form approved by the Committee setting forth, in the case of Share-
Based Awards, the number of shares of Stock or Share Units, as applicable, subject to the Award, and the price (if any) and term of the Award and, in the case
of Performance-Based Awards (other than a Qualifying Option or a Qualifying Stock Appreciation Right), the applicable Performance
8
Goals. The Award Agreement also shall set forth (or incorporate by reference) other material terms and conditions applicable to the Award as determined by
the Committee consistent with the limitations of this Plan.
(a) Mandatory Provisions for Options and SARs. Award Agreements for Options and SARs payable in stock shall be deemed to contain the
following provisions:
(1) Vesting: A provision providing for a minimum vesting schedule pursuant to which no Award of Options may become fully exercisable
prior to the third anniversary of the Date of Grant, and to the extent an Award provides for vesting in installments over a period of no less than three
years, no portion of an Award of Options may become exercisable prior to the first anniversary of the Date of Grant. In the event that the Participant
is not an Employee on the date on which an Option would otherwise vest and become exercisable, the Options subject to that vesting date will be
forfeited. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) any Award Agreement governing Options may provide for any additional vesting requirements,
including but not limited to longer periods of required employment or the achievement of Performance Goals; (ii) any Award Agreement may
provide that all or a portion of the Options subject to an Award vest immediately or, alternatively, vest in accordance with the vesting schedule but
without regard to the requirement for continued employment with the Corporation (or a Subsidiary) in the event of a Change in Control, or in the
case of termination of employment with the Corporation (or a Subsidiary) due to death, disability, layoff, retirement or divestiture, or in the case of a
vesting period longer than three years, vest and become exercisable or fail to be forfeited and continue to vest in accordance with the schedule in the
Award Agreement prior to the expiration of any period longer than three years for any reason designated by the Committee; and (iii) any Award
Agreement may provide that employment by another entity be treated as employment by the Corporation (or a Subsidiary) in the event a Participant
terminates employment with the Corporation (or a Subsidiary) on account of a divestiture. No Award Agreement may provide for accelerated vesting
of Options on account of layoff beyond vesting of up to the portion of the vesting period from the Date of Grant to the date on which a Participant's
employment terminates. The vesting requirements of this Section 6(a) shall also apply to Award Agreements governing SARs.
(2) Option and SAR Holding Period: Subject to the authority of the Committee under Section 7, a minimum six-month period shall elapse
between the date of initial grant of any Option or SAR paid in Stock and the sale of the underlying shares of Stock, and the Corporation may impose
legend and other restrictions on the Stock issued on exercise of the Options or SARs to enforce this requirement.
(3) No Waivers: A provision that neither the Committee nor the Board of Directors has retained the authority to waive the requirements set
forth in Sections 6(a)(1).
(b) Mandatory Provisions for Restricted Stock and Stock Units Payable in Stock. Award Agreements for Restricted Stock and Stock Units payable in
Stock shall be deemed to contain the following provisions: 
(1) Vesting: Provisions (I) requiring (A) a minimum vesting schedule pursuant to which no Award of Restricted Stock may become fully
vested prior to the third anniversary of the Date of Grant, and to the extent an Award provides for vesting in installments over a period of no less than
three years, no portion of an Award of Restricted Stock may become vested prior to the six-month anniversary of the Date of Grant, and (B)
forfeiture of shares of Restricted Stock that remain unvested pursuant to the terms of the Award Agreement at the time a Participant ceases to be an
Employee, (II) prohibiting accelerated immediate full vesting of Restricted Stock on account of layoff and (III) prohibiting the sale or other transfer
of any shares of Restricted Stock granted under an Award prior to the date on which such shares become vested pursuant to the terms of the Award
Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Award Agreement governing Restricted Stock may provide (i) for any additional vesting or forfeiture
requirements, including but not limited to longer periods of required employment or the achievement of Performance Goals; and (ii) that Restricted
Stock vests, continues to vest or vests on a pro rata basis and any forfeiture provisions or restrictions on sale of the vested portions of Restricted
Stock lapse prior to the third anniversary of the Date of Grant (A) in the event of a termination
9
of employment following a Change in Control (except that vesting may occur upon or following a Change in Control without regard to termination
of employment in the case of an employee who immediately prior to the Change in Control was not an officer of the Corporation who had been
elected as such by the Board), (B) in the case of termination of employment with the Corporation (or a Subsidiary) due to death, disability, layoff,
retirement or divestiture (except that immediate vesting on account of layoff is limited to a pro rata portion of the Award based on the portion of the
vesting period from the Date of Grant to the date on which a Participant’s employment terminates), (C) to satisfy any Tax withholding requirement
with respect to the Restricted Stock, or (D) in the case of a vesting or forfeiture period longer than three years, prior to the expiration of any period
longer than three years for any reason designated by the Committee. Dividends that become payable on Restricted Stock will not be payable to the
Participant but shall be accrued and held by the Corporation until such time as the restrictions lapse on the underlying Restricted Stock and the
shares become transferrable, at which time the accrued dividends shall be paid to the Participant; provided, however, that an Award Agreement may
provide for accelerated vesting of Dividends, Dividend Equivalents, or DDEs associated with Restricted Stock to satisfy a Tax withholding
requirement with respect to such Award. The vesting and forfeiture requirements of this Section 6(b) shall also apply to Award Agreements
governing Stock Units payable in Stock unless the Stock Units are granted in conjunction with, or are part of, another Award.
(2) No Waivers: A provision that neither the Committee nor the Board of Directors has retained the authority to waive the requirements set
forth in Section 6(b)(1).
(c) Mandatory Provisions Applicable to All Award Agreements. Award Agreements shall be subject to the terms of this Plan and shall be deemed to
include the following terms, unless the Committee in the Award Agreement consistent with applicable legal considerations, provides otherwise:
(1) Non-assignability: The Award shall not be assignable nor transferable, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and
during the lifetime of a Participant, the Award shall be exercised only by the Participant or by his or her guardian or legal representative. The
designation of a Beneficiary hereunder shall not constitute a transfer prohibited by the foregoing provisions.
(2) Rights as Stockholder: A Participant shall have no rights as a holder of Stock with respect to any unissued securities covered by an
Award until the date the Participant becomes the holder of record of the securities. Except in the case of Restricted Stock and except as provided in
Section 7, no adjustment or other provision shall be made for dividends or other stockholder rights, except to the extent that the Award Agreement
provides for Dividend Equivalents or similar economic benefits.
(3) Tax Withholding: Each Participant shall be responsible for payment of all Taxes imposed on such Participant with respect to an Award.
All withholding Tax obligations shall be satisfied on or prior to the payment of an Award.  If the Corporation concludes that any withholding Tax is
required with respect to any Award (including with respect to associated Dividends, Dividend Equivalents, or DDEs), and the Participant has not
otherwise made arrangements acceptable to the Corporation to satisfy the withholding Tax obligation, the Corporation may (i) offset an amount for
Tax withholding against any obligation of the Corporation to the Participant, (ii) reduce the amount of the Award (including associated Dividends,
Dividend Equivalents, or DDEs) paid to the Participant to pay Tax withholding, or (iii) require the Participant or his or her Beneficiary to pay the
Corporation an amount in cash to pay Tax withholding. The satisfaction of any withholding Taxes with respect to Share-Based Awards also may be
satisfied by cashless exercise as provided in Section 5(g).
(d) Other Provisions. Award Agreements may include other terms and conditions as the Committee shall approve, including but not limited
to the following:
(1) Other Terms and Conditions: Any other terms not inconsistent with the terms of this Plan as are necessary, appropriate, or desirable to
effect an Award to a Participant, including provisions describing the treatment of an Award in the event of the death, disability, layoff, retirement,
divestiture or other
10
termination of a Participant's employment with or services to the Corporation or a Subsidiary, any provisions relating to the vesting, exercisability,
forfeiture or cancellation of the Award, any requirements for continued employment, any other restrictions or conditions (including performance
requirements and holding periods) of the Award and the method by which the restrictions or conditions lapse, procedures acceptable to the
Committee (if any) with respect to the effect on the Award of a Change in Control, subject, in the case of Performance-Based Awards, to the
requirements for “performance-based compensation” under Code Section 162(m) and in the case of Options, SARs payable in shares of Stock,
Restricted Stock and Stock Units payable in shares of Stock, to the requirements of Sections 6(a), (b) and (7).
(2) Non-competition and non-solicitation clause: A provision or provisions requiring the forfeiture or recoupment of an Award (whether or
not vested) on account of activities deemed by the Committee in its sole discretion to be harmful to the Corporation, including but not limited to
employment with a competitor, misuse of the Corporation's proprietary or confidential information, or solicitation of the Corporation's employees.
(3) Claw-back: A provision entitling the Corporation to recoup any Award (whether or not vested) or value received for an Award under
circumstances specified in the Award Agreement or regulations, rules or interpretations of the Securities and Exchange Commission or other
applicable law.
(e) Contract Rights, Forms and Signatures. Any obligation of the Corporation to any Participant with respect to an Award shall be based solely upon
contractual obligations created by this Plan and an Award Agreement. Subject to the provisions of Section 8(h), no Award shall be enforceable until the
Award Agreement or an acknowledgement of receipt has been signed by the Participant and on behalf of the Corporation by an Executive Officer (other than
the recipient) or his or her delegate. By executing the Award Agreement or otherwise providing an acknowledgement of receipt, a Participant shall be deemed
to have accepted and consented to the terms of this Plan and any action taken in good faith under this Plan by and within the discretion of the Committee, the
Board of Directors or their delegates. Unless the Award Agreement otherwise expressly provides, there shall be no third party beneficiaries of the obligations
of the Corporation to the Participant under the Award Agreement.
SECTION 7. Adjustments; Change in Control; Acquisitions.
(a) Adjustments. If there shall occur any recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split (including a stock split in the form of a stock dividend), reverse
stock split, merger, combination, consolidation, or other reorganization or any extraordinary dividend or other extraordinary distribution in respect of the
Stock (whether in the form of cash, Stock or other property), or any split-up, spin-off, split-off, extraordinary redemption, or exchange of outstanding Stock,
or there shall occur any other similar corporate transaction or event in respect of the Stock, or a sale of all or substantially all the assets of the Corporation as
an entirety, then the Committee shall, in the manner and to the extent, if any, as it deems appropriate and equitable to the Participants and consistent with the
terms of this Plan, and taking into consideration the effect of the event on the holders of the Stock, proportionately adjust any or all of the following:
(1) the number and type of shares of Stock and Share Units that thereafter may be made the subject of Awards (including the specific
maximum and numbers of shares of Stock or Share Units set forth elsewhere in this Plan),
(2) the number and type of shares of Stock, Share Units, cash or other property subject to any or all outstanding Awards,
(3) the grant, purchase or exercise price, or conversion ratio of any or all outstanding Awards, or of the Stock, other property or Share Units
underlying the Awards,
(4) the securities, cash or other property deliverable upon exercise or conversion of any or all outstanding Awards,
11
(5) subject to Section 4(b), the Performance Goals or other standards appropriate to any outstanding Performance-Based Awards, or
 (6) any other terms as are affected by the event.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, no adjustment shall be made that would cause this Plan to violate Section 424(a) of
the Code or any successor provisions thereto, without the written consent of the Participant adversely affected thereby. The Committee may act prior to an
event described in this Section 7(a) (including at the time of an Award by means of more specific provisions in the Award Agreement) if deemed necessary or
appropriate to permit the Participant to realize the benefits intended to be conveyed by an Award in respect of the Stock in the case of an event described in
Section 7(a).
(b) Change in Control. The Committee may, in the Award Agreement, provide for the effect of a Change in Control on an Award. Such provisions
may include but are not limited to any one or more of the following with respect to any or all Awards: (i) the specific consequences of a Change in Control on
the Awards; (ii) the acceleration or extension of time periods for purposes of exercising, vesting in, or realizing gain from, the Awards; (iii) a reservation of
the Committee's right to determine in its discretion at any time that there shall be full acceleration or no acceleration of benefits under the Awards; (iv) that
only certain or limited benefits under the Awards shall be accelerated; (v) that the Awards shall be accelerated for a limited time only; or (vi) that acceleration
of the Awards shall be subject to additional conditions precedent (such as a termination of employment following a Change in Control).
In addition to any action required or authorized by the terms of an Award, the Committee may take any other action it deems appropriate to ensure
the equitable treatment of Participants in the event of or in anticipation of a Change in Control, including but not limited to any one or more of the following
with respect to any or all Awards: (i) the waiver of conditions on the Awards that were imposed for the benefit of the Corporation; (ii) provision for the cash
settlement of the Awards for their equivalent cash value, as determined by the Committee, as of the date of a Change in Control; (iii) provisions for the
assumption or continuation of the Award and the substitution for shares of stock of a successor entity, or a parent or subsidiary thereof, with appropriate
adjustments as to the number of shares, exercise or conversion price and conditions of the Award; or (iv) such other modification or adjustment to the Awards
as the Committee deems appropriate to maintain and protect the rights and interests of Participants upon or following a Change in Control. The Committee
also may accord any Participant a right to refuse any acceleration of exercisability, vesting or benefits, whether pursuant to the Award Agreement or
otherwise, in such circumstances as the Committee may approve.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7(b) or any provision in an Award Agreement to the contrary, if any Award to any Insider is
accelerated to a date that is less than six months after the Date of Grant, the Committee may prohibit a sale of the underlying Stock (other than a sale by
operation of law), and the Corporation may impose legend and other restrictions on the Stock to enforce this prohibition.
(c) Change in Control Definition. For purposes of this Plan, a “Change in Control” shall include and be deemed to occur upon one or more of the
following events:
(1) A tender offer or exchange offer is consummated for the ownership of securities of the Corporation representing 25 percent or more of
the combined voting power of the Corporation's then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote in the election of directors of the Corporation.
(2) The consummation of a merger, combination, consolidation, recapitalization, or other reorganization of the Corporation with one or
more other entities that are not Subsidiaries if, as a result of the consummation of the merger, combination, consolidation, recapitalization or other
reorganization, less than 75 percent of the outstanding voting securities of the surviving or resulting corporation shall immediately after the event be
owned in the aggregate by the stockholders of the Corporation (directly or indirectly), determined on the basis of record ownership as of the date of
determination of holders entitled to vote on the action (or in the absence of a vote, the day immediately prior to the event).
12
(3) Any person (as this term is used in Sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, but excluding any person described in and
satisfying the conditions of Rule 13d-1(b)(1) thereunder), becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly
or indirectly, of securities of the Corporation representing 25 percent or more of the combined voting power of the Corporation's then outstanding
securities entitled to vote in the election of directors of the Corporation.
(4) At any time within any period of two years after a tender offer, merger, combination, consolidation, recapitalization, or other
reorganization or a contested director election, or any combination of these events, the “Incumbent Directors” shall cease to constitute at least a
majority of the authorized number of members of the Board. For purposes hereof, “Incumbent Directors” shall mean the persons who were members
of the Board immediately before the first of these events and the persons who were elected or nominated as their successors or pursuant to increases
in the size of the Board by a vote of at least three-fourths of the Board members who were then Board members (or successors or additional
members so elected or nominated).
(5) The stockholders of the Corporation approve a plan of liquidation and dissolution of the Corporation, or a sale or transfer of all or
substantially all of the Corporation's business and/or assets as an entirety to an entity that is not a Subsidiary is consummated.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Committee determines that an Award could be subject to taxation under Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code, a
Change in Control shall have no effect on the Award unless the Change in Control also would constitute a change in the ownership or effective control of the
Corporation or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Corporation within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Code.
(d) Business Acquisitions. Awards may be granted under this Plan on terms and conditions as the Committee considers appropriate, which may differ
from those otherwise required by this Plan, to the extent necessary to reflect a substitution for or assumption of stock incentive awards held by employees of
other entities who become Employees of the Corporation or a Subsidiary as the result of a merger, consolidation or business combination of the employing
entity with, or the acquisition of assets or stock of the employing entity by, the Corporation or a Subsidiary, directly or indirectly.
SECTION 8. Administration.
(a) Committee Authority and Structure. This Plan and all Awards granted under this Plan shall be administered by the Management Development
and Compensation Committee of the Board or such other committee of the Board as may be designated by the Board and constituted so as to permit this Plan
to comply with the disinterested administration requirements of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act and the “outside director” requirement of Code
Section 162(m). The Board shall designate the members of the Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any action taken under this Plan by the
Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board or such other committee of the Board as may be designated by the Board to administer
this Plan and Awards granted under this Plan shall be valid and effective whether or not members of the Committee at the time of such action are later
determined not to have satisfied the requirements for membership set forth in this Section 8(a) or otherwise provided in any charter of the Committee.
(b) Selection and Grant. The Committee shall have the authority to determine the Employees to whom Awards will be granted under this Plan, the
type of Award or Awards to be made, and the nature, amount, pricing, timing, and other terms of Awards to be made to any one or more of these individuals,
subject to the terms of this Plan.
(c) Construction and Interpretation. The Committee shall have the power to interpret and administer this Plan and Award Agreements, and to adopt,
amend and rescind related rules and procedures. All questions of interpretation and determinations with respect to this Plan, the number of shares of Stock,
SARs, or Share Units or other Awards granted, and the terms of any Award Agreements, the adjustments required or permitted by Section 7, and other
determinations hereunder shall be made by the Committee and its determination shall be final and
13
conclusive upon all parties in interest. In the event of any conflict between an Award Agreement and any non-discretionary provisions of this Plan, the terms
of this Plan shall govern.
(d) Limited Authority of Committee to Change Terms of Awards. In addition to the Committee's authority under other provisions of this Plan
(including Sections 7 and 9), the Committee shall have the authority to accelerate the exercisability or vesting of an Award, to extend the term or waive early
termination provisions of an Award (subject to the maximum ten-year term under Section 4(d)), and to waive the Corporation's rights with respect to an
Award or restrictive conditions of an Award (including forfeiture conditions), in any case in such circumstances as the Committee deems appropriate.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee's authority under this Section 8(d) is subject to any express limitations of this Plan (including under Sections
6(a), 6(b), 7 and 9) and this Section 8(d) does not authorize the Committee to accelerate exercisability or vesting or waive early termination provisions if that
acceleration or waiver would be inconsistent with the mandatory vesting requirements set forth in Sections 6(a)(1) and 6(b)(1).
(e) Rule 16b-3 Conditions; Bifurcation of Plan. It is the intent of the Corporation that this Plan and Share-Based Awards hereunder satisfy and be
interpreted in a manner, that, in the case of Participants who are or may be Insiders, satisfies any applicable requirements of Rule 16b-3, so that these persons
will be entitled to the benefits of Rule 16b-3 or other exemptive rules under Section 16 under the Exchange Act and will not be subjected to avoidable liability
thereunder as to Awards intended to be entitled to the benefits of Rule 16b-3. If any provision of this Plan or of any Award would otherwise frustrate or
conflict with the intent expressed in this Section 8(e), that provision to the extent possible shall be interpreted and deemed amended so as to avoid such
conflict. To the extent of any remaining irreconcilable conflict with this intent, the provision shall be deemed disregarded as to Awards intended as Rule 16b-3
exempt Awards. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, the provisions of this Plan may at any time be bifurcated by the Board or the
Committee in any manner so that certain provisions of this Plan or any Award Agreement intended (or required in order) to satisfy the applicable
requirements of Rule 16b-3 are only applicable to Insiders and to those Awards to Insiders intended to satisfy the requirements of Rule 16b-3.
(f) Delegation and Reliance. The Committee, in its discretion, may delegate to the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation all or part of the
Committee’s authority and duties with respect to granting Awards (but in no event with respect to Awards to Participants who are Insiders on the date of any
such Awards), provided such delegation is in writing and is consistent with any limitations under the Maryland General Corporation Law. A copy of any such
delegation shall be maintained in the records of the actions of the Committee. The Committee may revoke or amend the terms of such delegation at any time,
but such revocation shall not invalidate prior actions of the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation that were consistent with the terms of the Plan. The
Committee may also delegate to the officers or employees of the Corporation the administrative authority to execute and deliver those instruments and
documents, to do all acts and things, and to take all other steps deemed necessary, advisable or convenient for the effective administration of this Plan in
accordance with its terms and purpose. In making any determination or in taking or not taking any action under this Plan, the Board, the Committee and any
person to whom authority has been delegated under this Plan may obtain and may rely upon the advice of experts, including professional advisors to the
Corporation. No director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation shall be liable for any such action or determination taken or made or omitted in good
faith.
(g) Exculpation and Indemnity. Neither the Corporation nor any member of the Board of Directors or of the Committee, nor any other person
participating in any determination under this Plan, or in the interpretation, administration or application of this Plan, shall have any liability to any party for
any action taken or not taken in good faith under this Plan or for the failure of an Award (or action in respect of an Award) to satisfy Code requirements as to
incentive stock options or to realize other intended tax consequences, to qualify for exemption or relief under Rule 16b-3 or to comply with any other law,
compliance with which is not required on the part of the Corporation.
(h) Notices, Signature, Delivery. Whenever a signature, notice or delivery of a document, or acknowledgement of receipt of a document, is required
or appropriate under this Plan or pursuant to an Award Agreement, signature, notice, delivery or acknowledgement may be accomplished by paper or written
format, or, subject to Section 10(d), by electronic means. In the event electronic means are used for the signature, notice or
14
delivery of a document, or acknowledgement of receipt of a document, the electronic record or confirmation of that signature, notice, delivery or
acknowledgement maintained by or on behalf of the Corporation shall for purposes of this Plan and any applicable Award Agreement be treated as if it was a
written signature, notice or acknowledgement and was delivered in the manner provided herein for a written document.
SECTION 9. Amendment and Termination of this Plan.
The Board of Directors may at any time terminate, suspend or discontinue this Plan. The Board of Directors may amend this Plan at any time,
provided that any material amendment to this Plan will not be effective unless approved by the Corporation's stockholders. For this purpose, a material
amendment is any amendment that would (i) materially increase the number of shares of Stock available under this Plan or issuable to a Participant (other
than a change in the number of shares made pursuant to Section 7); (ii) change the types of awards that may be granted under this Plan; (iii) expand the class
of persons eligible to receive awards or otherwise participate in this Plan; (iv) reduce the price at which an Option is exercisable or the base price of a SAR,
either by amendment of an Award Agreement or by substitution of a new Award at a reduced price (other than as permitted in Section 7); or (v) require
stockholder approval pursuant to the New Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual (so long as the Corporation is a listed company on the New York Stock
Exchange) or applicable law. The Committee may at any time alter or amend any or all Award Agreements under this Plan in any manner that would be
authorized for a new Award under this Plan, including but not limited to any manner set forth in Section 8(d) (subject to any applicable limitations
thereunder), so long as such an amendment would not require approval of the Corporation's stockholders, if such amendment was made to this Plan.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such action by the Board or the Committee shall, in any manner adverse to a Participant other than as expressly permitted
by the terms of an Award Agreement, affect any Award then outstanding and evidenced by an Award Agreement without the consent in writing of the
Participant or a Beneficiary who has become entitled to an Award thereunder.
SECTION 10. Miscellaneous.
(a) Unfunded Plan. This Plan shall be unfunded. Neither the Corporation, the Board of Directors nor the Committee shall be required to segregate
any assets that may at any time be represented by Awards made pursuant to this Plan. Neither the Corporation, the Board of Directors, nor the Committee
shall be deemed to be a trustee of any amounts to be paid or securities to be issued under this Plan.
(b) Rights of Employees.
(1) No Right to an Award. Status as an Employee shall not be construed as a commitment that any one or more Awards will be made under
this Plan to an Employee or to Employees generally. Status as a Participant shall not entitle the Participant to any additional future Awards.
(2) No Assurance of Employment. Nothing contained in this Plan (or in any other documents related to this Plan or to any Award) shall
confer upon any Employee or Participant any right to continue in the employ or other service of the Corporation or any Subsidiary or constitute any
contract (of employment or otherwise) or limit in any way the right of the Corporation or any Subsidiary to change a person's compensation or other
benefits or to terminate the employment of a person with or without cause.
(c) Effective Date; Duration. This Plan has been adopted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation and shall become effective upon and shall be
subject to the approval of the Corporation's stockholders. This Plan shall remain in effect until any and all Awards under this Plan have been exercised,
converted or terminated under the terms of this Plan and applicable Award Agreements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Award may be granted under this
Plan after April 27, 2021. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Award granted under this Plan on or prior to April 27, 2021 may be amended after such date in
any manner that would have been permitted prior to such date, except that no such amendment shall increase the number of shares of Stock or Stock Units
subject to, comprising or referenced in such Award (other than in accordance with Section 7(a)).
15
(d) Compliance with Laws. This Plan, Award Agreements, and the grant, exercise, conversion, operation and vesting of Awards, and the issuance and
delivery of shares of Stock and/or other securities or property or the payment of cash under this Plan, Awards or Award Agreements, are subject to
compliance with all applicable federal and state laws, rules and regulations (including but not limited to state and federal insider trading, registration,
reporting and other securities laws and federal margin requirements) and to such approvals by any listing, regulatory or governmental authority as may, in the
opinion of counsel for the Corporation, be necessary or advisable to comply with all legal requirements. Any securities delivered under this Plan shall be
subject to such restrictions (and the person acquiring such securities shall, if requested by the Corporation, provide such evidence, assurance and
representations to the Corporation as to compliance with any thereof) as counsel to the Corporation may deem necessary or desirable to assure compliance
with all applicable legal requirements.
(e) Applicable Law. This Plan, Award Agreements and any related documents and matters shall be governed by and in accordance with the laws of
the State of Maryland (without regard to its provisions regarding choice of law), except as to matters of federal law.
(f) Awards to Participants Outside the United States. Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, in order to comply with the laws of
other countries in which the Corporation and its Subsidiaries operate or have employees, the Committee shall have the authority to modify the terms and
conditions of Awards granted to Employees outside the United States to comply with applicable foreign laws and to take any action, before or after an Award
is made, that it deems necessary or advisable to obtain approval or comply with local government, regulatory, tax, exemption, approval or other requirements.
(g) Non-Exclusivity of Plan. Nothing in this Plan shall limit or be deemed to limit the authority of the Corporation, the Board of Directors or the
Committee to grant awards or authorize any other compensation, with or without reference to the Stock, under any other plan or authority.

Exhibit 10.26
LOCKHEED MAR TIN CORPORA TION
CONSOLIDA TED SUPPLEMENT AL RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN
As Amended and Restated Effective October 5, 2018
    
LOCKHEED MAR TIN CORPORA TION
CONSOLIDA TED SUPPLEMENT AL RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN
As Amended and Restated Effective
October 5, 2018
Effective December 31, 2017, LOCKHEED MAR TIN CORPORA TION (the “Corporation”) amended and restated the Lockheed
Martin Corporation Consolidated Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan.
Prior to December 31, 2016, the Corporation maintained a number of separate and distinct nonqualified supplemental defined
benefit pension plans for select employees, including the following:
(1)the Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan (the “SRP”);
(2)the Lockheed Martin Supplementary Pension Plan For T ransferred Employees of GE Operations (the “GE T ransfer Plan”);
and
(3)the Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan For Certain Transferred Employees of Lockheed Martin Corporation (formerly
known as the Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan for Certain T ransferred Employees of Lockheed Corporation) (the
“LMC T ransfer Plan” and, together with the SRP and GE T ransfer Plan, the “Component Plans”).
The Component Plans contained numerous terms and features which were common to all three plans, along with some features
unique to the particular plan.
Effective December 31, 2016, the Component Plans were mer ged into and with each other into the SRP , which was the surviving
plan. The surviving plan was renamed the Lockheed Martin Corporation Consolidated Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan
(referred to herein as the “Plan”). The Plan consists of three parts or components:
(1)the SRP Component (consisting of the former SRP , which includes the Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan of Lockheed
Martin Corporation (formerly the Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan of Lockheed Corporation), the Lockheed Martin
Corporation Supplemental Excess Retirement Plan (formerly the Martin Marietta Corporation Supplemental Excess
Retirement Plan), the Lockheed Martin Supplemental Retirement Income Plan (formerly the Martin Marietta Supplemental
Retirement Income Plan), and the Lockheed Martin T actical Systems Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (formerly
the Loral Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan), which were mer ged into the SRP ef fective July 1, 2004);
(2)the GE T ransfer Component (consisting of the former GE T ransfer Plan); and
(3)the LMC T ransfer Component (consisting of the former LMC T ransfer Plan, which includes the Incentive Retirement
Benefit Plan for Certain Executives of Lockheed Martin Corporation (formerly known as the Incentive Retirement Benefit
Plan for Certain Executives of Lockheed Corporation), which was mer ged into the LMC T ransfer Plan ef fective July 1,
2004).
1
The mer ger did not change the substantive terms of the Component Plans.
The Component Plans were amended and restated, ef fective January 1, 2005, in order to comply with the requirements of section
409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). The 2005 amendment and restatement of the Component
Plans applied only to the portion of a participant’ s benefit that accrued and/or vested on or after January l, 2005. The portion of a
participant’ s benefit that accrued and vested prior to January 1, 2005, is governed by the terms of the Component Plan in ef fect on
December 31, 2004. The Component Plans were amended and restated, ef fective June 26, 2008, in order to clarify certain
provisions in accordance with the final T reasury Regulations issued under Code section 409A and to make other clarifications with
respect to eligibility and benefits. The Component Plans were amended and restated ef fective December 31, 2008, in order to make
further clarifications in accordance with the final T reasury Regulations issued under Code section 409A and to make other
administrative clarifications. In addition, the GE T ransfer Plan and LMC T ransfer Plan were amended and restated ef fective
December 31, 2010, in order to make further clarifications in accordance with the final T reasury Regulations issued under Code
section 409A and to make other administrative clarifications.
On June 26, 2014, the Qualified Pension Plan (as defined under each of the Component Plans) was amended: (1) to provide that
pensionable earnings under the Qualified Pension Plan will not include amounts earned for or relating to any period after December
31, 2015; and (2) to freeze credited service under the Qualified Pension Plan, ef fective January 1, 2020, and to provide that no
Qualified Pension Plan participant will accrue credited service with respect to any period after December 31, 2019. The Component
Plans were amended and restated to confirm that these Qualified Pension Plan amendments will carry through to any applicable
provision in the Component Plan. Accordingly , base rate of pay , bonuses or other incentive compensation, or other amounts earned
for or relating to the period after December 31, 2015 will not be used in determining benefits under the Plan, and service after
December 31, 2019 will not be considered, deemed to be, or otherwise treated as credited service or similar benefit accrual service
in determining benefits payable under the Plan. Furthermore, the LMC T ransfer Plan was amended and restated to close the plan to
new entrants ef fective July 1, 2014.
The SRP and the LMC T ransfer Plan were amended and restated, ef fective for terminations from active service and pre-retirement
deaths on or after July 1, 2015, to update the mortality table used for determining the present value of benefits accrued under the
Plan after December 31, 2004, when an individual is eligible for a lump sum payout of such benefits and for certain benefit
conversions involving benefits accrued under the Plan after December 31, 2004, from the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality T able
with sex distinction to the mortality table approved by the Internal Revenue Service for calculating the present value of benefits for
determining lump sums payable under Code section 417(e)(3); provided, however , the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality T able with
sex distinction will be used instead of the Code section 417(e)(3) applicable mortality table when use of the Code section 417(e)(3)
applicable mortality table would cause a reduction in the amount of benefits payable under the Plan.
The Corporation amended and restated the Plan, ef fective December 31, 2017, so as (i) to reflect all amendments to the Plan or its
components since the prior restatements; (ii) to amend the LMC T ransfer Plan to provide that any of fset or reduction to the LM
Transfer Plan benefit for amounts
2
accrued under the Lockheed Martin Corporation Capital Accumulation Plan is frozen as of December 31, 2019; and (iii) to remove
in inapplicable references to plans sponsored by KAPL, Inc. The formal plan document for the Plan consists of (1) this document,
which describes the provisions of the Plan that are generally applicable to all of the Component Plans (the “Master Plan
Document”) and (2) the following three Annexes:
(I)The SRP Annex, which describes the special provisions applicable to the SRP Component and includes:
(A) Appendix A to the SRP Annex, which describes the additional benefits previously provided under the Lockheed
Martin Corporation Supplemental Excess Retirement Plan;
(B) Appendix B to the SRP Annex, which governs the portion of a participant’ s benefit that accrued and vested under
the SRP Component on or before December 31, 2004, and includes:
(1)Exhibit 1 to Appendix B to the SRP Annex, which describes the additional benefits under Lockheed Martin
Corporation T ermination Benefits Agreements; and
(2)Exhibit 2 to Appendix B to the SRP Annex, which describes the additional benefits previously provided
under the Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Excess Retirement Plan;
(II)The GE T ransfer Plan Annex, which describes the special provisions applicable to the GE T ransfer Component and
includes:
(A) Appendix A to the GE T ransfer Plan Annex, which governs the portion of a participant’ s benefit that accrued and
vested under the GE T ransfer Component on or before December 31, 2004; and
(III) The LMC T ransfer Plan Annex, which describes the special provisions applicable to the LMC T ransfer Component and
includes:
(A) Appendix A to the LMC T ransfer Plan Annex, which governs the portion of a participant’ s benefit that accrued and
vested under the LMC T ransfer Component on or before December 31, 2004.
The Corporation now wishes to amend and restate the LMC T ransfer Plan to provide that any of fset or reduction to the LM
Transfer Plan benefit for amounts accrued under the Lockheed Martin Corporation Capital Accumulation Plan (“CAP”) is frozen as
of October 5, 2018 (in lieu of December 31, 2019) due to the transfer of employees’ CAP accounts to the Lockheed Martin
Corporation Salaried Savings Plan on that date.
For the avoidance of doubt, all provisions of a Component Plan that govern any portion of a participant’ s benefit that accrued and
vested under the Component Plan on or before December 31, 2004, remains unchanged as a result of this amendment and
restatement.

10
conduct oneself, in a manner which the Participant shall have reason to believe is contrary to the best interest of the
Company , or shall be found by the Committee to have committed an act during the term of the Participant’ s employment

records, and other information “relevant” to the claimant’ s claim for benefits; (4) a description of any additional
material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or
information is necessary; (5) a statement describing any voluntary appeal procedures and the claimant’ s right to
obtain information about such procedures, if any; and (6) a statement of the claimant’ s right to bring a civil action
under section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse benefit determination on review .
(e)If in the event that the Claims Administrator must make a determination of disability in order to decide a claim, the
Claims Administrator shall follow the special claims procedures for disability benefits described in Department of
Labor Regulation section 2560.503-1(d). The Claims Administrator shall render a decision within a reasonable time

and appeals brought by elected of ficers of the Company , the Claims Administrator shall be the Committee.

ANNEX I
THE SRP COMPONENT
The purposes of the SRP Component are: (a) to provide certain employees of the Company with those benefits that cannot be paid
from the Company’ s tax qualified plans because of the limitations on contributions and benefits contained in Code section 415; (b)
to provide certain key management employees of the Company with those benefits that cannot be paid from the Company’ s tax-
qualified plans because of other limitations on contributions and benefits contained in the Code, such as the limitations contained in
Code section 401(a)(17); and (c) to provide certain key management employees of the Company with other supplemental benefits.
ARTICLE I.
DEFINITIONS
Unless the context indicates otherwise or the term is defined below or in the Master Plan Document, all terms shall be defined in
accordance with the Lockheed Martin Corporation Retirement Program.
ARTICLE II.
EXCESS BENEFIT PROVISIONS
1.Eligibility . An Eligible Employee who is entitled to benefits under a Qualified Pension Plan, and whose retirement income
benefits are limited by the provisions of the Qualified Pension Plan (as amended from time to time) relating to the limits under
Code section 415 and/or Code section 401(a)(17) shall receive benefits pursuant to this Article II.
2.Amount of Benefit . The benefit that each Participant shall be entitled to receive under the Plan is the amount reasonably
determined by the Company to be the dif ference between the Participant’ s actual benefit under the applicable Qualified Pension
Plan and the benefits that would have been payable under that Plan if:
(a)the Qualified Pension Plan had determined pensionable earnings on a “mix and match” basis, as defined below; and
(b)the Participant’ s benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan had not been limited by Code section 415 and/or Code section
401(a)(17).
If a Participant’ s compensation under the Management Incentive Compensation Plan (“MICP”) is included in pensionable earnings
under a Qualified Pension Plan, the Participant’ s total pensionable earnings shall be determined on a “mix and match” basis. The
Participant’ s annual compensation earned under the MICP shall be calculated separately from other annual pensionable earnings.
The average of the three (3) highest years of MICP compensation during the last 10 years shall be added to the average of the three
(3) highest years of other pensionable earnings during the last 10 years to arrive at total final average pensionable earnings for the
applicable period under the Qualified Pension Plan.
Benefits under this Article II are intended to supplement the Participant’ s actual benefit under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan
as necessary to provide the Participant with the full benefit the
1
Participant would have received under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan on a “mix and match” basis and without regard to the
limitations of Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17). T o prevent duplication of benefits, the full benefit under the
applicable Qualified Pension Plan (without regard of to the portion of the benefit attributable to employee contributions, if any)
shall be calculated without reduction for Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17), then reduced by the benefit payable from
the applicable Qualified Pension Plan, and then reduced further by the Grandfathered 2004 Benefit, then further reduced by the
benefit payable from other nonqualified pension plans of the Company which corresponds to the benefit payable under the
applicable Qualified Pension Plan (including any benefit payable under Appendix A of this Annex I and excluding any
nonqualified plans designed to supplement qualified defined contribution plans) to the extent permitted under Code section 409A.
The remaining benefit shall be paid from this Plan pursuant to this Article II. Participants have no right to duplicate benefits with
respect to the same period of service, and the Committee may make such adjustments to the benefits under this Plan as the
Committee deems necessary to prevent duplication of benefits.
The benefit payable under this Article II shall be payable to the Participant or Beneficiary who is receiving or entitled to receive
benefits with respect to the Participant under the Qualified Pension Plan.
If the benefits payable under the Qualified Pension Plan to any Participant are increased following the Participant’ s retirement as a
result of a general increase in the benefits payable to retired employees under that Plan, no such increase will be made under this
Plan.
ARTICLE III.
SUPPLEMENT AL BENEFITS
In addition to the benefits described in Article II, the Plan also provides benefits to certain key management employees, as set forth
in the Appendices hereto. Eligibility for , and the amount of, such benefits is set forth in the applicable Appendix. Payment options

an annuity and a lump sum payment under the terms and conditions described in this Section 1. All elections under this Section
1 must be made in the form and manner prescribed by the Senior V ice President, Human Resources. No election made pursuant
to this Section 1 may af fect a payment due in the same calendar year in which the election is made or accelerate payment into

this Plan shall be paid in the form of an annuity . Participants who first become eligible for participation in the Plan after

factors set forth in the Qualified Pension Plan.

or Beneficiary under this Plan does not exceed $10,000, all such benefits will be paid in a single lump sum payment in
full dischar ge of all liabilities with respect to such benefits. For purposes of this Section, V alue shall be determined as of
the Participant’ s Termination of Employment or attainment of age fifty-five (55), as applicable, and shall mean the
present value of a Participant’ s or Beneficiary’ s benefits, excluding the Grandfathered 2004 Benefit, based (i) for
Terminations of Employment prior to January 1, 2008, upon the applicable mortality table and applicable interest rate in
Code section 417(e)(3)(ii), or (ii) for terminations on or after January 1, 2008, upon the applicable mortality table and
applicable interest rate under Code section 417(e)(3), as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, for the
calendar month preceding the Plan Y ear in which the termination of employment or attainment of age fifty-five (55)

commence before six (6) months following the later of (i) the month in which the Participant has a T ermination of
Employment, or (ii) the month in which the Participant attains age fifty-five (55). No interest shall be paid between the
date of T ermination of Employment or attainment of age fifty-five (55), as applicable, and the payment date.

attaining age 55, a pre-retirement survivor benefit will be payable to the Participant’ s surviving spouse (if
any) (the “Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit” and the “Surviving Spouse”) in the form elected by the
Participant under the terms of the Plan. If the Participant’ s benefit was payable in a lump sum, the lump
sum shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of a monthly annuity payable for the life of the Surviving Spouse
with no further payments to anyone after his or her death. The Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit shall
commence as soon as administratively practicable (but no later than 90 days) following the later of (i) the
month in which the Participant dies, or (ii) the month in which the Participant would have attained age
fifty-five (55). No Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit is payable to anyone other than the Participant’ s

sum under Section 1.b., a lump sum Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit shall be paid to the Participant’ s
Surviving Spouse six (6) months following the later of (i) the month in which the Participant dies, or (ii)
the month in which the Participant would have attained age fifty-five (55).

“Disabled” or “Disability” shall have the meaning set forth in the Lockheed Martin Retirement Income Plan, or

requirements of Code section 409A(a)(2)(C).
e.Prospective Change of Payment Elections . Participants may elect to change the form of payment of benefits or further
delay the commencement of benefits as provided in this Section 1.e. All elections under this Section 1.e. must be made
in the form and manner prescribed by the Company . This Section 1.e. does not apply to Surviving Spouses or
Beneficiaries. Subject to the requirements of Code section 409A, other changes in the form of benefit, including
changes between actuarially equivalent forms of benefit, if any , may be made only as determined by the Senior V ice
President, Human Resources, of the Company in accordance with Code section 409A.
i.Form of Payment . A Participant who has validly elected (or deemed to have elected) payment as an annuity (as
described in Section 1.a. of Article IV) or has validly elected a lump sum payment (in accordance with Section
1.b. of Article IV) may later elect to receive payment in any form (annuity or lump sum) designated by the
Senior V ice President, Human Resources, of the Company , provided that such election is made in the form and

date the payment would have first commenced under the Participant’ s prior election. In addition, the first
payment under the new election must commence no earlier than sixty (60) months from the date when the

given ef fect until twelve (12) months from the date that the change in election is delivered to the Company .

provided such election is made in writing in the form and manner determined by the Senior V ice President,
Human
5
Resources, not less than twelve (12) months before the date the payment would have first commenced under the
Participant’ s prior election. In addition, the first payment under the new election must commence no earlier than
sixty (60) months from when the payment would have first commenced under the Participant’ s prior election. No
interest shall be paid between the date of termination of employment or attainment of age fifty-five (55), as

f.Notwithstanding the above, for periods prior to January 1, 2009 (or such later date as may be provided by the Internal
Revenue Service in guidance of general applicability), the Senior V ice President, Human Resources may provide
alternative rules for elections with respect to the commencement of payment and form of payment, provided that such
rules conform to Code section 409A and Internal Revenue Service guidance issued thereunder .

must make a single election that shall apply to his or her benefits under all such plans with respect to the form of annuity
(under Section 1.a. of this Article IV) and with respect to prospective changes of payment (under Section 1.e. of this
Article IV).
2.Deductibility of Payments . Subject to the provisions of Section Code section 409A, in the event that the Company reasonably
anticipates that the payment of benefits in accordance with the Participant’ s election under Section 1 would prevent the
Company from claiming an income tax deduction with respect to any portion of the benefits paid under Code section 162(m),
the Committee shall have the right to delay the timing of distributions from the Participant’ s Account as necessary to maximize
the Company’ s tax deductions. In the exercise of its discretion to adopt a delayed distribution schedule, the Committee shall
undertake to have distributions made at such times and in such amounts as the Company reasonably anticipates, or should
reasonably anticipate, that if the payment is made during such year , the deduction will not be barred by Code section 162(m) or
upon a T ermination of Employment in accordance with T reasury Regulation section 1.409A-2(b)(7)(i), consistent with the
objective of maximum deductibility for the Company . The Committee shall have no authority to reduce a Participant’ s Account
Balance or to pay aggregate benefits less than the Participant’ s Account Balance in the event that all or a portion thereof would
not be deductible by the Company . All scheduled payments under this Plan and any other plan required to be aggregated with
this Plan must be delayed in order for such payment to be delayed pursuant to this Section 2.

ARTICLE I.
EXCESS BENEFIT PROVISIONS
1.Eligibility . An Eligible Employee who is entitled to benefits under a Qualified Pension Plan, and whose retirement income
benefits are limited by the provisions of the Qualified Pension Plan (as amended from time to time) relating to the limits under
Code section 415 and/or Code section 401(a)(17) shall receive benefits pursuant to this Article I.
2.Amount of Benefit . The benefit that each Participant shall be entitled to receive is the dif ference between the Participant’ s
actual benefit under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan and the benefits that would have been payable under that Plan if:
a.the Qualified Pension Plan had determined pensionable earnings on a “mix and match” basis, as defined below; and
b.the Participant’ s benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan had not been limited by Code section 415 and/or Code section
401(a)(17).
If a Participant’ s compensation under the Management Incentive Compensation Plan “MICP”) is included in pensionable
earnings under a Qualified Pension Plan, the Participant’ s total pensionable earnings shall be determined on a “mix and match”
basis. The Participant’ s annual compensation earned under the MICP shall be calculated separately from other annual
pensionable earnings. The average of the three (3) highest years of MICP compensation during the last 10 years shall be added
to the average of the three (3) highest years of other pensionable earnings during the last 10 years to arrive at total final average
pensionable earnings for the applicable period under the Qualified Pension Plan.
Benefits under this Article I are intended to supplement the Participant’ s actual benefit under the applicable Qualified Pension
Plan as necessary to provide the Participant with the full benefit the Participant would have received under the applicable
Qualified Pension Plan on a “mix and match” basis and without regard to the limitations of Code section 415 and Code section
401(a)(17). T o prevent duplication of benefits, the full benefit under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan shall be calculated
without reduction for Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17), then reduced by the benefit payable from the applicable
Qualified Pension Plan, and then reduced further by the benefit payable from other nonqualified pension plans of the Company
which corresponds to the benefit payable under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan (including any benefit payable under
Exhibit 2 of this Plan and excluding any nonqualified plans designed to supplement qualified defined contribution plans). The
remaining benefit shall be paid from this Plan pursuant to this Article I. Participants have no right to duplicate benefits with
respect to the same period of service, and
1
the Committee may make such adjustments to the benefits under this Plan as the Committee deems necessary to prevent
duplication of benefits.
The benefit payable under this Article I shall be payable to the Participant or Beneficiary or any other person who is receiving
or entitled to receive benefits with respect to the Participant under the Qualified Pension Plan.
If the benefits payable under the Qualified Pension Plan to any Participant are increased following the Participant’ s retirement
as a result of a general increase in the benefits payable to retired employees under that Plan, no such increase will be made
under this Plan unless the Committee expressly so provides in writing.
ARTICLE II.
SUPPLEMENT AL BENEFITS
In addition to the benefits described in Article I, the Plan also provides benefits to certain key management employees, as set forth
in the Exhibits. Eligibility for , and the amount of, such benefits is set forth in the applicable Exhibit. Payment options for such
benefits are described in Article III.
ARTICLE III.
PAYMENT OF BENEFITS
1.Form of Payment . Benefits shall be paid in the same form at the same times and for the same period as benefits are paid with
respect to the Participant under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan, except as provided in the following paragraphs. Actuarial
adjustments shall be based on the factors set forth in the Qualified Pension Plan, except as provided in the following
paragraphs. If the benefits payable under this Plan correspond to Qualified Pension Plan benefits with multiple commencement
dates, each portion of the benefits payable under this Plan shall be paid at the same time as the corresponding portion of the
benefits is paid from the Qualified Pension Plan. If an Employee’ s benefits under the Qualified Pension Plan are suspended for
any month in accordance with the re-employment provisions thereof, the Participant’ s benefit for that month shall likewise be
suspended under this Plan.
Lump Sum Option . A Participant may irrevocably elect to receive a full or partial single lump sum payment in an
amount which is the Actuarial Equivalent of the benefit described above, and with no interest for the period between the
date of termination of employment and the payment date. This election must be made within the time period for electing
the form of benefit under the corresponding Qualified Pension Plan, by filing a written election in the form and manner
prescribed by the Company . Payment will be made six (6) months following the date payments would otherwise begin
pursuant to the above paragraph.
Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit . In the event the Participant dies prior to the date his or her retirement has commenced
under this Plan and the corresponding Qualified Pension Plan, the pre-retirement survivor benefit payable to the
surviving spouse (if any) under this Plan (the “Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit” and the “Surviving
2
Spouse”) will be payable, at the election of the Surviving Spouse, in any of the following forms:
(a)in the form of a monthly annuity payable to the Surviving Spouse for his lifetime, with no further payments to
anyone after his death (which will be referred to as the “Regular Form”);
(b)in the form of a lump sum payment which is the Actuarial Equivalent of the Regular Form (the “100% Lump
Sum”), but with Actuarial Equivalent determined as of the Election Date, and with no interest for the period
between the Election Date (or , if later , the date the Participant would have attained age 55 had he survived)
and the payment date; or
(c)in the form of a combined lump sum and life annuity benefit of (x) and (y), where (x) equals a lump sum
amount selected by the Surviving Spouse which is less than the 100% Lump Sum and (y) is a monthly single
life annuity for the life of Surviving Spouse (with no further payments to anyone after his death) in an amount
that can be provided with the dif ference between (x) and the 100% Lump Sum.
Any election to receive the benefit in the form of a lump sum as set forth in (b) above or a combined lump sum and
annuity as set forth in (c) above must be made by the Surviving Spouse no later than 90 days after the date of the
Participant’ s death or , if later , the date the Participant would have attained age 55 had he survived (with the date such
election is made by the Surviving Spouse referred to as the “Election Date”). In the event the Surviving Spouse makes
an election for a lump sum or partial lump sum payment within this period, payment will not be made to the Surviving
Spouse until six months after the Election Date (or , if later , six months after the date the benefit would otherwise be
payable under this Plan).
Cash-out of Small Benefits . Notwithstanding the above, if the V alue of the sum of the benefits payable to a Participant
or Beneficiary under this Plan does not exceed the amount that may be distributed without consent under Section 41 1(a)
(11) of the Code, all such benefits will be paid in a single lump sum payment in full dischar ge of all liabilities with
respect to such benefits. For purposes of this Section, V alue shall be determined as of the Participant’ s termination of
employment, and shall mean the present value of a Participant’ s or Beneficiary’ s benefits based upon the applicable
mortality table and applicable interest rate in Code section 417(e)(3)(ii) for the calendar month preceding the Plan Y ear
in which the termination of employment occurs.
2.Deductibility of Payments . In the event that the payment of benefits under Section 1 would prevent the Company from claiming
an income tax deduction with respect to any portion of the benefits paid, the Committee shall have the right to modify the form
and timing of distributions as necessary to maximize the Company’ s tax deductions. In the exercise of its discretion to adopt a
modified distribution schedule, the Committee shall undertake to have distributions made at such times and in such amounts as
most closely approximate the
3
payment method described in Section 1, consistent with the objective of maximum deductibility for the Company . The
Committee shall have no authority to reduce a Participant’ s accrued benefit under this Plan or to pay aggregate benefits less
than the Participant’ s accrued benefit in the event that all or a portion thereof would not be deductible by the Company .

ARTICLE II.
SUPPLEMENT ARY PENSION BENEFIT

equivalent to General Electric Company’ s EB) even though he is not employed at that level on the date his Service terminates.
2. Amount of Benefit .
A.    Definitions . For purposes of this Section 2, the following terms have the following meanings:
Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit . The annual equivalent of the maximum possible Primary Insurance
Amount payable, after reduction for early retirement, as an old-age benefit to an employee who retired at age 62 on January 1 of the
calendar year in which occurred the Employee’ s actual date of retirement or death, or December 31, 2015, whichever is earlier . The
Company shall determine the Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit in accordance with the Social Security Act in ef fect at the
end of the calendar year preceding such January 1.
If an Employee has less than 35 years of Credited Service, the Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit determined
under the above paragraph is multiplied by a factor , the numerator of which is the number of years of the Employees’ Credited
Service to
1
his or her date of retirement or death, or December 31, 2019, whichever is earlier , and the denominator of which is 35.
The Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit shall be adjusted to include any social security , severance, or similar
benefit provided under foreign law or regulations as the Committee may prescribe by rules and regulations.
Annual Pension Payable under the Qualified Pension Plan . The sum of:
(1) (i) the annual normal, early or late retirement benefit under Article V of the Qualified Pension Plan, including the
Personal Pension Account (excluding the regular supplement under Article V(4) of the Qualified Pension Plan), or
(ii) the normal, optional or disability retirement benefit under the RIP II Annex of the Qualified Pension Plan, less
(2) to the extent the Committee so determines, the benefit payable under any other pension plan contract, or policy of
the Plan Sponsor (whether qualified or non qualified), or government program attributable to periods of service for
which Credited Service is granted by the Committee for the determination of the benefit under this Plan or is
credited by the Qualified Pension. All such amounts shall be determined before applying any reduction factors for
Early , Optional or Disability Retirement, for election of any optional form of Pension at retirement, a qualified
domestic relations order(s), if any , or in connection with any other adjustment or supplement made pursuant to the
Qualified Pension Plan or any other pension plan.
For purposes of this paragraph, the Employee’ s Pension shall include the Personal Pension Account Annuity payable
to the Employee or the Employee’ s spouse on the date of the Employee’ s retirement or death, regardless of whether such annuity
commenced on such date.
Annual Retirement Income . For Employees who retire or die in active Service on or after April 5, 1993, the amount
determined by multiplying 1.75% of A verage Annual Compensation by the number of years of Credited Service completed at the
date of retirement or death, or December 31, 2019, whichever is earlier .
Average Annual Compensation . One-third of the Employee’ s Compensation for the highest consecutive three years
during the last 10 years immediately preceding his date of retirement or death, whichever is earlier . In computing A verage Annual
Compensation, normal straight-time earnings shall be substituted for actual Compensation for any month in which such normal
straight-time earnings are greater . Notwithstanding the foregoing, A verage Annual Compensation will be frozen ef fective as of
January 1, 2016. Accordingly , for purposes of determining A verage Annual Compensation, the term “years” above shall not include
any period after December 31, 2015, and A verage Annual Compensation shall not include amounts earned for or relating to any
period after December 31, 2015.
Compensation . Salary (including any deferred salary approved by the Committee as compensation for purposes of
this Plan) plus:

Commission Plan or other variable compensation plan, the total amount of sales commissions (or other variable
compensation earned unless such compensation is excluded by the Board or a committee thereof);
(3)    For all other persons, the sales commissions and other variable compensation earned to the extent such earnings were
then included under the Qualified Pension Plan, plus any amounts (other than salary and those mentioned in clauses (1)
through (3) above) which were then included as compensation under the Qualified Pension Plan except any amounts which
the Committee may exclude from the computation of “Compensation” and subject to the powers of the Committee with
respect to payment of benefits.
The Committee shall specify the basis for determining an Employee’ s Compensation for any portion of the three
years used to compute the Employee’ s Average Annual Compensation during which the Employee was not employed by an
employer participating in this Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Compensation will be frozen ef fective as of January 1, 2016.
Accordingly , Compensation shall not include amounts earned for or relating to any period after December 31, 2015.

any period during which the employee was a full-time Employee for purposes of the Qualified Pension Plan. Credited Service also
includes:
(1) Any period of Service with the Company or an Af filiate as the Committee may otherwise provide by rules and
regulations issued with respect to this Plan; and
(2) Any period of service with another employer as the Board may approve, if any conditions specified in such approval
have been met.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant’ s Credited Service shall be frozen ef fective January 1, 2020, and no
Participant shall accrue further Credited Service under this Plan with respect to any period after December 31, 2019.
B.    Normal Retirement Benefit . Subject to the limitations in Section G and the requirements of Code section 409A, the

the Plan, shall be the excess, if any , of the employee’ s Annual Retirement Income, over the sum of:

Annuity and excluding any supplements payable under the Qualified Pension Plan) (calculated as a five-year certain
annuity),

Master Plan Document, the benefit payable to an eligible
3
Employee who, after reaching age 60, retires on an optional retirement date under the Qualified Pension Plan shall be computed in
the manner provided by Section B (for an employee retiring on his or her normal retirement date) but taking into account only
Credited Service and A verage Annual Compensation to the actual date of optional retirement. The annual benefit payable to an
eligible Employee who, after reaching age 55 (but before reaching age 60), retires under the early retirement provisions of the
Qualified Pension Plan shall equal the amount in section B but taking into account only Credited Service and A verage Annual
Compensation to the Employee’ s actual T ermination of Employment and reduced for early retirement using the early retirement
reduction factor under Article V(2) of the Qualified Pension Plan.
Subject to the requirements of Code section 409A, the annual benefit payable to an eligible Employee who has satisfied
the eligibility requirements to receive a Disability Pension under the RIP II Annex of the Qualified Pension Plan (to the extent
consistent with the requirements of Code section 409A(a)(2(C)) shall be computed in the manner provided by Section B (for an
Employee retiring on his normal retirement date) taking into account only Credited Service and A verage Annual Compensation to
the actual date of disability retirement and not reduced for the Disability Supplement in the RIP II Annex of the Qualified Pension
Plan. In the case of an eligible Employee whose date of retirement precedes the first day of the month after reaching age 60, the
Plan benefit shall then be reduced by 12%.
If the Disability Pension payable to the Employee under the Qualified Pension Plan is discontinued as a result of the
Employee’ s disability ceasing before the Employee reaches age 60, the benefit provided under this Section C shall also be
discontinued to the extent permitted under Code section 409A.
D.    Special Benefit Protection for Certain Employees . Subject to the provisions of Code section 409A, a former Employee
whose Service with the Company is terminated on or after December 31, 1994, and after completing 25 or more years of V esting
Service, who does not withdraw his required or voluntary contributions from the Qualified Pension Plan before retirement, shall be
eligible for a benefit under this Plan commencing upon the later of T ermination of Employment with the Company and the
attainment of age 60 if:
(1) the Employee’ s Service is terminated for transfer to a successor employer and
(2) the Employee does not retire under the Qualified Pension Plan until the later of (1) termination of service with the
successor employer and (2) the first of the month after reaching age 60.
In determining the benefit under this Plan, the A verage Annual Compensation shall be based on the last 120 completed
months with the successor employer before the Employee’ s Service termination date and the Annual Estimated Social Security
Benefit shall be determined as though the Employee’ s retirement date was the date of termination. For the purposes of this
paragraph, the term “120 completed months” shall not include any period after December 31, 2015.
E.    Survivor Benefits . Subject to the requirements of Code section 409A, if a survivor benefit applies with respect to the
past and future service annuity portion of an Employee’ s Annual Pension payable under the Qualified Pension Plan, such survivor
benefit shall automatically apply to any benefit which he or she may be eligible under this Plan. The Employee’ s benefit shall be
adjusted and paid in the same manner as such pension payable under the Qualified Pension Plan is adjusted and paid on account of
such survivor benefit.
4
Payments to the survivor shall commence as soon as administratively practicable (but not later than 90 days) following the later of:
(1) the Employee’ s 55th birthday , or (2) the Employee’ s date of death.
F.    Payments Upon Death . Subject to the requirements of Code section 409A, if an eligible Employee dies in active

Employee contributions with interest including an Employee’ s Personal and V oluntary Pension Account) is payable to the
beneficiary or Surviving Spouse of such Employee under the Qualified Pension Plan, a death benefit shall also be payable to the
beneficiary or Surviving Spouse under this Plan as follows:
(1) Any such death benefit payable to a surviving spouse under this Plan shall equal 50% of the Employee’ s Annual
Retirement Income under this Plan reduced by (1) 100% of the Employee’ s preretirement surviving spouse benefit
payable or other lump sum benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan, (2) 25% of the Employee’ s Annual Estimated
Social Security Benefit, (3) the Employee’ s Personal Pension Account benefit, and (4) the benefit payable under the
Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan. Payments to the surviving spouse shall commence as
soon as administratively practicable (but no later than 90 days) after the later of: (1) the Employee’ s 55th birthday , or
(2) the Employee’ s date of death, subject to the requirements of Code section 409A if the beneficiary or Surviving
Spouse is entitled to benefits under more than one supplemental pension plan.
(2) Any such death benefit payable to a surviving spouse under this Plan shall take into account only Credited Service
and A verage Annual Compensation to the earlier of the Employee’ s death or termination of employment and will be

Plan.
(3) Subject to the requirements of Code section 409A, any such benefit payable to a surviving spouse shall be paid as
soon as administratively practicable (but no later than 90 days) after the later of: (1) the Employee’ s 55th birthday , or
(2) the Employee’ s date of death and will be paid in accordance with the payment provisions of the RIP Annex of

payable to an Employee under this Plan;
(2) The Employee’ s Annual Pension Payable under the Qualified Pension Plan (including the Personal Pension Account
Annuity) (calculated as a five-year certain annuity);
5
(3) 100% of the Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit before any adjustment for less than 35 years of Pension
Benefit Service;
(4) the Employee’ s annual benefit under the Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan; and
to the extent the Committee so determines, the benefit payable under any other pension plan contract, or policy of the
Plan Sponsor (whether qualified or non-qualified), or government program attributable to periods of service for which Credited
Service is granted by the Committee for the determination of the benefit under this Plan or is credited by the Qualified Pension

excess, to the extent permitted by Code section 409A.

Board of Directors may adopt, subject to the limitation that any such benefit or death benefit may not exceed the amount which

H.    Adjustments Following Retirement . If the Pension payable under the Qualified Pension Plan to any Employee is
increased following the Employee’ s retirement as a result of a general increase in the Pensions payable to retired employees under
that plan, no such increase will be made under this Plan.
I.    Non-duplication of Benefits . Benefits under this Article II are intended to supplement the Participant’ s actual benefit
under the Qualified Pension Plan as necessary to provide the Participant with the full benefit the Participant would have received
under the Qualified Pension Plan with the special adjustments described above. T o prevent duplication of benefits, the full benefit
under the Qualified Pension Plan and the enhanced benefit described above shall be calculated without reduction for Code section

benefit payable from the Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan, then reduced by the Grandfathered 2004
Benefit, to the extent permitted by Code section 409A. Participants have no right to duplicate benefits with respect to the same
period of service, and the Committee may make such adjustments to the benefits under this Plan as the Committee deems necessary
to prevent duplication of benefits.
ARTICLE III.

which the Participant has T ermination of Employment, or (ii) the month in which the Participant attains age fifty-five (55). No
interest shall be paid between the date of T ermination of Employment or attainment of age fifty-five (55), as applicable, and the

Senior V ice President, Human Resources as available for election under this Plan. If the Participant has not validly elected an
annuity form before his T ermination of Employment or attainment of age 55, as applicable, (i) an unmarried Participant shall be
deemed to have elected payment in the form of a monthly annuity for the life of the Participant with no further payments to anyone
after his or her death, and (ii) a married Participant shall be deemed to have elected payment in the form of a reduced monthly
annuity for the life of the Participant with, after the Participant’ s death, a 50% survivor annuity for the life of the Participant’ s
spouse. Actuarial adjustments shall be based on the factors set forth in the Qualified Pension Plan.
Cash-out of Small Benefits . Notwithstanding the above, if the V alue of the sum of the benefits payable to a Participant or
Beneficiary under this Plan does not exceed $10,000, all such benefits will be paid in a single lump sum payment in full dischar ge
of all liabilities with respect to such benefits. For purposes of this Section, V alue shall be determined as of the Participant’ s
Termination of Employment or attainment of age fifty-five (55), as applicable, and shall mean the present value of a Participant’ s or
Beneficiary’ s benefits, excluding the Grandfathered 2004 Benefit, based (i) for T erminations prior to January 1, 2008, upon the
applicable mortality table and applicable interest rate in Code section 417(e)(3)(ii), or (ii) for terminations on or after January 1,
2008, upon the applicable mortality table and applicable interest rate under Code section 417(e)(3), as amended by the Pension
Protection Act of 2006, for the calendar month preceding the Plan Y ear in which the T ermination of Employment or attainment of
age fifty-five (55) occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, benefits paid under this Section 1 to a Participant who is
reasonably determined by the Company to be a “specified employee” within the meaning of Code section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i), shall
not commence before the later of (i) six (6) months following the month in which the Participant T erminates Employment, or (ii)
the month in which the Participant attains age fifty-five (55). No interest shall be paid between the date of T ermination of
Employment or attainment of age fifty-five (55), as applicable, and the payment date.
Prospective Elections . Participants may elect to further delay the commencement of benefits as provided in this paragraph.
This paragraph does not apply to Surviving Spouses or Beneficiaries. A new election under this section shall be made by executing
and delivering to the Company an election in such form as prescribed by the Company . To constitute a valid election by a
Participant making a prospective change to a previous election, (i) the
7
prospective election must be executed and delivered to the Company at least twelve (12) months before the date the first payment
would be due under the Participant’ s previous election, and (ii) the first payment must be delayed by at least sixty (60) months from
the date the first payment would be due under the Participant’ s previous election, and (iii) such change in election shall not be given
effect until twelve (12) months from the date that the change in election is delivered to the Company . In the event an election fails
to satisfy the provisions set forth in this paragraph, such election shall be void and, if such an election is void, payment shall be
made in accordance with the most recent election which was valid. Other changes in the form of benefit may be made only as
determined by the Senior V ice President, Human Resources, of the Company in accordance with Code section 409A.
If a Participant participates in more than one supplemental pension plan sponsored by the Company , the Participant must
make a single election with respect to the form of annuity that shall apply to his or her benefits under all such plans and with
respect to prospective changes of payment under this Section 1 of Article III.
Notwithstanding the above, for periods prior to January 1, 2009, (or such later date as may be provided by the Internal
Revenue Service in guidance of general applicability), the Senior V ice President, Human Resources may provide alternative rules
for elections with respect to the commencement of payment and form of payment, provided that such rules conform to Code section
409A and Internal Revenue Service guidance issued thereunder .
2. Deductibility of Payments . Subject to the provisions of Section Code section 409A, in the event that the Company
reasonably anticipates that the payment of benefits in accordance with the Participant’ s election under Section 1 would prevent the
Company from claiming an income tax deduction with respect to any portion of the benefits paid under Code section 162(m), the
Committee shall have the right to delay the timing of distributions from the Participant’ s Account as necessary to maximize the
Company’ s tax deductions. In the exercise of its discretion to adopt a delayed distribution schedule, the Committee shall undertake
to have distributions made at such times and in such amounts as the Company reasonably anticipates, or should reasonably
anticipate, that if the payment is made during such year , the deduction will not be barred by Code section 162(m) or upon a
Termination of Employment in accordance with T reasury Regulation section 1.409A-2(b)(7)(i), consistent with the objective of
maximum deductibility for the Company . The Committee shall have no authority to reduce a Participant’ s Account Balance or to
pay aggregate benefits less than the Participant’ s Account Balance in the event that all or a portion thereof would not be deductible
by the Company . All scheduled payments under this Plan and any other plan required to be aggregated with this Plan must be
delayed in order for such payment to be delayed pursuant to this Section 2.

Annuity and excluding any supplements payable under the Qualified Pension Plan) (calculated as a five-year certain
annuity),
(2)1/2 of the Employee’ s Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit,
(3)the benefit payable from the Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan.
C. Early , Optional or Disability Retirement . Subject to the limitations in Section G, the benefit payable to an eligible
Employee who, after reaching age 60, retires on an optional retirement date under the Qualified Pension Plan shall be computed in
the manner provided by Section B (for an employee retiring on his or her normal retirement date) but taking into account only
Credited Service and A verage Annual Compensation to the actual date of optional retirement. The annual benefit payable to an
eligible Employee who, after reaching age 55 (but before reaching age 60) retires under the early retirement provisions of the
Qualified Pension Plan shall equal the amount in section B but taking into account only Credited Service and A verage Annual
Compensation to the Employee’ s actual termination of employment and reduced for early retirement using the early retirement
reduction factor under Article V(2) of the Qualified Pension Plan.
The annual benefit payable to an eligible Employee who has satisfied the eligibility requirements to receive a Disability
Pension under the RIP II Annex of the Qualified Pension Plan shall be computed in the manner provided by Section B (for an
Employee retiring on his normal retirement date) taking into account only Credited Service and A verage Annual Compensation to
the actual date of disability retirement and not reduced for the Disability Supplement in the RIP II Annex of the Qualified Pension
Plan. In the case of an eligible Employee whose date of retirement precedes the first day of the month after reaching age 60 the
Plan benefit shall then be reduced by 12%.
If the Disability Pension payable to the Employee under the Qualified Pension Plan is discontinued as a result of the
Employee’ s disability ceasing before the Employee reaches age 60, the benefit provided under this Section C. shall also be
discontinued.

D. Special Benefit Protection for Certain Employees . A former Employee whose Service with the Company is
terminated on or after December 31, 1994, and after completing 25 or more years of V esting Service, who does not withdraw his
required or voluntary contributions from the Qualified Pension Plan before retirement, shall be eligible for a benefit under this Plan
commencing upon his or her retirement under the Qualified Pension Plan after reaching age 60 if:
(1)the Employee’ s Service is terminated for transfer to a successor employer and
(2)the Employee does not retire under the Qualified Pension Plan until the later of (1) termination of service with the
successor employer and (2) the first of the month after reaching age 60.
In determining the benefit under this Plan, the A verage Annual Compensation shall be based on the last 120 completed
months with the successor employer before the Employee’ s Service termination date and the Annual Estimated Social Security
Benefit shall be determined as though the Employee’ s retirement date was the date of termination. For the purposes of this
paragraph, the term “120 completed months” shall not include any period after December 31, 2015.
E. Survivor Benefits . Subject to Section F(b), if a survivor benefit applies with respect to the past and future service
annuity portion of an Employee’ s Annual Pension payable under the Qualified Pension Plan, such survivor benefit shall
automatically apply to any benefit which he or she may be eligible under this Plan. The Employee’ s benefit shall be adjusted and
paid in the same manner as such pension payable under the Qualified Pension Plan is adjusted and paid on account of such survivor
benefit.
F. Payments Upon Death .
(a)    If an eligible Employee dies in active Service, or following retirement with a benefit from this Plan, and a death benefit
(other than a return of Employee contributions with interest including an Employee’ s Personal and V oluntary Pension
Account) is payable to the beneficiary or Surviving Spouse of such Employee under the Qualified Pension Plan, a death
benefit shall also be payable to the beneficiary or Surviving Spouse under this Plan as follows:
(1)Any such death benefit payable to a surviving spouse under this Plan shall equal 50% of the Employee’ s Annual
Retirement Income under this Plan reduced by (1) 100% of the Employee’ s preretirement surviving spouse benefit
payable or other lump sum benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan, (2) 25% of the Employee’ s Annual Estimated
Social Security Benefit, (3) the Employee’ s Personal Pension Account benefit, and (4) the benefit payable under the
Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan. Payments to the surviving spouse shall commence on
the later of: (1) the Employee’ s 55th birthday , or (2) the Employee’ s date of death.
(2)Any such death benefit payable to a surviving spouse under this Plan shall take into account only Credited Service
and A verage Annual Compensation to the earlier of the Employee’ s death or termination of employment and will be
reduced for early retirement using the early retirement reduction factors under Article V(2) of the Qualified Pension
Plan.
(3)Any such benefit payable to a surviving spouse shall be paid at the same time as the Qualified Pension Plan and will
be paid in accordance with the payment provisions of the RIP II Annex of the Qualified Pension Plan. If benefits
from the Qualified Pension
4
Plan are paid under the payment provisions of the RIP II Annex of the Qualified Pension Plan, then benefits from
this Plan will be paid in the same payment form.
(b)    In lieu of the benefit otherwise payable to a beneficiary or surviving spouse under Section E. or paragraph (a) of this
Section, an Employee may elect to have all or any portion of such benefit (or the equivalent value of all or any portion) paid
to the beneficiary designated in the employee’ s election in any of the following forms:
(1)An annuity for the spouse’ s remaining lifetime. If the beneficiary dies before the spouse, the remaining benefit shall
be paid as provided in the employee’ s election. In the absence of any such provision, the equivalent value of the
remaining payments shall be paid to the beneficiary’ s estate, if any , otherwise to the beneficiary’ s Personal
Representative.
(2)An annuity for the beneficiary’ s remaining lifetime. If any annuity otherwise payable under this item (2) is less than
$5,000 annually , the equivalent value shall be paid instead to the beneficiary in a lump sum.
(3)A lump sum.
Any such election must be made in writing to the Qualified Pension Plan Administrator prior to the Employee’ s death, and
becomes ef fective when the Qualified Pension Plan Administrator receives it. For purposes of this election, an Employee may
designate as his beneficiary only his estate, his former spouse, or a member of his immediate family .
For the purpose of determining the benefit conversions required to provide the benefit payments referred to above, the
interest rate assumption shall be the interest rate used by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation at the beginning of the year in
which the Employee’ s death occurs, in valuing immediate annuities for terminating single employer trusteed plans, and the
mortality assumption shall be based on the UP-1984 Mortality T able.
G. Limitations on Benefits .
(a)    Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary , if the sum of:
(1)The annual benefit (calculated before applying any reductions for early retirement or additions for any supplements
payable under the Qualified Pension Plan, and prior to any calculation for disability retirement reductions) otherwise
payable to an Employee under this Plan;
(2)The Employee’ s Annual Pension Payable under the Qualified Pension Plan (including the Personal Pension Account
Annuity) (calculated as a five-year certain annuity);
(3)100% of the Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit before any adjustment for less than 35 years of Pension
Benefit Service;
(4)the Employee’ s annual benefit under the Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan; and
to the extent the Committee so determines, the benefit payable under any other pension plan contract, or policy of the
Plan Sponsor (whether qualified or non-qualified), or government program attributable to periods of service for which Credited
Service is granted by the Committee for the determination of the benefit under this Plan or is credited by the Qualified Pension
exceeds 60%
5
of his or her Annual A verage Compensation, the benefit payable under this Plan shall be reduced by the amount of the excess.
(b)    Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan to the contrary , the amount of the benefit payable and any death benefit
payable to or on behalf of any Employee who is or was an Of ficer of the Company on the date of his retirement or death,
whichever is earlier , shall be determined according to such general rules and regulations as a Committee appointed by the
Board of Directors may adopt, subject to the limitation that any such benefit or death benefit may not exceed the amount
which would be payable under this Plan in the absence of such rules and regulations.
H. Adjustments Following Retirement . If the Pension payable under the Qualified Pension Plan to any Employee is
increased following the Employee’ s retirement as a result of a general increase in the Pensions payable to retired employees under
that plan, no such increase will be made under this Plan unless the Committee makes such determination.
I. Non-duplication of Benefits . Benefits under this Article I are intended to supplement the Participant’ s actual
benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan as necessary to provide the Participant with the full benefit the Participant would have
received under the Qualified Pension Plan with the special adjustments described above. T o prevent duplication of benefits, the full
benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan and the enhanced benefit described above shall be calculated without reduction for Code
section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17), then reduced by the benefit payable from the Qualified Pension Plan and further reduced
by the benefit payable from the Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan. Participants have no right to
duplicate benefits with respect to the same period of service, and the Committee may make such adjustments to the benefits under
this Plan as the Committee deems necessary to prevent duplication of benefits.
ARTICLE II.
PAYMENT OF BENEFITS
1. Form of Payment . Benefits shall be paid at the same time as the Qualified Pension Plan and will be paid in
accordance with the payment provisions of the RIP II Annex of the Qualified Pension Plan. If benefits from the Qualified Pension
Plan are paid under the payment provisions of the RIP II Annex, then benefits from this Plan will be paid in the same payment
form.
If an Employee’ s pension benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan is suspended for any month in accordance with the re-
employment provisions thereof, the Employee’ s benefit under this Plan for that month shall likewise be suspended.
Cash-out of Small Benefits . Notwithstanding the above, if the V alue of the sum of the benefits payable to a Participant or
Beneficiary under this Plan does not exceed the amount that may be distributed without consent under Section 41 1(a)(1 1) of the
Code, all such benefits will be paid in a single lump sum payment in full dischar ge of all liabilities with respect to such benefits.
For purposes of this Section, V alue shall be determined as of the Participant’ s termination of employment, and shall mean the
present value of a Participant’ s or Beneficiary’ s benefits based upon the applicable mortality table and applicable interest rate in
Code section 417(e)(3)(ii) for the calendar month preceding the Plan Y ear in which the termination of employment occurs.
2. Deductibility of Payments . In the event that the payment of benefits under Section 1 would prevent the Company
from claiming an income tax deduction with respect to any portion of
6
the benefits paid, the Committee shall have the right to modify the form and timing of distributions as necessary to maximize the
Company’ s tax deductions. In the exercise of its discretion to adopt a modified distribution schedule, the Committee shall
undertake to have distributions made at such times and in such amounts as most closely approximate the payment method described
in Section 1, consistent with the objective of maximum deductibility for the Company . The Committee shall have no authority to
reduce a Participant’ s accrued benefit under this Plan or to pay aggregate benefits less than the Participant’ s accrued benefit in the
event that all or a portion thereof would not be deductible by the Company .

APPENDIX III
THE LMC TRANSFER COMPONENT
The purposes of the LMC T ransfer Component are (a) to provide an additional retirement benefit for certain employees whose
regular retirement benefits have been limited as a result of employment service at a Lockheed Martin company that does not have a
Qualified Pension Plan; (b) to provide an additional retirement benefit for certain employees hired on or after January 1, 2006 at a
Lockheed Martin company that has a Qualified Pension Plan that is frozen to new participants as of such date; and (c) to provide
the above employees with those benefits that cannot be paid from the tax-qualified plans of Lockheed Martin Corporation and its
subsidiaries because of the limitations on contributions and benefits contained in Internal Revenue Code sections 415 and 401(a)
(17).
ARTICLE I.
DEFINITIONS
Unless the context indicates otherwise or the term is defined below or in the Master Plan Document, all terms shall be defined in
accordance with the Lockheed Martin Corporation Salaried Employee Retirement Program.
ARTICLE II.
TRANSFER BENEFITS
1. Eligibility . Benefits pursuant to this Article II are available to employees of the Company who:
(a)    are Members of the Qualified Pension Plan, and
(i)are transferred, prior to July 1, 2014 to a Participating Company that does not have a Qualified Pension Plan, and
(ii)are identified by such Participating Company as a key employee at the time of such transfer , and
(iii)are designated in writing, prior to July 1, 2014, by the Committee as a Participant in this Plan;
(b)    effective January 1, 2006, are not Members of the Qualified Pension Plan, and
(i)are hired by a Participating Company on or after January 1, 2006 and before July 1,2014, and
(ii)are V ice Presidents (Level 8) or above on their date of hire, or are promoted to V ice President (Level 8) after their
date of hire and before July 1, 2014, and
(iii)are not hired by a Participating Company pursuant to the Company’ s acquisition of an entity that does not sponsor a
qualified defined benefit pension plan.
A “Participating Company” is a business unit designated in writing by the Committee as a unit participating in this Plan. A
list of Participating Companies is set forth in Schedule 1.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no employee of the Company shall become a Participant in the Plan on or after July 1, 2014.
1
2. Amount of Benefit . The benefit that each Participant shall be entitled to receive under the Plan is the amount
reasonably determined by the Company to be the dif ference between the Participant’ s actual benefit, if any , under the Qualified
Pension Plan and the benefits that would have been payable under that Plan, subject to the of fset below , if:
(a)    the Qualified Pension Plan had determined pensionable earnings on a “mix and match” basis, as defined below;
(b)    the Participant’ s period of employment service as a Participant at a Participating Company at which no Credited
Service is earned was deemed to be years of Credited Service under the Qualified Pension Plan; and
(c)    the Participant’ s benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan had not been limited by Code section 415 and/or Code
section 401(a)(17).
If a Participant’ s compensation under the Management Incentive Compensation Plan (“MICP”) is included in pensionable
earnings under the Qualified Pension Plan, the Participant’ s total pensionable earnings shall be determined on a “mix and match”
basis. The Participant’ s annual compensation earned under the MICP shall be calculated separately from other annual pensionable
earnings. The average of the three (3) highest years of MICP compensation during the last 10 years shall be added to the average of
the three (3) highest years of other pensionable earnings during the last 10 years to arrive at total final average pensionable earnings
for the applicable period under the Qualified Pension Plan.
The above benefit (the “T ransfer Benefit”) shall be of fset by the benefits payable on behalf of the Participant under the
Lockheed Martin Corporation Capital Accumulation Plan (the “Lockheed Martin CAP”) and under the Lockheed Martin Account
Balance Retirement Plan (“ABRP”). In calculating the of fset, the Participant’ s total account balance as of the earlier of termination
of employment or October 5, 2018 from the Lockheed Martin CAP shall be converted into an annuity using the 1983 Group
Annuity Mortality T able and shall be calculated as of the Participant’ s termination of employment, using the PBGC immediate
interest rate for lump sums rate plus 1% and the Participant’ s age on the date of distribution. If the Participant received any prior
distributions from the Lockheed Martin CAP , the T ransfer Benefit shall be reduced by the annuity value of the prior distribution,
using the Lockheed Martin CAP distribution amount, the PBGC interest rate plus 1% and Participant’ s age on the date of
distribution. The T ransfer Benefit is then reduced for the amount of the normal retirement benefit from the ABRP . Notwithstanding
the foregoing, ef fective for terminations from active service and pre-retirement deaths on or after July 1, 2015, the of fset and prior
distribution reduction described above each shall be converted into an annuity using the applicable mortality table under Code
section 417(e)(3); provided that if use of the applicable mortality table under Code section 417(e)(3) results in an annuity that is
more than the annuity calculated using the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality T able with sex distinction, as determined at the time
benefits become payable pursuant to Article IV , then the annuity shall be calculated using the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality T able
with sex distinction.
Combined benefits under this Article II, the Lockheed Martin CAP and the ABRP are intended to supplement the
Participant’ s actual benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan as necessary to provide the Participant with the full benefit the
Participant would have received under the Qualified Pension Plan on a “mix and match” basis, without regard to the limitations of
Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17), and with the special adjustments described above. T o prevent duplication of
benefits, the full benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan and the enhanced T ransfer Benefit described above shall be calculated
without reduction for Code section 415 and Code section
2
401(a)(17), then reduced by the benefit payable from the Qualified Pension Plan (without regard to the portion of such benefit
attributable to employee contributions, if any), then reduced by the benefit payable from the Lockheed Martin CAP (as of the
earlier of termination of employment or October 5, 2018) and ABRP , and then reduced by the 2004 Grandfathered Benefit, to the
extent permissible under Code section 409A. The remainder of the benefit shall be paid from this Plan. Participants have no right to
duplicate benefits with respect to the same period of service, and the Committee may make such adjustments to the benefits under
this Plan as the Committee deems necessary to prevent duplication of benefits.
The benefit payable under this Article II shall be payable to the Participant or Beneficiary or any other person who is
receiving or entitled to receive benefits with respect to the Participant under the Qualified Pension Plan.
If the benefits payable under the Qualified Pension Plan to any Participant are increased following the Participant’ s
retirement as a result or a general increase in the benefits payable to retired employees under that Plan, no such increase will be
made under this Plan.
ARTICLE III.
INCENTIVE BENEFITS
1.Eligibility . Benefits pursuant to this Article III are available to the employees described below . However , an employee
who terminated employment with Lockheed Corporation prior to January 1, 1984, when eligible for a deferred retirement benefit
under Section 5.03 of the Lockheed Retirement Plan for Certain Salaried Employees is not eligible to receive a benefit under this
Article III.
An employee or former employee of Lockheed Martin Corporation and its subsidiaries who, prior to July 2, 2014:
(a) is employed by a Lockheed Martin business unit that is not covered by a Qualified Pension Plan, and
(b) is identified by such business unit as a key employee, and

determines is a corresponding incentive plan; and
(d) who has been specifically designated in writing before July 1, 2014 by the Committee as a Participant; and
(e) who is not eligible for a benefit under Article II of this Plan
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no employee of the Company shall become a Participant in the Plan on or after July 1, 2014.
2. Amount of Benefit .
A.    Normal or Disability Retirement . The benefit payable under this Article III to a Participant is the amount reasonably
determined to be the dif ference between the Participant’ s actual benefit under the Lockheed Martin Retirement Plan for Certain
Salaried Employees (or such other
3
Qualified Pension Plan as designated by the Committee (the “Designated Qualified Plan”)) and the benefits that would have been
payable under that Plan, subject to the of fset below , if:
(a) the Designated Qualified Plan had determined pensionable earnings on a “mix and match” basis as defined
below;
(b) the Participant’ s period of employment service as a Participant with the Company during which period no
Credited Service is earned either because the Participant was not in a covered group or because of a limitation on Credited
Service under the Qualified Pension, was deemed to be years of Credited Service under the Designated Qualified Pension
Plan; and
(c) the Participant’ s benefit under the Designated Qualified Plan had not been limited by Code section 415 and/or
Code section 401(a)(17).
If a Participant’ s compensation under the Management Incentive Compensation Plan (“MICP”) is included in pensionable
earnings under the Qualified Pension Plan, the Participant’ s total pensionable earnings shall be determined on a “mix and match”
basis. The Participant’ s annual compensation earned under the MICP shall be calculated separately from other annual pensionable
earnings. The average of the highest years of MICP compensation shall be added to the average of the highest years of other
pensionable earnings to arrive at total final average pensionable earnings for the applicable period under the Qualified Pension
Plan.
The above benefit (the “Incentive Benefit”) shall be of fset by the benefits payable on behalf of the Participant under the
Lockheed Martin Corporation Capital Accumulation Plan (the “Lockheed Martin CAP”) and under the Lockheed Martin Account
Balance Retirement Plan (“ABRP”). In calculating the of fset, the Participant’ s total account balance from the Lockheed Martin
CAP as of the earlier of termination of employment or October 5, 2018 shall be converted into an annuity using the 1983 Group
Annuity Mortality T able and shall be calculated as of the Participant’ s termination of employment, using the PBGC immediate
interest rate for lump sums rate plus 1% and Participant’ s age on the date of distribution. If the Participant received any prior
distributions from the Lockheed Martin CAP , the Incentive Benefit shall be reduced by the annuity value of the prior distribution,
using the Lockheed Martin CAP distribution amount. PBGC immediate interest rate for lump sums rate plus 1% and Participant’ s
age on the date of distribution. The Incentive Benefit is then reduced for the amount of the Participant’ s normal retirement benefit
from the ABRP , and then reduced by the Participant’ s 2004 Grandfathered Benefit, to the extent permissible under Code section
409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ef fective for terminations from active service and pre retirement deaths on or after July 1,
2015, the of fset and prior distribution reduction described above each shall be converted into an annuity using the applicable
mortality table under Code section 417(e)(3); provided that if use of the applicable mortality table under Code section 417(e)(3)
results in an annuity that is more than the annuity calculated using the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality T able with sex distinction, as
determined at the time benefits become payable pursuant to Article IV , then the annuity shall be calculated using the 1983 Group
Annuity Mortality T able with sex distinction.
B. No Duplication . Combined benefits under this Article III, the Lockheed Martin CAP and the ABRP are intended to
supplement the Participant’ s actual benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan as necessary to provide the Participant with the full
benefit the Participant would have received under the Qualified Pension Plan on a “mix and match” basis, without regard to the
limitations of Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17), and with the special adjustments described above. T o prevent
duplication of benefits, the full benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan and the enhanced Incentive Benefit described above shall
be calculated without reduction for Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17), then reduced by the benefit payable from the
Qualified Pension Plan then
4
reduced by the benefit payable from the Lockheed Martin CAP (as of the earlier of termination of employment or October 5, 2018)
and ABRP , and then reduced by the Participant’ s 2004 Grandfathered Benefit, to the extent permissible under Code section 409A.
The remainder of the benefit shall be paid from this Plan. Participants have no right to duplicate benefits with respect to the same
period of service, and the Committee may make such adjustments to the benefits under this Plan as the Committee deems necessary
to prevent duplication of benefits.
The benefit payable under this Article III shall be payable to the Participant or Beneficiary or any other person who would
be entitled to receive benefits with respect to the Participant under the Designated Qualified Plan.
If the benefits that would be payable under the Designated Qualified Plan to any Participant are increased following the
Participant’ s retirement as a result of a general increase in the benefits payable to retired employees under that Plan, no such
increase will be made under this Plan.

disability pension from the Lockheed Martin Retirement Income Plan or the Lockheed Martin Corporation Retirement
Income Plan III shall be paid in the form elected by the Participant under the terms of the Plan as soon as administratively
practicable (but no later than 90 days) following the date the Participant is reasonably determined by the Company to be
Disabled. For the purposes of this Section 1(d)(ii), the terms “Disabled” or “Disability” shall have the meaning set forth in
the Lockheed Martin Retirement Income Plan or the Lockheed Martin Corporation Retirement Income Plan III, as
applicable, to the extent consistent with the requirements of Code section 409A(a)(2)(C).
(e)    Prospective Change of Payment Elections . Participants may elect to change the form of payment of benefits or further
delay the commencement of benefits as provided in this Section 1(e). All elections under this Section 1(e) must be made in the
form and manner prescribed by the Company . This Section 1(e) does not apply to Surviving Spouses or Beneficiaries. Subject to
the provisions of Code section 409A, other changes in the form of benefit, including changes between actuarially equivalent forms
of benefit, if any , may be made only as determined by the Senior V ice President, Human Resources, of the Company in accordance
with Code section 409A.
(i)    Form of Payment . A Participant who has validly elected (or deemed to have elected) payment as an annuity (as
described in Section 1(a) of Article IV) or has validly elected a lump sum payment (in accordance with Section 1(b) of
Article IV) may later elect to receive payment in any form (annuity or lump sum) designated by the Senior V ice President,
Human
7
Resources, of the Company , provided that such election is made in the form and manner determined by the Senior V ice
President, Human Resources not less than twelve (12) months before the date the payment would have first commenced
under the Participant’ s prior election. In addition, the first payment under the new election must commence no earlier than
sixty (60) months from the date when the payment would have first commenced under the Participant’ s prior election. Such
change in election shall not be given ef fect until twelve (12) months from the date that the change in election is delivered to
the Company .
(ii)    Timing of Payment . Regardless of the form of payment, a Participant may elect to delay payment of his benefit
provided such election is made in writing in the form and manner determined by the Senior V ice President, Human
Resources, not less than twelve (12) months before the date the payment would have first commenced under the
Participant’ s prior election. In addition, the first payment under the new election must commence no earlier than sixty (60)
months from when the payment would have first commenced under the Participant’ s prior election. No interest shall be paid
between the date of T ermination of Employment or attainment of age fifty-five (55), as applicable, and the payment date.
Such change in election shall not be given ef fect until twelve (12) months from the date that the change in election is
delivered to the Company .
(f)    Notwithstanding the above, for periods prior to January 1, 2009 (or such later date as may be provided by the Internal
Revenue Service in guidance of general applicability), the Senior V ice President, Human Resources may provide alternative rules
for elections with respect to the commencement of payment and form of payment, provided that such rules conform to Code section
409A and Internal Revenue Service guidance issued thereunder .
(g)    If a Participant participates in more than one supplemental pension plan sponsored by the Corporation, the Participant
must make a single election that shall apply to his or her benefits under all such plans with respect to the form of annuity (under
Section 1(a) of this Article IV) and with respect to prospective changes of payment (under Section 1(e) of this Article IV).
2. Deductibility of Payments . Subject to the provisions of Section Code section 409A, in the event that the Company
reasonably anticipates that the payment of benefits in accordance with the Participant’ s election under Section 1 would prevent the
Company from claiming an income tax deduction with respect to any portion of the benefits paid under Code section 162(m), the
Committee shall have the right to delay the timing of distributions from the Participant’ s Account as necessary to maximize the
Company’ s tax deductions. In the exercise of its discretion to adopt a delayed distribution schedule, the Committee shall undertake
to have distributions made at such times and in such amounts as the Company reasonably anticipates, or should reasonably
anticipate, that if the payment is made during such year , the deduction will not be barred by Code section 162(m) or upon a
Termination of Employment in accordance with T reasury Regulation section 1.409A-2(b)(7)(i), consistent with the objective of
maximum deductibility for the Company . The Committee shall have no authority to reduce a Participant’ s Account Balance or to
pay aggregate benefits less than the Participant’ s Account Balance in the event that all or a portion thereof would not be deductible
by the Company . All scheduled payments under this Plan and any other plan required to be aggregated with this Plan must be
delayed in order for such payment to be delayed pursuant to this Section 2.

APPENDIX A T O ANNEX III
GRANDF ATHERED BENEFITS UNDER THE LMC TRANSFER COMPONENT
This Appendix A shall govern the portion of a Participant’ s benefit that accrued and vested under the Plan on or before December
31, 2004. This Appendix A shall not apply to the portion of a Participant’ s benefit that accrued and vested under the Plan on or
after January 1, 2005.
ARTICLE I.
TRANSFER BENEFITS
1. Eligibility . Benefits pursuant to this Article I are available to employees of the Company who:
(a)    are Members of the Qualified Pension Plan, and
(b)    are transferred to a Participating Company that does not have a Qualified Pension Plan, and
(c)    are identified by such Participating Company as a key employee at the time of such transfer , and
(d)    are designated in writing by the Committee as a Participant in this Plan.
A “Participating Company” is a business unit designated in writing by the Committee as a unit participating in this Plan. A
list of Participating Companies is set forth in Schedule 1.
2. Amount of Benefit . The benefit that each Participant shall be entitled to receive is the dif ference between the
Participant’ s actual benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan and the benefits that would have been payable under that Plan, subject
to the of fset below , if:
(a)    the Qualified Pension Plan had determined pensionable earnings on a “mix and match” basis, as defined below;
(b)    the Participant’ s period of employment service as a Participant at a Participating Company at which no Credited
Service is earned was deemed to be years of Credited Service under the Qualified Pension Plan; and
(c)    the Participant’ s benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan had not been limited by Code section 415 and/or Code
section 401(a)(17).
If a Participant’ s compensation under the Management Incentive Compensation Plan (“MICP”) is included in pensionable
earnings under the Qualified Pension Plan, the Participant’ s total pensionable earnings shall be determined on a “mix and match”
basis. The Participant’ s annual compensation earned under the MICP shall be calculated separately from other annual pensionable
earnings. The average of the three (3) highest years of MICP compensation during the last 10 years shall be added to the average of
the three (3) highest years of other pensionable earnings during the last 10 years to arrive at total final average pensionable earnings
for the applicable period under the Qualified Pension Plan.
1
The above benefit (the “T ransfer Benefit”) shall be of fset by the benefits payable on behalf of the Participant under the
Lockheed Martin Corporation Capital Accumulation Plan (the “Lockheed Martin CAP”) and under the Lockheed Martin Account
Balance Retirement Plan (“ABRP”). In calculating the of fset, the Participant’ s total account balance from the Lockheed Martin
CAP shall be converted into an annuity using the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality T able for males and the PBGC interest rate. The
benefits payable under the Lockheed Martin CAP shall be calculated as of the Participant’ s termination of employment, using the
Actuarial Equivalent. If the Participant received any prior distributions from the Lockheed Martin CAP , the T ransfer Benefit shall
be reduced by the annuity value of the prior distribution, using the Lockheed Martin CAP distribution amount, the PBGC interest
rate plus 1% and Participant’ s age on the date of distribution. The T ransfer Benefit is then reduced for the amount of the normal
retirement benefit from the ABRP .
Combined benefits under this Article I, the Lockheed Martin CAP and the ABRP are intended to supplement the
Participant’ s actual benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan as necessary to provide the Participant with the full benefit the
Participant would have received under the Qualified Pension Plan on a “mix and match” basis, without regard to the limitations of
Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17), and with the special adjustments described above. T o prevent duplication of
benefits, the full benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan and the enhanced T ransfer Benefit described above shall be calculated
without reduction for Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17), then reduced by the benefit payable from the Qualified
Pension Plan, and then reduced by the benefit payable from the Lockheed Martin CAP and ABRP . The remainder of the benefit
shall be paid from this Plan. Participants have no right to duplicate benefits with respect to the same period of service, and the
Committee may make such adjustments to the benefits under this Plan as the Committee deems necessary to prevent duplication of
benefits.
The benefit payable under this Article I shall be payable to the Participant or Beneficiary or any other person who is
receiving or entitled to receive benefits with respect to the Participant under the Qualified Pension Plan.
If the benefits payable under the Qualified Pension Plan to any Participant are increased following the Participant’ s
retirement as a result of a general increase in the benefits payable to retired employees under that Plan, no such increase will be
made under this Plan unless the Committee expressly so provides in writing.
ARTICLE II.
INCENTIVE BENEFITS
1. Eligibility . Benefits pursuant to this Article II are available to the employees described below . However , an employee who
terminated employment with Lockheed Corporation prior to January 1, 1984, when eligible for a deferred retirement benefit under
Section 5.03 of the Lockheed Retirement Plan for Certain Salaried Employees is not eligible to receive a benefit under this Article
II.
2
An employee or former employee of Lockheed Martin Corporation and its subsidiaries who:
(a) is employed by a Lockheed Martin business unit that is not covered by a Qualified Pension Plan, and
(b) is identified by such business unit as a key employee, and
(c) at the time of eligibility for benefits is, or for any year during his or her last ten (10) years of service with
Lockheed Martin Corporation was, a participant in the Lockheed Martin Corporation Management Incentive Compensation
Plan (including the Deferred Management Incentive Compensation Plan of Lockheed Martin Corporation), or any incentive
compensation plan of any subsidiary or af filiated corporation of Lockheed Martin Corporation which the Committee
determines is a corresponding incentive plan; and
(d) who has been specifically designated in writing by the Committee as a Participant; and
(e) who is not eligible for a benefit under Article I of this Plan.
2. Amount of Benefit .
A.    Normal or Disability Retirement . The benefit payable under this Article II to a Participant at normal retirement age is
the dif ference between the Participant’ s actual benefit under the Lockheed Martin Retirement Plan for Certain Salaried Employees
(or such other Qualified Pension Plan as designated by the Committee (the “Designated Qualified Plan”)) and the benefits that
would have been payable under that Plan, subject to the of fset below , if:
(a) the Designated Qualified Plan had determined pensionable earnings on a “mix and match” basis, as defined
below;
(b) the Participant’ s period of employment service as a Participant with the Company at which no Credited Service is
earned because the Participant was not in a covered group or because of a limitation on Credited Service under the
Qualified Pension Plan was deemed to be years of Credited Service under the Designated Qualified Plan; and
(c) the Participant’ s benefit under the Designated Qualified Plan had not been limited by Code section 415 and/or
Code section 401(a)(17).
If a Participant’ s compensation under the Management Incentive Compensation Plan (“MICP”) is included in pensionable
earnings under the Qualified Pension Plan, the Participant’ s total pensionable earnings shall be determined on a “mix and match”
basis. The Participant’ s annual compensation earned under the MICP shall be calculated separately from other annual pensionable
earnings. The average of the highest years of MICP compensation shall be added to the average of the highest years of other
pensionable earnings to arrive at total final average pensionable earnings for the applicable period under the Qualified Pension
Plan.
The above benefit (the “Incentive Benefit”) shall be of fset by the benefits payable on behalf of the Participant under the
Lockheed Martin Corporation Capital Accumulation Plan (the “Lockheed Martin CAP”) and under the Lockheed Martin Account
Balance Retirement Plan
3
(“ABRP”). In calculating the of fset, the Participant’ s total account balance from the Lockheed Martin CAP shall be converted into
an annuity using the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality T able and the PBGC interest rate. The benefits payable under the Lockheed
Martin CAP shall be calculated as of the Participant’ s termination of employment, using the Actuarial Equivalent. If the Participant
received any prior distributions from the Lockheed Martin CAP , the Incentive Benefit shall be reduced by the annuity value of the
prior distribution, using the Lockheed Martin CAP distribution amount, PBGC immediate interest rate for lump sums rate plus 1%
and Participant’ s age on the date of distribution. The Incentive Benefit is then reduced for the amount of the Participant’ s normal
retirement benefit from the ABRP .
B.    Early Retirement . The benefit payable under this Article II to a Participant who satisfies the Designated Qualified Plan
rules for early retirement eligibility as set forth in Article IV of the Qualified Pension Plan or for a deferred monthly retirement
benefit in accordance with the rules set forth in Article VIII of the Qualified Pension Plan, whether or not such Participant is a
member of the Qualified Pension Plan, shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the Qualified Pension
Plan, for early retirement, or Article VIII of the Qualified Pension Plan, for deferred retirement, as applied to the benefit amount
calculated in accordance with Paragraph A, above.
C. Pre-Retirement Surviving Spouse Benefit . If a Pre-retirement Surviving Spouse Benefit would have applied had the
Participant been eligible to participate in the Designated Qualified Plan, such survivor benefit shall automatically apply to any
benefit which he or she may be eligible under this Plan. The survivor benefit shall be adjusted and paid in the same manner as such
pension payable under the Designated Qualified Plan would be adjusted and paid on account of such survivor benefit.
Combined benefits under this Article II, the Lockheed Martin CAP and the ABRP are intended to supplement the Participant’ s
actual benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan as necessary to provide the Participant with the full benefit the Participant would
have received under the Qualified Pension Plan on a “mix and match” basis, without regard to the limitations of Code section 415
and Code section 401(a)(17), and with the special adjustments described above. T o prevent duplication of benefits, the full benefit
under the Qualified Pension Plan and the enhanced Incentive Benefit described above shall be calculated without reduction for
Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17), then reduced by the benefit payable from the Qualified Pension Plan, and then
reduced by the benefit payable from the Lockheed Martin CAP and ABRP . The remainder of the benefit shall be paid from this
Plan. Participants have no right to duplicate benefits with respect to the same period of service, and the Committee may make such
adjustments to the benefits under this Plan as the Committee deems necessary to prevent duplication of benefits.
The benefit payable under this Article II shall be payable to the Participant or Beneficiary or any other person who would be
entitled to receive benefits with respect to the Participant under the Designated Qualified Plan.
If the benefits that would be payable under the Designated Qualified Plan to any Participant are increased following the
Participant’ s retirement as a result of a general increase in the
4
benefits payable to retired employees under that Plan, no such increase will be made under this Plan unless the Committee
expressly so provides in writing.
ARTICLE III.
PAYMENT OF BENEFITS
1. Form of Payment . Benefits shall be paid in the same form at the same times and for the same period as benefits are paid
with respect to the Participant under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan, except as provided in the following paragraphs.
Actuarial adjustments shall be based on the factors set forth in the Qualified Pension Plan, except as provided in the following
paragraphs. If the benefits payable under this Plan correspond to Qualified Pension Plan benefits with multiple commencement
dates, each portion of the benefits payable under this Plan shall be paid at the same time as the corresponding portion of the
benefits is paid from the Qualified Pension Plan. If a Participant is not entitled to benefits under the Qualified Pension Plan,
benefits shall be paid as if the Participant had been a member of the Lockheed Martin Retirement Plan for Certain Salaried
Employees (or such other Qualified Retirement Plan as designated by the Committee) and had chosen from among the forms of
payment available under such Plan. If an Employee’ s benefits under the Qualified Pension Plan are suspended for any month in
accordance with the re-employment provisions thereof, the Participant’ s benefit for that month shall likewise be suspended under
Articles I and II of this Plan.
Lump Sum Option . A Participant may irrevocably elect to receive a full or partial single lump sum payment in an amount
which is the actuarial equivalent of the benefit described above. The actuarial equivalent will be computed using the Actuarial
Equivalent, and with no interest for the period between the date of termination of employment and the payment date. This election
must be made within the time period for electing the form of benefit under the corresponding Qualified Pension Plan, by filing a
written election in the form and manner prescribed by the Company . Payment will be made six (6) months following the date
payments would otherwise begin pursuant to the above paragraph. If a Participant is not entitled to benefits under the Qualified
Pension Plan, the Participant may make the election at any time after the Participant would have qualified for early retirement
under the Qualified Pension Plan had the Participant been a member of such Plan. Payment will be made six (6) months following
the date of such Participant’ s election.
Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit . In the event the Participant dies prior to the date his or her retirement has commenced
under this Plan and the corresponding Qualified Pension Plan, the pre-retirement survivor benefit payable to the surviving spouse
(if any) under this Plan (the “Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit” and the “Surviving Spouse”) will be payable, at the election of the
Surviving Spouse, in any of the following forms:
(a) in the form of a monthly annuity payable to the Surviving Spouse for his lifetime, with no further payments to
anyone after his death (which will be referred to as the “Regular Form”);
(b) in the form of a lump sum payment which is the actuarial equivalent of the Regular Form (the “100% Lump
Sum”), but with actuarial equivalence determined as of
5
the Election Date using the Actuarial Equivalent, and with no interest for the period between the Election Date (or , if later ,
the date the Participant would have attained age 55 had he survived) and the payment date; or
(c) in the form of a combined lump sum and life annuity benefit of (x) and (y), where (x) equals a lump sum amount
selected by the Surviving Spouse which is less than the 100% Lump Sum and (y) is a monthly single life annuity for the life
of Surviving Spouse (with no further payments to anyone after his death) in an amount that can be provided with the
difference between (x) and the 100% Lump Sum.
Any election to receive the benefit in the form of a lump sum as set forth in (b) above or a combined lump sum and annuity
as set forth in (c) above must be made by the Surviving Spouse no later than 90 days after the date of the Participant’ s death or , if
later, the date the Participant would have attained age 55 had he survived (with the date such election is made by the Surviving
Spouse referred to as the “Election Date”). In the event the Surviving Spouse makes an election for a lump sum or partial lump sum
payment within this period, payment will not be made to the Surviving Spouse until six months after the Election Date (or , if later ,
six months after the date the benefit would otherwise be payable under this Plan).
Cash-out of Small Benefits . Notwithstanding the above, if the V alue of the sum of the benefits payable to a Participant or
Beneficiary under this Plan does not exceed the amount that may be distributed without consent under Section 41 1(a)(1 1) of the
Code, all such benefits will be paid in a single lump sum payment in full dischar ge of all liabilities with respect to such benefits.
For purposes of this Section, V alue shall be determined as of the Participant’ s termination of employment, and shall mean the
present value of a Participant’ s or Beneficiary’ s benefits based upon the applicable mortality table and applicable interest rate in
Code section 417(e)(3)(ii) for the calendar month preceding the Plan Y ear in which the termination of employment occurs.
2. Deductibility of Payments . In the event that the payment of benefits under Section 1 would prevent the Company from
claiming an income tax deduction with respect to any portion of the benefits paid, the Committee shall have the right to modify the
form and timing of distributions as necessary to maximize the Company’ s tax deductions. In the exercise of its discretion to adopt a
modified distribution schedule, the Committee shall undertake to have distributions made at such times and in such amounts as
most closely approximate the payment method described in Section 1, consistent with the objective of maximum deductibility for
the Company . The Committee shall have no authority to reduce a Participant’ s accrued benefit under this Plan or to pay aggregate
benefits less than the Participant’ s accrued benefit in the event that all or a portion thereof would not be deductible by the
Company .
