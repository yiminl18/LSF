SANTA CLARA, Calif., Jan. 26, 2023 -- Intel Corporation today reported fourth -quarter and full-year 2022  financial 
results. The company also announced that its board of directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.365 per 
share on the company’s common stock, which will be payable on March 1, 2023, to shareholders of record as of 
February 7, 2023.
“Despite the economic and market headwinds, we continued to make good progress on our strategic transformation 
in Q4, including advancing our product roadmap and improving our operational structure and processes to drive 
efficiencies while delivering at the low-end of our guided range,” said Pat Gelsinger, Intel CEO. “In 2023, we will 
continue to navigate the short-term challenges while striving to meet our long-term commitments, including 
delivering leadership products anchored on open and secure platforms, powered by at-scale manufacturing and 
supercharged by our incredible team.”  
“In the fourth quarter, we took steps to right-size the organization and rationalize our investments, prioritizing the 
areas where we can deliver the highest value for the long term,” said David Zinsner, Intel CFO. “These actions 
underpin our cost-reduction targets of $3 billion in 2023, and set the stage to achieve $8 billion to $10 billion by the 
end of 2025.”

Business Unit Summary
Intel previously announced several organizational changes to accelerate its execution and innovation by allowing it 
to capture growth in both large traditional markets and high-growth emerging markets. This includes the 
reorganization of Intel's business units to capture this growth and provide increased transparency, focus and 
accountability. As a result, the company modified its segment reporting in the first quarter of 2022 to align to the 
previously announced business reorganization. All prior-period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to 
reflect the way the company internally manages and monitors operating segment performance starting in fiscal year 
2022.

▪AXG delivered record revenue for both the fourth quarter and full year. In January 2023, AXG launched the 
Intel® Xeon® CPU Max Series (formerly code-named Sapphire Rapids HBM) and the Intel® Data Center 
GPU Max Series (formerly code-named Ponte Vecchio). Intel also announced that with AXG’s flagship 
products now in production, the company is evolving AXG’s structure to accelerate and scale its impact and 
drive go-to-market strategies with a unified voice to customers. Accordingly, the consumer graphics teams 
will join CCG, and the accelerated computing teams will join DCAI.   
▪IFS achieved record revenue for both the fourth quarter and full year, with active design engagements with 
seven of the 10 largest foundry customers. It also added a leading cloud, edge and data center solutions 
provider as a customer to Intel 3. 
▪Intel completed the IPO of Mobileye, which achieved record revenue for both the fourth quarter and full year 
of 2022.  Mobileye continued to execute well in its core advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) 
business, as it launched systems into 233 distinct vehicle models in 2022.
Business Outlook
Intel's guidance for the first quar ter of 2023  includes both GAAP and non-GAAP estimates. Reconciliations between 
GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are included below.*
Q1 2023 GAAP* Non-GAAP*
Approximately Approximately
Revenue $10.5-11.5 billion $10.5-11.5 billion^
Gross margin 34.1% 39.0%
Tax rate (84)% 13%
Earnings (loss) per share $(0.80) $(0.15)
Actual results may differ materially from Intel’s Business Outlook as a result of, among other things, the factors 
described under “Forward-Looking Statements” below. 
*Effective January 2023, Intel increased the estimated useful life of certain production machinery and equipment 
from five years to eight years. When compared to the estimated useful life in place as of the end of 2022, Intel 
expects total depreciation expense in 2023 to reduce by roughly $4.2 billion, including an approximate $2.6 billion 
increase to gross profit, a $400 million decrease in R&D expenses and a $1.2 billion decrease in  2023  ending 
inventory values. Intel’s Q1 2023 outlook includes an estimated $350 million to $500 million benefit to operating 
margin or $0.07 to $0.10 benefit to EPS from this change, split approximately 75% to cost of sales and 25% to 
operating expenses. The change in depreciable life will not be counted toward the $3 billion in cost savings in 2023 
or the $8 billion to $10 billion exiting 2025 communicated at Q3 2022 earnings.

statements included in this release are based on management's expectations as of the date of this release and, 
except as required by law, Intel disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect future 
events or circumstances. Unless specifically indicated otherwise, the forward-looking statements in this release do 
not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that have 
not been completed as of the date of this release. Forward-looking statements involve many risks and uncertainties 
that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements. Intel 
presently considers the following to be among the important factors that can cause actual results to differ materially 
from the company's expectations.  
▪Demand for Intel's products is highly variable and can differ from expectations due to factors including 
changes in business and economic conditions; customer confidence or income levels, and the levels of 
customer capital spending; the introduction, availability, and market acceptance of Intel's products, products 
used together with Intel products, and competitors' products; competitive and pricing pressures, including 
actions taken by competitors; supply constraints and other disruptions affecting customers; changes in 
customer order patterns or forecasts including order cancellations; changes in customer needs and 
emerging technology trends; and changes in the level of inventory and computing capacity at customers. 
▪Intel's results can vary significantly from expectations based on capacity utilization; variations in inventory 
valuation, including variations related to the timing of qualifying products for sale; changes in revenue 
levels; segment product mix; the timing and execution of the manufacturing ramp and associated costs; 
excess or obsolete inventory; changes in unit costs; defects or disruptions in the supply of materials or 
resources, including as a result of ongoing industry shortages of components and substrates; suppliers 
extending lead times, experiencing capacity constraints, limiting or canceling supply, allocating supply to Intel/Page 4
other customers including competitors, delaying or canceling deliveries or increasing prices, or other supply 
chain issues; product manufacturing quality/yields; and changes in capital requirements and investment 
plans. Variations in results can also be caused by the timing of Intel product introductions and related 
expenses, including marketing programs and Intel's ability to respond quickly to technological developments 
and to introduce new products or incorporate new features into existing products, as well as decisions to 
exit product lines or businesses, which have resulted and can result in restructuring and asset impairment 
charges.
▪Intel's results may be affected by factors that could cause the implementation of, and expected results from, 
our restructuring or cost-savings initiatives to differ from Intel's expectations. The expected cost savings 
resulting from these initiatives may not be realized and are subject to risks related to the timing and amount 
of related charges, local labor law requirements, and assumptions related to severance, post-retirement, 
and other costs. In addition, significant or prolonged turnover may negatively impact our operations and 
culture, as well as our ability to successfully maintain our processes and procedures, including due to the 
loss of historical, technical, and other expertise.
▪Intel's results can be affected by adverse economic, social, political, regulatory, and physical/infrastructure 
conditions in countries where Intel, its customers, or its suppliers operate, including recession or slowing 
growth, military conflict and other security risks, natural disasters, infrastructure disruptions, health concerns 
(including the COVID-19 pandemic), fluctuations in currency exchange rates, inflation, interest rate risks, 
sanctions and tariffs, political disputes, changes in government grants and incentives, and continuing 
uncertainty regarding social, political, immigration, and tax and trade policies in the US and abroad. Results 
can also be affected by the formal or informal imposition by countries of new or revised export and/or import 
and doing-business regulations, including changes or uncertainty related to the US government entity list 
and changes in the ability to obtain export licenses, which can be changed without prior notice. For 
example, in response to Russia’s war with Ukraine, numerous countries and organizations have imposed 
financial and other sanctions and export controls against Russia and Belarus, while businesses, including 
the c ompany , have limited or suspended Russian operations. Russia has likewise imposed currency 
restrictions and regulations and may further take retaliatory trade or other actions, including the 
nationalization of foreign businesses. 
▪The COVID-19 pandemic has previously adversely affected significant portions of Intel's business and could 
have a material adverse effect on Intel's financial condition and results of operations. The pandemic has 
resulted in authorities imposing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, including manufacturing, 
transportation, and operational restrictions or disruptions, such as the Shanghai port shutdowns. These 
measures have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our 
customers, and those of our respective vendors, suppliers, and partners. Restrictions on our manufacturing 
or support operations or workforce, or similar limitations for our vendors and suppliers, can impact our 
ability to meet customer demand and could have a material adverse effect on us. Restrictions or disruptions 
of transportation, or disruptions in our customers’ operations and supply chains, may adversely affect our 
results of operations. The pandemic has caused us to modify our business practices. There is no certainty 
that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus, and illness and workforce 
disruptions could lead to unavailability of our key personnel and harm our ability to perform critical functions. 
The pandemic has also previously resulted in substantial economic uncertainty and volatility and disrupted 
historical patterns related to demand for our products and services. Demand for our products has been and 
could again be materially harmed in the future, and our ability to accurately predict future demand, trends, 
or other matters may be impacted. The degree to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future 
developments, which are highly uncertain. The impact of the pandemic can also exacerbate other risks 
discussed in this section. 
▪Intel operates in highly competitive industries and its operations have high costs that are either fixed or 
difficult to reduce in the short term. In addition, we have entered new areas and introduced adjacent 
products, such as our intention to become a major provider of foundry services, and we face new sources of Intel/Page 5
competition and uncertain market demand or acceptance of our offerings with respect to these new areas 
and products, and they do not always grow as projected. 
▪Intel's expected tax rate is based on current tax law, including current interpretations of the Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), and current expected income and can be affected by changes in interpretations of 
TCJA and other laws, such as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022; changes in the volume and mix of profits 
earned and location of assets across jurisdictions with varying tax rates; changes in the estimates of credits, 
benefits, and deductions; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities, 
including payment of interest and penalties; and the ability to realize deferred tax assets. 
▪Intel's results can be affected by gains or losses from equity securities and interest and other, which can 
vary depending on gains or losses on the change in fair value, sale, exchange, or impairments of equity and 
debt investments, interest rates, cash balances, and changes in fair value of derivative instruments.   
▪Product defects or errata (deviations from published specifications) can adversely impact our expenses, 
revenues, and reputation. 
▪We or third parties regularly identify security vulnerabilities with respect to our processors and other 
products as well as the operating systems and workloads running on them. Security vulnerabilities and any 
limitations of, or adverse effects resulting from, mitigation techniques can adversely affect our results of 
operations, financial condition, customer relationships, prospects, and reputation in a number of ways, any 
of which may be material, including incurring significant costs related to developing and deploying updates 
and mitigations, writing down inventory value, a reduction in the competitiveness of our products, defending 
against product claims and litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, 
addressing customer satisfaction considerations, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties. 
Adverse publicity about security vulnerabilities or mitigations could damage our reputation with customers 
or users and reduce demand for our products and services.
▪Cybersecurity incidents, whether or not successful, can affect Intel's results by causing us to incur 
significant costs or disrupting our operations or those of our customers and suppliers, and can result in 
reputational harm.
▪Intel's results can be affected by litigation or regulatory matters involving intellectual property, stockholder, 
consumer, chemicals, antitrust, commercial, disclosure, and other issues, as well as by the impact and 
timing of settlements and dispute resolutions. For example, in the first quarter of 2022, the General Court in 
the European Commission (EC) competition matter annulled the EC's findings against Intel regarding 
rebates, as well as the fine previously imposed on and paid by Intel. $1.2 billion was returned to Intel in 
February 2022, and the EC has appealed this decision to the Court of Justice.
▪Intel's results can be affected by the impact and timing of closing of acquisitions, divestitures, and other 
significant transactions, such as the pending acquisition of Tower Semiconductor Inc. In addition, these 
transactions do not always achieve our financial or strategic objectives and can disrupt our ongoing 
business and adversely impact our results of operations. We may not realize the expected benefits of 
portfolio decisions due to numerous risks, including unfavorable prices and terms; changes in market 
conditions; changes in applicable laws; limitations due to regulatory or governmental approvals, contractual 
terms, or other conditions; and potential continued financial obligations associated with such transactions.
Detailed information regarding these and other factors that could affect Intel's business and results is included in 
Intel's SEC filings, including the company's most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, particularly the "Risk 
Factors" sections of those reports. Copies of these filings may be obtained by visiting our Investor Relations website

Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures
In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with US GAAP, this document contains references to the 
non-GAAP financial measures below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful 
supplemental information about our operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results 
between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater 
transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our 
performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in our performance-based RSUs and our cash bonus 
plans.  
Starting in the first quarter of 2022, we incrementally exclude from our non-GAAP results share-based 
compensation and all gains and losses on equity investments. The adjustment for all gains and losses on equity 
investments includes the ongoing mark-to-market adjustments previously excluded from our non-GAAP results .
Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items, as well as the 
related income tax effects where applicable. Income tax effects have been calculated using an appropriate tax rate 
for each adjustment, as applicable. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, 
or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in 
accordance with US GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.
NAND memory 
businessWe completed the first closing of the divestiture of 
our NAND memory business to SK hynix on 
December 29, 2021 and fully deconsolidated our 
ongoing interests in the NAND OpCo Business in 
the first quarter of 2022.We exclude the impact of our NAND memory 
business in certain non-GAAP measures. While the 
second closing of the sale is still pending and subject 
to closing conditions, we deconsolidated this business 
in Q1 2022 and management does not view the 
historical results of the business as a part of our core 
operations. We believe these adjustments provide 
investors with a useful view, through the eyes of 
management, of our core business model and how 
management currently evaluates core operational 
performance. In making these adjustments, we have 
not made any changes to our methods for measuring 
and calculating revenue or other financial statement 
amounts.
Acquisition-related 
adjustmentsAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets 
consists of amortization of intangible assets such 
as developed technology, brands, and customer 
relationships acquired in connection with business 
combinations. Charges related to the amortization 
of these intangibles are recorded within both cost of 
sales and MG&A in our US GAAP financial 
statements. Amortization charges are recorded 
over the estimated useful life of the related 
acquired intangible asset, and thus are generally 
recorded over multiple years.We exclude amortization charges for our acquisition-
related intangible assets for purposes of calculating 
certain non-GAAP measures because these charges 
are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted 
by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. These 
adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our 
current operating performance and comparison to our 
past operating performance and provide investors with 
additional means to evaluate cost and expense 
trends.
Share-based 
compensationShare-based compensation consists of charges 
related to our employee equity incentive plans.We exclude charges related to share-based 
compensation for purposes of calculating certain non-
GAAP measures because we believe these 
adjustments provide better comparability to peer 
company results and because these charges are not 
viewed by management as part of our core operating 
performance. We believe these adjustments provide 
investors with a useful view, through the eyes of 
management, of our core business model, how 
management currently evaluates core operational 
performance, and additional means to evaluate 
expense trends, including in comparison to other peer 
companies.Non-GAAP 
adjustment or 
measure Definition Usefulness to management and investorsIntel/Page 13
Patent settlement A portion of the charge from our IP settlements 
represents a catch-up of cumulative amortization 
that would have been incurred for the right to use 
the related patents in prior periods. This charge 
related to prior periods is excluded from our non-
GAAP results; amortization related to the right to 
use the patents in the current and ongoing periods 
is included.  We exclude the catch-up charge related to prior 
periods for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP 
measures because this adjustment facilitates 
comparison to past operating results and provides a 
useful evaluation of our current operating 
performance.
Optane inventory 
impairmentBeginning in 2022, we initiated the wind-down of 
our Intel Optane memory business.We exclude these impairments for purposes of 
calculating certain non-GAAP measures because 
these charges do not reflect our current operating 
performance. This adjustment facilitates a useful 
evaluation of our current operating performance and 
comparisons to past operating results.
Restructuring and 
other chargesRestructuring charges are costs associated with a 
formal restructuring plan and are primarily related 
to employee severance and benefit arrangements. 
Other charges include a benefit in Q1 2022 related 
to the annulled EC fine, a charge in Q1 2021 
related to the VLSI litigation, periodic goodwill and 
asset impairments, certain pension charges, and 
costs associated with restructuring activity.We exclude restructuring and other charges, including 
any adjustments to charges recorded in prior periods, 
for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP 
measures because these costs do not reflect our core 
operating performance. These adjustments facilitate a 
useful evaluation of our core operating performance 
and comparisons to past operating results and provide 
investors with additional means to evaluate expense 
trends.
(Gains) losses on 
equity 
investments, net(Gains) losses on equity investments, net consists 
of ongoing mark-to-market adjustments on 
marketable equity securities, observable price 
adjustments on non-marketable equity securities, 
related impairment charges, and the sale of equity 
investments and other.We exclude these non-operating gains and losses for 
purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures 
because it provides better comparability between 
periods. The exclusion reflects how management 
evaluates the core operations of the business.
Gains (losses) 
from divestitureGains (losses) are recognized at the close of a 
divestiture, or over a specified deferral period when 
deferred consideration is received at the time of 
closing. Based on our ongoing obligation under the 
NAND wafer manufacturing and sale agreement 
entered into in connection with the first closing of 
the sale of our NAND memory business on 
December 29, 2021, a portion of the initial closing 
consideration was deferred and will be recognized 
between first and second closing.We exclude gains or losses resulting from divestitures 
for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP 
measures because they do not reflect our current 
operating performance. These adjustments facilitate a 
useful evaluation of our current operating performance 
and comparisons to past operating results.
Tax Reform Adjustments for Tax Reform reflect the impact of a 
change in tax law from 2017 Tax Reform related to 
the capitalization of R&D costs.We exclude the impacts of this 2022 change in US tax 
treatment of R&D costs for purposes of calculating 
certain non-GAAP measures as we believe these 
adjustments facilitate a better evaluation of our current 
operating performance and comparison to past 
operating results.
Adjusted free cash 
flowWe reference a non-GAAP financial measure of 
adjusted free cash flow, which is used by 
management when assessing our sources of 
liquidity, capital resources, and quality of earnings. 
Adjusted free cash flow is operating cash flow 
adjusted for 1) additions to property, plant and 
equipment, net of proceeds from capital grants and 
partner contributions, 2) payments on finance 
leases, and 3) proceeds from the McAfee equity 
sale.This non-GAAP financial measure is helpful in 
understanding our capital requirements and sources 
of liquidity by providing an additional means to 
evaluate the cash flow trends of our business. Since 
the 2017 divestiture, McAfee equity distributions and 
sales have contributed to operating and free cash 
flow, and while the McAfee equity sale in Q1 2022 
would typically be excluded from adjusted free cash 
flow as an equity sale, we believe including the sale 
proceeds in adjusted free cash flow facilitate a better, 
more consistent comparison to past presentations of 
liquidity.Non-GAAP

Supplemental Reconciliations of GAAP Outlook to Non-GAAP Outlook
Set forth below are reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable U S GAAP 
financial measure. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, 
financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial outlook prepared in accordance with 
US GAAP and the reconciliations from this Business Outlook should be carefully evaluated. 
Please refer to "Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures" in this document for a detailed explanation of the adjustments 
made to the comparable US GAAP measures, the ways management uses the non-GAAP measures, and the 
reasons why management believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information for investors.
Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the items described above, as well 
as the related income tax effects. Beginning in 2023, income tax effects are calculated using the same fixed long-
term projected tax rate across all adjustments. We project this long-term non-GAAP tax rate on an annual basis 
using a five-year non-GAAP financial projection that excludes the income tax effects of each adjustment. The 
projected non-GAAP tax rate also considers factors such as our expected tax structure, our tax positions in various 
jurisdictions, and key legislation in significant jurisdictions where we operate. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate may 
be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant 
changes in our geographic earnings mix, or changes to our strategy or business operations. Prospectively, we 
believe this approach will facilitate  comparison of our operating results and provide useful evaluation of our current 
operating performance. As described in our explanation of non-GAAP measures above, and consistent with the use 
of our other non-GAAP adjustments, beginning in 2023 management uses this non-GAAP tax rate in managing 
internal short- and long-term operating plans and in evaluating our performance.

non-GAAP tax rate.
