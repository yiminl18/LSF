Item 1.
Business This Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated here
in by reference contain forward-looking statements based on expectations,estimates, and projections as of the da
te of this filing. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. See Item 1A of PartI—“Risk Factors.”
Amazon.com, Inc. was incorporat
ed in 1994 in the state of Washington and reincorporated in 1996 in the state of Delaware. Our principal corporate officesare located in Seatt
le, Washington. We completed our initial public offering in May 1997 and our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Marketunder the symbol “AMZN.”
As used herein, “Amazon.com,” “we,” 
“our,” and similar terms include Amazon.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.General
Amazon.com opened its virtua
l doors on the World Wide Web in July 1995. We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. We are guided by fourprinciples: customer obs
ession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of oursegments, we serve our prima
ry customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. In addition, we provide services, suchas advertising services 
and co-branded credit card agreements.We have organized our oper
ations into three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). These segments reflect the waythe Company evaluates its busin
ess performance and manages its operations. Additional information on our operating segments and product information iscontained in Item 8 of Par
t II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 11—Segment Information.” See Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussionand Analysis of Financial Condition and Resu
lts of Operations—Results of Operations—Supplemental Information” for supplemental information about our netsales. Our company-sponsored rese
arch and development expense is set forth within “Technology and content” in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements andSupplementary Data—Consolidated St
atements of Operations.”Consumers
We serve consumers through our 
retail websites and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We design our websites to enable hundreds of millions ofunique products to be sold by us and by third p
arties across dozens of product categories. Customers access our websites directly and through our mobile websitesand apps. We also manufactu
re and sell electronic devices, including Kindle e-readers, Fire tablets, Fire TVs, and Echo, and we develop and produce mediacontent. We strive to of
fer our customers the lowest prices possible through low everyday product pricing and shipping offers, and to improve our operatingefficiencies so tha
t we can continue to lower prices for our customers. We also provide easy-to-use functionality, fast and reliable fulfillment, and timely customerservice. In addition, we off
er Amazon Prime, an annual membership program that includes unlimited free shipping on tens of millions of items, access to unlimitedinstant streaming of thous
ands of movies and TV episodes, and other benefits.We fulfill custome
r orders in a number of ways, including through: North America and International fulfillment and delivery networks that we operate; co-sourced and outsourced arrang
ements in certain countries; and digital delivery. We operate customer service centers globally, which are supplemented by co-sourced arrangements. See 
Item 2 of Part I, “Properties.”Sellers
We offer programs tha
t enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products on our websites and their own branded websites, and fulfill orders throughus. We are not the selle
r of record in these transactions. We earn fixed fees, a percentage of sales, per-unit activity fees, interest, or some combination thereof, forour seller programs.
Developers and Enterprises
We serve developers and en
terprises of all sizes, including start-ups, government agencies, and academic institutions, through our AWS segment, whichoffers a broad set of globa
l compute, storage, database, and other service offerings.3

Table of ContentsContent Creators
We serve authors and independ
ent publishers with Kindle Direct Publishing, an online service that lets independent authors and publishers choose a 70%royalty option and make the
ir books available in the Kindle Store, along with Amazon’s own publishing arm, Amazon Publishing. We also offer programs thatallow authors, musicians, fi
lmmakers, app developers, and others to publish and sell content.Competition
Our businesses encompass a large v
ariety of product types, service offerings, and delivery channels. The international marketplace in which we compete isevolving rapidly and intense
ly competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world. Our current andpotential competito
rs include: (1) online, offline, and multichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products weoffer and sell to consume
rs and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and all distributionchannels; (3) web search eng
ines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, oracquiring goods an
d services, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including websitedevelopment, advertising, 
fulfillment, customer service, and payment processing; (5) companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or forthird parties, whether onl
ine or offline; (6) companies that provide information technology services or products, including on-premises or cloud-basedinfrastructure and other ser
vices; and (7) companies that design, manufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, telecommunication, and electronic devices. Webelieve that the principal com
petitive factors in our retail businesses include selection, price, and convenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additionalcompetitive facto
rs for our seller and enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers’ ability andwillingness to change business pra
ctices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brandrecognition, and greate
r control over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursuerestrictive distr
ibution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers withrestrictive ter
ms, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and thedevelopment of new business models 
and the entry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliancesthat strengthen their 
competitive positions.Intellectual Property
We regard our trademarks, 
service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectualproperty as critica
l to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements withour employees, customers, pa
rtners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. andinternational domain n
ames, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain ofour proprietary technology. 
We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties.Seasonality
Our business is affected by season
ality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31. Werecognized 33%, 33%, and 
32% of our annual revenue during th e fourth quarter of 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 . Employees
We employed approximately 
341,400 full-time and part -time employees as of December 31, 2016 . However, employment levels f luctuate due to seasonalfactors affecting ou
r business. Additionally, we utilize independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. We have works councils,statutory employee rep
resentation obligations, and union agreements in certain countries outside the United States. We consider our employee relations to be good.Competition for qualifi
ed personnel in our industry has historically been intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff.Available Information

Risk Factors Please carefully consid
er the following risk factors. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flowscould be materially adversely
 affected. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks.We Face Intense Competition
Our businesses are rapidly evolv
ing and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors in different industries, including retail, e-commerce services,digital content and el
ectronic devices, and web and infrastructure computing services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longerhistories, more custome
rs, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer geographic regions. Theymay secure better t
erms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.Competition may intensify, 
including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as ourcompetitors enter in
to business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. Inaddition, new and enhanced techno
logies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices, may increase ourcompetition. The Intern
et facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, and increased competition may reduce our sales and profits.Our Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources
We are rapidly and signi
ficantly expanding our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure tosupport our retail and serv
ices businesses. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management, personnel,operations, systems,
 technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage growtheffectively, which could d
amage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.Our Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Business, Legal, Financial, and Competi
tiveRisks
We may have limited o
r no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our new offerings. These offerings may present newand difficult technology 
challenges, and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other qualityissues. In addition, profitab
ility, if any, in our newer activities may be lower than in our older activities, and we may not be successful enough in these neweractivities to recoup ou
r investments in them. If any of this were to occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operatingresults.
We May Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate
We may not be able to ac
curately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of ourexpenses and investments is f
ixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected.Our revenue growth may not be sustain
able, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on thecontinued growth of demand for th
e products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditionsworldwide. A softening of demand, whether 
caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in decreasedrevenue or growth.
Our sales and operating resul
ts will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to risks described elsewhere in this section and the following:•
our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers’ demands;•
our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers;•
our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders;•
the introduction of competitive websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements;•
changes in usage or adoption rates of the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and web services, including outside the U.S.;•
timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure;6

the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware, viruses, phishing and other spam emails, denial of service attacks, data theft, computerintrusions, outages, and simil
ar events; and•
terrorist attacks and armed hostilities.Our International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks
Our international activities are
 significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In certain international market segments,we have relatively li
ttle operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, andmaintain internat
ional operations and websites, and promote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis.In addition to risks describ
ed elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:•
local economic and political conditions;•
government regulation of e-commerce and other services, electronic devices, and competition, and restrictive governmental actions (such as tradeprotection measures, in
cluding export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs), nationalization, and restrictions on foreign ownership;•
restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content, includinguncertainty as a result of
 less Internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regardingthe physical and digital
 distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights;•
business licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices;•
limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;•
limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure;•
shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow;•
laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, privacy, network security, encryption, payments, and restrictions on pricing or discounts;•
lower levels of use of the Internet;•
lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.;•
lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk;•
difficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;•
different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions;7

Table of Contents•
compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officialsand other third parties;
•
laws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and•
geopolitical events, including war and terrorism.As international e-com
merce and other online and web services grow, competition will intensify. Local companies may have a substantial competitiveadvantage because of the
ir greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, as well as their more established local brand names. We may not be able tohire, train, retain, 
and manage required personnel, which may limit our international growth.The People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and Ind
ia regulate Amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in country through regulations and licenserequirements that may restrict (i) f
oreign investment in and operation of the Internet, IT infrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii) Internetcontent, and (iii) the s
ale of media and other products and services. For example, in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements,www.amazon.cn is operated by PRC companies tha
t are indirectly owned, either wholly or partially, by PRC nationals. In addition, we provide certain technologyservices in China in conjunct
ion with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indiancompanies by foreign enti
ties involved in online multi-brand retail trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics servicesto third-party selle
rs to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold an indirect minority interest in an entity that is a third-party seller on thewww.amazon.in marketplace. Although we b
elieve these structures and activities comply with existing laws, they involve unique risks, and the PRC is activelyconsidering changes i
n its foreign investment rules that could impact these structures and activities. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretationof PRC and Indian laws and regulations, and i
t is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. In addition, our Chinese and Indianbusinesses and operations may be un
able to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or in China enforce contractualrelationships with respec
t to management and control of such businesses. If our international activities were found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC,Indian or other laws or regul
ations or if interpretations of those laws and regulations were to change, our businesses in those countries could be subject to fines andother financial pena
lties, have licenses revoked, or be forced to shut down entirely.If We Do Not Successfully Optimize and Operate Our Fulfillm
ent Network and Data Centers, Our Business Could Be HarmedIf we do not adequately predi
ct customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully, it could result inexcess or insufficient 
fulfillment or data center capacity, or result in increased costs, impairment charges, or both, or harm our business in other ways. As wecontinue to add fulfill
ment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements, our fulfillment and data center networks becomeincreasingly complex and op
erating them becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively.In addition, a failure 
to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network will increase our net shipping cost by requiring long-zone or partial shipments. We andour co-sourcers may be unabl
e to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers. If the other businesses on whose behalf we performinventory fulfillmen
t services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in excess of forecasts, we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may beunable to optimize our fu
lfillment network.We rely on a limited nu
mber of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. If we are not able to negotiateacceptable terms with these c
ompanies or they experience performance problems or other difficulties, it could negatively impact our operating results and customerexperience. In addition, ou
r ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by inclementweather, fire, flood, power loss, 
earthquakes, labor disputes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, and similar factors.Under some of our commerci
al agreements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory andoperating our fulfill
ment network. Our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of these other companies to accurately forecast product demandwould result in unexpected costs 
and other harm to our business and reputation.8

Table of ContentsThe Seasonality of Our Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations
We expect a disproportion
ate amount of our net sales to occur during our fourth quarter. If we do not stock or restock popular products in sufficient amountssuch that we fail to mee
t customer demand, it could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. If we overstock products, we may be required to takesignificant inventory m
arkdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could reduce profitability. We may experience an increase in our net shippingcost due to complimenta
ry upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too manycustomers access our websit
es within a short period of time due to increased holiday demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websitesunavailable or prevent us 
from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. Inaddition, we may be unable to ad
equately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillmentcompanies and customer se
rvice co-sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. We also face risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating tofulfillment network opt
imization and inventory.We generally have paym
ent terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customers.As a result of holiday sales, as o
f December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level (otherthan as a result of cash f
lows provided by or used in investing and financing activities). This operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payableas of December 31. Our accounts pay
able balance generally declines during the first three months of the year, resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash, cashequivalents, and marketable
 securities balances.Our Business Could Suffer if We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Commercial Agreements, Strat
egic Alliances, and OtherBusiness Relationships
We provide e-commer
ce and other services to businesses through commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships. Under theseagreements, we provide web serv
ices, technology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services, as well as enable sellers to offer products or servicesthrough our websites. These arrang
ements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other resource commitments, which maylimit the amount of busin
ess we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, and develop the components of these commercial relationships, whichmay include web services, fu
lfillment, customer service, inventory management, tax collection, payment processing, hardware, content, and third-party software,and engaging third parties 
to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on thevolume of the other company
’s sales. Therefore, if the other company’s offering is not successful, the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or theagreement may be terminated. M
oreover, we may not be able to enter into additional commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms. We alsomay be subject to clai
ms from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing, maintaining, or developing these services.As our agreements termin
ate, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We may in the future enter intoamendments on less favorab
le terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our operatingresults.
Our present and fut
ure e-commerce services agreements, other commercial agreements, and strategic alliances create additional risks such as:•
disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;•
impairment of other relationships;•
variability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and•
difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements.Our Business Could Suffer if We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Acquisitions and Investments
We have acquired and inves
ted in a number of companies, and we may acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies. Thesetransactions creat
e risks such as:•
disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;•
problems retaining key personnel;•
additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested;•
the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, including as a result of acquisitions;9

Table of Contents•
the potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result ofany integration of opera
tions;•
the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our offerings and unanticipated expenses related to such integration;•
the difficulty of integrating a new company’s accounting, financial reporting, management, information and information security, human resource, andother administrative systems
 to permit effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented;•
for investments in which an investee’s financial performance is incorporated into our financial results, either in full or in part, the dependence on theinvestee’s accounting, f
inancial reporting, and similar systems, controls, and processes;•
the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger public company;•
potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest; and•
for foreign transactions, additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political, andregulatory risks associate
d with specific countries.As a result of future acquis
itions or mergers, we might need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt, contingent liabilities, oramortization expenses 
related to intangible assets, any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business. In addition, valuations supporting ouracquisitions and strategic
 investments could change rapidly given the current global economic climate. We could determine that such valuations have experiencedimpairments or other-than-temporar
y declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results.We Have Foreign Exchange Risk
The results of operations of, 
and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international websites and product and service offerings areexposed to foreign exchange r
ate fluctuations. Upon translation, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains orlosses on the remeasurem
ent of intercompany balances. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations hasincreased. We also hold c
ash equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign currencies including British Pounds, Euros, and Japanese Yen. If the U.S. Dollarstrengthens compared to
 these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, when translated, may be materially less than expected and viceversa.
The Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel Could Negatively Affe
ct Our BusinessWe depend on our senior manage
ment and other key personnel, particularly Jeffrey P. Bezos, our President, CEO, and Chairman. We do not have “keyperson” life insurance po
licies. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business.We Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Breaches
As a result of our services be
ing web-based and the fact that we process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including personal information, for ourcustomers, failure to p
revent or mitigate data loss or other security breaches, including breaches of our vendors’ technology and systems, could expose us or ourcustomers to a risk of loss or 
misuse of such information, adversely affect our operating results, result in litigation or potential liability for us, and otherwise harmour business. We use third-par
ty technology and systems for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, encryption and authentication technology,employee email, cont
ent delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions. Some subsidiaries had past security breaches, and, although they did nothave a material adv
erse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future. Although we have developed systems andprocesses that are design
ed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reducethe impact of a secur
ity breach at a third-party vendor, such measures cannot provide absolute security.We Face Risks Related to System Interruption and Lack of Redundancy
We experience occas
ional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us fromefficiently fulf
illing orders or providing services to third parties, which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services. If we areunable to continually add sof
tware and hardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and take other steps to improve the efficiency of oursystems, it could cause syste
m interruptions or delays and adversely affect our operating results.10

Table of ContentsOur computer and communica
tions systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure,earthquakes, acts of war or 
terrorism, acts of God, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events couldcause system interrupt
ion, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services, which couldmake our product and servic
e offerings less attractive and subject us to liability. Our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not besufficient. In addition, we 
may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate for any related losses. Any of these events could damage our reputation and beexpensive to remedy.
We Face Significant Inventory Risk
In addition to risks describ
ed elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties, we are exposed tosignificant inventory r
isks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles andpricing, defective m
erchandise, changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products, and otherfactors. We endeavor to 
accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and/or sell. Demand for products,however, can change signific
antly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. In addition, when we begin selling or manufacturinga new product, it may be diff
icult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. Theacquisition of certa
in types of inventory or components may require significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. We carry a broadselection and signific
ant inventory levels of certain products, such as consumer electronics, and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or duringthe relevant selling s
easons. Any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results.We May Not Be Able to Adequately Protect Our Intell
ectual Property Rights or May Be Accused of Infringing Intellectual Property Rights of Third PartiesWe regard our trademarks, 
service marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and similar intellectual property as critical toour success, and we rely on trade
mark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees,customers, and others to prot
ect our proprietary rights. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products andservices are made av
ailable. We also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business. Furthermore,regulations governing domain n
ames may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiringdomain names that are s
imilar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.We may not be able to discov
er or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. Third parties that license our proprietary rights alsomay take actions that dimini
sh the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. The protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure ofsignificant financi
al and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or preventthird parties from in
fringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquireequivalent or superior t
echnology or other intellectual property rights.Other parties also may c
laim that we infringe their proprietary rights. We have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legalproceedings regarding al
leged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, may result in theexpenditure of signific
ant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us, or the payment of damages, including to satisfy indemnification obligations.We may need to obtain li
censes from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights, but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to usor at all. In addition, we m
ay not be able to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us, or at all, licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual propertywe do not own. These risks have been ampli
fied by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims.Our digital content offeri
ngs depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content. If the digital rightsmanagement technology th
at we use is compromised or otherwise malfunctions, we could be subject to claims, and content providers may be unwilling to includetheir content in our serv
ice.We Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highl
y VolatileWe have a rapidly evolving bus
iness model. The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to, among other risks, the risksdescribed elsewhere in th
is Item 1A, as well as:•
changes in interest rates;•
conditions or trends in the Internet and the industry segments we operate in;11

Table of Contents•
quarterly variations in operating results;•
fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for Internet-related companies in particular;•
changes in financial estimates by us or securities analysts and recommendations by securities analysts;•
changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public;•
changes in the valuation methodology of, or performance by, other e-commerce or technology companies; and•
transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, and speculation.Volatility in our stock pri
ce could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees orgrant larger stock awards 
than we have historically, which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders, orboth.
Government Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business
We are subject to gene
ral business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices,and other services. Existing 
and future laws and regulations may impede our growth. These regulations and laws may cover taxation, privacy, data protection,pricing, content, copyrights, d
istribution, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy consumption, environmental regulation,electronic contra
cts and other communications, competition, consumer protection, trade and protectionist measures, web services, the provision of online paymentservices, information 
reporting requirements, unencumbered Internet access to our services or access to our facilities, the design and operation of websites, thecharacteristics 
and quality of products and services, and the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems. It is not clear how existing laws governing issuessuch as property ownership, libel, 
and personal privacy apply to the Internet, e-commerce, digital content, and web services. Jurisdictions may regulate consumer-to-consumer online businesses, 
including certain aspects of our seller programs. Unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for, or availabilityof, our products and services and 
increase our cost of doing business.We Could Be Subject to Additional Sales Tax or Other Indirect Tax Liabil
itiesAn increasing number of stat
es and foreign jurisdictions have considered or adopted laws or administrative practices, with or without notice, that imposeadditional obligations on r
emote sellers and online marketplaces to collect transaction taxes such as sales, consumption, value added, or similar taxes. We may nothave sufficient lead 
time to build systems and processes to collect these taxes. Failure to comply with such laws or administrative practices, or a successfulassertion by such states or fo
reign jurisdictions requiring us to collect taxes where we do not, could result in substantial tax liabilities, including for past sales, aswell as penalties and int
erest. In addition, if the tax authorities in jurisdictions where we are already subject to sales tax or other indirect tax obligations weresuccessfully to challeng
e our positions, our tax liability could increase substantially. In the U.S., Supreme Court decisions restrict states’ rights to require remotesellers to collect s
tate and local sales taxes (although some states are seeking to have the Supreme Court revisit these decisions). We support a federal law thatwould allow states to require s
ales tax collection by remote sellers under a nationwide system.We are also subject to 
U.S. (federal and state) and foreign laws, regulations, and administrative practices that require us to collect information from ourcustomers, vendors, merchan
ts, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes and report such information to various government agencies. The scope of suchrequirements continues 
to expand, requiring us to develop and implement new compliance systems. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could resultin significant penalties.
We Could Be Subject to Additional Income Tax Liabilit
iesWe are subject to inco
me taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices invarious jurisdictions may b
e subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment isrequired in evaluating 
and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business forwhich the ultimate tax d
etermination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we havelower statutory rates and h
igher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able torealize the rel
ated tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses,acquisitions (including in
tegrations) and investments, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, and changesin the relevant tax, a
ccounting, and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations, including fundamental changes to the tax lawsapplicable to corpora
te multinationals. The U.S., the European Union and its member states, and a number of other countries are actively pursuing changes in thisregard.
Except as required under U.S. tax l
aws, we do not provide for U.S. taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previouslytaxed since we intend to inves
t such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the12

Table of ContentsU.S. If our intent changes or if th
ese funds are needed for our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue or pay U.S. taxes on some or all of theseundistributed earnings and our 
effective tax rate would be adversely affected. We are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictionsmay assess additional inco
me tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, litigation, or the relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles,and interpretations cou
ld have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as forprior and subsequent periods. For inst
ance, the IRS is seeking to increase our U.S. taxable income related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries fortransactions undertaken 
in 2005 and 2006, and we are currently contesting the matter in U.S. Tax Court. In addition to the risk of additional tax for 2005 and 2006transactions, if this l
itigation is adversely determined or if the IRS were to seek transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature for transactions in subsequent years,we could be subject to signifi
cant additional tax liabilities. In addition, in October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examinewhether decisions by the tax au
thorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Unionrules on state aid. If th
is matter is adversely resolved, Luxembourg may be required to assess, and we may be required to pay, additional amounts with respect tocurrent and prior periods 
and our taxes in the future could increase. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits,investigations, and a
ny related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.Our Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks
We have significant suppl
iers, including licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of supply, that are important to our sourcing, services,manufacturing, and any re
lated ongoing servicing of merchandise and content. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guaranteeavailability of me
rchandise, content, components, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. If our current suppliers were to stopselling or licensing me
rchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including as a result of one or more supplierbankruptcies due to poor econom
ic conditions, as a result of natural disasters, or for other reasons, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers ina timely and effic
ient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, if our suppliers or other vendors violate applicable laws, regulations, our code ofstandards and responsibilit
ies, or implement practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous to the environment, it could damage our reputation, limit ourgrowth, and negatively affe
ct our operating results.We May Be Subject to Risks Related to Government Contracts and Rela
ted Procurement RegulationsOur contracts with U.S., as well as stat
e, local, and foreign, government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirementsrelating to their fo
rmation, administration, and performance. We may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and anyviolations could result in v
arious civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments,forfeiture of profi
ts, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, such contracts may provide for termination bythe government at any ti
me, without cause.We May Be Subject to Product Liability Cla
ims if People or Property Are Harmed by the Products We Sell or ManufactureSome of the products we sell or m
anufacture may expose us to product liability claims relating to personal injury, death, or environmental or propertydamage, and may require p
roduct recalls or other actions. Certain third parties also sell products using our e-commerce services that may increase our exposure toproduct liability cl
aims, such as if these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims. Although we maintain liability insurance, we cannot be certainthat our coverage will be 
adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all.In addition, some of our agre
ements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability.We Are Subject to Payments-Related Risks
We accept payments using
 a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, credit accounts (including promotional financing), gift cards, direct debitfrom a customer’s bank a
ccount, consumer invoicing, physical bank check, and payment upon delivery. For existing and future payment options we offer to ourcustomers, we may bec
ome subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processesthat could result in signi
ficant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debitcards, we pay interchange and o
ther fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to providecertain Amazon-branded p
ayment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, andpromotional financing. In 
each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We also offer co-13

Table of Contentsbranded credit card program
s, which could adversely affect our operating results if terminated. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules,including data security 
rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficultor impossible for us to comply. 
If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached or compromised, we may beliable for card issuing b
anks’ costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers,process electronic funds 
transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.In addition, we provide regula
ted services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to thirdparties, and because we provid
e services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf. In these jurisdictions, we may be subject to requirements forlicensing, regulatory insp
ection, bonding and capital maintenance, the use, handling, and segregation of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, andauthentication. We a
re also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, money laundering, internationalmoney transfers, privacy 
and information security, and electronic fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could besubject to additional r
equirements and civil and criminal penalties, or forced to cease providing certain services.We Could Be Liable for Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Sell
ersThe law relating to the l
iability of providers of online payment services is currently unsettled. In addition, governmental agencies could require changes inthe way this business is conducted. Under ou
r seller programs, we may be unable to prevent sellers from collecting payments, fraudulently or otherwise, whenbuyers never receive th
e products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions. Under our A2Z Guarantee, wereimburse buyers for paym
ents up to certain limits in these situations, and as our marketplace seller sales grow, the cost of this program will increase and couldnegatively affect ou
r operating results. We also may be unable to prevent sellers on our sites or through other seller sites from selling unlawful goods, selling goodsin an unlawful manner, or viol
ating the proprietary rights of others, and could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers.Item 1B.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements
This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward
-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Allstatements other than s
tatements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial position,made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K ar
e forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions toidentify forward-lookin
g statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results coulddiffer materia
lly for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customerspending, world events, the rate o
f growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new businessopportunities and the tim
ing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared withservices, the extent to whi
ch we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growthand expansion, the outcomes of l
egal proceedings and claims, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management,seasonality, the degree 
to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks offulfillment throughput 
and productivity. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well asother risks and uncertai
nties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A ofPart I, “Risk Factors.”
Overview
Our primary source of revenue is the sale o
f a wide range of products and services to customers . The products offered on our consum er-facing websitesprimarily include m
erchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and those offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sellelectronic devices. Gen
erally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of itemssold by third-party selle
rs as service sales. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, publishing, certain digitalcontent subscriptions, adver
tising, and co-branded credit cards.Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainab
le growth in free cash flows 1 . Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income andefficiently manag
ing working capital 2 and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operatingincome primarily r
esult from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make inlonger-term strat
egic initiatives. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including loweringprices, improving availabilit
y, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, increasing product categories and service offerings, expandingproduct information, imp
roving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust.We seek to reduce our variabl
e costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include p roduct and content costs, payment processingand related transac
tion costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and aportion of our marketing cos
ts. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to ourwebsites and web services, our el
ectronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment centers. Variable costs generally change directlywith sales volume, while fixed 
costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. Todecrease our variabl
e costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts fromsuppliers, and reduce defe
cts in our processes. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture._______________________

See “Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information on our non-GAAP free cash flows financial measures.(2)
Working capital consists of accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable.18

Table of ContentsBecause of our model we are able to turn our inv
entory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle 3 . On average, our high inventory velocitymeans we generally collect fr
om consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affectedby numerous factors, including ou
r product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability andselection of product off
erings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers.We also expect some var
iability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of salesby third-party sellers, 
the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of paymentterms with suppliers.
We expect spending in te
chnology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, andmerchandising employees. Our technology and con
tent investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due togeographic expansion and the cross-func
tionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, includingAWS, and expansion of new and existing product 
categories and service offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience andimprove our process efficienc
ies. We believe that advan ces in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power and the advances of wirelessconnectivity, will continu
e to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best take advantage of thesecontinued advances in techno
logy, we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices. We are alsoinvesting in AWS, which offers a broad s
et of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings to developers and enterprises of all sizes.We seek to effici
ently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions,and aligning employee compensation with shareho
lders’ interests. We utilize restr icted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because webelieve this compensat
ion model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested andunvested stock awards outstanding, withou
t regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 490 million and 497million 
as of December 31, 2015 and 2016. Our financial reporting currency is 
the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends . For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens y
ear-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses willbe higher than if curren
cies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, ourconsolidated net sales and op
erating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond theU.S. economy through our growing internation
al businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operatingresults and growth rates befo
re and after the effect of currency changes.In addition, the remeasu
rement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreigncurrency exchange rat
es. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidatedtrends and comparisons.

Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Judgments
The preparation of finan
cial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates andassumptions that affec
t the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in theconsolidated financia
l statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to theportrayal of the company
’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, oftenas a result of the need to 
make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies andjudgments addressed below. We a
lso have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant tounderstanding our results. For addi
tional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business andAccounting Policies.” Although we beli
eve that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available.Actual results may diff
er significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.Inventories
Inventories, consisting of produ
cts available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost ormarket value. This valua
tion requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through salesto individual customers, r
eturns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about futuredisposition of inventory are 
inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As ameasure of sensitivity, 
for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2016 , we would have recorded an addition al cost of sales ofapproximately $130 mill
ion.In addition, we enter
 into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. Ifwe reduce these commit
ments, we may incur additional costs.Income Taxes
We are subject to inco
me taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices invarious jurisdictions may b
e subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment isrequired in evaluating 
and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business forwhich the ultimate tax d
etermination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we havelower statutory rates and h
igher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able torealize the rel
ated tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses,acquisitions (including in
tegrations) and investments, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, and changesin the relevant tax, a
ccounting, and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations, including fundamental changes to the tax lawsapplicable to corpora
te multinationals. The U.S., the European Union and its member states, and a number of other countries are actively pursuing changes in thisregard.
Except as required under U.S. tax l
aws, we do not provide for U.S. taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previouslytaxed since we intend to inves
t such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S. If our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our U.S.operations, we would be required to 
accrue or pay U.S. taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings and our effective tax rate would be adversely affected.We are also current
ly subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in anaudit, litigation, or th
e relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results orcash flows in the period or per
iods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. For instance, the IRS is seeking to increase ourU.S. taxable income relat
ed to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for transactions undertaken in 2005 and 2006, and we are currently contesting thematter in U.S. Tax Court. In addition 
to the risk of additional tax for 2005 and 2006 transactions, if this litigation is adversely determined or if the IRS were to seektransfer pricing adjus
tments of a similar nature for transactions in subsequent years, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. In addition, inOctober 2014, the European Commission open
ed a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to thecorporate income tax p
aid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. If this matter is adversely resolved, Luxembourg may berequired to assess, and we may be 
required to pay, additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase. Althoughwe believe our tax estimate
s are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits, investigations, and any related litigation could be materially different from ourhistorical income t
ax provisions and accruals.20

(5,065 )  (6,450 )  (9,876 ) Financing activities
4,432  (3,763 )  (2,911 ) Our principal sources of liqu
idity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fairvalue, were $ 
17.4 billion , $19.8 billion , and $26.0 billion as of December 31, 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 . Amounts held in foreign curren cies were $5.4 billion, $7.3billion, and 
$9.1 billion , as of December 31, 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 , and were primarily Euros, Jap anese Yen, and British Pounds.Cash provided by (used in) operating 
activities was $6.8 billion , $11.9 billion , and $16.4 billion in 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 . Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from
 our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, advertising agreements, and our co-branded creditcard agreements, offset by
 cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation (less amounts capitalized related to internal-use softwarethat are reflec
ted as cash used in investing activities), payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-termobligations. Cash received f
rom our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buyfrom us, our receivables 
from consumers settle quickly. The increase in operating cash flow in 2015 , compared to the compar able prior year period, was primarilydue to the increase in ne
t income, excluding non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation, and changes in working capital.The 
increase in operating cash flow in 2016 , compared to the compar able prior year period, was primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding non-cashcharges such as deprecia
tion, amortization, and stock-based compensation. Cash provided by (used in) operating activities is also subject to changes in workingcapital. Working capi
tal at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timingof cash receipts and paym
ents, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.Cash provided by (used in) investing a
ctivities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, internal-use software andwebsite development costs, c
ash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities ofmarketable securi
ties. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(5.1) billion , $(6.5) billion , and $(9.9) billion in 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 , with the variability caused pr
imarily by our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment, purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities, and changes incash paid for acquisitions. Cash 
capital expenditures were $4.9 billion , $ 4.6 billion , and $6.7 billion in 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 , which primarily refl ect additionalcapacity to support our ful
fillment operations and additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure(the majority of which is 
to support AWS), during all three periods. Capital expenditures included $537 million, $528 million, and $417 million for internal-usesoftware and website developm
ent in 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 . Stock-based compensation cap italized for internal-use software and website development costs doesnot affect cash flows. In 
2014 , 2015 , and 2016 , we made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $979 million , 
$795 million , and $116 million . Cash provided by (used in) financing 
activities was $4.4 billion , $(3.8) billion , and $(2.9) billion in 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 . Cash outflows from financing activities result from principal re
payments on obligations related to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of long-term debt and other. Principalrepayments on obligations r
elated to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of long-term debt and other were $1.9 billion , $4.2 billion , and $4.4 billion in 
2014 , 2015 , and 2016 . The increase in 2015 prima rily reflects additional repayments on capital leases as well as a $750 million repayment on our unsecuredsenior notes. Property and equipm
ent acquired under capital leases were $4.0 billion , $4.7 billion , and $5.7 billion in 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 , with the increase reflecting investm
ents in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS, which investments we expect tocontinue over time. Cash inf
lows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from long-term debt and other and tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions. Pro
ceeds from long-term debt and other were $6.4 billion , $353 million , and $621 million in 2014 , 21

Table of Contents2015 
, and 2016 . During 2014, cash inflows from financ ing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of $6.0 billion of senior nonconvertibleunsecured debt in five tr
anches maturing in 2019 through 2044. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 5—Long-Term Debt”for additional discussion of 
the notes. Tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions are presented as financing cash flows. Cash inflowsfrom tax benefits re
lated to stock-based compensation deductions were $6 million , $119 million , and $829 million in 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 . We had no borrowings outstanding under our $3.0 b
illion unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Agreement”) and $495 million of borrowings outstanding under our $500 million s
ecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) as of December 31, 2016 . See Item 8 of Part II, “Finan cial Statementsand Supplementary Data—Note 5—Long-Te
rm Debt” for additional information. In 
2014 , 2015 , and 2016 , we recorded net tax provisions o f $167 million , $950 million , and $1.4 billion . Except as required under U.S. tax l aws, we donot provide for U.S. taxes on our undistribu
ted earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributedearnings indefinitely ou
tside of the U.S. If our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue or pay U.S. taxeson some or all of these undist
ributed earnings, and our effective tax rate would be adversely affected. As of December 31, 2016 , cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securi
ties held by foreign subsidiaries was $8.6 billion , which included undistributed e arnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside ofthe U.S. of 
$2.8 billion . We have tax benefits relati ng to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are beingutilized to reduce our U.S. tax
able income. In December 2015, U.S. legislation was enacted that extended accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifyingproperty through 2019. Cash taxes paid (n
et of refunds) were $177 million , $273 million , and $412 million for 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 . As of December 31, 2016 , our federal net opera
ting loss carryforward was approximately $76 million and we had approximately $608 million of federal tax credits potentiall y available tooffset future tax liabilities. 
Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit. As we utilize our federal net operatinglosses and tax credits, we expe
ct cash paid for taxes to significantly increase. We endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financialreporting basis.
Our liquidity is als
o affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for standby and trade letters of credit, guarantees, debt, and real estateleases. To the extent we proc
ess payments for third-party sellers or offer certain types of stored value to our customers, some jurisdictions may restrict our use ofthose funds. These restrict
ions would result in the reclassification of a portion of our cash and cash equivalents from “Cash and cash equivalents” to restricted cash,which is classified within “Ac
counts receivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2015 and 2016 , restricted cash, cash equivalents, and market
able securities were $285 million and $600 million . See Item 8 of Part II, “Finan cial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 7—Commitments and Contingencies
” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Purchase obligations and openpurchase orders, consisting of 
inventory and significant non-inventory commitments, were $8.5 billion as of December 31, 2016 . Purchase obligations and open purchase orders are gene
rally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.On average, our high inventory velo
city means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. We expect variability ininventory turnover over ti
me since it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focuson in-stock inventory avail
ability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose toutilize third-party fulfillment pro
viders.We believe that cash 
flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as borrowing availableunder our credit agree
ments, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months, which includes the maturation of $1.0 billion 
of our unsecured senior notes. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I,“Risk Factors.” We continual
ly evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain capital, finance, and operating leasearrangements, repurch
ase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen ourfinancial position.
The sale of additional equ
ity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider theacquisition of, or investm
ent in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidityrequirements or cause us 
to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines orfinancing instruments wil
l be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.22

Table of ContentsResults of Operations
We have organized our oper
ations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. In the first quarter of 2016, we began allocating stock-basedcompensation and “Other oper
ating expense, net” to our segment results, and we conformed prior period segment results to the current presentation. Thesesegments reflect th
e way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements andSupplementary Data—Note 11—Segment 
Information.”Net Sales
Net sales include product and s
ervice sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media contentwhere we record revenue gross. Serv
ice sales represent third-party seller fees earned (including commissions) and related shipping fees, AWS sales, certain digitalcontent subscriptions, cer
tain advertising services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Amazon Prime membership fees are allocated between product salesand service sales and amo
rtized over the life of the membership according to the estimated delivery of services. Net sales information is as follows (in millions):

0.2  0.2  0.1 In 2014, we recorded charges est
imated at $170 million primarily related to Fire phone inventory valuation and supplier commitment costs, the majority ofwhich was included in our North Americ
a segment.Cost of Sales
Cost of sales primarily cons
ists of the purchase price of consumer products, digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including PrimeVideo and Prime Music, packaging suppl
ies, sortation and delivery centers and related equipment costs, and inbound and outbound shipping costs, including wherewe are the transportat
ion service provider. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales uponsale of products to our custom
ers.The 
increase in cost of sales in absolute do llars in 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 , compared to the compara ble prior year periods, is primarily due to increasedproduct and shipping costs result
ing from increased sales.Costs to operate our AWS segment ar
e primarily classified as “Technology and content” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internaltechnology requirements 
and external sales to AWS customers.Fulfillment
Fulfillment costs prim
arily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment and customer servicecenters and payment proc
essing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in fulfillment, AWS costs are primarily classifiedas “Technology and content.” Fulf
illment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transactioncosts, our level of productiv
ity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, timing of fulfillment capacity expansion, theextent we utilize ful
fillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit byimplementing improve
ments in our operations and enhancements to our27

ce features. Additionally, because payment processing and fulfillment costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchaseprice of underlying trans
actions, and payment processing and related transaction and fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales,sales by our sellers have high
er fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales.The 
increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 , compared to the compara ble prior year periods, is primarily due to variablecosts corresponding with incre
ased physical and digital product and service sales volume, inventory levels, and sales mix; costs from expanding fulfillmentcapacity; and payment p
rocessing and related transaction costs.We seek to expand o
ur fulfillment capacity to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes fromsales of our own products as well as sa
les by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.Marketing
We direct customers 
to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our Associates program, sponsored search,social and online advert
ising, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing expenses are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes inrates. To the extent the
re is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see acorresponding change in our ma
rketing expense.The 
increase in marketing costs in absolu te dollars in 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 , compared to the compara ble prior year periods, is primarily due to increasedspending on online marketing ch
annels and television advertising, as well as payroll and related expenses.While costs associated wi
th Amazon Prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effectiveworldwide marketing tools, and in
tend to continue offering them indefinitely.Technology and Content
Technology costs consist princip
ally of research and development activities including payroll and related expenses for employees involved in application,production, maintenance, op
eration, and development of new and existing products and services, as well as AWS and other technology infrastructure costs.Content costs consist principa
lly of payroll and related expenses for employees involved in category expansion, editorial content, buying, and merchandisingselection.
We seek to invest effi
ciently in several areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our processefficiency through rap
id technology developments while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital spendingprojects often support a va
riety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expectspending in technology and content 
to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. The increase in technology and contentcosts in absolute dollars in 
2014 , 2015 , and 2016 , compared to the compara ble prior year periods, is primarily due to increased payroll and related costsassociated with expanding our produ
cts and services, and an increase in spending on technology infrastructure principally allocated to our AWS segment.Technology infrastructur
e costs consist of servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation, rent, utilities, and payroll expenses. Thesecosts are allocated 
to segments based on usage. In 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 , we expanded our technology infras tructure principally by increasing our capacity forAWS service offerings global
ly, compared to the comparable prior year periods. Additionally, the costs associated with operating and maintaining our expandedinfrastructure have 
increased over time, corresponding with increased usage. We expect these trends to continue over time as we invest in technology infrastructureto support increased usage.
The increase in payroll 
and related costs is primarily due to the expansion of existing product categories and service offerings, including AWS, andinitiatives to introdu
ce new product and service offerings.For 
2014 , 2015 , and 2016 , we capitalized $641 million (including $104 million of stock-based compensation ), $642 million (including $114 million of stock-based compensation), 
and $511 million (including $94 million of stock-based compensation ) of costs associated with internal-use software and websitedevelopment. Amortizat
ion of previously capitalized amounts was $559 million , $635 million , and $634 million for 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 . General and Administrative
The 
increase in general and administ rative costs in absolute dollars in 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 , compared to the compar able prior year period, is primarilydue to increases in payrol
l and related expenses.28

Table of ContentsOther Operating Expense, Net
Other operating expense, net was 
$133 million , $171 million , and $167 million during 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 , and was primarily rela ted to theamortization of int
angible assets.Interest Income and Expense
Our interest income was 
$39 million , $50 million , and $100 million during 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 . We generally invest our excess cash in investmentgrade short- to interm
ediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance ofinvested funds based on the preva
iling rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested.Interest expense was 
$210 million , $459 million , and $484 million in 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 . The increase is primarily due to inc reases in our long-termdebt and capital and fina
nce lease arrangements.Our long-term debt was 
$8.2 billion and $7.7 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2016 . Our other long-term liab ilities were $9.2 billion and $12.6 billionas of 
December 31, 2015 and 2016 . See Item 8 of Part II, “Finan cial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 5—Long-Term Debt and Note 6—Other Long-Term Liabilities” for additional
 information.Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), ne
t was $(118) million , $(256) million , and $90 million during 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 . The primary component of oth er income(expense), net is rela
ted to foreign currency and equity warrant valuation gains (losses).Income Taxes
Our effective tax ra
te is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix ofjurisdictions to which they r
elate, changes in how we do business, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments, audit-related developments, foreigncurrency gains (losses), t
ax law developments (including changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices), and relative changes of expensesor losses for which tax benefi
ts are not recognized. Additionally, our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss.For example, the impact o
f discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower.We recorded a provision fo
r income taxes of $167 million , $950 million , and $1.4 billion in 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 . Our provision for income taxes in 2015was higher than in 2014 primari
ly due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income and increased losses in certain foreign subsidiaries for which we may not realize a taxbenefit. Losses for which we may not 
realize a related tax benefit, primarily due to losses of foreign subsidiaries, reduce our pre-tax income without acorresponding reductio
n in our tax expense, and therefore increase our effective tax rate. We have recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assetsassociated with losses for which we 
may not realize a related tax benefit. We also generated income in lower tax jurisdictions primarily related to our Europeanoperations, which are headqua
rtered in Luxembourg.Our provision for income taxes 
in 2016 was higher than in 2015 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income, partially offset by an increase in theproportion of foreign losses fo
r which we may realize a tax benefit, an increase in tax amortization deductions, and a decline in the proportion of nondeductibleexpenses. We have recorded v
aluation allowances against the deferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit. Wegenerated income and loss
es in lower tax jurisdictions primarily related to our European operations.We have tax benefits relating
 to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce ourU.S. taxable income. In Decembe
r 2015, U.S. legislation was enacted that extended accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property through 2019 andmade permanent the U.S. fede
ral research and development credit. As of December 31, 2016 , our federal net opera ting loss carryforward was approximately $76 million 
and we had approximately $608 million of federal tax credits potentiall y available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily relatedto the U.S. federal resear
ch and development credit.See Item 8 of Part II, “Finan
cial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 10—Income Taxes” for additional information.29

Table of ContentsEquity-Method Investment A
ctivity, Net of TaxEquity-method investment 
activity, net of tax, was $37 million , $(22) million , and $(96) million in 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 . The primary component of th isactivity during 2014 was our share o
f a gain recorded by LivingSocial related to the sale of its Korean operations. This gain was partially offset by operating lossesincurred by LivingSocial during 
the period. The primary components of this activity during 2015 and 2016 were our equity-method investment losses during theperiods and impairments 
recorded in 2016.Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measur
es, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our me
asures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations, meet thedefinition of non-GAAP financial m
easures.We provide multiple m
easures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property andequipment with cash and through c
apital and finance leases.Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is cash flow from op
erations reduced by “Purchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development,net,” which is included in cash 
flow from investing activities. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure,“Net cash provided by (used in) ope

lows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residualcash flow available for d
iscretionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representingprincipal reductions of d
ebt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financingoptions may change over tim
e. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statementsof cash flows.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market ri
sk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments.Information relat
ing to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion andAnalysis of Financial Condition and Resul
ts of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”Interest Rate Risk
Our exposure to market risk fo
r changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. Our long-term debt is carried atamortized cost and flu
ctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at afixed rate, will gener
ally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing ratesof interest. All of o
ur cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available-for-sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value onour consolidated balance
 sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-ratedmoney market funds. 
Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses inprincipal if forced to sell 
securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.The following table provides in
formation about our cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expectedmaturity and the rel

Table of ContentsBased upon quoted market prices 
and Level 2 inputs, the fair value of our total debt was $9.3 billion as of December 31, 2016 . Foreign Exchange Risk
During 
2016 , net sales from our Inte rnational segment accounted for 32% of our consolidated revenues. Ne t sales and related expenses generated from ourinternationally-fo
cused websites, and from www.amazon.ca and www.amazon.com.mx (which are inc luded in our North America segment), are primarilydenominated in the funct
ional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include Euros, Japanese Yen, and British Pounds. The results of operationsof, and certain of our int
ercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused websites and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.Upon consolidation, as foreign exch
ange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significantgains or losses on the remeasu
rement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2016 , International segment net sales 
decreased by $489 million in comparison with the prior y ear.We have foreign exchange 
risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance offoreign funds as of 
December 31, 2016 , of $9.1 billion , an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of$455 million, $915 million, and $1.8 bi
llion. All investments are classified as “available-for-sale.” Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated othercomprehensive loss,” a sepa
rate component of stockholders’ equity.We have foreign exchange 
risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as ofDecember 31, 2016 
, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of $225 million, $476 million, and $1.1 billion,recorded to “Other incom
e (expense), net.”See Item 7 of Part II, “Man
agement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Effect of ForeignExchange Rates” for addition
al information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates.Investment Risk
As of 
December 31, 2016 , our recorded value in equi ty and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was $467 million. We record ourequity and equity warrant inv
estments in publicly traded companies at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility, and represents $242 million of ourinvestments as of 
December 31, 2016 . We evaluate our equity and equity warrant investments in private companies for impairment when events andcircumstances indic
ate that the decline in fair value of such assets below the carrying value is other-than-temporary. Our analysis includes a review of recentoperating results and tre
nds, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. The current global economic climate providesadditional uncertain
ty. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. As such, we believe thatmarket sensitivities are not 
practicable.33

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNote 1—DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS A
ND ACCOUNTING POLICIESDescription of Business
Amazon.com opened its virtua
l doors on the World Wide Web in July 1995. We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. In each of our segments,we serve our primary custom
er sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. We serve consumers through our retail websitesand focus on selection, pric
e, and convenience. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices. We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products on ourwebsites and their own branded websit
es and to fulfill orders through us, and programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, app developers, and others topublish and sell content. We s
erve developers and enterprises of all sizes through our AWS segment, which provides access to technology infrastructure thatenables virtually any typ
e of business. In addition, we provide services, such as advertising services and co-branded credit card agreements.We have organized our oper
ations into three segments: North America, In ternational, and AWS. See “Note 11—Segment Information.”Prior Period Reclassifications
Certain prior period amoun
ts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation, including the allocation of stock-based compensation and“Other operating expense, ne
t” to segment results within “Note 11 — Segment Information.” These revised segment results reflect the way our chief operatingdecision maker evalua
tes the Company’s business performance and manages its operations. In Q1 2016, current deferred tax assets and current deferred taxliabilities were r
eclassified as non-current, and capitalized debt issuance costs were reclassified from “Other assets” to “Long-term debt” as a result of the adoptionof new accounting guidance. The adop
tion of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financi
al statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and those entities in which we have avariable interest 
and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and China and that support our seller lending financing activities(collectively, the 
“Company”). Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated.Use of Estimates
The preparation of finan
cial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets andliabilities, revenu
es and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates areused for, but not
 limited to, determining the selling price of products and services in multiple element revenue arrangements and determining the amortizationperiod of these elemen
ts, incentive discount offers, sales returns, vendor funding, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, income taxes, valuation andimpairment of invest
ments, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, collectability of receivables, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill,depreciable lives of p
roperty and equipment, internal-use software and website development costs, acquisition purchase price allocations, investments in equityinterests, and contingenc
ies. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per share is 
calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common sh
ares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a netloss, stock awards are excluded 
from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect. In 2014, we excluded stock awardsof 
17 million . 41

Table of ContentsThe following table shows the cal
culation of diluted shares (in millions):  
 Year Ended December 31,

ic earnings per share462  467  474 Total dilutive effe
ct of outstanding stock awards—  10  10 Shares used in computation of di
luted earnings per share462  477  484 Revenue
We recognize revenue 
from product sales or services rendered when the following four criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,delivery has occurred or s
ervice has been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue arrangements withmultiple deliverab
les are divided into separate units and revenue is allocated using estimated selling prices if we do not have vendor-specific objective evidence orthird-party evidence of the
 selling prices of the deliverables. We allocate the arrangement price to each of the elements based on the relative selling prices of eachelement. Estimated selling price
s are management’s best estimates of the prices that we would charge our customers if we were to sell the standalone elementsseparately and include 
considerations of customer demand, prices charged by us and others for similar deliverables, and the price if largely based on the cost ofproducing the product or servi
ce.Sales of our digital devic
es, including Kindle e-readers, Fire tablets, Fire TVs, and Echo, are considered arrangements with multiple deliverables, consistingof the device, undeliver
ed software upgrades and/or undelivered non-software services such as cloud services and free trial memberships to other services. Therevenue allocated to 
the device, which is the substantial portion of the total sale price, and related costs are generally recognized upon delivery. Revenue related toundelivered software upgrad
es and/or undelivered non-software services is deferred and recognized generally on a straight-line basis over the estimated period thesoftware upgrades and non-softwar
e services are expected to be provided for each of these devices.Sales of Amazon Prime membe
rships are also considered arrangements with multiple deliverables, including shipping benefits, Prime Video, Prime Music,Prime Photos, and access to the Kindl
e Owners’ Lending Library. The revenue related to the deliverables is amortized over the life of the membership based on theestimated delivery o
f services. Amazon Prime membership fees are allocated between product sales and service sales. Costs to deliver Amazon Prime benefits arerecognized as cost of sal
es as incurred. As we add more benefits to the Prime membership, we will update the method of determining the estimated selling prices ofeach element as well 
as the allocation of Prime membership fees.We evaluate whether i
t is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally,when we are primarily oblig
ated in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but notall of these indicato
rs, revenue is recorded at the gross sale price. We generally record the net amounts as commissions earned if we are not primarily obligated anddo not have latitude in est
ablishing prices. Such amounts earned are determined using fixed fees, a percentage of seller revenues, per-unit activity fees, or somecombination thereof.
Product sales represent r
evenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Product salesand shipping revenues, net of promo
tional discounts, rebates, and return allowances, are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers.Retail sales to custome
rs are made pursuant to a sales contract that provides for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon our delivery to the carrier or thecustomer. Amazon’s elec
tronic devices sold through retailers are recognized at the point of sale to consumers.Service sales represen
t third-party seller fees earned (including commissions) and related shipping fees, AWS sales, certain digital content subscriptions,certain advertising s
ervices, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Service sales, net of promotional discounts and return allowances, are recognized whenservice has been rendered.
Return allowances, which reduce 
revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience. Allowance for returns was $147 million , $153 million, and 
$156 million as of December 31, 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 . Additions to the allowance were $1.1 billion , $1.3 billion , and $1.5 billion , and deductions to the allowance were 
$1.1 billion , $1.3 billion , and $1.5 billion in 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 . Revenue from product sales and s ervices rendered is recorded net of salesand consumption taxes. Additional
ly, we periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers,such as percentage discounts o
ff current purchases, inducement offers, such as offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase, and other similaroffers. Current discount off
ers, when accepted by our customers, are treated as a reduction to the purchase price of the related transaction, while inducement offers,when accepted by our customers, 
are treated as a reduction to purchase price based on estimated future redemption rates. Redemption rates are estimated using ourhistorical experience for similar i
nducement offers. Current discount offers and inducement offers are presented as a net amount in “Total net sales.”42

Table of ContentsCost of Sales
Cost of sales primarily cons
ists of the purchase price of consumer products, digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including PrimeVideo and Prime Music, packaging suppl
ies, sortation and delivery centers and related equipment costs, and inbound and outbound shipping costs, including wherewe are the transportat
ion service provider. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales uponsale of products to our custom
ers. Payment processing and related transaction costs, including those associated with seller transactions, are classified in“Fulfillment” on our consol
idated statements of operations.Vendor Agreements
We have agreements with ou
r vendors to receive funds for advertising services, cooperative marketing efforts, promotions, and volume rebates. Wegenerally consider amoun
ts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, andtherefore record thos
e amounts as a reduction of the cost of inventory, cost of services, or cost of property and equipment. Vendor rebates are typically dependentupon reaching minimum purch
ase thresholds. We evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. Whenvolume rebates can be r
easonably estimated, we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold.When we receive direc
t reimbursements for costs incurred by us in advertising the vendor’s product or service, the amount we receive is recorded as anoffset to “Marketing” on ou
r consolidated statements of operations.Fulfillment
Fulfillment costs prim
arily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International segments’ fulfillment and customerservice centers, inc
luding costs attributable to buying, receiving, inspecting, and warehousing inventories; picking, packaging, and preparing customer orders forshipment; payment process
ing and related transaction costs, including costs associated with our guarantee for certain seller transactions; responding to inquiriesfrom customers; and supply ch
ain management for our manufactured electronic devices. Fulfillment costs also include amounts paid to third parties that assist us infulfillment and custo
mer service operations.Marketing
Marketing costs primar
ily consist of targeted online advertising, television advertising, public relations expenditures, and payroll and related expenses forpersonnel engaged in marke
ting and selling activities. We pay commissions to participants in our Associates program when their customer referrals result inproduct sales and classify su
ch costs as “Marketing” on our consolidated statements of operations. We also participate in cooperative advertising arrangementswith certain of our vendors, and o
ther third parties.Advertising and other promotion
al costs are expensed as incurred and were $3.3 billion , $3.8 billion , and $5.0 billion in 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 . Prepaid advertising costs were not sign
ificant as of December 31, 2015 and 2016 . Technology and Content
Technology costs consist princip
ally of research and development activities including payroll and related expenses for employees involved in application,production, maintenance, op
eration, and development of new and existing products and services, as well as AWS and other technology infrastructure costs.Content costs consist principa
lly of payroll and related expenses for employees involved in category expansion, editorial content, buying, and merchandisingselection.
Technology and content costs ar
e expensed as incurred, except for certain costs relating to the development of internal-use software and websitedevelopment, including softwa
re used to upgrade and enhance our websites and applications supporting our business, which are capitalized and amortized over two years 
. General and Administrative
General and administra
tive expenses primarily consist of payroll and related expenses; facilities and equipment, such as depreciation expense and rent;professional fees and li
tigation costs; and other general corporate costs for corporate functions, including accounting, finance, tax, legal, and human resources,among others.

Table of ContentsStock-Based Compensation
Compensation cost for all sto
ck awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the service period. The fair valueof restricted stock uni
ts is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock, and the fair value of stock options isestimated on the date o
f grant using the Black-Scholes model. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using theaccelerated method. The estimated
 number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differfrom our current esti
mates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors whenestimating expected forfeitures,
 including employee level, economic conditions, time remaining to vest, and historical forfeiture experience.Other Operating Expense, Net
Other operating expen
se, net, consists primarily of marketing-related, contract-based, and customer-related intangible asset amortization expense, andexpenses related to leg
al settlements.Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), ne
t, consists primarily of foreign currency gains (losses) of $(127) million , $(266) million , and $21 million in 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 
, equity warrant valuation g ains (losses) of $(5) million , $0 million , and $67 million in 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 , and realized gains (loss es) on marketablesecurities sales of 
$3 million , $(5) million , and $(8) million in 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 . Income Taxes
Income tax expense includ
es U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Except as required under U.S. tax laws, we do not provide for U.S. taxes onour undistributed earnings of 
foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside ofthe U.S. If our intent changes or i
f these funds are needed for our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue or pay U.S. taxes on some or all of theseundistributed earnings and our 
effective tax rate would be affected. Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely invested outside of the U.S.were 
$2.8 billion as of December 31, 2016 . Determination of the unr ecognized deferred tax liability that would be incurred if such amounts were repatriated is notpracticable.
Deferred income tax balances
 reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and arestated at enacted tax rates ex
pected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.Deferred tax assets are eval
uated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We considermany factors when assessing the 
likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative earnings experience and expectations offuture taxable incom
e and capital gains by taxing jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.We utilize a two-step 
approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the tax positionfor recognition by deter
mining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, includingresolution of related 
appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of beingrealized upon ultima
te settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require periodicadjustments and whic
h may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense.Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair value is defined as th
e price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants atthe measurement date. To i
ncrease the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used tomeasure fair value:
Level 1 
—Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.Level 2 
—Valuations based on observable inpu ts other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities inactive markets, quoted price
s for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can becorroborated by observable 
market data.Level 3 
—Valuations based on unobservable inpu ts reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by othermarket participan
ts. These valuations require significant judgment.44

Table of ContentsFor our cash, cash equivalents, or 
marketable securities, we measure the fair value of money market funds and equity securities based on quoted prices inactive markets for identical asset
s or liabilities. All other financial instruments were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or basedon quoted market prices of s
imilar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold any cash, cashequivalents, or marketable 
securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2015 and 2016 . As part of entering into com
mercial agreements, we often obtain equity warrant assets giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies. As ofDecember 31, 2015 
and 2016 , these warrants had a fai r value of $16 million and $223 million , and are recorded within “Oth er assets” on our consolidated balancesheets. The related gain 
(loss) recorded in “Other income (expense), net” was $(5) million , $0 million , and $67 million in 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 . These assets are primarily cl
assified as Level 2 assets.Cash and Cash Equivalents
We classify all highly 
liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.Inventories
Inventories, consisting of produ
cts available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost ormarket value. This valua
tion requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through salesto individual customers, r
eturns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category.We provide Fulfillment by Am
azon services in connection with certain of our sellers’ programs. Third-party sellers maintain ownership of their inventory,regardless of whether ful
fillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and therefore these products are not included in our inventories.We also purchase electronic 
device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for ourproducts. During the normal cours
e of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter intoagreements with contra
ct manufacturers and suppliers. A portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm, non-cancellable comm
itments. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.Accounts Receivable, Net and Other
Included in “Accounts rece
ivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to customers, sellers, and vendors. As ofDecember 31, 2015 
and 2016 , customer receivabl es, net, were $2.3 billion and $3.9 billion , seller receivabl es, net, were $337 million and $661 million , and vendor receivables, net, we
re $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion . Seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which providesfunding to sellers prima
rily to procure inventory.We estimate losses on r
eceivables based on known troubled accounts and historical experience of losses incurred. Receivables are considered impaired andwritten-off when it is probab
le that all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The allowance for doubtfulaccounts was 
$190 million , $189 million , and $237 million as of December 31, 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 . Additions to the allowance were $225 million , $289million 
, and $451 million , and deductions to the allowanc e were $188 million , $290 million , and $403 million in 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 . The allowance for loan losses related to our s
eller receivables was not material as of December 31, 2015 and 2016 . Internal-Use Software and Website Development
Costs incurred to develop softwar
e for internal use and our websites are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software . Costsrelated to design or ma
intenance of internal-use software and website development are expensed as incurred. For the years ended 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 , we capitalized 
$641 million (including $104 million of stock-based compensation ), $642 million (including $114 million of stock-based compensation ), and $511 million 
(including $94 million of stock-based compensation ) of costs associated with internal-use software and website development. Amortization of previouslycapitalized amounts was 
$559 million , $635 million , and $634 million for 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 . Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipment are s
tated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Property includes buildings and land that we own, along with property we haveacquired under build-to-su
it, finance, and capital lease arrangements. Equipment includes assets such as furniture and fixtures, heavy equipment, servers andnetworking equipment, and inte
rnal-use software and45

Table of Contentswebsite development. 
Depreciation is record ed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets (generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the underlying bui
lding, two years for assets such as interna l-use software, three years for our servers, five years for networking equipment, five years for furniture and fixtures, 
and ten years for heavy equipment). Depre ciation expense is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories on ourconsolidated statemen
ts of operations.Leases and Asset Retirement Obligations
We categorize leases at their incepti
on as either operating or capital leases. On certain of our lease agreements, we may receive rent holidays and otherincentives. We recogni
ze lease costs on a straight-line basis without regard to deferred payment terms, such as rent holidays, that defer the commencement date ofrequired payments. Additiona
lly, incentives we receive are treated as a reduction of our costs over the term of the agreement. Leasehold improvements arecapitalized at cost and amortized
 over the lesser of their expected useful life or the non-cancellable term of the lease.We establish assets and
 liabilities for the estimated construction costs incurred under build-to-suit lease arrangements to the extent we are involved in theconstruction of structur
al improvements or take construction risk prior to commencement of a lease. Upon occupancy of facilities under build-to-suit leases, weassess whether these arrang
ements qualify for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance. If we continue to be the deemed owner, the facilitiesare accounted for as f
inance leases.We establish assets and
 liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Suchassets are depreciated over t
he lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs.Goodwill
We evaluate goodwill for 
impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not berecoverable. In test
ing goodwill for impairment, we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value ofa reporting unit is less th
an its carrying amount. If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform a two-stepimpairment test. We test goo
dwill for impairment under the two-step impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of thereporting units. If the f
air value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, asecond step is performe
d to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimatethe fair value of the 
reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operatingexpenses, based primarily on 
expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions.We completed the requ
ired annual testing of goodwill for impairment for all reporting units as of April 1, 2016, and determined that goodwill is not impairedas the fair value of our 
reporting units substantially exceeded their book value. There were no triggering events identified from the date of our assessment throughDecember 31, 2016 
that would require an update to our annual impairment test. See “Note 4—Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets.”Other Assets
Included in “Other assets” on ou
r consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to acquired intangible assets, net of amortization; video andmusic content, net of am
ortization; long-term deferred tax assets; certain equity investments; marketable securities restricted for longer than one year, the majorityof which are attributab
le to collateralization of bank guarantees and debt related to our international operations; and equity warrant assets.Video and Music Content
We obtain video and music con
tent to be made available to customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions andgenerally have terms from 
one to seven years with fixed and variab le payment schedules. When the license fee for a specific movie, television, or music title isdeterminable or reasonably e
stimable and the content is available for streaming, we recognize an asset representing the fee per title and a corresponding liability forthe amounts owed. We reliev
e the liability as payments are made and we amortize the asset to “Cost of sales” on a straight-line basis or on an accelerated basis,based on estimated viewing pa
tterns over each title’s contractual window of availability, which typically ranges from one to seven years. If we are unable to reasonably estimate 
the cost per title, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred. We also develop original content. Theproduction costs of interna
lly developed content are capitalized only if persuasive evidence exists that the production will generate revenue. Prior to 2015, becausewe had limited history to suppor
t the economic benefits of our content, we generally expensed such costs as incurred. In 2015, we began capitalizing a portion ofproduction costs as we have develop
ed more experience to support that future revenue will be46

Table of Contentsearned. Capitalized in
ternally developed costs are generally amortized to “Cost of sales” on an accelerated basis that follows the viewing pattern of customerstreams in the first month
s after availability.Investments
We generally invest our 
excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Suchinvestments are included i
n “Cash and cash equivalents” or “Marketable securities” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, classified as available-for-sale, and reported at f
air value with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss.”Equity investments are a
ccounted for using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence, but notcontrol, over an investee. Equ
ity-method investments are included within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. Our share of the earnings or losses asreported by equity-method 
investees, amortization of basis differences, and related gains or losses, if any, are classified as “Equity - method investment activity,net of tax” on our consolidat
ed statements of operations.Equity investments without re
adily determinable fair values and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for usingthe cost method of account
ing and classified as “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. Under the cost method, investments are carried at cost and areadjusted only for other-th
an-temporary declines in fair value, certain distributions, and additional investments.Equity investments that
 have readily determinable fair values are classified as available-for-sale and are included in “Marketable securities” on ourconsolidated balance she
ets and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss.”We periodically eva
luate whether declines in fair values of our investments below their book value are other-than-temporary. This evaluation consists ofseveral qualitativ
e and quantitative factors regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until aforecasted recovery o
ccurs. Additionally, we assess whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell anyinvestment before recovery 
of its amortized cost basis. Factors considered include quoted market prices; recent financial results and operating trends; impliedvalues from any recent tran
sactions or offers of investee securities; credit quality of debt instrument issuers; other publicly available information that may affect thevalue of our investments; du
ration and severity of the decline in value; and our strategy and intentions for holding the investment.Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, other than goodwi
ll, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of theassets might not be recove
rable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of anasset, a significant ch
ange in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount ofan asset or group of assets may no
t be recoverable.For long-lived assets used in oper
ations, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted,probability-weighted futu
re cash flows. We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. Long-livedassets are considered he
ld for sale when certain criteria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset, the asset is available for salein its immediate cond
ition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value lesscosts to sell. Assets held for sa
le were not significant as of December 31, 2015 and 2016 . Accrued Expenses and Other
Included in “Accrued expenses 
and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to unredeemed gift cards, leases and assetretirement obliga
tions, current debt, acquired digital media content, and other operating expenses.As of 
December 31, 2015 and 2016 , our liabilities for un redeemed gift cards was $2.0 billion and $2.4 billion . We reduce the liabi lity for a gift card whenredeemed by a customer. 
If a gift card is not redeemed, we recognize revenue when it expires or when the likelihood of its redemption becomes remote, generallytwo years 
from the date of issuance. Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue is record
ed when payments are received in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service period.Unearned revenue primar
ily relates to prepayments of Amazon Prime memberships and47

Table of ContentsAWS services. Included in “Other 
long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets was $244 million and $499 million of unearned revenue as of December 31, 2015 
and 2016 . Foreign Currency
We have internationa
lly-focused websites for Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Spain, and theUnited Kingdom 
. Net sales generated from these websites, as well as most of the related expenses directly incurred from those operations, are denominated inlocal functional cur
rencies. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these websites is generally the same as the local currency.Assets and liabilities of 
these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at period-end foreign exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at averagerates prevailing throughou
t the period. Translation adjustments are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss,” a separate component of stockholders’equity, and in the “Foreign cur
rency effect on cash and cash equivalents,” on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Transaction gains and losses includingintercompany transac
tions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are included in “Other income (expense), net” on ourconsolidated statemen
ts of operations. In connection with the settlement and remeasurement of intercompany balances, we recorded losses of $98 million and $215million 
in 2014 and 2015, and recorded a gain of $62 million in 2016 . Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting St
andards Board (“FASB”) issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) amending revenue recognition guidanceand requiring more deta
iled disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flowsarising from contrac
ts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the revenue recognition guidance to reporting periods beginningafter December 15, 2017. Ear
ly adoption is permitted for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. As we evaluate the impact of this ASU, the moresignificant changes tha
t we have identified relate to the timing of when we recognize revenue and the gross amount of revenue that we present. We expect timingchanges to include Amazon-br
anded electronic devices sold through retailers, which will be recognized at the point of sale to the retailer rather than to endcustomers, and the unredee
med portion of our gift cards, which we will begin to recognize over the expected customer redemption period, which is substantiallywithin 
nine months, rather than waiting un til gift cards expire or when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote, generally two years from the date of issuance.In addition, we anticipat
e that certain advertising services will be classified as revenue rather than a reduction in cost of sales. We are continuing to evaluate theimpact this ASU, and related a
mendments and interpretive guidance, will have on our consolidated financial statements. We plan to adopt this ASU beginning inQ1 2018 with a cumulative adjustm
ent to retained earnings as opposed to retrospectively adjusting prior periods.In July 2015, the FASB issued an ASU modifying the accounting fo
r inventory. Under this ASU, the measurement principle for inventory will change fromlower of cost or market va
lue to lower of cost and net realizable value. The ASU defines net realizable value as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course ofbusiness, less reasonably predi
ctable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The ASU is applicable to inventory that is accounted for under the first-in,first-out method and is e
ffective for reporting periods after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect adoption to have a material impacton our consolidated financi
al statements.In November 2015, the FASB issued an ASU amending the account
ing for income taxes and requiring all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified asnon-current on the consolida
ted balance sheets. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2016 and retrospectively adjusted prior periods. Upon adoption, current deferred taxassets of 
$769 million and current deferred tax liabilities of $13 million in our December 31, 2015 consolidat ed balance sheet were reclassified as non-current.In February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the account
ing for leases. The new guidance requires the recognition of lease assets and liabilities foroperating leases with te
rms of more than 12 months, in addition to those currently recorded, on our consolidated balance sheets. Presentation of leases within theconsolidated statemen
ts of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows will be generally consistent with the current lease accounting guidance. The ASUis effective for r
eporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact and expect the ASUwill have a material impact on
 our consolidated financial statements, primarily to the consolidated balance sheets and related disclosures.In March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the account
ing for stock-based compensation and requiring excess tax benefits and deficiencies to berecognized as a component o
f income tax expense rather than equity. This guidance also requires excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be presented as anoperating activity on th
e statement of cash flows and allows an entity to make an accounting policy election to either estimate expected forfeitures or to account forthem as they occur. The ASU is effe
ctive for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt this ASU in thefirst quarter of 2017 by re
cording the cumulative impact of applying this guidance to retained earnings, which we estimate will increase by approximately $700 million 
, and we will continue to estim ate expected forfeitures.48

Table of ContentsThe inclusion of excess tax ben
efits and deficiencies as a component of our income tax expense will increase volatility within our provision for income taxesas the amount of excess tax b
enefits or deficiencies from stock-based compensation awards are dependent on our stock price at the date the awards vest. Based onour current stock price, we would 
expect this change to have a material impact to our provision for income taxes. As a measure of sensitivity, had we adopted thisASU at the beginning of 2016, our income tax 
expense would have decreased by approximately $750 million , which reflects the amoun t of excess tax benefitsgenerated during the yea
r ended December 31, 2016.In October 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the account
ing for income taxes. The new guidance requires the recognition of the income taxconsequences of an interco
mpany asset transfer, other than transfers of inventory, when the transfer occurs. For intercompany transfers of inventory, the incometax effects will cont
inue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party. The ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15,2017, with early adoption permi
tted. We are currently evaluating the impact and expect the ASU will have a material impact on our consolidated financialstatements.
In November 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the present
ation of restricted cash within the statement of cash flows. The new guidance requires thatrestricted cash be in
cluded within cash and cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective retrospectively for reporting periods beginningafter December 15, 2017, with e
arly adoption permitted.Note 2—CASH, CAS

and 2016 . We capitalize construction in 
progress and record a corresponding long-term liability for build-to-suit lease agreements where we are considered the owner,for accounting purposes, during th
e construction period. For buildings under build-to-suit lease arrangements where we have taken occupancy, which do notqualify for sales recogn
ition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance, we determined that we continue to be the deemed owner of these buildings. This isprincipally due to our signi
ficant investment in tenant improvements. As a result, the buildings are being depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives or therelated leases’ t
erms. Additionally, certain build-to-suit lease arrangements and finance leases provide purchase options. Upon occupancy, the long-termconstruction obligations a
re considered long-term finance lease obligations with amounts payable during the next 12 months recorded as “Accrued expenses andother.” Gross assets remain

NTANGIBLE ASSETSAcquisition Activity
On 
September 25, 2014 , we acquired Twitch Intera ctive, Inc. (“Twitch”) for approximately $842 million in cash, as adjusted for the assumption of optionsand other items. We acqu
ired Twitch because of its user community and the live streaming experience it provides. During 2014, we acquired certain othercompanies for an aggrega
te purchase price of $20 million . The primary reason for our o ther 2014 acquisitions was to acquire technologies and know-how toenable Amazon to serve
 customers more effectively.During 
2015 and 2016 , we acquired certain co mpanies for an aggregate purchase price of $690 million and $103 million . The primary reason for th eseacquisitions, none of which were ind

The Company is involved from tim
e to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the following:In November 2007, an Austrian copyright 
collection society, Austro-Mechana, filed lawsuits against Amazon.com International Sales, Inc., Amazon EU S.àr.l., Amazon.de GmbH, Amazon.com GmbH, and Amazon Logist
ik in the Commercial Court of Vienna, Austria and in the District Court of Munich, Germanyseeking to collect a t
ariff on blank digital media sold by our EU-based retail websites to customers located in Austria. In July 2008, the German court stayed theGerman case pending a fina
l decision in the Austrian case. In July 2010, the Austrian court ruled in favor of Austro-Mechana and ordered us to report all sales ofproducts to which the tarif
f potentially applies for a determination of damages. We contested Austro-Mechana’s claim and in September 2010 commenced anappeal in the Commerci
al Court of Vienna. We lost this appeal and in March 2011 commenced an appeal in the Supreme Court of Austria. In October 2011, theAustrian Supreme Court refer
red the case to the European Court of Justice (“ECJ”). In July 2013, the ECJ ruled that EU law does not preclude application of thetariff where cert
ain conditions are met and directed the case back to the Austrian Supreme Court for further proceedings. In October 2013, the Austrian SupremeCourt referred the cas
e back to the Commercial Court of Vienna for further fact finding to determine whether the tariff on blank digital media meets the conditionsset by the ECJ. In August 2015, the Commercia
l Court of Vienna ruled that the Austrian tariff regime does not meet the conditions the ECJ set and dismissedAustro-Mechana’s claims. 
In September 2015, Austro-Mechana appealed that judgment to the Higher Commercial Court of Vienna. In December 2015, the HigherCommercial Court of Vienna con
firmed that the Austrian tariff regime does not meet the conditions the ECJ set and dismissed Austro-Mechana’s appeal. InFebruary 2016, Austro-Mechana appea
led that judgment to the Austrian Supreme Court. A number of additional actions have been filed making similarallegations. In Decembe
r 2012, a German copyright collection society, Zentralstelle für private Überspielungsrechte (“ZPU”), filed a complaint against AmazonEU S.à r.l., Amazon Media EU S.à r.l., Amazon Servic

many. In January 2013, a Belgian copyright collection society, AUVIBEL, filed a complaint against Amazon EU S.à r.l. in the Court ofFirst Instance of Brussels, Belgiu
m, seeking to collect a tariff on blank digital media sold by the Amazon.fr retail website to customers located in Belgium. InNovember 2013, the Belgian court ru
led in favor of AUVIBEL and ordered us to report all sales of products to which the tariff potentially applies for adetermination of dam
ages. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.In May 2009, Big Baboon, Inc. filed a compl
aint against Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon Payments, Inc. for patent infringement in the United States DistrictCourt for the Central Distri

Integrated Business-to-Business Web Commerce And Business Automation System” (U.S. PatentNos. 6,115,690 and 6,343,275) and seeks injunctive re
lief, monetary damages, treble damages, costs, and attorneys’ fees. In February 2011, the court entered anorder staying the lawsuit pend
ing the outcome of the United States Patent and Trademark Office’s re-examination of the patent. We dispute the allegations ofwrongdoing and intend to defend ourselv
es vigorously in this matter.In June 2012, Hand Held Products, Inc., a subsidiary o
f Honeywell, filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc., AMZN Mobile, LLC, AmazonFresh, LLC,A9.com, Inc., A9 Innovations, LLC, and Quidsi, Inc. in the Uni

rcode reader applications, including Amazon Mobile, Amazon Price Check, Flow, and AmazonFresh, infringes U.S. Patent No. 6,015,088,entitled “Decoding Of Real Ti
me Video Imaging.” The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, interest, and an injunction. In March 2016, the districtcourt granted our motion fo
r summary judgment of non-infringement and dismissed the case with prejudice. In April 2016, Hand Held Products appealed thedistrict court’s judgm

aims. The complaints seek an unspecified amount of damages, interest, injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees. We have been named inseveral other simil
ar cases. In December 2014, the Supreme Court ruled in Busk that time spent waiting for and undergoing security screening is not compensableworking time under the fede
ral wage and hour statute. In February 2015, the courts in those actions alleging only federal law claims entered stipulated ordersdismissing those actions without p
rejudice. In March 2016, the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky dismissed the Vance case withprejudice. In April 2016, the pl

In 
2014 , 2015 , and 2016 , we recorded net tax provisions o f $167 million , $950 million , and $1.4 billion . We have tax benefits r elating to excess stock-based compensation deductions 
and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. In December 2015, U.S.legislation was enacted 
that extended accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property through 2019 and made permanent the U.S. federal research anddevelopment credit. As such, c

$ 167  $950  $1,425 Our provision for income taxes 
in 2015 was higher than in 2014 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income and increased losses in certain foreignsubsidiaries for which we may not 
realize a tax benefit. Losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit, primarily due to losses of foreign subsidiaries,reduce our pre-tax inco
me without a corresponding reduction in our tax expense, and therefore increase our effective tax rate. We have recorded valuationallowances against the de
ferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit. We also generated income in lower taxjurisdictions primar
ily related to our European operations, which are headquartered in Luxembourg.Our provision for income taxes 
in 2016 was higher than in 2015 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income, partially offset by an increase in theproportion of foreign losses fo

We are subject to inco
me taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our taxpositions and determining our p
rovision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which theultimate tax determination is u
ncertain. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxeswill be due. These reserves a
re established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fullysupportable. We adjust thes
e reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits. The provision for income taxes includes theimpact of reserve prov
isions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.The reconciliation of ou

As of December 31, 2016 , we had $1.7 billion of accrued tax contingen cies, of which $1.1 billion , if fully recognized, would de crease our effective tax rate.As of 
December 31, 2015 and 2016 , we had accrued intere st and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, related to tax contingencies of $59 million and $67 million 
. Interest and penalti es, net of federal income tax benefit, recognized for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 was $8 million , $18million 
, and $9 million . We are under examina
tion, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the calendar year 2005 and thereafter. These examinations may lead 
to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination aswell as subsequent periods. As previously d
isclosed, we have received Notices of Proposed Adjustment from the IRS for transactions undertaken in the 2005 and2006 calendar years rel
ating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries. The IRS is seeking to increase our U.S. taxable income by an amount that wouldresult in additional federal ta
x of approximately $1.5 billion , subject to interest. To da te, we have not resolved this matter administratively and are currentlycontesting it in U.S. Tax Court. We cont
inue to disagree with these IRS positions and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In addition to the risk ofadditional tax for 2005 and 2006 t
ransactions, if this litigation is adversely determined or if the IRS were to seek transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature fortransactions in subsequent ye
ars, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities.Certain of our subsidiaries 
are under examination or investigation or may be subject to examination or investigation by the French Tax Administration(“FTA”) for calendar yea
r 2006 and thereafter. These examinations may l ead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes. In September2012, we received proposed tax assess
ment notices for calendar years 2006 through 2010 relating to the allocation of income between foreign jurisdictions. In June2015, we received final tax 
collection notices for these years assessing additional French tax of €196 million , including interest and pen alties through September2012. We disagree with the assess
ment and intend to contest it vigorously. We plan to pursue all available administrative remedies, and if we are not able toresolve this matter, we p
lan to pursue judicial remedies. In addition to the risk of additional tax for years 2006 through 2010, if this litigation is adverselydetermined or if the FTA were 
to seek adjustments of a similar nature for subsequent years, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. In addition, in October 2014, the European Commission op
ened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to thecorporate income tax p
aid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. If this matter is adv ersely resolved, Luxembourg may berequired to assess, and we may be 
required to pay, additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods from 2003 onwards and our taxes in the futurecould increase. 
We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including Canada, China, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg,and the United Kingdom. 
 We are under, or may be subj ect to, audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of theseparticular jurisdi
ctions primarily for 2008 and thereafter. 65

Table of ContentsWe expect the total 
amount of tax contingencies will grow in 2017 . In addition, changes in stat e, federal, and foreign tax laws may increase our taxcontingencies. The timing o
f the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issuesraised by the taxing author
ities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will receive additionalassessments by various tax autho
rities or possibly reach resolution of income tax examinations in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements mayor may not result in changes 
to our contingencies related to positions on tax filings in years through 2016 . The actual amount of any ch ange could varysignificantly depending on th
e ultimate timing and nature of any settlements. We cannot currently provide an estimate of the range of possible outcomes.Note 11—SEGMENT INFORMATION
We have organized our oper
ations into three segments: North America, In ternational, and AWS. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses“Fulfillment,” “Mark
eting,” “Technology and content,” and “General and administrative” based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which thecosts are incurred. The m
ajority of technology infrastructure costs are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. The majority of the remaining non-infrastructure te
chnology costs are incurred in the U.S. and are allocated to our North America segment. In Q1 2016, we began allocating stock-basedcompensation and “Other oper
ating expense, net” to our segment results. In our segment results, these amounts are combined and titled “Stock-based compensationand other.” There are no in
ternal revenue transactions between our reportable segments. These segments reflect the way our chief operating decision makerevaluates the Company’s business p
erformance and manages its operations.North America
The North America segment pr
imarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions throughNorth America-focused websit
es such as www.amazon.com, www.amazon.ca, and www.amazon.com.mx. This segment includes export sales from these websites.International
The International segm
ent primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions throughinternationally-fo
cused websites such as www.amazon.com.au, www.amazon.com.br, www.amazon.cn, www.amazon.fr, www.amazon.de, www.amazon.in,www.amazon.it, www.amazon.co.jp, www.amazon.nl, www.amazon.es, and www.amazon.
co.uk. This segment includes export sales from these internationally-focused websites (including expo
rt sales from these sites to customers in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada), but excludes export sales from our North Americanwebsites.
AWS
The AWS segment consists of amounts e
arned from global sales of compute, storage, database, and other service offerings for start-ups, enterprises,government agencies, and a
cademic institutions.66

Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We carried out an eva
luation required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”), under the supervision and with the participation of ourprincipal executive o
fficer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined inRule 13a-15(e) of the 1934 Act, as of 
December 31, 2016 . Based on this  evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that,as of 
December 31, 2016 , our disclosure controls and pro cedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us inthe reports that we fil
e or submit under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules andforms and to provide
 reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officerand principal financial officer,
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible 
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the 1934 Act.Management has assessed the 
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 based on criteria est ablished in InternalControl—Integrated Framework 
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As a result of this assessment,management concluded th
at, as of December 31, 2016 , our internal control ove r financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding thereliability of financial reporting
 and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.Ernst & Young has independently assessed 
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and its report is included below.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our int
ernal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2016 that materially affected, or are reaso nablylikely to materially affect, our i
nternal control over financial reporting.Limitations on Controls
Our disclosure controls and proc
edures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving theirobjectives as specifi
ed above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reportingwill prevent or detect 
all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide onlyreasonable, not absolute, assu
rance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to erroror fraud will not occur or th
at all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.71

Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Sharehold
ersAmazon.com, Inc.
We have audited Amazon.com, 
Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 , based on criteria est ablished in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by 
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Amazon.com,Inc.’s management is resp
onsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal controlover financial repor
ting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express anopinion on the Company’s internal 
control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require thatwe plan and perform t
he audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all materialrespects. Our audit included ob
taining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing andevaluating the design and ope
rating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessaryin the circumstances. 
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A company’s internal c
ontrol over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reportingand the preparation of f
inancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control overfinancial reporting includes
 those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions and dispositions o
f the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation offinancial statements in accordance
 with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only inaccordance with authori
zations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, us
e, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent l
imitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to futu
re periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate.In our opinion, 
Amazon.com, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 , based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheetsof Amazon.com, Inc. as of 
December 31, 2016 and 2015 , and the related consolid ated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’equity, and cash flows for each o
f the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 of Amazon.com, Inc. and our repor t dated February 9, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
