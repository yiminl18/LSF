Our Distribution Network
Our produ cts are primarily brought to market through direct-store-delivery (DSD), customer warehouse and distributor networks.
The distribution system used depends on customer needs, product characteristics and local trade practices.
Direct-Store-Delivery
We, our independent bottlers and our distributors operate DSD systems that deliver beverages, foods and snacks directly to retail
stores where the products are merchandised by our employees or our independent bottlers. DSD enables us to merchandise with
maximum visibility and appeal. DSD is especially well-suited
4
Table of Contents
to products that are restocked often and respond to in-store promotion and merchandising.
Customer W arehouse
Some of our products are delivered from our manufacturing plants and warehouses to customer warehouses. These less costly
systems generally work best for products that are less fragile and perishable, and have lower turnover .
Distributor Networks
We distribute many of our products through third-party distributors. Third-party distributors are particularly effective when greater
distribution reach can be achieved by including a wide range of products on the delivery vehicles. For example, our foodservice
and vending business distributes beverages, foods and snacks to restaurants, businesses, schools and stadiums through third-party
foodservice and vending distributors and operators.
Our products are also available on a growing number of e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications as consumer
consumption patterns continue to change and retail increasingly expands online.
Ingredients and Other Supplies
The principal ingredients we use in our beverage, food and snack products are apple, orange and pineapple juice and other juice
concentrates, aspartame, corn, corn sweeteners, flavorings, flour , grapefruit, oranges and other fruits, oats, potatoes, raw milk, rice,
seasonings, sucralos e, sugar , vegetable and essential oils, and wheat. We also use water in the manufacturing of our products. Our
key packaging materials include plasti c resins, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene resins used for
plastic beverage bottles and film packag ing used for snack foods, aluminum used for cans, glass bottles, closures, cardboard and
paperboard cartons. Fuel, electricity and natural gas are also important commodities for our businesses due to their use in our and
our busine ss partners’ facilities and the vehicles delivering our products. We employ specialists to secure adequate supplies of
many of these items and have not experienced any significant continuous shortages that would prevent us from meeting our
requirements. Many of these ingredients, raw materials and commodities are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for
such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing
agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is
mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such
increases to our customers. In addition , we continue to make investments to improve the sustainability and resources of our
agricultural supply chain, including the development of our initiative to advance  sustainable farming practices by our suppliers and
expanding it globally . See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on how we manage our
exposure to commodity costs.
Our Brands and Intellectual Pr operty Rights
We own numerous valuable trademar ks which are essential to our worldwide businesses, including Agusha, Amp Energy,
Aquafina, Aquafina Flavorsplash, Aunt Jemima, Cap’n Crunch, Cheetos, Chester ’s, Chipsy , Chokis, Chudo, Cracker Jack,

Molochnik, Walkers and Ya. We also hold long-term licenses to use valuable trademarks in connection with our products in certain
markets, including Dole and Ocean Spray . We also distribute Rockstar Energy drinks, Muscle Milk protein shakes and various
DPSG brands, inclu ding Dr Pepper in certain markets, Crush and Schweppe s. Joint ventures in which we have an ownership
interest either own or have the right to use certain trademarks, such as Lipton, Sabra and Starbucks. Trademarks remain valid so
long as they are used properly for identification purposes, and we emphasize correct use of our trademarks. We have authorized,
through licensing arrangements, the use of many of our trademarks in such contexts as snack food joint ventures and beverage
bottling appointments. In addition, we license the use of our trademarks on merchandise that is sold at retail, which enhances brand
awareness.
We either own or have licenses to use a number of patents which relate to certain  of our products, their packaging, the processes for
their production and the design and operation of various equipment used in our businesses. Some of these patents are licensed to
others.
Seasonality
Our busin esses are affected by seasonal variations. For instance, our beverage sales are higher during the warmer months and
certain food and dairy sales are higher in the cooler months. Weekly beverage  and snack sales are generally highest in the third
quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related patterns, and generally lowest in the first quarter . However , taken as a whole,
seasonality has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial results.
Our Customers
Our customers include wholesale and other distributors, foodservice customer s, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores,
discount/dollar stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, hard discounters, e-commerce retailers and authorized independent
bottlers, among others. We normally grant our independent bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture certain beverage
products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area. These arrangements provide us with the right to charge our
independent bottlers for concentrate, finished goods and Aquafina royalties and specify the manufacturing process required for
product quality . We also grant distribution rights to our independent bottlers for certain beverage products bearing our trademarks
for specified geographic areas.
We rely on and provide financial incen tives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products to the
consumer . For our independent distributors and retailers, these incentives inclu de volume-based rebates, product placement fees,
promotions and displays. For our independent bottlers, these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated
annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs , such as consumer incentives, advertising support,
new produ ct support, and vending and cooler equipment placement. Consumer  incentives include coupons, pricing discounts and
promotions, and other promotional offers. Advertising support is directed at advertising programs and supporting independent
bottler media. New product support includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace support, such as
point-of-purchase materials, product placement fees, media and advertising. Vending and cooler equipment placement programs
support the acquisition and placement of vending machines and cooler equipment. The nature and type of programs vary annually .
Changes to the retail landscape, including increased consolidation of retail ownership, the rapid growth of sales through e-
commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers, as well as
the growth in hard discounters, and the current economic environment continue to increase the importance of major customers. In
2017 , sales to Walmart Inc. (Walmart), including Sam’ s Club (Sam’ s), represented approximately 13% of our consolidated net
revenue. Our top five retail customers represented approximately 33% of our 2017  net reven ue in North America, with Walmart
(including
6
Table of Contents
Sam’ s) representing approximately 19%. These percentages include concentrate  sales to our independent bottlers, which were used
in finished goods sold by them to these retailers.
See “Off-Balance-S heet Arrangements” in “Our Financial Results – Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7.
Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information on our independent
bottlers.
Our Competition
Our beverage, food and snack products are in highly competitive categories and markets and compete against products of
international beverage, food and snack companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies, as well as regional, local and
private label manufa cturers, economy brands and other competitors. In many countries in which our products are sold, including
the United States, The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor . Other beverage, food and snack competitors
include, but are not limited to, DPSG, Kellogg Company , The Kraft Heinz Company , Mondelēz International, Inc., Monster
Beverage Corporation, Nestlé S.A., Red Bull GmbH and Snyder ’s-Lance, Inc.
Many of our food and snack products hold significant leadership positions in the food and snack industry in the United States and
worldwide. In 2017 , we and The Coca- Cola Company represented approximately 23% and 20%, respectively , of the U.S. liquid
refreshment beverage category by estimated retail sales in measured channels, according to Information Resources, Inc. However ,
The Coca-Cola Company has significant carbonated soft drink (CSD) share advantage in many markets outside the United States.
Our beverage, food and snack products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty , taste, price, value, quality ,
product variety, innovation, distribution , advertising, marketing and promotional activity , packaging, convenience, service and the
ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends, including increased consumer focus on health and
wellness and the continued acceleration  of e-commerce and other methods of distributing and purchasing products. Success in this
competitive environ ment is dependent on effective promotion of existing products, effective introduction of new products and
reformulations of existing products, the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns, marketing programs, product packaging,
pricing, increased efficiency in production techniques, new vending and dispensing equipment and brand and trademark
development and protection. We believe that the strength of our brands, innovation and marketing, coupled with the quality of our
products and flexibility of our distribution network, allows us to compete ef fectively .
Resear ch and Development
We engage  in a variety of research and development activities and invest in innovation globally with the goal of meeting changing
consumer demands and preferences and accelerating sustainable growth. These activities principally involve: development of new
ingredients, flavors and products; reformulation and improvement in the quality and appeal of existing products; improvement and
modernization of manufacturing processes, including cost reduction; impro vements in product quality , safety and integrity;
development of, and improvements in, dispensing equipment, packaging technology , package design and portion sizes; efforts
focused on identifying opportunities to transform, grow and broaden our product portfolio, including by developing products with
improved nutrition profiles that reduce added sugars, sodium or saturated fat, including through the use of sweetener alternatives
and flavor  modifiers and innovation in existing sweeteners, and by offering more products with positive nutrition including whole
grains, fruits and vegetables, dairy , protein and hydration; investments in building our capabilities to support our global e-
commerce business; and improvements in energy efficiency and efforts focused on reducing our impact on the environment. Our
research centers are located around the world, including in Brazil, China, India, Ireland, Mexico, Russia, the United Arab Emirates,
the United Kingdom and the United States, and leverage nutrition science, food
7
Table of Contents
science, engineering and consumer insights to meet our strategy to continue to develop nutritious and convenient beverages, foods
and snacks.
In 2017 , we continued to refine our beverage, food and snack portfolio to meet changing consumer demands by reducing added
sugars in many of our beverages and sodium and saturated fat in many of our foods and snacks, and by developing a broader
portfolio of product choices, including: continuing to expand our beverage options that contain no high-fructose corn syrup and that
are made with natural flavors; expanding our state-of-the-art food and beverage healthy vending initiative to increase the
availability of convenient, affordable and enjoyable nutrition; further expanding our portfolio of nutritious products by building on
our impor tant nutrition platforms and brands — Quaker (grains), Tropicana (juices, lemonades, fruit and vegetable drinks),
Gatorade (sports nutrition for athletes), Naked Juice (cold-pressed juices and smoothies) and KeVita (probiotics, tonics and
fermented teas); further expanding our whole grain products globally; and further expanding our portfolio of nutritious products in
growing categories, such as dairy , humm us and other refrigerated dips, and baked grain snacks. In addition, we continued to make
investments to reduce our impact on the environment, including: efforts to conserve raw materials and energy, such as by working
to achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions across our global businesses, by helping to protect and conserve global water
supply especially in high-water -risk locations (including replenishing watersh eds that source our operations in high-water -risk
locations and promoting the efficient use of water use in our agricultural supply chain), and by incorporating into our operations,
improvements in the sustainability and resources of our agricultural supply chain; efforts to reduce waste generated by our
operations and disposed of in landfills;  efforts to support increased packagin g recovery and recycling rates; efforts to increase
energy efficiency , including the increased use of renewable energy and resources; efforts to support sustainable agriculture by
expanding best practices with our growers and suppliers; and efforts to optim ize packaging technology and design to make our
packaging increasin gly recoverable or recyclable with lower environmental impact, including continuing to invest in developing
compostable and biodegradable packaging.
Research and development costs were $737 million , $760 million  and $754 million  in 2017 , 2016  and 2015 , respectively , and are
reported within selling, general and administrative expenses. Consumer research is excluded from such research and development
costs and included in other marketing costs.
Regulatory Matters

We are also subject to numerous similar and other laws and regulations outside the United States, including but not limited to laws
and regulations governing food safety , occupational health and safety , comp etition, anti-corruption and data privacy . In many
jurisdictions, compliance with competiti on laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions,
as is compliance with anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act. We rely on legal and operational compliance programs,
as well as in-house and outside counsel and other experts, to guide our businesses in complying with the laws and regulations
around the world that apply to our businesses.
In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture,
distribution or sale of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities used in the
production of our products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages,
while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly , some measures apply a single tax rate per
liquid ounce while others apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the amoun t of added sugar in the beverage and some apply a
flat tax rate on beverages containing a particular substance or ingredient.
In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, product labeling or warning requirements or
other limitations on the marketing or sale of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such
products or the audience to whom products are marketed. These types of provisions have required that we provide a label that
highlights perceived concerns about a product or warns consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances
present in our products. It is possible that similar or more restrictive require ments may be proposed or enacted in the future.
Regulators may also restrict consumers’  ability to use benefit programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in
the United States, to purchase certain beverages and foods. In addition, legislation has been enacted in certain U.S. states and in
certain other countries where our products are sold that requires collection and recycling of containers or that prohibits the sale of
our bevera ges in certain non-refillable containers, unless a deposit, ecotax or other fee is charged. It is possible that similar or more
restrictive requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future.
We are also subject to national and local  environmental laws in the United States and in foreign countries in which we do business,
including laws related to water consum ption and treatment, wastewater dischar ge and air emissions. In the United States, our
facilities must comply with the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liabil ity Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other federal and state laws regarding handling, storage,
release and disposa l of wastes generate d on-site and sent to third-party owned and operated off-site licensed facilities and our
facilities outside the United States must comply with similar laws and regulations. In addition, continuing concern over climate
change may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements (in or outside of the United States) to reduce or mitigate
the potential effects of greenhouse gases, or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity
concerns. Our policy is to abide by all applicable environmental laws and regulations, and we have internal programs in place with
respect to our global environmental compliance. We have made, and plan to continue making, necessary expenditures for
compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. While these expenditures have not had a material impact on our
business, financial condition or results of operations to date, changes in environmental compliance requirements, and any
expenditures necessary to comply with such requirements, could adversely affect our financial performance. In addition, we and
our subsidiaries are subject to enviro nmental remediation obligations arisin g in the normal course of business, as well as
remediation and related indemnificatio n obligations in connection with certain historical activities and contractual obligations,
including those of businesses acquired by us or our subsidiaries. While these environmental remediation and indemnification
9
Table of Contents
obligations cannot be predicted with certainty , such obligations have not had, and are not expected to have, a material impact on our
capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
In addition to the discussion in this section, see also “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Employees
As of December 30, 2017 , we and our consolidated subsidiaries employed approximately 263,000 people worldwide, including
approximately 113,000 people within the United States. In certain countries, our employment levels are subject to seasonal
variations. We or our subsidiaries are party to numerous collective bargainin g agreements. We expect that we will be able to
renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire.  We believe that relations with our
employees are generally good.

Demand for our products may be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences or any inability on our part to
innovate, market or distribute our products effectively , and any significant reduction in demand could adversely affect our
business, financial condition or results of operations.
We are a global food and beverage company operating in highly competitive categories and markets. To generate revenues and
profits, we rely on continued demand for our products and therefore must understand our customers and consumers and sell
products that appeal to them in the sales  channel in which they prefer to shop or browse for such products. In general, changes in
consumption in our product categories or consumer demographics could result  in reduced demand for our products. Demand for
our products depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to shifts in consumer trends and preferences,
including increased demand for product s that meet the needs of consumers who are concerned with: health and wellness (including
products that have less added sugars, sodium and saturated fat); convenience (including responding to changes in in-home and on-
the-go consumption patterns and methods of distribution of our products to customers and consumers); or the location of origin or
source of the ingredients and products (including the environmental impact related to the production of our products).
Consumer preferenc es have been evolving, and are expected to continue to evolve, due to a variety of factors, including: changes in
consumer demographics, including the aging of the general population and the emer gence of the millennial and younger
generations who have differing spending  and consumption habits; consumer concerns or perceptions regarding the nutrition profile
of certain of our products, including the presence of added sugar , sodium and saturated fat in certain of our products; growing
demand for organic or locally sourced ingredients, or consumer concerns or perceptions (whether or not valid) regarding the health
effects of ingredien ts or substances present in certain of our products, such as 4-MeI, acrylamide, artificial flavors and colors,
artificial sweeteners, aspartame, caf feine, furfuryl alcohol, high-fructose corn syrup, partially hydrolyzed oils, saturated fat, sodium,
sugar , trans fats or other product ingredients, substances or attributes, including genetically engineered ingredients; taxes or other
restrictions, including labeling requirements, imposed on our products; consumer concerns or perceptions regarding packaging
materials, including their environmental impact; changes in package or portion size; changes in social trends that impact travel,
vacation or leisure activity patterns; changes in weather patterns or seasonal consumption cycles; the continued acceleration of e-
commerce and other methods of purchasing products; negative publicity (whether or not valid) resulting from regulatory actions,
litigation against us or other companies in our industry or negative or inaccurate posts or comments in the media, including social
media, about us, our employees, our products or advertising campaigns and marketing programs; perception of social media posts
or other information disseminated by us or our employees and agents, customers, suppliers, bottlers, distributors, joint venture
partners or other third parties; perception of our employees, agents, customers, suppliers, bottlers, distributors, joint venture
partners or other third parties or the business practices of such parties; product boycotts; or a downturn in economic conditions.
Any of these factors may reduce consumers’ willingness to purchase our products and any inability on our part to anticipate or react
to such changes could result in reduced demand for our products and erosion of our competitive and financial position and could
adversely af fect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.
Demand for our products is also depe ndent in part on product quality , product and marketing innovation and production and
distribution, including our ability to: maintain a robust pipeline of new products; improve the quality of existing products; extend
our portfolio of products in growing markets and categories; respond to cultural differences and regional consumer preferences
(whether through developing or acquiring new products that are responsive to such preferences); monitor and adjust our use of
ingredients (including to respond to applicable regulations); develop or acquire a broader portfolio of product choices, including by
continuing to increase non-carbonated beverage offerings and other alternatives to traditional carbonated beverage offerings and, in
some cases, reformulations of our traditional carbonated beverage offerings; develop sweetener alternatives and innovation;
improve the production, packaging and distribution of our
11
Table of Contents
products; respond to competitive product and pricing pressures and changes in distribution channels, including in the rapidly
growing e-commerce channel; and implement effective advertising campaign s and marketing programs, including successfully
adapting to a rapidly changing media environment through the use of social media and online advertising campaigns and marketing
programs.
Although we devote significant resourc es to the items mentioned above, there can be no assurance as to our continued ability to
develop, launch, maintain or distribute successful new products or variants of existing products in a timely manner (including to
correctly anticipate or effectively react to changes in consumer preferences) or to develop and effectively execute advertising and
marketing campaigns that appeal to customers and consumers. Our failure to make the right strategic investments to drive
innovation or successfully launch new products or variants of existing products or ef fectively distribute our products could decrease
demand for our existing products by negatively affecting consumer perception of our existing brands and may result in inventory
write-of fs and other costs that could adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Changes in, or failure to comply with, laws and regulations applicable to our products or our business operations could
adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
The condu ct of our business is subjec t to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental
agencies in the United States, as well as government entities and agencies outsid e the United States, including laws and regulations
relating to the production, storage, distribution, sale, display , advertisin g, marketing, labeling, content, quality , safety ,
transportation, disposal, recycling and use of our products, as well as our employment and occupational health and safety practices
and protection of personal information. In addition, in many jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of special
importance to us due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions, as is compliance with anti-corruption laws. Many of these
laws and regulations have differing or conflicting legal standards across the various markets where our products are made,
manufactured, distributed or sold and, in certain markets, such as developing and emer ging markets, may be less developed or
certain. For example, products containing genetically engineered ingredients are subject to varying regulations and restrictions in
the jurisdi ctions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. In addition, these laws and regulations and
related interpretations may change, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly , as a result of a variety of factors, including political,
economic or social events. Such changes may include changes in: food and drug laws; laws related to product labeling, advertising
and marketing practices; laws and treaties related to international trade, including laws regarding the import or export of our
products or ingredients used in our products and tariffs; laws and programs restricting the sale and advertising of certain of our
products, including restrictions on the audience to whom products are marketed ; laws and programs aimed at reducing, restricting
or eliminating ingredients or substances in, or attributes of, certain of our products; laws and programs aimed at discouraging the
consumption or altering the package or portion size of certain of our products,  including laws imposing restrictions on the use of
government funds or programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistan ce Program (included within the Farm Bill in the
United States), to purchase certain of our products; increased regulatory scrutiny of, and increased litigation involving product
claims and concerns  (whether or not valid) regarding the effects on health of ingredients or substances in, or attributes of, certain of
our products, including without limitation those found in energy drinks; state consumer protection laws; laws regulating the
protection of personal information; cyber-security regulations; regulatory initiatives, including the imposition or proposed
imposition of new or increased taxes or other measures impacting the manufact ure, distribution or sale of our products; accounting
rules and interpretations; employment laws; privacy laws; laws regulating the price we may charge for our products; laws
regulating water rights and access to and use of water or utilities; environmental laws, including laws relating to the regulation of
water treatment and dischar ge of wastewater and air emissions and laws relating to the disposal, recovery or recycling of our
products and their packaging. Changes in regulatory requirements, and competing regulations and standards, where our
12
Table of Contents
products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, may result in higher compliance costs, capital expenditures and higher
production costs, which could adversely af fect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.
The impo sition by any jurisdiction in the United States or outside the United States of new laws, regulations or governmental
policy and their related interpretations, or changes in any of the foregoing,  including taxes, labeling, product or production
requirements or other limitations on, or pertaining to, the sale or advertisement of certain of our products, ingredients or substances
contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities used in the production of our products, may further alter the way in
which we do busine ss and, therefore, may continue to increase our costs or liabilities or reduce demand for our products, which
could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose
new requirements or restrictions, other jurisdictions may follow and the requirements or restrictions, or proposed requirements or
restrictions, may also result in adverse publicity (whether or not valid). For example, if one jurisdiction imposes a tax on sugar -
sweetened beverage s or foods, or imposes a specific labeling or warning requirement, other jurisdictions may impose similar or
other measures that impact the manufact ure, distribution or sale of our products. The foregoing may result in decreased demand for
our produc ts, advers e publicity or increa sed concerns about the health implications of consumption of ingredients or substances in
our products (whether or not valid).
In addition, studies (whether or not scien tifically valid) are underway by third parties purporting to assess the health implications of
consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in certain of our products, such as 4-MeI, acrylamide, caffeine, furfuryl
alcohol, added sugars, sodium and satur ated fat. Third parties have also published documents or studies claiming (whether or not
valid) that taxes can address consumer consumption of sugar -sweetened beverages and other foods high in sugar , sodium or
saturated fat. If, as a result of these studies and documents or otherwise, there is an increase in consumer concerns (whether or not
valid) about the health implications of consumption of our products, an increase  in the number of jurisdictions that impose taxes on
our products, or an increase in new labeling, product or production requirements or other restrictions on the manufacturing, sale or
display of our products, demand for our products could decline, or we could be subject to lawsuits or new regulations that could
affect sales of our products, any of which could adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Although we have policies and procedures in place that are designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance, our employees,
suppliers, or other third parties with whom we do business could take actions, intentional or not, that violate these policies and
procedures or applicable laws or regulations or could fail to maintain required documentation sufficient to evidence our compliance
with applicable laws or regulations. Violations of laws or regulations could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions,
including fines, penalties, disgor gement of profits or activity restrictions, any of which could result in adverse publicity or affect
our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, regulatory authorities under whose laws we operate may have
enforcement powers that can subject us to actions such as product recall, seizure of products or assets or other sanctions, which
could have an adverse ef fect on the sales of products in our portfolio or could lead to damage to our reputation.
In addition , we and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of legal and environm ental remediation obligations arising in the normal
course of business, as well as environmental remediation, product liability , toxic tort and related indemnification proceedings in
connection with certain historical activities and contractual obligations, including those of businesses acquired by us or our
subsidiaries. Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentified contaminants on current
and former properties of ours and our subsidiaries, the potential exists for reme diation, liability and indemnification costs to differ
materially from the costs we have estimated. W e cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these matters
13
Table of Contents
will not exceed our estimates or otherwise have an adverse ef fect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
The imposition or proposed imposition  of new or increased taxes aimed at our products could adversely affect our business,
financial condition or results of operations.
Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering
imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or
attributes of, our products or commodities used in the production of our produc ts. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply
to all beverages, including non-caloric  beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar).
Similarly , some measures apply a single tax rate per liquid ounce while others apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the
amount of added sugar in the beverage and some apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing a particular substance or ingredient.
For examp le, effective January 2018, the City of Seattle, Washington in the United States enacted a per-ounce surchar ge on all
sugar -sweetened beverages. By contrast , the United Kingdom enacted a graduated tax, effective April 2018, in which the per-ounce
tax rate is tied to the amount of added sugar present in the beverage: the higher the amount of added sugar , the higher the per-ounce
tax rate and Saudi Arabia enacted, effective June 2017, a flat tax rate of 50% on the retail price of carbonated soft drinks. These tax
measures, whatever their scope or form , could increase the cost of our products , reduce overall consumption of our products, lead
to negative publicity (whether based on scientific fact or not) or leave consumer s with the perception (whether or not valid) that our
products do not meet their health and wellness needs. Such factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition or
results of operations.
Significant additional labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products may reduce
demand for such products and could adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering
imposing, product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of certain of our products as a result of
ingredients or substances contained in such products. These types of provisions have required that we provide a label that
highlights perceived concerns about a product or warns consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances
present in our produ cts. For example, in California in the United States, Proposition 65 requires a specific warning on or relating to
any product that contains a substance listed by the State of California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects or other
reproductive harm, unless the level of such substance in the product is below a safe harbor level established by the State of
California.
In addition, a numb er of jurisdictions, both in and outside the United States, have imposed or are considering imposing labeling
requirements, including color -coded labeling of certain food and beverage products where colors such as red, yellow and green are
used to indicate various levels of a particular ingredient, such as sugar , sodium or saturated fat. The imposition or proposed
imposition of additional product labeling or warning requirements could reduce overall consumption of our products, lead to
negative publicity (whether based on scientific fact or not) or leave consumers with the perception (whether or not valid) that our
products do not meet their health and wellness needs. Such factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition or
results of operations.
Changes in laws and regulations relat ing to packaging or disposal of our products could continue to increase our costs and
reduce demand for our products or otherwise have an adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition or results
of operations.
Certain of our products are sold in packaging designed to be recoverable for recycling but not all packaging
14
Table of Contents
is recovered, whether due to low value , lack of infrastructure or otherwise. The United States and many other jurisdictions have
imposed or are considering imposing regulations or policies designed to encourage recycling, including requiring that deposits or
certain taxes or fees be charged in connection with the sale, distribution, marketing and use of certain packaging; extended
producer responsibility policies which makes brand owners responsible for the costs of recycling products after consumers have
used them; and adop ting or extending product stewardship policies which could require brand owners to plan for and, if necessary ,
pay for the recycling  or disposal of packaging after consumers have used them. In addition, these jurisdictions may elect to impose
regulations or policies to ban the use of certain packaging, such as plastic beverage bottles. Compliance with these laws and
regulations could continue to affect our costs or require changes in our distribution model, which could adversely affect our
business, financial condition or results of operations. Further , our reputation could be damaged if we or others in our industry do
not act, or are perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to packaging or disposal of our products.
Our business, financial condition or results of operations could suf fer if we are unable to compete ef fectively .
Our beverage, food and snack products are in highly competitive categories and markets and compete against products of
international bevera ge, food and snack  companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies, as well as regional, local, and
private label manufa cturers, economy brands and other competitors. In many countries in which our products are sold, including
the United States, The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor . Other beverage, food and snack competitors
include, but are not limited to, DPSG, Kellogg Company , The Kraft Heinz Company , Mondelēz International, Inc., Monster
Beverage Corporation, Nestlé S.A., Red Bull GmbH and Snyder ’s-Lance, Inc.
Our beverage, food and snack products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty , taste, price, value, quality ,
product variety, innovation, distribution , advertising, marketing and promotional activity , packaging, convenience, service and the
ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends, including increased consumer focus on health and
wellness and the continued acceleration of e-commerce and other methods of distributing and purchasing products. If we are unable
to effectively promote our existing products or introduce new products, if our advertising or marketing campaigns are not effective
or if we are otherw ise unable to effectively respond to pricing pressure or compete effectively (including in distributing our
products effectively and cost efficiently through all existing and emer ging channels of trade, including through e-commerce and
hard discounters), we may be unable to grow or maintain sales or category share or we may need to increase capital, marketing or
other expenditures, which may adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Our busin ess, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of political conditions in the
markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold.
Political conditions in the markets in which our products are made, manufacture d, distributed or sold may be difficult to predict and
may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operatio ns. The results of elections, referendums or other
political conditions in the markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold could create uncertainty
regarding how existing laws and regulat ions may change, including with respect to sanctions, climate change regulation, taxes, the
movement of goods, services and people between countries and other matters, and could result in exchange rate fluctuation,
volatility in global stock markets and global economic uncertainty . For example, there is continued uncertainty surrounding the
United Kingdom’ s pending withdrawal from the European Union, including how the United Kingdom will interact with other
European Union countries following its departure. Any changes in, or the imposition of new laws, regulations or governmental
policy and their related interpretations due to elections,
15
Table of Contents
referendums or other political conditio ns could have an adverse impact on our business, financial conditions and results of
operations.
Our busin ess, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to grow our business in
developing and emerging markets.
Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in developing and emer ging markets, including Mexico, Russia, the
Middle East, Brazil, China and India. However , there can be no assurance that our existing products, variants of our existing
products or new products that we make, manufacture, distribute or sell will be accepted or be successful in any particular
developing or emer ging market, due to local or global competition, product price, cultural differences, consumer preferences or
otherwise. The following factors could reduce demand for our products or otherwise impede the growth of our business in
developing and emer ging markets: unstable economic, political or social conditions; acts of war, terrorist acts, and civil unrest;
increased competition; volatility in the economic growth of certain of these markets and the related impact on developed countries
who export to these  markets; volatile oil prices and the impact on the local economy in certain of these markets; our inability to
acquire businesses, form strategic business alliances or to make necessary infrastructure investments; our inability to complete
divestitures or refranchisings; impositio n of new or increased labeling, product or production requirements, or other restrictions;
imposition of new or increased sanctions against, or other regulations restricting  contact with, certain countries in these markets, or
imposition of new or increased sanctions against U.S. multinational corporations operating in these markets; actions, such as
removing our products from shelves, taken by retailers in response to U.S. trade sanctions or other governmental action or policy;
foreign ownership restrictions; nationalization of our assets or the assets of our suppliers, bottlers, distributors, joint venture
partners or other third parties; imposition of taxes on our products or the ingredients or substances used in our products;
government-mandated closure, or threatened closure, of our operations or the operations of our suppliers, bottlers, distributors, joint
venture partners, customers or other third parties; restrictions on the import or export of our products or ingredients or substances
used in our products; regulations relating to the repatriation of funds currently  held in foreign jurisdictions to the United States;
highly-inflationary economies, devaluation or fluctuation, such as the devaluation of the Egyptian pound, Turkish lira, Pound
sterling, Argentine peso and the Mexican peso, or demonetization of currency; regulations on the transfer of funds to and from
foreign countries, currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions, which result in significant cash balances in foreign
countries, from time to time, or could significantly affect our ability to effectively manage our operations in certain of these
markets and could result in the deconsolidation of such businesses; the lack of well-established or reliable legal systems; increased
costs of doing busin ess due to compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international
operations, includin g the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export
Enhancement Act; and adverse consequ ences, such as the assessment of fines or penalties, for any failure to comply with these
laws and regulation s. If we are unable to expand our businesses in developing and emer ging markets, effectively operate, or
manage the risks associated with operat ing, in these markets, or achieve the return on capital we expect from our investments in
these markets, our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely af fected.
Uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of
operations.
Many of the countri es in which our products are made, manufactured, distribute d and sold have experienced and may, from time to
time, continue to experience uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions, such as recessions or economic slowdowns. Our
business or financial results may be adversely impacted by uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions in the United States and
globally , including: adverse changes in interest rates, tax laws or tax rates; volatile commodity markets, including speculative
influences; highly-inflationary
16
Table of Contents
economies, devaluation, fluctuation or demonetization; contraction in the availability of credit in the marketplace due to legislation
or econom ic conditions; the effects of government initiatives, including demon etization, austerity or stimulus measures to manage
economic condition s and any changes to or cessation of such initiatives; the effects of any default by or deterioration in the
creditworthiness of the countries in which our products are made, manufacture d, distributed or sold or of countries that may then
impact countries in which our products  are made, manufactured, distributed or sold; reduced demand for our products resulting
from volatility in general global economic conditions or a shift in consumer preferences for economic reasons or otherwise to
regional, local or private label products or other lower -cost products, or to less profitable sales channels; or a decrease in the fair
value of pension or post-retirement assets that could increase future employee benefit costs and/or funding requirements of our
pension or post-retirement plans. In addition, we cannot predict how current or future economic conditions will affect our
customers, consumers, suppliers, bottler s, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties and any negative impact on any
of the foregoing may also have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
In addition, some of the major financial institutions with which we execute transactions, including U.S. and non-U.S. commercial
banks, insurance companies, investment banks and other financial institutions, may be exposed to a ratings downgrade, bankruptcy ,
liquidity events, default or similar risks as a result of unfavorable economic conditions, changing regulatory requirements or other
factors beyond our control. A ratings downgrade, bankruptcy , receivership, default or similar event involving a major financial
institution, or changes in the regulatory environment, may limit the ability or willingness of financial institutions to enter into
financial transaction s with us, including to provide banking or related cash management services, or to extend credit on terms
commercially accep table to us or at all; may leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or exposed to certain currencies or price risk
associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials, including through our use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders,
pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures; or may result in a decline in the market value of our
investments in debt securities, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Similar risks exist with respect to our customers, suppliers, bottlers, distributors  and joint venture partners and could result in their
inability to obtain credit to purchase our products or to finance the manufac ture and distribution of our products resulting in
canceled orders and/or product delays, which could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition or
results of operations.
Our business and reputation could suffer if we are unable to protect our information systems against, or effectively respond to,
cyberattacks or other cyber incidents or if our information systems, or those of our customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract
manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties, are otherwise disrupted.
We depend on infor mation systems and technology , some of which are provid ed by third parties, including public websites and
cloud-based services, for many activities important to our business, including: to interface with our customers and consumers; to
engage in marketing activities; to enab le and improve the effectiveness of our operations; to order and manage materials from
suppliers; to manage inventory; to manage our facilities; to conduct research and development; to maintain accurate financial
records; to achieve operational efficiencies; to comply with regulatory , financial reporting, legal and tax requirements; to collect
and store sensitive data and confidential information; to communicate electronically among our global operations and with our
employees and the employees of our customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners and
other third parties; and to communicate with our investors.
As with other global companies, we are regularly subject to cyberattacks. Cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring
more frequently , are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals
(including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored
17

institutions, terrorist organizations and individuals or groups participating in organized crime) with a wide range of expertise and
motives (including monetization of corporate, payment or other internal or personal data, theft of trade secrets and intellectual
property for competitive advantage and leverage for political, social, economic and environmental reasons). Such cyberattacks and
cyber incidents can take many forms including cyber extortion, denial of service, social engineering, such as impersonation
attempts to fraudulently induce employ ees or others to disclose information or unwittingly provide access to systems or data,
introduction of viruses or malware, such as ransomware through phishing emails, website defacement or theft of passwords and
other credentials. Although we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyberattacks or other cyber
incidents, no cyberattack or other cybe r incident has, to our knowledge, had a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition or results of operations to date.
If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and maintain our information technology
infrastructure, including monitoring networks and systems, upgrading our security policies and the skills and training of our
employees, and requiring our third-party  service providers, customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint
venture partners or other third parties to do the same, if we or they fail to timely identify or appropriately respond to cyberattacks or
other cyber incidents, or if our or their information systems are damaged, compromised, destroyed or shut down (whether as a
result of natural disasters, fires, power outages, acts of terrorism or other catastrophic events, network outages, software, equipment
or telecommunications failures, technol ogy development defects, user errors, or from deliberate cyberattacks such as malicious or
disruptive software, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering, hackers or otherwise), our business could be disrupted
and we could, amon g other things, be subject to: transaction errors; processing inefficiencies; the loss of, or failure to attract, new
customers and consumers; lost revenues resulting from the disruption or shutdown of computer systems or other information
technology systems at our offices, plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities, or the loss of a competitive advantage
due to the unauthorized use, acquisition  or disclosure of, or access to, confiden tial information; the incurrence of costs to restore
data and to safeguar d against future extortion attempts; the loss of, or damage to, intellectual property or trade secrets, including the
loss or unauthorized disclosure of sensit ive data or other assets; alteration, corruption or loss of accounting, financial or other data
on which we rely for financial reporting and other purposes, which could cause delays in our financial reporting; damage to our
reputation or brands; damage to employee, customer and consumer relations; litigation; regulatory enforcement actions or fines;
unauthorized disclos ure of confidential personal information of our employees , customers or consumers; the loss of information
and/or supply chain disruption resulting from the failure of security patches to be developed and installed on a timely basis;
violation of data privacy , security or other laws and regulations; and remediation costs.
Further , our informa tion systems and the information stored therein could be compromised by, and we could experience similar
adverse consequences due to, unauthorized outside parties accessing or extracting sensitive data or confidential information,
corrupting informat ion or disrupting business processes (or demonstrating an ability to do so) or by inadvertent or intentional
actions by our employees, agents or third parties. We continue to devote significant resources to network security , backup and
disaster recovery , and other security measures, including training, to protect our systems and data, but these security measures
cannot provide absolute security or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every such breach or
disruption. In addition, due to the const antly evolving nature of these security threats, the form and impact of any future incident
cannot be predicted.
Similar risks exist with respect to the cloud-based service providers and other third-party vendors that we rely upon for aspects of
our inform ation technology support services and administrative functions, including payroll processing, health and benefit plan
administration and certain finance and accounting functions, and systems managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties
and their vendors. The need to coordinate with various third-party vendors may complicate our efforts to resolve any issues that
may arise. As a result,
18
Table of Contents
we are subject to the risk that the activities associated with our third-party vendors may adversely affect our business even if the
attack or breach does not directly impac t our systems or information. Moreover , our increased use of mobile and cloud technologies
could heighten these and other operational risks, as certain aspects of the security of such technologies may be complex,
unpredictable or beyond our control.
While we currently maintain insurance coverage that, subject to its terms and conditions, is intended to address costs associated
with certain aspects of cyber incidents, network failures and data privacy-related concerns, this insurance coverage may not,
depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding an incident, cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise
from an incident, or the damage to our reputation or brands that may result from an incident.
Our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by increased costs, disruption of supply or
shortages of raw materials, energy , water and other supplies.
We and our business partners use various raw materials, energy, water and other  supplies in our business. The principal ingredients
we use in our bever age, food and snack  products are apple, orange and pineapple juice and other juice concentrates, aspartame,
corn, corn sweeteners, flavorings, flour , grapefruit, oranges and other fruits, oats, potatoes, raw milk, rice, seasonings, sucralose,
sugar , vegetable and essential oils, and wheat. W e also use water in the manufacturing of our products. Our key packaging materials
include plastic resins, including PET and polypropylene resins used for plastic beverage bottles and film packaging used for snack
foods, aluminum used for cans, glass bottles, closures, cardboard and paperboard cartons. Fuel, electricity and natural gas are also
important commodities for our businesses due to their use in our and our business partners’ facilities and the vehicles delivering our
products.
Some of these raw materials and supplies are sourced from countries experienc ing civil unrest, political instability or unfavorable
economic conditions, and some are available from a limited number of suppliers or a sole supplier or are in short supply when
seasonal demand is at its peak. We cannot assure that we will be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with
these suppliers or that our contingency plans, including development of ingredients, materials or supplies to replace ingredients,
materials or supplies sourced from such suppliers, will be effective in preven ting disruptions that may arise from shortages or
discontinuation of any ingredient that is sourced from such suppliers. In addition, increasing focus on climate change, deforestation,
water , animal welfare and human right s concerns and other risks associated with the global food system may lead to increased
activism focusing on consumer goods companies, governmental intervention and consumer response, and could adversely affect
our or our suppliers’ reputation and business and our ability to procure the materials we need to operate our business. The raw
materials and energy, including fuel, that we use for the manufacturing, production and distribution of our products are largely
commodities that are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by many factors, including changes in global
supply and demand , weather conditions (including any potential effects of climate change), fire, natural disasters (such as a
hurricane, tornado, earthquake or floodin g), disease or pests, agricultural uncerta inty, health epidemics or pandemics, governmental
incentives and controls (including impo rt/export restrictions), political uncertai nties, acts of terrorism, governmental instability or
currency exchange rates. Shortage of some of these raw materials and other supplies, sustained interruption in their supply or an
increase in their costs could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Many of our ingredients, raw
materials and commodities are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we
manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments,
including swaps and futures. If commod ity price changes result in unexpected or significant increases in raw materials and energy
costs, we may be unwilling or unable  to increase our product prices or unable to effectively hedge against commodity price
increases to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating results. In addition,
certain of the derivatives used to hedge price risk do not qualify for hedge

accounting treatmen t and, therefore, can result in increased volatility in our net earnings in any given period due to changes in the
spot prices of the underlying commodities.
Water is a limited resource in many parts of the world. The lack of available water of acceptable quality and increasing pressure to
conserve water in areas of scarcity and stress may lead to: supply chain disruption; adverse effects on our operations; higher
compliance costs; capital expenditures (including additional investments in the development of technologies to enhance water
efficiency and reduce water consumption); higher production costs; the cessation of operations at, or relocation of, our facilities or
the faciliti es of our suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties; or damage
to our reputation, any of which could adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Business disruptions could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Our ability , and that of our suppliers and other third parties, including our bottlers, contract manufacturers, joint venture partners,
distributors and customers, to make, manufacture, transport, distribute and sell products in our portfolio is critical to our success.
Damage or disruption to our or their operations due to any of the following factors could impair the ability to make, manufacture,
transport, distribute or sell products in our portfolio: adverse weather conditions (including any potential effects of climate change)
or natural disasters, such as a hurricane,  tornado, earthquake or flooding; govern ment action; economic or political uncertainties or
instability in countries in which such products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, which may also affect our ability to
protect the security of our assets and employees; fire; terrorism; outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities; food safety warnings or
recalls, whether related to products in our portfolio or otherwise; health epidemi cs or pandemics; supply and commodity shortages;
unplanned delays or unexpected problems associated with repairs or enhancem ents of facilities in which such products are made,
manufactured, distributed or sold; loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites; cyber incidents, including the disruption or
shutdown of computer systems or other information technology systems at our offices, plants, warehouses, distribution centers or
other facilities or those of our suppliers and other third parties who make, manufacture, transport, distribute and sell products in our
portfolio; industrial  accidents or other occupational health and safety issues; telecommunications failures; power or water
shortages; strikes and other labor dispu tes; or other reasons beyond our control or the control of our suppliers and other third
parties. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such
events if they occur , could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, as well as require additional
resources to restore operations.
Product contamination or tampering or issues or concerns with respect to product quality , safety and integrity could adversely
affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.
Product contamination or tampering, the failure to maintain high standards for product quality , safety and integrity , including with
respect to raw mate rials and ingredients obtained from suppliers, or allegation s (whether or not valid) of product quality issues,
mislabeling, misbran ding, spoilage, allergens, adulteration or contamination with respect to products in our portfolio may reduce
demand for such products, and cause production and delivery disruptions or increase costs, which could adversely affect our
business, reputation, financial condition  or results of operations. If any of the products in our portfolio are mislabeled or become
unfit for consumptio n or cause injury , illness or death, or if appropriate resou rces are not devoted to product quality and safety
(particularly as we expand our portfolio into new categories) or to comply with changing food safety requirements, we could decide
to, or be required to, recall products in our portfolio and/or we may be subject to liability or government action, which could result
in payment of dama ges or fines, cause certain products in our portfolio to be unavailable for a period of time, result in destruction
of product inventory , or result in adverse publicity (whether or not valid), which could reduce consumer demand and
20
Table of Contents
brand equity . Moreover , even if allegations of product contamination or tampering or suggestions that our products were not fit for
consumption are meritless, the negative publicity surrounding assertions against us or products in our portfolio or processes could
adversely affect our reputation or brands. Our business could also be adversely  affected if consumers lose confidence in product
quality , safety and integrity generally , even if such loss of confidence is unrelate d to products in our portfolio. Any of the foregoing
could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, if we do not have adequate
insurance, if we do not have enforceable indemnification from suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture
partners or other third parties or if indemnification is not available, the liability  relating to such product claims or disruption as a
result of recall ef forts could materially adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Any damage to our reputation or brand image could adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We are a leading global beverage, food and snack company with brands that are respected household names throughout the world.
Maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to selling our branded products. Our reputation or brand image could be adversely
impacted by any of the following, or by adverse publicity (whether or not valid) relating thereto: the failure to maintain high
ethical, social and environmental practi ces for all of our operations and activi ties, including with respect to human rights, child
labor laws and workplace conditions and safety , or failure to require our suppliers or other third parties to do so; the failure to
achieve our goals of reducing added sugars, sodium and saturated fat in certai n of our products and of growing our portfolio of
product choices; the failure to achieve our other sustainability goals or to be perceived as appropriately addressing matters of social
responsibility; the failure to protect our intellectual property , including in the event our brands are used without our authorization;
health concerns (whether or not valid) about our products or particular ingredients or substances in, or attributes of, our products,
including concerns regarding whether certain of our products contribute to obesity; the imposition or proposed imposition of new
or increase d taxes, labeling requirements or other limitations on, or pertaining to, the sale, display or advertising of our products;
any failure to comply , or perception of a failure to comply , with our policies and goals, including those regarding advertising to
children and reduci ng calorie consumption from sugar -sweetened beverages;  our research and development efforts; the recall
(voluntary or otherwise) of any products in our portfolio; our environmental impact, including use of agricultural materials,
packaging, water , energy use and waste  management; any failure to achieve our goals with respect to reducing our impact on the
environment, or perception of a failure to act responsibly with respect to water use and the environment; any failure to achieve our
goals with respect to human rights throughout our value chain; the practices of our employees, agents, customers, distributors,
suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, joint venture partners or other third parties (including others in our industry) with
respect to any of the foregoing, actual or perceived; consumer perception of our industry; consumer perception of our advertising
campaigns, sponsorship arrangements or marketing programs; consumer perception of our use of social media; consumer
perception of statements made by us, our employees and executives, agents, customers, suppliers, bottlers, distributors, joint
venture partners or other third parties (including others in our industry); or our responses or the responses of others in our industry
to any of the foregoing.
In addition , we operate globally , which requires us to comply with numerous local regulations, including, without limitation, anti-
corruption laws, competition laws and tax laws and regulations of the jurisdicti ons in which our products are made, manufactured,
distributed or sold. In the event that we or our employees engage in or are believ ed to have engaged in improper activities, we may
be subject to regulatory proceedings, including enforcement actions, litigation, loss of sales or other consequences, which may
cause us to suffer damage to our reputation in the United States or abroad. Failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to
maintain an effective system of intern al control or to provide accurate and timely financial information could also hurt our
reputation. In addition, water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and demand
21
Table of Contents
for water continues to rise. Our reputati on could be damaged if we or others in our industry do not act, or are perceived not to act,
responsibly with respect to water use.
Further , the popularity of social media and other consumer -oriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of
information dissemination. As a result, negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us, our products, policies, practices,
advertising campaigns and marketing programs or sponsorship arrangement s; our use of social media or of posts or other
information disseminated by us or our employees, agents, customers, suppliers, bottlers, distributors, joint venture partners or other
third parties; consumer perception of any of the foregoing, or failure by us to respond effectively to any of the foregoing, may also
generate adverse publicity (whether or not valid) that could damage our reputation.
Damage to our reputation or brand image or loss of consumer confidence in our products or employees for any of these or other
reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of
operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.
Failure to successfully complete or integrate acquisitions and joint ventures into our existing operations, or to complete or
effectively manage divestitures or refranchisings, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of
operations.
We regula rly review our portfolio of businesses and evaluate potential acquisiti ons, joint ventures, divestitures, refranchisings and
other strategic transa ctions. Potential issues associated with these activities could include, among other things: our ability to realize
the full extent of the expected returns, benefits, cost savings or syner gies as a result of a transaction, within the anticipated time
frame, or at all; receipt of necessary consents, clearances and approvals in connection with a transaction; and diversion of
management’ s attention from day-to-day operations.
With respe ct to acquisitions, the following factors also pose potential risks: our ability to successfully combine our businesses with
the business of the acquired company , including integrating the acquired company’ s manufacturing, distribution, sales, accounting,
financial reporting and administrative support activities and information technology systems with our company; our ability to
successfully operate in new categories or territories; motivating, recruiting and retaining executives and key employees;
conforming standard s, controls (including internal control over financial reporting, environmental compliance, health and safety
compliance and compliance with other laws and regulations), procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation
structures between us and the acquired company; consolidating and streamlining corporate and administrative infrastructures and
avoiding increased operating expenses; consolidating sales and marketing operations; retaining existing customers and attracting
new custo mers; retaining existing distributors; identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets;
coordinating geographically dispersed or ganizations; managing tax costs or inef ficiencies associated with integrating our operations
following completion of an acquisition; and other unanticipated problems or liabilities, such as contingent liabilities and litigation.
With respect to joint ventures, we share ownership and management responsibility with one or more parties who may or may not
have the same goals , strategies, priorities, resources or values as we do. Joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of
all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of our joint venture partners
may adve rsely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us or otherwise damage our
reputation and brands and adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
In addition, acquisitions and joint ventures outside of the United States increas e our exposure to risks associated with operations
outside of the United States, including fluctuations in exchange rates and
22
Table of Contents
compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and laws and regulations outside
the United States.
With respe ct to divestitures and refranc hisings, we may not be able to complet e or effectively manage such transactions on terms
commercially favor able to us or at all and may fail to achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divestiture or
refranchising. Furth er, as divestitures and refranchisings may reduce our direct control over certain aspects of our business, any
failure to maintain good relations with divested or refranchised businesses in our supply or sales chain may adversely impact our
sales or business performance.
If an acquisition or joint venture is not successfully completed or integrated into our existing operations, or if a divestiture or
refranchising is not successfully completed or managed or does not result in the benefits or cost savings we expect, our business,
financial condition or results of operations may be adversely af fected.
A change in our estimates and underlying assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in an
impairment charge, which could materially af fect our results of operations.
We conduct impairment tests on our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets , as well as other investments and other long-lived
assets annually , during our third quarter , or more frequently , if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable or that an other -than-temporary impairment exists. Any changes in our estimates or underlying assumptions regarding
the future performance of our reportin g units or in determining the fair value of any such reporting unit, including goodwill,
indefinite-lived intangible assets, as well as other investments and other long-lived assets, could adversely affect our results of
operations. Factors that could result in an impairment include, but are not limited to: significant negative economic or industry
trends or competitive operating conditions; significant macroeconomic conditions that may result in a future increase in the
weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value; and significant changes in the nature and timing of decisions regarding
assets or markets that do not perform consistent with our expectations, including factors we use to estimate future levels of sales,
operating profit or cash flows. Future impairment charges could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations in the
periods recognized.
Increases in income tax rates, change s in income tax laws or disagreements with tax authorities could adversely affect our
business, financial condition or results of operations.
We are subject to income taxes in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in income tax
rates or other change s in income tax laws in any particular jurisdiction could reduce our after-tax income from such jurisdiction and
could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our operations outside the United States generate a
significant portion of our income. In addition, the United States and many of the other countries in which our products are made,
manufactured, distributed or sold, including countries in which we have significant operations, have recently made or are actively
considering changes to existing tax laws. For example, on December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJ Act) was signed
into law in the United States. The changes in the TCJ Act are broad and complex and we continue to examine the impact the TCJ
Act may have on our business and financial results. Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time
transition tax on undistributed international earnings regardless of whether they are repatriated, reduced the U.S. corporate income
tax rate from 35% to 21%, imposed limitations on the deductibility of interest and certain other corporate deductions, and moved
from a “worldwide” system of taxation  that generally allows deferral of U.S. tax on international earnings until repatriated to a
“territorial”/dividend exemption system with a minimum tax that will subject international earnings to U.S. tax when earned. In
accordance with applicable SEC guidance, we recorded a provisional net tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting from
the enactment of the TCJ Act. This provisional expense is subject to change , possibly materially , due to, among other things,
changes in estimates,
23
Table of Contents
interpretations and assumptions we have made, changes in Internal Revenue Service (IRS) interpretations, the issuance of new
guidance, legislative  actions, changes in accounting standards or related interpretations in response to the TCJ Act and future
actions by states within the United States that have not currently adopted the TCJ Act. For further information regarding the
potential impact of the TCJ Act, see “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Our Critical Accounting Policies” in Item 7.
Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 5 to our consolidated financial
statements.
Additional changes in the U.S. tax regime or in how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings, including
changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of
operations.
We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by the IRS and other taxing authorities with respect to income and
non-income based taxes both within and outside the United States. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in
jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legisla tion or regulation, may make resolving tax disputes
more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation could differ from our historical provisions and
accruals, resulting in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, in connection with
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project, companies are required to
disclose more information to tax author ities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits
earned in various countries.
Failure to realize anticipated benefits from our productivity initiatives or global operating model could have an adverse impact
on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Our future success and earnings growth depend, in part, on our ability to continue to reduce costs and improve efficiencies. Our
productivity initiativ es help support our growth initiatives and contribute to our results of operations. We continue to implement
strategic plans that we believe will position our business for future success and long-term sustainable growth by allowing us to
achieve a lower cost structure and operate more efficiently in the highly competitive beverage, food and snack categories and
markets. We are also continuing to implement our global operating model to improve efficiency , decision making, innovation and
brand management across the global PepsiCo organization to enable us to comp ete more effectively . Further , in order to continue to
capitalize on our cost reduction efforts and our global operating model, it will be necessary to make certain investments in our
business, which may be limited due to capital constraints. Some of these measures could yield unintended consequences, such as
business disruptions, distraction of management and employees, reduced employee morale and productivity , and unexpected
additional employee  attrition, including the inability to attract or retain key personnel. It is critical that we have the appropriate
personnel in place to continue to lead and execute our plans, including to effectively manage personnel adjustments and transitions
resulting from these initiatives and incre ased competition for employees with the skills necessary to implement our plans. If we are
unable to successfully implement our productivity initiatives and global operating model as planned, fail to implement these
initiatives as timely as we anticipate, do not achieve expected savings as a result of these initiatives or incur higher than expected or
unanticipated costs in implementing these initiatives, fail to identify and implement additional productivity opportunities in the
future, or fail to successfully manage business disruptions or unexpected employee consequences on our workforce, morale or
productivity , we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits, which could adversely af fect our business, financial condition
or results of operations.
If we are unable to recruit, hire or retain key employees or a highly skilled and diverse workforce, it could have a negative
impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Our conti nued growth requires us to recruit, hire, retain and develop our leadership bench and a highly skilled and diverse
workforce. W e compete to recruit and hire new employees and then must train them and develop
24
Table of Contents
their skills  and competencies. Our employees are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies and our continued
ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to retain, develop and motivate highly skilled personnel for all areas of our
organization. Any unplanned turnover or unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans to backfill current leadership
positions, including the Chief Executive Officer, or to hire and retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce could deplete our
institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage or result in increased costs due to increased competition for
employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our
reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.
The loss of, or a significant reduction in sales to, any key customer or disruption in the retail landscape, including rapid growth
in hard discounters and the e-commerce channel, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of
operations.
Our customers include wholesale and other distributors, foodservice customer s, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores,
discount/dollar stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, hard discounters, e-commerce retailers and authorized independent
bottlers, among others. We must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, including Wal-Mart, to
compete effectively . Any inability to resolve a significant dispute with any of our key customers, a change in the business condition
(financial or otherwise) of any of our key customers, even if unrelated to us, a significant reduction in sales to any key customer , or
the loss of any of our key customers could adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
In addition, our industry has been affected by changes to the retail landscape, including the rapid growth in sales through e-
commerce websites and mobile commerce applications as well as the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers.
We are making significant investments in attracting talent to and building our global e-commerce capabilities. Although we are
engaged in e-commerce with respect to many of our products, if we are unable to maintain and develop successful relationships
with existing and new e-commerce retailers or otherwise adapt to the growing e-commerce landscape, while simultaneously
maintaining relationships with our key customers operating in traditional retail channels, we may be disadvantaged in certain
channels and with certain customers and consumers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of
operations. In addition, the growth in e-commerce may result in consumer price  deflation, which may affect our relationships with
key retail customers . If these e-commerce retailers were to take significant market share away from traditional retailers and/or we
fail to adapt to the rapidly changing retail and e-commerce landscapes, our ability to maintain and grow our share of sales or
volume and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely af fected.
Further , the retail landscape continues to be impacted by the increased consol idation of retail ownership and purchasing power ,
particularly in North America, Europe and Latin America, resulting in large retailers with increased purchasing power , which may
impact our ability to compete in these areas. Such retailers may demand improved efficiency , lower pricing and increased
promotional programs. Further , should larger retailers increase utilization of their own distribution networks, other distribution
channels such as e-commerce, or private label brands, the competitive advanta ges we derive from our go-to-market systems and
brand equity may be eroded. In addition, the growth of hard discounters that are focused on limiting the number of items they sell
and selling predominantly private label brands may reduce our ability to sell our products through such retailers. Failure to
appropriately respon d to any of the foregoing, including failure to offer effective sales incentives and marketing programs to our
customers, could reduce our ability to secure adequate shelf space and produc t availability at our retailers, adversely affect our
ability to maintain or grow our share of sales or volume, and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of
operations.

Our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets may be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade
of our credit ratings.
Rating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt are based on a number of factors,
including our cash generating capability , levels of indebtedness, policies with respect to shareholder distributions and our financial
strength generally , as well as factors beyond our control, such as the then-curre nt state of the economy and our industry generally .
Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency , especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether as a
result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs, impair our ability to access
capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all, and result in a reduction in our liquidity . We expect to
maintain Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to
global credit markets at favorable interest rates. However , any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our
ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically , and therefore require
us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. Our borrowing costs and access to the commercial paper market
could also be adversely affected if a credit rating agency announces that our ratings are under review for a potential downgrade. An
increase in our borrowing costs, limita tions on our ability to access the globa l capital and credit markets or a reduction in our
liquidity could adversely af fect our financial condition and results of operations.
If we are not able to successfully implement shared services or utilize informa tion technology systems and networks effectively ,
our ability to conduct our business may be negatively impacted.
We have entered into agreements with third-party service providers to utilize certain information technology support services and
administrative functions, including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting
functions, and may enter into agreements for shared services in other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and
efficiencies. In addition, we utilize cloud-based services and systems and networks managed by third-party vendors to process,
transmit and store information and to conduct certain of our business activities and transactions with employees, customers,
consumers and other third parties. If any of these third-party service providers or vendors do not perform effectively , or if we fail to
adequately monitor their performance, we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings or we may have to incur additional
costs to correct errors made by such service providers and our reputation could be harmed. Depending on the function involved,
such errors may also lead to business disruption, processing inef ficiencies, the loss of or damage to intellectual property or sensitive
data through security breaches or otherw ise, adverse effects on financial reporting, litigation or remediation costs, or damage to our
reputation, which could have a negative impact on employee morale.
We continue on our multi-year business transformation initiative to migrate certain of our systems, including our financial
processing systems, to enterprise-wide systems solutions. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business
transformation initia tive, and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses. If we do not
allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper information technology infrastructure, or if
we fail to achieve the expected benefits from this initiative, it may impact our ability to process transactions accurately and
efficiently , and remain in step with the changing needs of our business, which could result in the loss of customers or consumers
and revenue. In addition, the failure to either deliver the applications on time,  or anticipate the necessary readiness and training
needs, could lead to business disruption and loss of customers or consumers and revenue. In connection with these implementations
and resulti ng business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of business processes and controls,
including our internal control over finan cial reporting processes, to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting. To date,
this transition has not materially af fected, and we do not expect it to materially af fect, our internal

control over financial reporting.
Fluctuations in exchange rates impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We hold assets, incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar . Because our
consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the United
States, where the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar , are translated into U.S. dollars. Our operations outside of the
United States, particularly in Mexico, Russia, Canada, the United Kingdom and Brazil , generate a signific ant portion of our net
revenue. In addition , we purchase many of the ingredients, raw materials and commodities used in our business in numerous
markets and in numerous currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates, including as a result of currency controls or other currency
exchange restrictions have had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
Climate change, water scarcity or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change or water scarcity may
negatively af fect our business and operations or damage our reputation.
There is concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have an adverse impact on global temperatures,
weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has
a negative effect on agricultural productivity , we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain
commodities that are necessary for our products, such as sugar cane, corn, wheat, rice, oats, oranges and other fruits and potatoes.
Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as a hurricane, earthquake or flooding, may disrupt the productivity of our
facilities or the operation of our supply chain and unfavorably impact the demand for, or our consumer ’s ability to purchase, our
products. The predicted effects of climate change may also exacerbate challenges regarding the availability and quality of water . As
demand for water access continues to increase around the world, we may be subject to decreased availability of water , deteriorated
quality of water or less favorable pricing for water , which could adversely impact our manufacturing and distribution operations.
Concern over clima te change may resul t in new or increased regional, federal and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to
reduce or mitigate the effects of greenh ouse gases, or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local
water scarcity concerns. In the event that such regulation is more stringent than current regulatory obligations or the measures that
we are currently undertaking to monitor and improve our energy efficiency and water conservation, we may experience disruptions
in, or significant increases in our costs of, operation and delivery and we may be required to make additional investments in
facilities and equipment or relocate our facilities. In particular , increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase
the cost of energy, including fuel, required to operate our facilities or transpor t and distribute our products, thereby substantially
increasing the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products.  As a result, the effects of climate change or water
scarcity could negatively af fect our business and operations.
In addition, any failure to achieve our goals with respect to reducing our impac t on the environment or perception (whether or not
valid) of our failure  to act responsibly with respect to water use and the environment or to effectively respond to new, or changes
in, legal or regulatory requirements concerning climate change or water scarcity could result in adverse publicity and could
adversely af fect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.
There is also increas ed focus, including by governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors, customers and consumers
on these and other environmental sustainability matters, including deforestation, land use, climate impact and water use. Our
reputation could be damaged if we or others in our industry do not act, or are perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to our
impact on the environment.

A portion of our workforce is represented by unions. Failure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements, or
strikes or work stoppages, could cause our business to suf fer.
Many of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and other employees may seek to be covered by
collective bargaining agreements. Strikes or work stoppages or other business interruptions could occur if we are unable to renew
these agreements on satisfactory terms or enter into new agreements on satisfactory terms or if we are unable to otherwise manage
changes in, or that affect, our workforce, which could impair manufacturing and distribution of our products or result in a loss of
sales, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. The terms and conditions of existing,
renegotiated or new collective bargaining agreements could also increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully
implement future operational changes to enhance our ef ficiency or to adapt to changing business needs or strategy .
If we are not able to adequately protec t our intellectual property rights or if we are found to infringe the intellectual property
rights of others, the value of our products or brands, or our competitive position, could be reduced, which could have an adverse
impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business. These intellectual property rights include ingredient
formulas, trademark s, copyrights, patents, business processes and other trade secrets that are important to our business and relate to
a variety of our products, their packaging, the processes for their production and the design and operation of various equipment
used in our businesses. We protect our intellectual property rights globally through a combination of trademark, copyright, patent
and trade secret laws, third-party assignment and nondisclosure agreements and monitoring of third-party misuses of our
intellectual property . If we fail to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks, copyrights, patents, business processes and trade
secrets, including our ingredient formul as, or if there is a change in law that limits or removes the current legal protections of our
intellectual property , the value of our products and brands, or our competitive position, could be reduced and there could be an
adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, if, in the course of developing new
products or improving the quality of existing products, we are found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others,
directly or indirectl y, such finding could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of
operations and may limit our ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products.
Potential liabilities and costs from litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations could have an
adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We and our subsidia ries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations,
including but not limited to matters related to our advertising, marketing or commercial practices, product labels, claims and
ingredients including sugar , sodium and saturated fat, our intellectual property rights, alleged infringement or misappropriation by
us of intellectual property rights of others, environmental, privacy , employment, tax and insurance matters and matters relating to
our compl iance with applicable laws and regulations. We evaluate such matters to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes
and estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses and establish reserves as appropriate. These matters are inherently uncertain
and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselve s in these matters, or that our assessment of the
materiality of these matters and the likely outcome or potential losses and established reserves will be consistent with the ultimate
outcome of such matters. In the event that management’ s assessment of actual or potential claims and proceedings proves
inaccurate or litigation, claims, proceedings, inquiries or investigations that are material arise in the future, there may be a material
adverse ef fect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Responding to litigation, claims,

proceedings, inquiries, and investigations, even those that are ultimately non-meritorious, may also require us to incur significant
expense and devote significant resources, and may generate adverse publicity  that may damage our reputation or brand image,
which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Many factors may adversely af fect the price of our publicly traded securities.
Many factors may adversely affect the price of our common stock and publicly traded debt. Such factors, some of which are
beyond our control, may include, but are not limited to: unfavorable economic conditions; changes in financial or tax reporting and
changes in accounting principles or practices that materially affect our reported financial condition and results; investor perceptions
of our business, strategies and performance or those of our competitors; actions  by shareholders or others seeking to influence our
business strategies; speculation by the media or investment community regarding our business, strategies and performance or those
of our competitors; developments relating to pending litigation, claims, investigations or inquiries; trading activity in our securities
or trading activity in derivative instruments with respect to our securities; changes in our credit ratings; the impact of our share
repurchase programs or dividend policy; and the outcome of referenda and elections. In addition, corporate actions, such as those
we may or may not take from time to time as part of our continuous review of our corporate structure and our strategy , including as
a result of business, legal, regulatory and tax considerations, may not have the impact we intend and may adversely affect the price
of our securities. The above factors, as well as the other risks included in this “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” could adversely affect the
price of our securities.
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.
We have received no written comments  regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the SEC that were issued 180
days or more preceding the end of our 2017  fiscal year and that remain unresolved.

Item 3. Legal Pr oceedings.
As previously disclosed, in January 2011, Wojewodzka Inspekcja Ochrony Srodowiska, the Polish environmental control authority ,
began an audit of a bottling plant of our subsidiary , Pepsi-Cola General Bottlers Poland SP, z.o.o. (PCGB), in Michrow , Poland. In
July 2013 , Wojewo dzka Inspekcja Ochrony Srodowiska alleged that the plant was not in compliance in 2009 with applicable
regulations governing the taking of wate r samples for analysis of the plant’ s waste and sought monetary sanctions of $650,000 and,
in August 2013, PCGB appealed this decision. In April 2015, the General Environmental Inspector for Environmental Protection
upheld the sanctions against PCGB and, in May 2015, PCGB further appea led this decision. In October 2015, Viovodeship
Administrative Court in Warsaw rejected our appeal and, in December 2015, PCGB filed an extraordinary appeal in the Supreme
Administrative Court. In October 2017, the Supreme Administrative Court issued a final, non-appealable decision, rejecting our
appeal and we agreed to invest funds up to the penalty amount(s) into the bottling plant to fully resolve the matter .
In additio n, we and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claim s, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and
investigations. While the results of such litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations cannot be
predicted with certainty , management believes that the final outcome of the foregoing will not have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition, results of operation s or cash flows. Sanctions imposed by foreign authorities are levied in local currency and
disclosed using the U.S. dollar equival ent at the time of imposition and are subject to currency fluctuations. See also “Item 1.
Business – Regulatory Matters” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

OUR BUSINESS
Executive Overview
We are a leading global food and beve rage company with a complementary portfolio of enjoyable brands, including Frito-Lay ,
Gatorade, Pepsi-Col a, Quaker and Tropicana. Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third
parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of convenient and enjoyable beverages, foods and snacks, serving
customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories.
At PepsiC o, we are focused on operating our company in a way that generates sustained financial growth and consistently strong
returns and is also responsive to the needs of the world around us. We call this approach Performance with Purpose — it is
embedded into our business and our strategy — and it enabled us to deliver another year of strong performance in 2017.
As we look to 2018  and beyond, we believe our Performance with Purpose strategy will enable us to continue delivering strong
performance while positioning our Company for long-term sustainable growth.
Our strategies are designed to address key challenges facing our Company , including: macroeconomic and political volatility and
the continued rebalancing of the economic world; shifting consumer preferences and increasing demand for more nutritious foods
and beverages; the disruption of retail; the expansion of hard discounters; and the emer gence of niche brands laying claim to large
consumer segments, particularly in developed markets. We intend to focus on the following areas to address and adapt to these
challenges:
•Utilizing the strength of our distribution system to offer consumers a wide array of choices, from “fun-for -you” to “better -
for-you” to “good-for -you” products to meet consumers’ demand for more nutritious foods and beverages;
•Continuing to strengthen our retail and foodservice relationships to sell our products faster , increase cash flow and engage
consumers;
•Minimizing our environmental footprin t to streamline costs and mitigate our operational impact on the communities in
which we operate;
•Continuing to invest in our associates so that we have the best talent to position our company for continued growth; and
•Continuing our investments in e-comm erce and digital solutions to meet changing consumer consumption patterns and
capture cost savings while streamlining our operations.
See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for additional information about risks and uncertainties that the Company faces.
Our Operations
See “Item 1. Business” for information on our divisions and a description of our distribution network, ingredients and other
supplies, brands and intellectual property rights, seasonality , customers and competition. In addition, see Note 1 to our consolidated
financial statements for financial information about our divisions

and geographic areas.
Other Relationships
Certain members of our Board of Direc tors also serve on the boards of certain  vendors and customers. These Board members do
not partici pate in our vendor selection and negotiations nor in our customer negotiations. Our transactions with these vendors and
customers are in the normal course of business and are consistent with terms  negotiated with other vendors and customers. In
addition, certain of our employees serve  on the boards of Pepsi Bottling Ventures LLC and other affiliated companies of PepsiCo
and do not receive incremental compensation for such services.
Our Business Risks
We are subject to risks in the normal course of business. During 2017  and 2016 , certain jurisdictions in which our products are
made, manufactured , distributed or sold operated in a challenging environment, experiencing unstable economic, political and
social conditions, civil unrest, natural disasters, debt and credit issues, and currency fluctuations. We continue to monitor the
economic, operating and political environment in these markets closely and to identify actions to potentially mitigate any
unfavorable impacts on our future results.
The hurric anes and earthquakes which occurred in the third and fourth quarters of 2017 in North and Central America did not
materially impact our consolidated financial results in 2017.
In addition, certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are
considering imposin g, new or increased  taxes on the manufacture, distribution  or sale of our products, ingredients or substances
contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities used in the product ion of our products. These taxes vary in scope and
form: some apply to all beverages, inclu ding non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener
(e.g., sugar). Similarly , some measures apply a single tax rate per liquid ounce while others apply a graduated tax rate depending
upon the amount of added sugar in the beverage and some apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing a particular substance or
ingredient.
We sell a wide varie ty of beverages, foods and snack in more than 200 countries and territo ries and the profile  of the products we
sell, and the amount  of revenue attributa ble to such products, varies by jurisdiction. Because of this, we cannot predict the scope or
form potential taxes or other potential limitations on our products may take, and therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes
or limitations on our financial results. In addition, taxes and limitations may impact us and our competitors differently . We continue
to monitor existing and proposed taxes in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and
to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impa ct, if any, of such taxes or limitations, including
advocating alternative measures with respect to the imposition, form and scope of any such taxes or limitations.
In addition , our industry has been affected by disruption of the retail landsca pe, including the rapid growth in sales through e-
commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers and the
international expans ion of hard discount ers. We continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and to identify actions we may
take to build our global e-commerce capabilities, distribute our products effectively through all existing and emer ging channels of
trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results.
During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. The changes in the TCJ Act are broad and
complex and we continue to examine the impact the TCJ Act may have on our business and financial results. Among its many
provisions, the TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S.
corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result of the enactment of the TCJ Act, we recognized a provisional net tax
expense of $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. See further information in “Items Affecting Comparability .” The recorded
impact of
46
Table of Contents
the TCJ Act is provisional and the final amount may differ from the above estimate, possibly materially , due to, among other
things, changes in estimates, interpretations and assumptions we have made, changes in IRS interpretations, the issuance of new
guidance, legislative  actions, changes in accounting standards or related interpretations in response to the TCJ Act and future
actions by states within the United States that have not currently adopted the TCJ Act. For additional information, see “Our
Liquidity and Capital Resources,” “Our Critical Accounting Policies” and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.
See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Executive Overview” above and “Market Risks” below for more information about these risks
and the actions we have taken to address key challenges.
Risk Management Framework
The achievement of our strategic and operating objectives involves taking risks and that those risks may evolve over time. To
identify , assess, prioritize, address, manage, monitor and communicate these risks across the Company’ s operations, we leverage an
integrated risk management framework. This framework includes the following:
•PepsiCo’ s Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for PepsiCo’ s integrated risk management framework. One of the
Board’ s primary responsibilities is overseeing and interacting with senior management with respect to key aspects of the
Company’ s business, including risk assessment and risk mitigation of the Company’ s top risks. The Board receives updates
on key risks throughout the year. In addition, the Board has tasked designated Committees of the Board with oversight of
certain categories of risk management, and the Committees report to the Board regularly on these matters.
◦The Audit  Committee of the Board reviews and assesses the guidelines and policies governing PepsiCo’ s risk
management and oversight processes, and assists the Board’ s oversight of financial, compliance and employee
safety risks facing PepsiCo;
◦The Comp ensation Committee of the Board reviews PepsiCo’ s employee compensation policies and practices to
assess whether such policies and practices could lead to unnecessary risk-taking behavior;
◦The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the Company’ s
governance structure and other corporate governance matters, including succession planning; and
◦The Public Policy and Sustainability Committee of the Board assists the Board in its oversight of PepsiCo’ s
policies, programs and related risks that concern key public policy and sustainability matters.
•The PepsiCo Risk Committee (PRC), which is comprised of a cross-functional, geographically diverse, senior management
group, including PepsiCo’ s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, meets regularly to identify , assess,
prioritize and address top strategic, financial, operating, compliance, safety , reputational and other risks. The PRC is also
responsible for reporting progress on our risk mitigation ef forts to the Board;
•Division and key country risk committ ees, comprised of cross-functional senior management teams, meet regularly to
identify , assess, prioritize and address division and country-specific business risks;
•PepsiCo’ s Risk Management Office, which manages the overall risk managem ent process, provides ongoing guidance,
tools and analytical support to the PRC and the division and key country risk committees, identifies and assesses potential
risks and facilitates ongoing communication between the parties, as well as with PepsiCo’ s Board of Directors and the
Audit Committee of the Board;

•PepsiCo’ s Corporate  Audit Department evaluates the ongoing effectiveness of our key internal controls through periodic
audit and review procedures; and
•PepsiCo’ s Compliance & Ethics Department leads and coordinates our compliance policies and practices.
Market Risks
We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:
•commodity prices, af fecting the cost of our raw materials and ener gy;
•foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and
•interest rates.
In the normal cours e of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of
strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the
identification and effective implementat ion of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives.
Our globa l purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements. See “Uncertain or
unfavorable econom ic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.” and
“Our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by increased costs, disruption of supply or
shortages of raw materials, energy, water and other supplies.” in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” See “Our Liquidity and Capital
Resources” for further information on our non-cancelable purchasing commitments.
The fair value of our derivatives fluctuates based on market rates and prices. The sensitivity of our derivatives to these market
fluctuations is discussed below . See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these derivatives and
our hedgin g policies . See “Our Critical Accounting Policies” for a discussion of the exposure of our pension and retiree medical
plan assets and liabilities to risks related to market fluctuations.
Inflationary , deflationary and recessiona ry conditions impacting these market risks also impact the demand for and pricing of our
products. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion.
Commodity Prices
Our commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $0.9 billion  as of December 30, 2017  and $0.8 billion  as of December 31,
2016 . At the end of 2017 , the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10% decrease in the
underlying commodity price, would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2017  by $96 million .
Foreign Exchange
Our operations outside of the United States generated 42% of our net revenue in 2017 , with Mexico, Russia, Canada, the United
Kingdom and Brazil  comprising approximately 20% of our net revenue in 2017 . As a result, we are exposed to foreign  exchange
risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. During 2017 , unfavorable
foreign exchange had a net nominal impact on net revenue growth due to decli nes in the Egyptian pound, Turkish lira and Pound
sterling, offset by appreciation in the Russian ruble, Brazilian real and euro. Currency declines against the U.S. dollar which are not
offset could adversely impact our future financial results.
In addition , volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made,
manufactured, distributed or sold, including in Brazil, China, India, Mexico, the
48
Table of Contents
Middle East, Russia and Turkey , and currency fluctuations in certain of these international markets continue to result in challenging
operating environments. We also continue to monitor the economic and political developments related to the United Kingdom’ s
pending withdrawal from the European Union, including how the United Kingdom will interact with other European Union
countries following its departure, and the potential impact for the ESSA segment and our other businesses.
Starting in 2014, Russia announced economic sanctions against the United State s and other nations that include a ban on imports of
certain ingredients and finished goods from specific countries. These sanctions have not had and are not expected to have a material
impact on the results of our operations in Russia or our consolidated results or financial position, and we will continue to monitor
the economic, operating and political environment in Russia closely . For the years ended December 30, 2017 , December 31, 2016
and December 26, 2015 , net revenue genera ted by our operations in Russia represented 5%, 4% and 4% of our consolidated net
revenue, respectively . As of December 30, 2017 , our long-lived assets in Russia were $4.7 billion .
Our foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $1.6 billion  as of December 30, 2017  and December 31, 2016 . The
total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $1.5 billion  as of December 30, 2017  and
$0.8 billion  as of December 31, 2016 . At the end of 2017 , we estim ate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange
rates would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2017 by $125 million .
Due to exchange restrictions and other conditions that significantly impact our ability to effectively manage our businesses in
Venezuela and realize earnings generat ed by our Venezuelan businesses, effective at the end of the third quarter of 2015, we
deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for our investments in our Venezuelan subsidiaries and joint
venture using the cost method of accounting. In 2015, we recorded pre- and after-tax charges of $1.4 billion  in our income
statement to reduce the value of the cost method investments to their estimated fair values, resulting in a full impairment. The
factors that led to our conclusions at the end of the third quarter of 2015 continued to exist through the end of 2017, and we expect
these conditions will continue for the foreseeable future.
We do not have any guarantees related to our Venezuelan entities, and our ongoing contractual commitments to our Venezuelan
businesses are not material. W e will recognize income from dividends and sales of inventory to our V enezuelan entities, which have
not been and are not expected to be material, to the extent cash in U.S. dollars is received. We have not received any cash in U.S.
dollars from our Venezuelan entities since our deconsolidation at the end of the third quarter of 2015. We continue to monitor the
conditions in Venezuela and their impac t on our accounting and disclosures. For further information, please refer to Note 1 to our
consolidated financial statements and “Items Af fecting Comparability .”
Inter est Rates
Our interest rate derivatives had a total notional value of $14.2 billion  as of December 30, 2017  and $11.2 billion  as of
December 31, 2016 . Assuming year-end 2017  investment levels and variable rate debt, a 1-percentage-point increase in interest
rates woul d have decreased our net interest expense in 2017  by $25 million  due to higher cash and cash equivalents and short-term
investments levels as compared with our variable rate debt.

OUR FINANCIAL RESUL TS
Results of Operations — Consolidated Review
In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below , “effective net pricing” reflects the year-over -year impact of discrete
pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different
countries and “net pricing” reflects the year-over -year combined impact of list price changes, weight changes per package,
discounts and allowances. Additionally , “acquisitions and divestitures,” except as otherwise noted, reflect all mergers and
acquisitions activity , including the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and changes in ownership or control in consolidated
subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. The impact of the structural change related to the deconsolidation of our
Venezuelan businesses is presented separately .
Volume
Our beverage volume in the NAB, Latin America, ESSA and AMENA segmen ts reflects sales to authorized bottlers, independent
distributors and retailers, as well as the sale of beverages bearing Company-o wned or licensed trademarks that have been sold
through our authorized independent bottlers. Bottler case sales (BCS) and concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE) are not
necessarily equal during any given period due to seasonality , timing of product launches, product mix, bottler inventory practices
and other factors. While our beverage revenues are not entirely based on BCS volume, as there are independent bottlers in the
supply chain, we believe that BCS is a valuable measure as it quantifies the sell-through of our beverage products at the consumer
level. Sales of products from our unconsolidated joint ventures are reflected in our reported volume. NAB, Latin America, ESSA
and AMENA, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, make, market, distribute and sell ready-to-drink tea
products through a joint venture with Unilever (under the Lipton brand name), and NAB further , either independently or in
conjunction with third parties, makes, markets, distributes and sells ready-to-drink coffee products through a joint venture with
Starbucks. In addition, AMENA licenses the Tropicana brand for use in China on co-branded juice products in connection with a
strategic alliance with T ingyi.
Our food and snacks volume in the FLNA, QFNA, Latin America, ESSA and AMENA segments is reported on a system-wide
basis, which includes our own sales and the sales by our noncontrolled affiliates of snacks bearing Company-owned or licensed
trademarks.
Servings
Since our divisions each use different measures of physical unit volume (i.e., kilos, gallons, pounds and case sales), a common
servings metric is necessary to reflect our consolidated physical unit volume. Our divisions’ physical volume measures are
converted into servings based on U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines for single-serving sizes of our products.
In 2017 , total servings decreased 1% compared to 2016 . In 2016 , total servings incre ased 3% compared to 2015 . Excluding the
impact of the 53rd reporting week in 2016, total servings in 2017 was even with the prior year and total servings in 2016 increased
2% compared to 2015. Servings growth reflects adjustments to the prior year results for divestitures and other structural changes,
including the deconsolidation of our V enezuelan businesses ef fective as of the end of the third quarter of 2015.

See “Results of Operations – Division Review” for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue.
2017
Operating profit increased 7% and opera ting margin improved 1.0 percentage points. Operating profit growth was driven by the
benefit of actions associated with our productivity initiatives, which contribute d more than $1 billion in cost reductions across a
number of expense categories, as well as effective net pricing. Items affecting comparability (see “Items Affecting Comparability”)
also contributed 4 percentage points to operating profit growth and increased operating profit margin by 0.5 percentage points,
primarily reflecting a prior -year impairment charge to reduce the value of our 5% indirect equity interest in TAB to its estimated
fair value. Additionally , the impact of refranchising our beverage business in Jordan and a gain associated with the sale of our
minority stake in Britvic each contributed 1 percentage point to operating profit growth. These impacts were partially offset by
certain operating cost increases, higher commodity costs and unfavorable foreign exchange. Commodity inflation reduced
operating profit growth by 6 percentage  points, primarily attributable to inflation in the AMENA, Latin America, ESSA, NAB and
FLNA segments. Corporate unallocated expenses (see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements) decreased 9%, reflecting the
impact of higher prior -year contributions to The PepsiCo Foundation, Inc. to fund charitable and social programs.
2016
Operating profit increased 17% and operating margin increased 2.3 percentage points. Operating profit growth was driven by the
benefit of actions associated with our productivity initiatives, which contribute d more than $1 billion in cost reductions across a
number of expense categories, ef fective net pricing and volume growth. Additionally , the impact of recording an impairment char ge
in 2015 and ceasing the operations of our MQD joint venture contributed 1 percentage point to operating profit growth. These
impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, higher advertising and marketing expenses, unfavorable foreign
exchange and higher commodity costs, as well as the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan businesses, which reduced operating profit
growth by 2 percentage points. Items affecting comparability (see “Items Affecting Comparability”) contributed 13 percentage
points to operating profit growth and increased operating profit margin by 1.5 percentage points, primarily reflecting a 17-
percentage-point contribution from the 2015 Venezuela impairment charges. Higher commodity inflation reduced operating profit
growth by 1 percentage point, primarily attributable to inflation in the Latin America, ESSA and AMENA segments, partially
offset by deflation in the NAB, FLNA and QFNA segments. The impact of our 53rd reporting week was fully offset by incre mental
investments we made in our business. Corporate unallocated expenses (see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements)
decreased 1%, driven by lower pension expense reflecting the change to the full yield curve approach, lower foreign exchange
transaction losses and decreases in other corporate expenses, partially offset by increased contributions to The PepsiCo Foundation,
Inc. to fund charita ble and social programs and the net impact of items affecting comparability mentioned above included in
corporate unallocated expenses.

2017
Net interest expense decreased $325 million  reflecting a prior -year charge of $233 million representing the premium paid in
accordance with the “make-whole” redemption provisions to redeem all of our outstanding 7.900% senior notes due 2018 and
5.125% senior notes due 2019 for the principal amounts of $1.5 billion and $750 million, respectively . This decrease also reflects
higher interest income due to higher interest rates and average cash balances, as well as gains on the market value of investments
used to economicall y hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability . These impacts were partially offset by higher interest
expense due to higher average debt balances.
The reported tax rate increased 23.5 percentage points primarily as a result of the provisional net tax expense related to the TCJ
Act, which contributed 26 percentage point s to the increase, partially offset by the impact of the prior -year impairment charge to
reduce the value of our 5% indirect equity interest in TAB to its estimated fair value, which had no corresponding tax benefit, as
well as the impact of recognizing excess tax benefits in the provision for incom e taxes as a result of the changes in accounting for
certain aspects of share-based payments to employees in the current year. See Note  2 and Note 5 to our consolidated financial
statements for additional information.
Net income attributable to PepsiCo and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share both decreased 23%. Items affecting
comparability (see “Items Affecting Comparability”) negatively impacted both net income attributable to PepsiCo and net income
attributable to PepsiCo per common share by 30 percentage points, primarily as a result of the provisional net tax expense related to
the TCJ Act.

2016
Net interest expense increased $321 million  reflecting  a charge of $233 million representing the premium paid in accordance with
the “make-whole” redemption provision s to redeem all of our outstanding 7.900% senior notes due 2018 and 5.125% senior notes
due 2019 for the principal amounts of $1.5 billion and $750 million, respectiv ely. This increase also reflects higher average debt
balances, partially offset by higher interest income due to higher average cash balances, as well as gains on the market value of
investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability .
The report ed tax rate decreased 0.7 percentag e points due to the impact of the 2015 Venezuela impairment charges, which had no
corresponding tax benefit, partially offset by the 2015 favorable resolution with the IRS of substantially all open matters related to
the audits for taxabl e years 2010 and 2011, as well as the 2016 impairment charge recorded to reduce the value of our 5% indirect
equity interest in T AB to its estimated fair value, which had no corresponding tax benefit.
Net income attributable to PepsiCo increased 16% and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share increased 19%. Items
affecting comparability (see “Items Affecting Comparability”) positively contributed 12 percentage points to net income
attributable to PepsiCo and 13 percentage points to net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share.
Non-GAAP Measures
Certain financial measures contained in this Form 10-K adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance with U.S.
Generally Accepted Accounting Princi ples (GAAP). We use non-GAAP  financial measures internally to make operating and
strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a
factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K
provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating
results, and provide s additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures in this
Form 10-K allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business
performance and trends.
We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that
could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performan ce or trends. Examples of items for which we may
make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring programs;
charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulati ons, such as significant tax law changes; gains or
losses associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; debt redemptions; pension and retiree
medical related items; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; asset impairments (non-cash); and remeasurements of net
monetary assets.  See below and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a description of adjustments to our U.S. GAAP financial
measures in this Form 10-K. 
Non-GAAP informa tion should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP . In addition, our non-GAAP financial
measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.
The following non-GAAP financial measures are contained in this Form 10-K:
•cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, noncontrolling interests and
provision for income taxes, each adjusted for items af fecting comparability;

Corr esponding Constant Curr ency Gr owth Rates
Cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, noncontrolling interests and provision for
income taxes, adjusted for items affecting comparability; operating profit/loss, adjusted for items affecting comparability , and net
income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, adjusted for items affecting comparability , exclude the net impact of
mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting,
restructuring and impairment charges related to our 2014 and 2012 Productivity Plans, a provisional net tax expense associated
with the enactment of the TCJ Act, charges related to the transaction with Tingyi, a charge related to debt redemption, pension-
related settlements, Venezuela impairment charges and a tax benefit (see “Items Affecting Comparability” for a detailed description
of each of these items). We also evaluate performance on operating profit/loss,  adjusted for items affecting comparability , and net
income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, adjusted for items affecting comparability , on a constant currency
basis, which measure our financial resul ts assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates
in effect for the comparable prior -year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as
appropriate, our current year U.S. dollar results by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as
appropriate, those amounts by the prior -year average foreign exchange rates. We believe these measures provide useful information
in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance.
Organic Revenue
We define organic revenue as net revenue adjusted for the impact of foreign  exchange translation, as well as the impact from
acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes, including the Venezuela deconsolidation, for the comparable period. The
Venezuela deconsolidation impact excluded the results of our V enezuelan businesses for the first three quarters of 2015. In addition,
our fiscal 2016 reported results included an extra week of results. Organic revenue excludes the impact of the 53rd reporting week
in the fourth quarter of 2016.
We believe organic revenue provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we
believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year .
See “Or ganic Revenue Growth” in “Results of Operations – Division Review .”
Free Cash Flow
We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property , plant and
equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities,
we believe  that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe  investors should also consider net capital spending
when evaluating our cash from operating
54
Table of Contents
activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share
repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discre tionary expenditures since we have certain non-
discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure.
See “Free Cash Flow” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
ROIC and Net ROIC, Excluding Items Affecting Comparability
We define  ROIC as net income attributable to PepsiCo plus interest expense after-tax divided by the sum of quarterly average debt
obligations and quarterly average comm on shareholders’ equity . Although ROIC is a common financial metric, numerous methods
exist for calculating ROIC. Accordingly , the method used by management to calculate ROIC may differ from the methods other
companies use to calculate their ROIC.
We believ e this metric serves as a measure of how well we use our capital to generate returns. In addition, we use net ROIC,
excluding items affecting comparability , to compare our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it
removes from our operating results the impact of items that are not indicati ve of our ongoing performance and reflects how
management evaluates our operating results and trends. We define net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability , as ROIC,
adjusted for quarterly average cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, after-tax interest income and items affecting
comparability . We believe the calculation of ROIC and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability , provides useful
information to investors and is an additional relevant comparison of our performance to consider when evaluating our capital
allocation ef ficiency .
See “Return on Invested Capital” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Mark-to-Market Net Impact
We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products,
energy and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period
with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and
administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity . These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division
results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the
economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility , which remains in corporate
unallocated expenses.
Restructuring and Impairment Charges
2014 Multi-Y ear Pr oductivity Plan
To build on the successful implementati on of the 2014 Productivity Plan to date, we expanded and extended the program through
the end of 2019 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the 2014 Productivity Plan to further
strengthen our food, snack and beve rage businesses. We now expect to incur pre-tax charges and cash expenditures of
approximately $1.3 billion and $985 million, respectively , as compared to our previous estimate of pre-tax charges and cash
expenditures of approximately $990 million and $705 million, respectively .

The expected pre-tax char ges and cash expenditures are summarized by year as follows:

(a)This total pre-tax charge is expected to consist of approximately $795 million of severance and other employee-related costs, approximately $165 million for asset impairments (all non-cash)
resulting from plant closures and related actions, and approximately $345 million for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives, including contract termination costs. This
charge is expected to impact reportable segments and Corporate approximately as follows: FLNA 14%, QFNA 3%, NAB 30%, Latin America 15%, ESSA 25%, AMENA 4% and Corporate
9%.
(b)In 2015 and 2014, cash expenditures include $2 million and $10 million, respectively, reported on our cash flow statement in pension and retiree medical plan contributions.
See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to our 2014 and 2012 Productivity Plans.
We regularly evaluate different productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plans and other initiatives discussed above and in
Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.
Provisional Net T ax Expense Related to the TCJ Act
In 2017, we recorded a provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion ($1.70 per share) associated with the enactment of the TCJ Act in
the fourth  quarter of 2017. Included in the net tax expense of $2.5 billion is a provisional mandatory one-time transition tax of
approximately $4 billion on undistributed international earnings, included in other liabilities. This mandatory one-time transition
tax was partially offset by a provisional $1.5 billion benefit resulting from the required remeasurement of our deferred tax assets
and liabilities to the new , lower U.S. corporate income tax rate.
See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.
Charges Related to the T ransaction with T ingyi
In 2016, we recorde d a pre- and after-tax impairment charge of $373 million ($0.26 per share) in the AMENA segment to reduce
the value of our 5% indirect equity interest in T AB to its estimated fair valu e. 
In 2015, we recorded a pre- and after-tax charge of $73 million ($0.05 per share) in the AMENA segment related to a write-of f of
the value of a call option to increase our holding in T AB to 20%.
See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.
Charge Related to Debt Redemption
In 2016, we paid $2.5 billion to redeem all of our outstanding 7.900% senior notes due 2018 and 5.125% senior notes due 2019 for
the princip al amounts of $1.5 billion and $750 million, respectively , and terminated certain interest rate swaps. As a result, we
recorded a pre-tax charge of $233 million ($156 million after-tax or $0.11 per share) to interest expense, primarily representing the
premium paid in accordance with the “make-whole” redemption provisions.
See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements.

Pension-Related Settlements
In 2016, we recorde d a pre-tax pension settlement charge in corporate unallocat ed expenses of $242 million ($162 million after-tax
or $0.1 1 per share) related to the purchase of a group annuity contract. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.
In 2015, we recorde d pre-tax benefits of $67 million ($42 million after-tax or $0.03 per share) in the NAB segment associated with
the settlem ent of pension-related liabilities from previous acquisitions. These benefits were recognized in selling, general and
administrative expenses.
Venezuela Impairment Charges
In 2015, we record ed pre- and after-tax charges of $1.4 billion ($0.91 per share) in the Latin America segment related to the
impairment of investments in our wholly-owned V enezuelan subsidiaries and beverage joint venture.
See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements and “Our Business Risks.”
Tax Benefit
In 2015, we recognized a non-cash tax benefit of $230 million  ($0.15 per share) associated with our agreem ent with the IRS
resolving substantia lly all open matters  related to the audits for taxable years 2010 through 2011, which reduced our reserve for
uncertain tax positions for the tax years 2010 and 201 1.

2017
Net reven ue decreased 5%, reflecting unfavorable foreign exchange, which negatively impacted net revenue performance by 10
percentage points, primarily driven by a weak Egyptian pound. This impact was partially of fset by ef fective net pricing.
Snacks volume grew 5%, driven by high-single-digit growth in China and India and double-digit growth in Pakistan. Additionally ,
the Middle East experienced low-single-digit growth and Australia experienced mid-single-digit growth.
Beverage volume declined 1%, reflectin g a double-digit decline in India and a mid-single-digit decline in the Middle East, partially
offset by mid-single-digit growth in China, high-single-digit growth in Pakistan and low-single-digit growth in the Philippines.
Operating profit improvement primarily  reflected a prior -year impairment charge to reduce the value of our 5% indirect equity
interest in TAB to its estimated fair value, included in items affecting comparability in the above table (see “Items Affecting
Comparability”). The effective net pricing and planned cost reductions across a number of expense categories also increased
operating profit growth. Additionally , the impact of refranchising our beverage business in Jordan contributed 14 percentage points
to operating profit growth. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, as well as higher commodity
costs, which reduced operating profit growth by 32 percentage points, primarily due to transaction-related foreign exchange on raw
material purchases driven by the weak Egyptian pound. Unfavorable foreign exchange translation reduced operating profit growth
by 8 percentage points.
2016
Net revenue declined 1%, reflecting unfavorable foreign exchange, which negatively impacted net revenue performance by 5
percentage points, as well as unfavorable net pricing. These impacts were partially of fset by volume growth.
Snacks volume grew  7%, reflecting double-digit growth in China and the Middle East and high-single-digit growth in Pakistan.
Additionally , India experienced low-single-digit growth and Australia experienced mid-single-digit growth.
Beverage volume grew 4%, driven by high-single-digit growth in Pakistan, double-digit growth in the Philippines and mid-single-
digit growth in China. Additionally , the Middle East experienced low-single-digit growth and India experienced mid-single-digit
growth.
Operating profit decreased 34%, primarily reflecting the items affecting comparability in the above table (see “Items Affecting
Comparability”). Additionally , operating profit performance was negatively impacted by certain operating cost increases, including
strategic initiatives, higher advertising and marketing expenses and the unfavorable net pricing, partially offset by the volume
growth and planned cost reductions across a number of expense categories. The impact from a 2015 gain related to the
refranchising of a portion of our beverage business in India negatively impacted operating profit performance by 4 percentage
points. This impact was partially offset by a 2015 impairment charge associated with a joint venture in the Middle East which
positively contributed 3 percentage points to operating profit performance.

Our Liquidity and Capital Resour ces
We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities and other
available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet
our operating, investing and financing needs. Our primary sources of cash available to fund cash outflows, such as our anticipated
share repurchases, dividend payments and scheduled debt maturities, include cash from operations and proceeds obtained from
issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt. However , there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and
credit markets will not impair our abilit y to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. See Note 8 to
our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities. See also “Our Business Risks” and “Uncertain or
unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.” in
“Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
As of December 30, 2017 , we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries of $18.9
billion outside the United States. The TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings,
including the $18.9 billion held in our consolidated subsidiaries outside the United States as of December 30, 2017, as a result of
which we recognize d a provisional mandatory transition tax liability of approximately $4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Under the provisions of the TCJ Act, this transition tax must be paid over eight years; we currently expect to pay this liability over
the period 2019 to 2026 . The recorded impact of the TCJ Act is provisional and the final amount may differ from the above
estimate, possibly materially , due to, among other things, changes in estimates, interpretations and assumptions we have made,
changes in IRS interpretations, the issuance of new guidance, legislative actions, changes in accounting standards or related
interpretations in response to the TCJ Act and future actions by states within the United States that have not currently adopted the
TCJ Act.
In addition, as a result of this transition tax, we may access and repatriate our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments
held in our foreign subsidiaries during 2018 without such funds being subject to further U.S. income tax liability . We are currently
evaluating when to repatriate such funds  currently held by our foreign subsidiaries and how to utilize such funds, including whether
to utilize such funds  or other available methods of debt financing, such as comm ercial paper borrowings, for our anticipated share
repurchases, dividen d payments, scheduled debt maturities, discretionary benefit plan contributions, capital expenditures, certain
investments into our business or other uses. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks,” “Items Affecting Comparability”
and “Our Critical Accounting Policies” as well as Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.
As of December 30, 2017 , cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidi aries subject to currency
controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material.
Furthermore, our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality . Working capital needs are impacted
by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the third quarter due to season al and holiday-related sales patterns, and generally
lowest in the first quarter . On a continuing basis, we consider various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our
business results, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, dividends, share repurchases, productivity and other efficiency
initiatives, and other structural changes. These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments.
The table below summarizes our cash activity:  
 2017  2016  2015
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 9,994  $ 10,673  $ 10,864

Table of Contents
Operating Activities
During 2017 , net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $10 billion , compared to $10.7 billion  in the prior year.
The opera ting cash flow performance primarily reflects unfavorable working capital comparisons to the prior year. This decrease is
mainly due to highe r current year payments to vendors and customers, coupled with higher net cash tax payments in the current
year, partially of fset by lower pension and retiree medical plan contributions in the current year .
In February 2018, we received approval from our Board of Directors to make discretionary contributions of $1.4 billion to the
PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan A (Plan A) in the United States that we intend to invest in fixed income securities. As of
February 13, 2018, we contributed $750  million of the approved amount; we expect to contribute the remaining $650 million in the
first quarter of 2018.
During 2016 , net cash provided by operating activities was $10.7 billion , compared to $10.9 billion  in the prior year. The operating
cash flow performance reflects discretionary pension contributions of $459 million. In addition, working capital reflects
unfavorable comparisons to the prior year . These decreases were partially of fset by lower net cash tax payments in the current year .
Investing Activities
During 2017 , net cash used for investing activities was $4.4 billion , prim arily reflecting net capital spendin g of $2.8 billion and net
purchases of debt securities with maturities greater than three months of $1.9 billion.
During 2016 , net cash used for investing activities was $7.1 billion , primarily reflecting net purchases of debt securities with
maturities greater than three months of $4.1 billion and net capital spending of $2.9 billion.
See Note 1 to our consolidated financ ial statements for further discussion of capital spending by division; see Note 9 to our
consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in debt securities.
We expect 2018  net capital spending to be approximately $3.6 billion .
Financing Activities
During 2017 , net cash used for financing activities was $4.2 billion , primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our
shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of $6.5 billion and net payments of short-term borrowings of $1.1
billion, partially offset by net proceeds from long-term debt of $3.1 billion and proceeds from exercises of stock options of $0.5
billion.
During 2016 , net cash used for financing activities was $3.2 billion , primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our
shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of $7.2 billion, debt redemptions of $2.5 billion, and withholding
tax payments on restricted stock units (RSUs), performance stock units (PSUs) and PepsiCo equity performance units (PEPunits)
converted of $0.1 billion, partially offset by net proceeds from long-term debt of $4.7 billion, net proceeds from short-term
borrowings of $1.5 billion, and proceeds from exercises of stock options of $0.5 billion.
We annually review our capital structure with our Board of Directors, including  our dividend policy and share repurchase activity .
On Februa ry 11, 2015, we announced a share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $12.0 billion of PepsiCo
common stock commencing from July 1, 2015 and expiring on June 30, 2018. On February 13, 2018, we announced a new share
repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $15.0 billion of PepsiC o common stock commencing on July 1, 2018 and
expiring on June 30, 2021. In addition, on February 13, 2018, we announced a 15.2% increase in our annualized dividend to $3.71
per share from $3.22 per share, effective with the dividend expected to be paid in June 2018. We expect to return a total of
approximately $7 billion to shareholders in 2018 through share repurchases of approximately $2 billion and dividends of
approximately $5 billion.

(a)See “Non-GAAP Measures.” In addition, when evaluating free cash flow, we also consider the following items impacting comparability: $6 million and $459 million in
discretionary pension contributions and associated net cash tax benefits of $1 million and $151 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively; $113 million, $125 million and $214 million
of payments related to restructuring charges and associated net cash tax benefits of $30 million, $22 million and $51 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively; net cash received
related to interest rate swaps of $5 million in 2016; net cash tax benefit related to debt redemption charge of $83 million in 2016; and $88 million in pension-related settlements and
associated net cash tax benefits of $31 million in 2015. We will also consider payments related to the provisional transition tax liability of approximately $4 billion, which we
currently expect to be paid over the period 2019 to 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act, as an item impacting comparability.
We use free cash flow primarily for financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. We expect to
continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining Tier 1 commercial
paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets
at favorab le interest rates. However , see “Our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets may be adversely affected
by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings.” in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks” for certain
factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows.
Any down grade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency , especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or not
as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increas e our future borrowing costs and impair our ability
to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade of our current
short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have
experienced historically , and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. See “Our
borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets may be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our
credit ratings.” in “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements.

balance sheet, must be paid over eight years. We expect to pay approximately $0.3 billion per year in 2019-2023, $0.6 billion in 2024, $0.9 billion in 2025 and $1.0 billion in 2026
and these amounts are excluded from the table above.

Long-term contractu al commitments, except for our long-term debt obligations and provisional transition tax liability , are generally
not recorded on our balance sheet. Operating leases primarily represent buildin g leases. Non-cancelable purchasing commitments
are primarily for oranges, orange juice and certain other commodities. Non-cancelable marketing commitments are primarily for
sports marketing. Bottler funding to independent bottlers is not reflected in our long-term contractual commitments as it is
negotiated on an annual basis. Accrue d liabilities for pension and retiree medical plans are not reflected in our long-term
contractual commitments. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our pension and
retiree medical obligations.
Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements
We do not have guarantees or other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that we believe
could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity .
We coordinate, on an aggregate basis, the contract negotiations of raw material requirements, including sweeteners, aluminum cans
and plastic  bottles and closures for us and certain of our independent bottlers. Once we have negotiated the contracts, the bottlers
order and take delivery directly from the supplier and pay the suppliers directly . Consequently , transactions between our
independent bottlers  and suppliers are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As the contracting party , we could be
liable to these suppliers in the event of any nonpayment by our independent bottlers, but we consider this exposure to be remote.

OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
An apprec iation of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results. These policies may require
management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties, and as a result, such estimates may significantly
impact our financia l results. The precision of these estimates and the likelihood of future changes depend on a number of
underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes. Other than our accounting for pension and retiree medical plans, our critical
accounting policies do not involve a choice between alternative methods of accounting. With the exception of our provisional net
tax expense related to the TCJ Act and the change in 2016 to the full yield approach to estimate the service and interest cost
components for our pension and retiree medical plans described below , we applied our critical accounting policies and estimation
methods consistently in all material respects, and for all periods presented. We have discussed our critical accounting policies with
our Audit Committee.
72
Table of Contents
Our critical accounting policies are:
•revenue recognition;
•goodwill and other intangible assets;
•income tax expense and accruals; and
•pension and retiree medical plans.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue upon shipment or delivery to our customers based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of
return. However , our policy for DSD and certain chilled products is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from
store shelv es to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshn ess they expect. Similarly , our policy for certain
warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates,
for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.
Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry
practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days
internationally , and may allow discounts for early payment. We estimate and reserve for our bad debt exposure based on our
experience with past due accounts and collectibility , the aging of accounts receivable and our analysis of customer data.
Our policy is to provide customers with product when needed. In fact, our commitment to freshness and product dating serves to
regulate the quantity of product shipped  or delivered. In addition, DSD products are placed on the shelf by our employees with
customer shelf space and storerooms limiting the quantity of product. For product delivered through other distribution networks, we
monitor customer inventory levels.
As discussed in “Our Customers” in “Item 1. Business,” we offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to
customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incen tives, discounts, advertising and other marketing
activities. Sales incentives and discount s are primarily accounted for as a reduc tion of revenue and include payments to customers
for performing activities on our behalf , such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products,
payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided
to our independent bottlers.
See Note 2 to our consolidated financi al statements for additional information on our revenue recognition and related policies,
including total marketplace spending, and the transition to the new revenue recognition guidance, which becomes effective in the
first quarter of 2018.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
We sell products under a number of brand names, many of which were develop ed by us. Brand development costs are expensed as
incurred. We also purchase brands and other intangible assets in acquisitions. In a business combination, the consideration is first
assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities, including brands and other intangible assets, based on estimated fair values, with any
excess recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value requires significant estim ates and assumptions based on an evaluation of a
number of factors, such as marketplace participants, product life cycles, market share, consumer awareness, brand history and
future expansion expectations, amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.
We believe that a brand has an indefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance
73
Table of Contents
and we have the intent and ability to support the brand with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future. If these perpetual
brand criteria are not met, brands are amortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from 20 to 40 years.
Determining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors,
including market share, consumer awareness, brand history , future expansion expectations and regulatory restrictions, as well as the
macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brand is sold.
In connection with previous acquisitions, we reacquired certain franchise rights which provided the exclusive and perpetual rights
to manufacture and/or distribute beverages for sale in specified territories. In determining the useful life of these franchise rights,
many factors were considered, including the pre-existing perpetual bottling arrangements, the indefinite period expected for these
franchise rights to contribute to our future cash flows, as well as the lack of any factors that would limit the useful life of these
franchise rights to us, including legal, regulatory , contractual, competitive, economic or other factors. Therefore, certain of these
franchise rights are considered as indefinite-lived, with the balance amortized over the remaining contractual period of the contract
in which the right was granted.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and are assessed for impairment at least annually , using either a
qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment durin g our third quarter . Where we use the qualitative
assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors
considered include macroeconomic, industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical financial
performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than
not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.
The quantitative assessment requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with
management’ s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions
underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant management
judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeco nomic and other factors to estimate future levels of
sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for nonamortizable intangible assets, such
as forecasted growth rates and weight ed-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are
consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks
described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks.”
Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic
environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated
fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows.
See Note 2 and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Income T ax Expense and Accruals
Our annua l tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various
jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determi ning our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax
positions. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain
positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in
light of changing facts and circumstance s, such as the progress of a tax audit. See “Increases in income tax rates, changes in income
tax laws or disagree ments with tax authorities could adversely affect our busin ess, financial condition or results of operations.” in
“Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
74
Table of Contents
An estima ted annual effective tax rate is applied to our quarterly operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual item
recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time
as that item. W e consider the tax adjustments from the resolution of prior year tax matters to be among such items.
Tax law requires items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements. As
a result, our annual tax rate reflected in our financial statements is different than that reported in our tax returns (our cash tax rate).
Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse
over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets
generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years for which we have already
recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the
available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax
liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statement s for which payment has been deferred, or expense
for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized as expense in our financial statements.
During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States . Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed
a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from
35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the enactment of the TCJ Act, we recognized a provisional net tax expense of
$2.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. See further information in “Items Af fecting Comparability .” 
Included in the provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion is a provisional mandatory one-time transition tax of approximately $4
billion on undistributed international earnings, included in other liabilities. This provisional mandatory one-time transition tax was
partially offset by a provisional $1.5 billion benefit resulting from the requir ed remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and
liabilities to the new, lower U.S. corporate income tax rate, effective January 1, 2018. The effect of the remeasurement was
recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, consistent with the enactment date of the TCJ Act and reflected in our provision for income
taxes.
The recorded impact of the TCJ Act is provisional and the final amount may differ, possibly materially , due to, among other things,
changes in estimates , interpretations and assumptions we have made, changes in IRS interpretations, the issuance of new guidance,
legislative actions, changes in accounting standards or related interpretations in response to the TCJ Act and future actions by states
within the United States that have not currently adopted the TCJ Act.
In 2017 , our annu al tax rate was 48.9% compa red to 25.4% in 2016 , as discus sed in “Other Consolidated Results.” The tax rate
increased 23.5 percentage points compared to 2016, primarily as a result of the provisional net tax expense related to the TCJ Act,
which contributed 26 percentage points to the increase, partially offset by the impact of the prior -year impairment charge to reduce
the value of our 5% indirect equity interest in TAB to its estimated fair value, which had no corresponding tax benefit, as well as
the impact of recogn izing excess tax benefits in the provision for income taxes as a result of the changes in accounting for certain
aspects of share-based payments to employees in the current year. See Note 2 and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements
for additional information.
The TCJ Act is currently expected to reduce our annual tax rate, in percentage terms, to the low twenties in 2018. However , we
continue to evaluate  the impact of the TCJ Act on our annual tax rate due to certain provisions, such as the global intangible low-
tax income (GIL TI) provision which may impact our tax rate in future years.

Pension and Retir ee Medical Plans
Our pension plans cover certain employees in the United States and certain international employees. Benefits are determined based
on either years of service or a combinat ion of years of service and earnings. Certain U.S. and Canada retirees are also eligible for
medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements. Generally , our share of retiree
medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts, which vary based upon years of service, with retirees contributing the
remainder of the cost. In addition, we have been phasing out certain subsidies of retiree medical benefits.
In 2016, we approved an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans that resulted in the combination
of two plans effective December 31, 2016, and the spinof f of a portion of the combined plan into a pre-existing plan effective
January 1, 2017. The benefits offered to the plans’ participants were unchanged.  The result of the reorganization was the creation of
Plan A and the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan I (Plan I). The reorganization was made to facilitate a targeted investment
strategy over time and to provide additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility . Actuarial gains and
losses associated with Plan A are amortized over the average remaining servic e life of the active participants, while the actuarial
gains and losses associated with Plan I are amortized over the remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants. As a result of
these chan ges, the pre-tax net periodic benefit cost decreased by $42 million ($27 million after-tax, reflecting tax rates effective for
the 2017 tax year, or $0.02 per share) in 2017, primarily impacting corporate unallocated expenses. See Note 7 to our consolidated
financial statements.
In 2016, the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans purchased a group annuity contract whereby an unrelated insurance
company assumed the obligation to pay and administer future annuity payments  for certain retirees. In 2016, we made discretionary
contributions of $452 million primarily to fund the transfer of the obligation. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge
of $242 million ($162 million after-tax or $0.11 per share). See “Items Affecting Comparability” and Note 7 to our consolidated
financial statements.
Our Assumptions
The determ ination of pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount
of benefits that employees earn while working, as well as the present value of those benefits. Annual pension and retiree medical
expense amounts are principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the
year (servi ce cost), (2) the increase in the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time (interest cost), and (3) other gains
and losses as discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, reduced by (4) the expected return on assets for our
funded plans.
Significant assumptions used to measure our annual pension and retiree medical expenses include:
•certain employee-related demographic factors, such as turnover , retirement age and mortality;
•the expected return on assets in our funded plans;
•for pension expense, the rate of salary increases for plans where benefits are based on earnings;
•for retiree medical expense, health care cost trend rates; and
•for pension and retiree medical expense, the spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the present value of
liabilities and, beginning in 2016, to determine service and interest costs.
Certain assumptions  reflect our historica l experience and management’ s best judgment regarding future expectations. All actuarial
assumptions are reviewed annually , except in the case of an interim remeasurem ent due to a significant event such as a curtailment
or settlement. Due to the significant management judgment
76
Table of Contents
involved, our assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension and retiree medical expenses and
obligations.
At each measurement date, the discount rates are based on interest rates for high-quality , long-term corporate debt securities with
maturities comparable to those of our liabilities. Our U.S. obligation and pension and retiree medical expense is based on the
discount rates determined using the Mercer Above Mean Curve. This curve includes bonds that closely match the timing and
amount of our expected benefit payments and reflects the portfolio of investments we would consider to settle our liabilities.
Beginning 2016, we changed the method we use to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for
our U.S. and the majority of our signifi cant international pension and retiree medical plans. Historically , we estimated the service
and intere st cost components using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the
projected benefit obligation (or accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation for the retiree medical plans) at the beginning of the
period. We now use a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components of benefit cost by applying the specific spot
rates along the yield  curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. We have made
this change to improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates, which we
believe will result in a more precise measurement of service and interest costs. This change does not affect the measurement of our
benefit obligation. We have accounted for this change in estimate on a prospective basis as of the beginning of 2016. The pre-tax
reduction in net periodic benefit cost associated with this change was $125 milli on ($81 million after-tax or $0.06 per share) for the
full year 2016.
See Note 7 to our consolidated financia l statements for information about the expected rate of return on plan assets and our plans’
investment strategy . Although we review  our expected long-term rates of return on an annual basis, our asset returns in a given year
do not significantly influence our evaluation of long-term rates of return.
The health  care trend rate used to deter mine our retiree medical plans’ liability and expense is reviewed annually . Our review is
based on our claims  experience, information provided by our health plans and actuaries, and our knowledge of the health care
industry . Our review  of the trend rate considers factors such as demographics, plan design, new medical technologies and changes
in medical carriers.
Weighted-average assumptions for pension and retiree medical expense are as follows:  
 2018  2017  2016
Pension      
Service cost discount rate 3.7% 4.3% 4.5%
Interest cost discount rate 3.2% 3.5% 3.8%
Expected rate of return on plan assets (a)6.9% 7.2% 7.2%
Expected rate of salary increases 3.2% 3.2% 3.2%
Retiree medical      
Service cost discount rate 3.6% 4.0% 4.3%
Interest cost discount rate 3.0% 3.2% 3.3%
Expected rate of return on plan assets (a)6.5% 7.5% 7.5%
Current health care cost trend rate 5.8% 5.9% 6.0%
(a) Expected rate of return on plan assets in 2018 reflects  a $1.4 billion contribution to Plan A in the United States that we intend to invest in fixed income securities, as well
as our 2018 tar get investment allocations disclosed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.
In general , lower discount rates increase the size of the projected benefit obligation and pension expense in the following year,
while higher discount rates reduce the size of the projected benefit obligation and pension expense. Based on our assumptions, we
expect our total pension and retiree medical expense to remain
77
Table of Contents
consistent in 2018  prim arily driven by cost savings due to the recognition of prior experience gains on plan assets and the impact of
approved plan contributions, partially of fset by the change in discount rates.
Sensitivity of Assumptions
A decrease in each of the collective discount rates or in the expected rate of return assumptions would increase expense for our
benefit plans. A 25-basis-point decrease in each of the above discount rates and expected rate of return assumptions would increase
2018  pre-tax pension and retiree medical expense as follows:
Assumption  Amount
 
Discount rates used in the calculation of expense  $47
Expected rate of return  $42
See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional informatio n about the sensitivity of our retiree medical cost
assumptions.
Funding
We make contributions to pension trusts that provide plan benefits for certain pension plans. These contributions are made in
accordance with applicable tax regula tions that provide for current tax deductions for our contributions and taxation to the
employee only upon receipt of plan benefits. Generally , we do not fund our pension plans when our contributions would not be
currently tax deductible. As our retiree medical plans are not subject to regulat ory funding requirements, we generally fund these
plans on a pay-as-you-go basis, although we periodically review available options to make additional contributions toward these
benefits.
In Februar y 2018, we received approval  from our Board of Directors to make discretionary contributions of $1.4 billion to Plan A
in the United States that we intend to invest in fixed income securities. As of February 13, 2018, we contributed $750 million of the
approved amount; we expect to contribu te the remaining $650 million in the first quarter of 2018. These contributions are reflected
in our 2018 long-term expected rate of return on plan assets and tar get investment allocations.
Our pensio n and retiree medical contrib utions are subject to change as a result  of many factors, such as changes in interest rates,
deviations between actual and expected  asset returns and changes in tax or other benefit laws. We regularly evaluate different
opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans. See Note 7 to our consolidated
financial statements for our past and expected contributions and estimated future benefit payments.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1 — Basis of Pr esentation and Our Divisions
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the consolidated accounts
of PepsiCo , Inc. and the affiliates that we control. In addition, we include our share of the results of certain other affiliates using the
equity method based on our economic  ownership interest, our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating or
financial decisions of these af filiates or our ability to direct their economic resources. W e do not control these other af filiates, as our
ownership in these other af filiates is generally 50% or less. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated.
Raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production
planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and
delivering finished product are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are used in
determining, among  other items, sales incentives accruals, tax reserves, share-based compensation, pension and retiree medical
accruals, amounts and useful lives for intangible assets and future cash flows  associated with impairment testing for perpetual
brands, goodwill and other long-lived assets. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well
as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our
estimates as circums tances change. As future events and their effect cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ
significantly from these estimates.
Effective as of the end of the third quarter of 2015, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries from our consolidated financial
statements and began accounting for our investments in our wholly-owned Venezuelan subsidiaries and joint venture using the cost
method of accounting. See subsequent discussion of “V enezuela.”
Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturda y of each December , resulting in an additional week of results every five or six years. Our
fiscal 2016 results included an extra week. While our North America results are reported on a weekly calendar basis, most of our
international operations report on a monthly calendar basis. Certain operations in our ESSA segment report on a weekly calendar
basis. The following chart details our quarterly reporting schedule:
 
Quarter   United States and Canada   International
First Quarter   12 weeks   January , February
Second Quarter   12 weeks   March, April and May
Third Quarter   12 weeks   June, July and August
Fourth Quarter   16 weeks (17 weeks for 2016)   September , October , November and December
See “Our Divisions” below , and for additional unaudited information on items affecting the comparability of our consolidated
results, see further unaudited information in “Items Affecting Comparability” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amoun ts. All per share amounts reflect common per share
amounts, assume dilution unless otherw ise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to the

year presentation, including the adoption of the recently issued accounting pronouncements disclosed in Note 2.
Our Divisions
Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a
wide variety of convenient and enjoyable beverages, foods and snacks, serving customers and consumers in more than 200
countries and territories with our largest operations in North America, Mexico, Russia, the United Kingdom and Brazil. Division
results are based on how our Chief Executive Officer assesses the performance of and allocates resources to our divisions and are
considered our reportable segments. For additional unaudited information on our divisions, see “Our Operations” contained in
“Item 1. Business.” The accounting policies for the divisions are the same as those described in Note 2, except for the following
allocation methodologies:
•share-based compensation expense;
•pension and retiree medical expense; and
•derivatives.
Share-Based Compensation Expense
Our divisi ons are held accountable for share-based compensation expense and, therefore, this expense is allocated to our divisions
as an incremental employee compensation cost. The allocation of share-based compensation expense in 2017  was approximately
13% to FLNA,  1% to QFNA , 18% to NAB, 7% to Latin America, 9% to ESSA,  9% to AMENA and 43% to corpora te unalloc ated
expenses. In 2016 , the allocation of share-based compensation expense was approximately 14% to FLNA, 2% to QFNA , 22% to
NAB, 7% to Latin America, 11% to ESSA, 10% to AMENA and 34% to corporate unallo cated expenses. We had similar
allocations of share-based compensation expense to our divisions in 2015 . The expense allocated to our divisions excludes any
impact of changes in our assumptions during the year which reflect market conditions over which division management has no
control. Therefore, any variances betw een allocated expense and our actual expense are recognized in corporate unallocated
expenses.
Pension and Retir ee Medical Expense
Pension and retiree  medical service costs measured at fixed discount rates, as well as amortization of costs related to certain
pension plan amendments and gains and losses due to demographics (including mortality assumptions and salary experience) are
reflected in division  results. Division results also include interest costs, measure d at fixed discount rates, for retiree medical plans.
Interest costs for the pension plans, pension asset returns and the impact of pension funding, and gains and losses other than those
due to demographics, are all reflected in corporate unallocated expenses. In addition, corporate unallocated expenses include the
difference between the service costs included in division results and total service costs determined using the plans’ discount rates as
disclosed in Note 7.
Derivatives
We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products,
energy and metals . Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period
with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and
administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity . These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division
results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the
economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility , which remains in corporate
unallocated expenses. These derivatives hedge underlying commodity price risk and were not entered into for trading or speculative
purposes.

Venezuela
Due to exchange restrictions and other conditions that significantly impact our ability to effectively manage our businesses in
Venezuela and realize earnings generat ed by our Venezuelan businesses, effective at the end of the third quarter of 2015, we
deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for our investments in our Venezuelan subsidiaries and joint
venture using the cost method of accou nting. We recorded pre- and after-tax charges of $1.4 billion  in our income statement to
reduce the value of the cost method investments to their estimated fair values, resulting in a full impairment. The factors that led to
our conclusions at the end of the third quarter of 2015 continued to exist through the end of 2017.
We do not have any guarantees related to our Venezuelan entities, and our ongoing contractual commitments to our Venezuelan
businesses are not material. W e will recognize income from dividends and sales of inventory to our V enezuelan entities, which have
not been and are not expected to be material, to the extent cash in U.S. dollars is received. We have not received any cash in U.S.
dollars from our Venezuelan entities since our deconsolidation at the end of the third quarter of 2015. We continue to monitor the
conditions in Venezuela and their impact on our accounting and disclosures. For further unaudited information, see “Our Business
Risks,” “Items Affecting Comparability ” and “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Note 2 — Our Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue upon shipment or delivery to our customers based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of
return. However , our policy for DSD and certain chilled products is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from
store shelv es to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshn ess they expect. Similarly , our policy for certain
warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates,
for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.
Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry
practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days
internationally , and may allow discounts for early payment.
We estimate and reserve for our bad debt exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility , the aging of
accounts receivable and our analysis of customer data. Bad debt expense is classified within selling, general and administrative
expenses in our income statement.
87
Table of Contents
We are exposed to concentration of credit risk from our major customers, includ ing Walmart. In 2017 , sales to Walmart (including
Sam’ s) represented approximately 13% of our consolidated net revenue, including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers,
which were used in finished goods sold by them to W almart. W e have not experienced credit issues with these customers.
Total Marketplace Spending
We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending
includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily
accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers  for performing activities on our behalf, such as
payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote
lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers.
A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers  and customer volume rebates, are based on annual
targets, and accruals are established during the year for the expected payout. These accruals are based on contract terms and our
historical experience  with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer participation
and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are
recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also
based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred. The terms of most of our incentive arrangements do not exceed
a year, and, therefore, do not require highly uncertain long-term estimates. Certain arrangements, such as fountain pouring rights,
may extend beyond one year. Up-front payments to customers under these arrangements are recognized over the shorter of the
economic or contractual life, primarily as a reduction of revenue, and the remaining balances of $262 million  as of December 30,
2017  and $291 million  as of December 31, 2016  are includ ed in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our
balance sheet. For additional unaudited information on our sales incentives, see “Our Customers” in “Item 1. Business” and “Our
Critical Accounting Policies” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
For interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our
interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted
sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period’ s actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our
forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes
in estimate s and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginn ing in the interim period that they are identified. In
addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing
activities. Our annual financial statements are not impacted by this interim allocation methodology .
Advertising and other marketing activit ies, reported as selling, general and administrative expenses, totaled $4.1 billion  in 2017 ,
$4.2 billion  in 2016  and $3.9 billion  in 2015 , including  advertising expenses of $2.4 billion  in 2017 , $2.5 billion  in 2016  and $2.4
billion  in 2015 . Deferred advertising costs are not expensed until the year first used and consist of:
•media and personal service prepayments;
•promotional materials in inventory; and
•production costs of future media advertising.
Deferred advertising costs of $46 million  and $32 million  as of December 30, 2017  and December 31, 2016 , respectively , are
classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet.

Distribution Costs
Distribution costs, including the costs of shipping and handling activities, which include certain merchandising activities, are
reported as selling, general and administrative expenses. Shipping and handling expenses were $9.9 billion  in 2017 , $9.7 billion  in
2016  and $9.4 billion  in 2015 .
Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Software Costs
We capita lize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining
computer software for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will be
used as intended. Capitalized software costs include(i) external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or
obtaining computer software, (ii) compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software
projects and (iii) interest costs incurred while developing internal-use computer software. Capitalized software costs are included in
property , plant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the
estimated useful lives of the software, which approximate five to 10 years. Software amortization totaled $224 million  in 2017 ,
$214 million  in 2016  and $202 million  in 2015 . Net capitalized software and development costs were $686 million  and $791
million  as of December 30, 2017  and December 31, 2016 , respectively .
Commitments and Contingencies
We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, certain taxes and environmental matters, as well as
commitments under  contractual and other commercial obligations. We recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments
when a loss is proba ble and estimable. For additional unaudited information on our commitments, see “Our Liquidity and Capital
Resources” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Research and Development
We engage in a variety of research and development activities and continue to invest to accelerate growth and to drive innovation
globally . Consumer research is excluded from research and development costs and included in other marketing costs. Research and
development costs were $737 million , $760 million  and $ 754 million  in 2017 , 2016  and 2015 , respectively , and are reported within
selling, general and administrative expenses.
See “Research and Development” in “Item 1. Business” for additional unaudited information about our research and development
activities.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and are assessed for impairment at least annually , using either a
qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment durin g our third quarter . Where we use the qualitative
assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors
considered include macroeconomic, industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical financial
performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than
not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.
In the quantitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, if the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset
exceeds its estimated fair value, as deter mined by its discounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to
that exces s. Quantit ative assessment of goodwill is performed using a two-step impairment test at the reporting unit level. A
reporting unit can be a division or
89
Table of Contents
business within a division. The first step compares the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, with its estimated fair
value, as determined  by its discounted cash flows. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, we
complete the second step to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss that we should record, if any. In the second step, we
determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill by allocating the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to all of
the assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets). The amount of impairment loss is equal
to the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The quantitative assessment
described above requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management’ s
strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a
discount rate (weighted average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant management judgment is
necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors to estimate future levels of sales,
operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evalua tions for nonamortizable intangible assets, such as
forecasted growth rates and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent
with our internal forecasts and operating plans.
Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic
environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated
fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows.

Policies” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Adopted
In 2017, the SEC issued guidance related to the TCJ Act which allows recording of provisional tax expense using a measurement
period, not to exceed one year , when information necessary to complete the accounting
90
Table of Contents
for the effects of the TCJ Act is not available. We elected to apply the measur ement period provisions of this guidance to certain
income tax effects of the TCJ Act when it became effective during our fourth quarter of 2017, resulting in a provisional net tax
expense of $2.5 billion . This provisional net tax expense was recorded based on information available to us prior to the issuance of
our 2017 consolidated financial stateme nts, may be subject to further revision as disclosed in Note 5, and will be finalized no later
than the end of 2018.
In 2016, the Financ ial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance that changes the accounting for certain aspects of
share-based payments to employees. We adopted the provisions of this guidance during our first quarter of 2017, resulting in the
following impacts to our financial statements:
•Income tax effects of vested or settled awards were recognized in the provision  for income taxes on our income statement
on a prospective basis. Previously , these tax effects were recorded on our equity statement in capital in excess of par value.
For the year ended December 30, 2017, our excess tax benefits were $115 million , resulting in a $0.08  increase to diluted
net income  attributable to PepsiCo per common share. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015, our
excess tax benefits recognized were $110 million  and $107 million , respectively . If we had applied this standard in 2016 and
2015, there would have been a $0.07  increase to diluted net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share for both
years. The ongoing impact on our financial statements is dependent on the timin g of when awards vest or are exercised, our
tax rate and the intrinsic value when awards vest or are exercised.
•Excess tax benefits are retrospectively presented within operating activities and withholding tax payments upon vesting of
RSUs, PSUs and PEPunits are retrospectively presented within financing activities in the cash flow statement. The adoption
resulted in an increase of $295 million , $269 million  and $284 million  in our operating cash flow with a corresponding
decrease in our financing cash flow for the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015,
respectively .
The guidance also allows for the employer to repurchase more of an employee’ s shares, up to the maximum statutory rate, for tax
withholding purposes and not classify the award as a liability that requires valuation on a mark-to-market basis. Our accounting
treatment for outstanding awards was not impacted by our adoption of this provision. In addition, the guidance allows for a policy
election to account for forfeitures as they occur . We will continue to apply our policy of estimating forfeitures.
In 2016, the FASB issued guidance that eliminates the requirement that an investor retrospectively apply equity method accounting
for an investment originally accounted for by another method. The guidance requires that an equity method investor add the cost of
acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor’s previously held interest and adopt the equity
method of accounting as of the date the investor ’s ability to exercise significant influence over the investment is achieved. We
adopted the provisions of this guidance prospectively during our first quarter of 2017; the adoption did not impact our financial
statements.
In 2015, the FASB issued guidance that requires companies to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the
balance sheet. We adopted the provisi ons of this guidance retrospectively during our first quarter of 2017, resulting in the
reclassification of $639 million  of deferred taxes from current to non-current on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2016.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Not Y et Adopted
In 2017, the FASB issued guidance to amend and simplify the application of hedge accounting guidance to better portray the
economic results of risk management activities in the financial statements. The guidance expands the ability to hedge nonfinancial
and financial risk components, reduces complexity in fair value hedges of interest rate risk, eliminates the requirement to separately
measure and report hedge ineffectiveness, as well as eases certain hedge effectiveness assessment requirements. The guidance is
effective beginning
91
Table of Contents
in 2019 with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance, including transition elections and
required disclosures, on our financial statements and the timing of adoption.
In 2017, the FASB issued guidance that requires companies to retrospectively present the service cost component of net periodic
benefit cost for pension and retiree medical plans along with other compensation costs in operating profit and present the other
components of net periodic benefit cost below operating profit in the income statement. The guidance also allows only the service
cost component of net periodic benefit cost to be eligible for capitalization within inventory or fixed assets on a prospective basis.
We will adopt the guidance when it becomes effective in the first quarter of 2018. We will also update our allocation of service
costs to our division s starting in 2018 to better approximate actual service cost. In connection with this adoption, we expect to
record a decrease in operating profit of $233 million  for the year ended December 30, 2017 and an increase in operating profit of
$19 million  for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily impacting selling, general and administrative expenses. See Note 7
for further information on our service cost and other components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and retiree medical plans.
In 2016, the FASB issued guidance to clarify how restricted cash should be presented in the cash flow statement. We will adopt the
guidance when it becomes effective in the first quarter of 2018. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our
financial statements. 
In 2016, the FASB issued guidance that requires companies to account for the income tax effects of intercompany transfers of
assets, other than inventory , when the transfer occurs versus deferring income  tax effects until the transferred asset is sold to an
outside party or otherwise recognized. We will adopt the guidance when it becomes effective in the first quarter of 2018. The
guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.
In 2016, the FASB issued guidance that requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet, but record expenses on the
income statement in a manner similar to current accounting. For lessors, the guidance modifies the classification criteria and the
accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. The guidance is effective beginning in 2019 with early adoption permitted.
We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements and related disclosures, including the increase
in the assets and liabilities on our balance sheet and the impact on our current lease portfolio from both a lessor and lessee
perspective. To facilitate this, we are utilizing a comprehensive approach to review our lease portfolio, as well as assessing system
requirements and control implications. We have identified our significant leases by geography and by asset type that will be
impacted by the new guidance, as well as a software tool to begin tracking the requirements of the guidance. In addition, we are
currently evaluating the timing of adoption of this guidance. See Note 13 for our minimum lease payments under non-cancelable
operating leases.
In 2016, the FASB issued guidance that requires companies to measure investments in certain equity securities at fair value and
recognize any changes in fair value in net income. We will adopt the guidanc e when it becomes effective in the first quarter of
2018. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements. In the second quarter of 2017, we sold
our minor ity stake in Britvic, representing all of our available-for -sale equity securities, which reduced the risk and volatility of
these investments in our income statement in the future. See Note 9 for further information on our available-for -sale securities.
In 2014, the FASB issued guidance on revenue recognition, with final amendments issued in 2016. The guidance provides for a
five-step model to determine the revenue recognized for the transfer of goods or services to customers that reflects the expected
entitled consideration in exchange for those goods or services. It also provides clarification for principal versus agent
considerations and identifying performance obligations. In addition, the F ASB introduced practical expedients related to disclosures
of remaining performance obligations, as well as other amendments related to guidance on collectibility , non-cash consideration
and the presentation  of sales and other similar taxes. Financial statement disclo sures required under the guidance will enable users
to understand the nature, amount, timing, judgments and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows relating to customer contracts. The
two permitted transition methods under the
92
Table of Contents
guidance are the full retrospective approach or a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening retained earnings in the year of
adoption (cumulative effect approach). We will adopt the guidance using the cumulative effect approach when it becomes effective
in the first quarter of 2018.
We are utilizing a comprehensive appro ach to assess the impact of the guidance on our contract portfolio by reviewing our current
accounting policies and practices to identify potential differences that would result from applying the new requirements to our
revenue contracts, including evaluation of our performance obligations, principal versus agent considerations and variable
consideration. We are substantially complete with our contract and business process reviews and implemented changes to our
controls to support recognition and disclosures under the new guidance. As a result of implementing certain changes to our
accounting policies upon adoption, we plan to record an adjustment to opening retained earnings to reflect marketplace spending
that our customers and independent bottlers expect to be entitled to in line with revenue recognition; exclude all sales, use, value-
added and certain excise taxes assessed by governmental authorities on revenue-producing transactions from net revenue and cost
of sales; and to record shipping and handling activities that are performed after a customer obtains control of the product as a
fulfillment cost. Based on the foregoin g, we currently do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our financial
statements or disclosures.

2014 Multi-Y ear Productivity Plan
The 2014 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 13, 2014, includes the next generation of productivity initiatives that
we believe will strengthen our food, snack and beverage businesses by: accelerating our investment in manufacturing automation;
further optimizing our global manufacturing footprint, including closing certain manufacturing facilities; re-engineering our go-to-
market systems in developed markets; expanding shared services; and implementing simplified organization structures to drive
efficiency . To build on the successful implementation of the 2014 Productivity Plan to date, we expanded and extended the program
through the end of 2019 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above to further strengthen
our food, snack and beverage businesses.
In 2017 , 2016  and 2015 , we incurred restructuring char ges of $295 million  ($224 million  after -tax or $0.16  per share) , $160 million
($131 million  after -tax or $0.09  per share) and $169 million  ($134 million  after -tax
93

or $0.09  per share), respecti vely, in conjunction with our 2014 Productivity Plan. All of these charges were recorded in selling,
general and administrative expenses and primarily relate to severance and other employee-related costs, asset impairments (all non-
cash), and other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives, including contract termination costs. Substantially all of
the restructuring accrual at December 30, 2017  is expected to be paid by the end of 2018 .

2012 Multi-Y ear Productivity Plan
The 2012 Productiv ity Plan, publicly announced on February 9, 2012, include d actions in every aspect of our business that we
believe would strengthen our complementary food, snack and beverage businesses.
In 2015 , we incurred restructuring charges of $61 million  ($50 million  after-tax or $0.03  per share) in conju nction with our 2012
Productivity Plan. All of these charges were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and primarily related to
severance and other employee-related costs, asset impairments (all non-cash) and contract termination costs. The 2012 Productivity
Plan was completed in 2016 and all cash payments were paid by the end of 2016.

Other Productivity Initiatives
There were no mate rial charges related to other productivity and efficiency initiatives outside the scope of the 2014 and 2012
Productivity Plans in 2017 and 2016. In 2015, we incurred charges of $90 million  ($66 million  after-tax or $0.04  per share)  related
to other productivity and efficiency initiatives outside the scope of the 2014 and 2012 Productivity Plans. These charges were
recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and primarily reflect severance and other employee-related costs and asset
impairments (all non-cash). These initiatives were not included in items af fecting comparability .
We regularly evaluate dif ferent productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plans and other initiatives described above.

Table of Contents
Depreciable and amortizable assets are evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic
environment. In these circumstances, if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written
down to its estimat ed fair value, which is based on discounted future cash flows. Useful lives are periodically evaluated to
determine whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate the need for revision. For additional unaudited
information on our policies for amorti zable brands, see “Our Critical Accounting Policies” in Management’ s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Nonamortizable Intangible Assets
We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in each of the fiscal years ended December 30, 2017 , December 31,
2016  and December 26, 2015 . We recognized no material impairmen t charges for nonamortizable intangible assets in each of the
fiscal years ended December 30, 2017 , December 31, 2016  and December 26, 2015 . As of December 30, 2017 , the estimated fair
values of our indefinite-lived reacquired and acquired franchise rights recorded at NAB exceeded their carrying values. However ,
there could be an impairment of the carrying value of NAB’ s reacquired and acquired franchise rights if future revenues and their
contribution to the operating results of NAB’ s CSD business do not achieve our expected future cash flows or if macroeconomic
conditions result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value. We have also analyzed the
impact of the macroeconomic condition s in Russia and Brazil on the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in
these countries and have concluded that there is no impairment as of December 30, 2017 . However , there could be an impairment
of the carrying value of certain brands in these countries if there is a deteriorat ion in these conditions, if future revenues and their
contributions to the operating results do not achieve our expected future cash flows or if macroeconomic conditions result in a
future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value. For additional information on our policies for
nonamortizable intangible assets, see Note 2.

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States . Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed
a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from
35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the enactment of the TCJ Act, we recognized a provisional net tax expense of
$2.5 billion  in the fourth quarter of 2017. See further unaudited information in “Items Affecting Comparability” in Management’ s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
Included in the provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion  is a provisional mandatory one-time transition tax of approximately $4
billion  on undist ributed international earnings, included in other liabilities. This provis ional mandatory one-time transition tax was
partially offset by a provisional $1.5 billion  benefit resulting from the required remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and
liabilities to the new, lower U.S. corporate income tax rate, effective January 1, 2018. The effect of the remeasurement was
recorded in the fourt h quarter of 2017, consistent with the enactment date of the TCJ Act, and reflected in our provision for income
taxes.
99
Table of Contents
The TCJ Act also creates a new requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries, known as GILTI, must be included
in the gross income of their U.S. shareh older . The FASB allows an accounting policy election of either recognizing deferred taxes
for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or recognizing such taxes as a current-period expense when
incurred. Due to the complexity of calculating GILTI under the new law, we have not determined which method we will apply .
Therefore, we have not made any adjustments related to potential GILTI tax in our financial statements. We expect to elect an
accounting policy in the first quarter of 2018.
The components of the provisional net tax expense recorded in 2017 are based on currently available information and additional
information needs to be prepared, obtai ned and/or analyzed to determine the final amounts. The provisional tax expense for the
mandatory repatriation of undistributed international earnings will require further analysis of certain foreign exchange gains or
losses, substantiation of foreign tax credits, as well as estimated cash and cash equivalents as of November 30, 2018, the tax year-
end of our foreign subsidiaries. The provisional tax benefit for the remeasurement of deferred taxes will require additional
information necessa ry for the preparatio n of our U.S. federal tax return, and further analysis and interpretation of certain provisions
of the TCJ Act impa cting deferred taxes, for example 100% expensing of qualif ied assets as well as our accounting policy election
for recognizing deferred taxes for GIL TI, could impact our deferred tax balance as of December 30, 2017.
Tax effects for these items will be recorded in subsequent quarters, as discre te adjustments to our income tax provision, once
complete. The SEC has issued guidance  that allows for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the TCJ
Act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. We currently anticipate finalizing and recording any resulting adjustments
by the end of 2018.
The recorded impact of the TCJ Act is provisional and the final amount may differ, possibly materially , due to, among other things,
changes in estimates , interpretations and assumptions we have made, changes in IRS interpretations, the issuance of new guidance,
legislative actions, changes in accounting standards or related interpretations in response to the TCJ Act and future actions by states
within the United States that have not currently adopted the TCJ Act.

Business Risks,” “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Our Critical Accounting Policies” in Management’ s Discussion and

Reserves
A number  of years may elapse before a particular matter , for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved.
The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdictions and the related
open tax audits are as follows:
Jurisdiction  Years Open to Audit  Years Currently Under
Audit
United States  2012-2016  2012-2013
Mexico  2014-2016  2014
United Kingdom  2014-2016  None
Canada (Domestic)  2013-2016  2013-2014
Canada (International)  2010-2016  2010-2014
Russia  2012-2016  2012-2016
While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter , we believe that our
reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light
of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any
101
Table of Contents
particular issue would usually require the use of cash. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax
rate in the year of resolution. For further unaudited information on the impac t of the resolution of open tax issues, see “Other
Consolidated Results” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
In 2015, we reached  an agreement with the IRS resolving substantially all open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2010
and 201 1. The agreement resulted in a 2015 non-cash tax benefit totaling $230 million .
As of December 30, 2017 , the total gross amount of reserves for income taxes, reported in other liabilities, was $2.2 billion . We
accrue interest related to reserves for income taxes in our provision for income  taxes and any associated penalties are recorded in
selling, general and administrative expenses. The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $283 million  as
of December 30, 2017 , of which  $89 million  of expense was recognized in 2017 . The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in
other liabilities, was $193 million  as of December 31, 2016 , of which $61 million  of expense was recognized in 2016 .
A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits, is as follows:
 2017  2016

Balance, end of year $ 2,212  $ 1,885
Carryforwards and Allowances
Operating loss carryforwards totaling $12.6 billion  at year-end 2017  are being carried forward in a number of foreign and state
jurisdictions where we are permitted to use tax operating losses from prior periods to reduce future taxable income. These operating
losses will expire as follows: $0.2 billion  in 2018 , $11.1 billion  between 2019  and 2037 and $1.3 billion  may be carried forward
indefinitely . We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than
not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Undistributed International Earnings
As of December 30, 2017 , we had approximately $42.5 billion  of undistributed international earnings. We intend to repatriate
approximately $20 billion  of our foreign earnings back to the United States and have recognized all tax expense on these earnings
in the fourth quarter of 2017. We intend to continue to reinvest the remaining $22.5 billion  of earnings outside the United States for
the foreseeable future and while U.S. federal tax expense has been recognized as a result of the TCJ Act, no deferred tax liabilities
with respe ct to items such as certain foreign exchange gains or losses, foreign withholding taxes or state taxes have been
recognized. It is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecogn ized tax expense on these reinvested international
earnings.
Note 6 — Shar e-Based Compensation
Our share-based compensation program is designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees’ interests with
the interes ts of our shareholders. Peps iCo has granted stock options, RSUs , PSUs, PEPunits and long-term cash awards to
employees under the shareholder -approved PepsiCo, Inc. Long-T erm
102
Table of Contents
Incentive Plan (LTIP). Executives who are awarded long-term incentives based on their performance may generally elect to receive
their grant in the form of stock options or RSUs, or a combination thereof. Executives who elect stock options receive four stock
options for every one RSU that would have otherwise been granted. Certain executive officers and other senior executives do not
have a choice and, beginning in 2016 , were granted 66% PSUs and 34% long-term  cash, each of which are subject to pre-
established performance targets. Previo usly, they were granted a combination of 60% PEPunits  measuring both absolute and
relative stock price performance and 40% long-term cash based on achievement of specific performance operating metrics.
The Company may use authorized and unissued shares to meet share requirements resulting from the exercise of stock options and
the vesting of RSUs, PSUs and PEPunits.
As of December 30, 2017 , 74 million  shares were available for future share-based compensation grants under the L TIP.
The following table summarizes our total share-based compensation expense:

As of December 30, 2017 , there was $314 million  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based
compensation grants. This unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of two
years.
Method of Accounting and Our Assumptions
The fair value of share-based award grants is amortized to expense over the vesting period, primarily three  years. Awards to
employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are amortized to expense over the period through the
date that the employ ee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award. In addition, we
use histori cal data to estimate forfeiture rates and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected
to vest.
We do not backdate, reprice or grant share-based compensation awards retroactively . Repricing of awards would require
shareholder approval under the L TIP.
Stock Options
A stock option perm its the holder to purchase shares of PepsiCo common stock  at a specified price. We account for our employee
stock options under the fair value metho d of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock option expense at
the date of grant. All stock option grant s have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of
grant and generally have a 10-year term.

The expec ted life is the period over which our employee groups are expected  to hold their options. It is based on our historical
experience with similar grants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the expected U.S. Treasury rate over the expected life.
Volatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent historica l period equivalent to the expected life. Dividend
yield is estimated over the expected life based on our stated dividend policy and forecasts of net income, share repurchases and
stock price.

Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units
Each RSU represents our obligation to deliver to the holder one share of PepsiC o common stock when the award vests at the end
of the service period . PSUs are awards pursuant to which a number of shares are delivered to the holder upon vesting at the end of
the service period based on PepsiCo’ s performance against specified financial and/or operational performance metrics. The number
of shares may be increased to the maximum or reduced to the minimum threshold based on the results of these performance
metrics in accordance with the terms established at the time of the award. During the vesting period, RSUs and PSUs accrue
dividend equivalents that pay out in cash (without interest) if and when the applicable RSU or PSU vests and becomes payable.
The fair value of RSUs is measured at the market price of the Company’ s stock on the date of grant. The fair value of PSUs is
measured at the market price of the Company’ s stock on the date of grant with the exception of awards with market conditions, for
which we use the Monte-Carlo simulat ion model to determine the fair value. The Monte-Carlo simulation model uses the same
input assumptions as the Black-Scholes model; however , it also further incorporates into the fair-value determination the
possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Compensation costs related to these awards are recognized regardless of
whether the market condition is satisfied, provided that the requisite service has been provided.

Note 7 — Pension, Retir ee Medical and Savings Plans
Effective January 1, 2017, the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans were  reorganized into Plan A and Plan I. Actuarial gains
and losses associated with Plan A are amortized over the average remaining service

Table of Contents
life of the active participants, while the actuarial gains and losses associated with Plan I are amortized over the remaining life
expectancy of the inactive participants. As a result of this change, the pre-tax net periodic benefit cost decreased by $42
million  ($27 million  after-tax, reflecting tax rates effective for the 2017 tax year, or $0.02 per share) in 2017, primarily impacting
corporate unallocated expenses. See “Our Critical Accounting Policies” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.
In 2016, the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans purchased a group annuity contract whereby an unrelated insurance
company assumed the obligation to pay and administer future annuity payments  for certain retirees. In 2016, we made discretionary
contributions of $452 million  primarily to fund the transfer of the obligation. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge
of $242 million  ($162 million  after-tax or $0.11 per share). See additional unaudite d information in “Items Affecting
Comparability” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Effective as of the beginning of 2016, we prospectively changed the method  we use to estimate the service and interest cost
components of net periodic benefit cost. The pre-tax reduction in net periodic benefit cost associated with this change in 2016 was
$125 million  ($81 million  after-tax or $0.06  per share). See “Our Critical Accounting Policies” in Management’ s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further unaudited information on this change in accounting estimate.
Gains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions, including the difference between the actual
return on plan assets and the expected  return on plan assets, as well as changes in our assumptions, are determined at each
measurement date. These differences are recognized as a component of net gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss. If
this net accumulated  gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the market-rela ted value of plan assets or plan liabilities, a portion
of the net gain or loss is included in expense for the following year based upon the average remaining service life for participants in
Plan A (approximately 11 years) and retiree medical (approximat ely 7 years), or the rema ining life expectancy for participants in
Plan I (approximately 27 years). The cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service
(prior service (credit)/cost) is included in earnings on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service life for participants in
Plan A or the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I.
We regularly evaluate dif ferent opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans.

•Service cost is the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year .
•Interest cost is the accrued interest on the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time.
108
Table of Contents
•Expected return on plan assets is the long-term return we expect to earn on plan investments for our funded plans that will
be used to settle future benefit obligations.
•Amortization of prior service cost/(cred it) represents the recognition in the income statement of benefit changes resulting
from plan amendments.
•Amortization of net loss/(gain) represents the recognition in the income statement of changes in the amount of plan assets
and the projected benefit obligation based on changes in assumptions and actual experience.
•Settlement/curtailment loss/(gain) represents the result of actions that effectively eliminate all or a portion of related
projected benefit obligations. Settlements are triggered when payouts to settle the projected benefit obligation of a plan due
to lump sums or other events exceed the annual service and interest cost. Settlements are recognized when actions are
irrevocable and we are relieved of the primary responsibility and risk for project ed benefit obligations. Curtailments are due
to events such as plant closures or the sale of a business resulting in a reduction of future service or benefits. Curtailment
losses are recognized when an event is probable and estimable, while curtailme nt gains are recognized when an event has
occurred (when the related employees terminate or an amendment is adopted).
•Special termination benefits are the additional benefits offered to employees upon departure due to actions such as
restructuring.

Total $ 164 $ 659 $ 162 $ 56 $ 36 $ 43
(a) Includes $ 452 million  in 2016 relating to the funding of the group annuity contract purchase from an unrelated insurance company .
In February 2018, we received approval from our Board of Directors to make discretionary contributions of $1.4 billion  to Plan A
in the United States that we intend to invest in fixed income securities. As of February 13, 2018, we contributed $750 million  of the
approved amount; we expect to contribute the remaining $650 million  in the first quarter of 2018. These contributions are reflected
in our 2018 long-term expected rate of return on plan assets and target investm ent allocations. In addition, in 2018, we expect to
make non-discretion ary contributions of approximately $175 million to our U.S. and international plans for pension benefits and
approximately $ 75 million  for retiree medical benefits.
Plan Assets
Our pension plan investment strategy includes the use of actively managed accounts and is reviewed periodically in conjunction
with plan liabilities , an evaluation of market conditions, tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments. This
strategy is also applicable to funds held for the retiree medical plans. Our investment objective includes ensuring that funds are
available to meet the plans’ benefit obligations when they become due. Asse ts contributed to our pension plans are no longer
controlled by us, but become the property of our individual pension plans. Howe ver, we are indirectly impacted by changes in these
plan assets  as compared to changes in our projected liabilities. Our overall investment policy is to prudently invest plan assets in a
well-diversified portfolio of equity and high-quality debt securities and real estate to achieve our long-term return expectations. Our
investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments, such as futures and forward contracts, to reduce interest rate and
foreign currency risks. Futures contract s represent commitments to purchase or sell securities at a future date and at a specified
price. Forward contracts consist of currency forwards.
For 2018  and 2017 , our expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 7.2%  and 7.5% , respectively . Our target investment
allocations for U.S. plan assets are as follows:
 2018 2017
Fixed income 47% 40%
U.S. equity 29% 33%
International equity 20% 22%
Real estate 4% 5%
Actual investment allocations may vary from our target investment allocations due to prevailing market conditions. We regularly
review our actual investment allocations and periodically rebalance our investments.
The expected return on plan assets is based on our investment strategy and our expectations for long-term rates of return by asset
class, takin g into account volatility and correlation among asset classes and our historical experience. We also review current levels
of interest  rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of the long-term rates. We evaluate our expected return assumptions
annually to ensure that they are reasonable. To calculate the expected return on plan assets, our market-related value of assets for
fixed income is the actual fair value. For all other asset categories, such as equity securities, we use a method that recognizes
111
Table of Contents
investment gains or losses (the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets) over
a five-year period. This has the ef fect of reducing year -to-year volatility .

Savings Plan
Certain U.S. employees are eligible to participate in 401(k) savings plans, which are voluntary defined contribution plans. The
plans are designed to help employees accumulate additional savings for retirement, and we make Company matching contributions
for certain employees on a portion of eligible pay based on years of service.
Certain U.S. salaried  employees, who are not eligible to participate in a defined  benefit pension plan, are also eligible to receive an
employer contribution to the 401(k) savings plan based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution.
In 2017 , 2016  and 2015 , our total Company contributions were $176 million , $164 million  and $148 million , respectively .

(b) These notes, issued in Canadian dollars, were designated as a net investment hedge to partially offset the effects of foreign currency on our investments in certain of our
foreign subsidiaries.
The net proceeds from the issuances of the above notes were used for gener al corporate purposes, including the repayment of
commercial paper .
In 2017 , we entered into a new five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement (Five-Y ear Credit Agreement) which expires on
June 5, 2022. The Five-Y ear Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $3.75 billion , subject to
customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $4.5 billion .
Additionally , we may , once a year , request renewal of the agreement for an additional one-year period.
114
Table of Contents
Also in 2017 , we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement) which expires on
June 4, 2018. The 364-Day Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $3.75 billion , subject to
customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $4.5 billion . We may
request renewal of this facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of
up to one year, which would mature no later than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. The Five-Y ear Credit
Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement together replaced our $3.7225 billion  five-year credit agreement and our $3.7225
billion  364-day credit agreement both dated as of June 6, 2016. Funds borrowed under the Five-Y ear Credit Agreement and the
364-Day Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. Subject to certain conditions, we may borrow , prepay and
reborrow amounts under these agreements. As of December 30, 2017 , there were no outstanding borrowings under the Five-Y ear
Credit Agreement or the 364-Day Credit Agreement.
In 2016, we paid $2.5 billion  to redeem all of our outstanding 7.900%  senior notes due 2018 and 5.125%  senior notes due 2019 for
the principal amounts of $1.5 billion  and $750 million , respectively , and terminated certain interest rate swaps. As a result, we
recorded a pre-tax charge of $233 million  ($156 million  after-tax or $0.11 per share) to interest expense, primarily representing the
premium paid in accordance with the “make-whole” redemption provisions. See further unaudited information in “Items Affecting
Comparability” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
In addition, as of December 30, 2017 , our international debt of $73 million  was related to borrowings from external parties
including various lines of credit. These lines of credit are subject to normal banking terms and conditions and are fully committed
at least to the extent of our borrowings.
See “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations for further unaudited information on our borrowings and long-term contractual commitments.
Note 9 — Financial Instruments
Derivatives and Hedging
We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:
•commodity prices, af fecting the cost of our raw materials and ener gy;
•foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and
•interest rates.
In the normal cours e of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of
strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the
identification and effective implementat ion of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives.
Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements.
Our hedging strategies include the use of derivatives and, in the case of our net investment hedges, debt instruments. Certain
derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, while others do not
qualify and are marked to market through earnings. Cash flows from deriv atives used to manage commodity price, foreign
exchange or interest rate risks are class ified as operating activities in the cash flow statement. We classify both the earnings and
cash flow impact from these derivatives consistent with the underlying hedged item. See “Our Business Risks” in Management’ s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further unaudited information on our business risks.
115
Table of Contents
We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We perform assessments of our counterparty credit risk
regularly , including reviewing netting agreements, if any, and a review of credit ratings, credit default swap rates and potential
nonperformance of the counterparty . Based on our most recent assessment of our counterparty credit risk, we consider this risk to
be low. In addition,  we enter into derivative contracts with a variety of financial institutions that we believe are creditworthy in
order to reduce our concentration of credit risk.
Commodity Prices
We are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increased  costs through higher pricing may be limited in the
competitive environment in which we operate. This risk is managed through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders,
pricing agreements and derivative instruments, which include swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw
materials is mitigated through purchases  from multiple geographies and suppliers. We use derivatives, with terms of no more than
three  years, to economically hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases, primarily for
agricultural products, energy and metals . Ineffectiveness for those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting treatment was not
material for all periods presented. Derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that do not qualify for hedge accounting
treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either
cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity . These gains and losses are
subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.
Our commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $0.9 billion  as of December 30, 2017  and $0.8 billion  as of December 31,
2016 .
Foreign Exchange
Our operations outside of the United States generated 42% of our net revenue in 2017 , with Mexico, Russia, Canada, the United
Kingdom and Brazil  comprising approximately 20% of our net revenue in 2017 . As a result, we are exposed to foreign  exchange
risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold.
Additionally , we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases and
foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. We manage this risk through sourcing purchases
from local  suppliers, negotiating contracts in local currencies with foreign suppliers and through the use of derivatives, primarily
forward contracts with terms of no more than two years. Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are
recognized as transaction gains or losses  in our income statement as incurred. We also use net investment hedges to partially offset
the ef fects of foreign currency on our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.
Our foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $1.6 billion  as of December 30, 2017  and December 31, 2016 . The
total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $1.5 billion  as of December 30, 2017  and
$0.8 billion  as of December 31, 2016 . Ineffectiveness for derivatives and non-derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting
treatment was not material for all periods presented. For foreign currency derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting
treatment, all gains and losses were offset by changes in the underlying hedged items, resulting in no material net impact on
earnings.
Inter est Rates
We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investm ent opportunities and risks, tax consequences and
overall financing strategies. W e use various interest rate derivative instruments including,
116
Table of Contents
but not limited to, interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, Treasury locks and swap locks to manage our overall
interest expense and foreign exchange risk. These instruments effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt
issuances. Certain of our fixed rate indebtedness have been swapped to floating  rates. The notional amount, interest payment and
maturity date of the interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of
the related  debt. Our Treasury locks and swap locks are entered into to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to
forecasted debt transactions.
Our interest rate derivatives had a total notional value of $14.2 billion  as of December 30, 2017  and $11.2 billion  as of
December 31, 2016 . Ineffectiveness for derivatives that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment was not material for all
periods presented.
As of December 30, 2017 , approximately 43% of total debt, after the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments, was
subject to variable rates, compared to approximately 38% as of December 31, 2016 .
Available-for-Sale Securities
Investments in debt and marketable equity securities, other than investments accounted for under the equity method, are classified
as available-for -sale . All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less are classified as cash
equivalents. Our investments in available-for -sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to
changes in the fair value of available-for -sale securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common
shareholders’ equity . Unrealized gains and losses on our investments in debt securities as of December 30, 2017  were  not material.
In 2017, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $95 million  ($85 million  after-tax or $0.06  per share), net of discount and fees, associated
with the sale of our minority stake in Britvic. This gain was recorded in our ESSA segment in selling, general and administrative
expenses. The pre-tax unrealized gain on these available-for -sale equity securities was $72 million  as of December 31, 2016 . See
Note 2 for additional information on investments in certain equity securities.
Changes in the fair value of available-for -sale securities impact net income only when such securities are sold or an other -than-
temporary impairment is recognized. We regularly review our investment portfolio to determine if any security is other -than-
temporarily impaired . In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of
a security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and our intent to sell, or whether we
will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Our assessment of whether a
security is other -than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related
to any particular security . We recorded no other -than-temporary impairment charges on our available-for -sale securities for the
years ended December 30, 2017 , December 31, 2016  and December 26, 2015 .
Tingyi-Asahi Beverages Holding Co. Ltd.
During 2016, we concluded that the decline in estimated fair value of our 5% indirect equity interest in TAB was other than
temporary based on significant negative economic trends in China and changes in assumptions associated with TAB’s future
financial performance arising from the disclosure by TAB’s parent company , Tingyi, regarding the operating results of its beverage
business. As a result, we recorded a pre- and after-tax impairment charge of $373 million  ($0.26  per share)  in 2016 in the AMENA
segment. This charge was recorded in selling, general and administrative expen ses in our income statement and reduced the value
of our 5% indirect equity interest in TAB to its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value was derived using both an income and
market approach, and is considered a non-recurring Level 3 measurement within  the fair value hierarchy . The carrying value of the
investment in T AB was $166 million  as of December 30, 2017
117
Table of Contents
and December 31, 2016 . We conti nue to monitor the impact of economic and other developments on the remaining value of our
investment in T AB.
In connection with our transaction with Tingyi in 2012, we received a call option to increase our holding in TAB to 20% with an
expiration date in 2015. Prior to its expiration, we concluded that the probability of exercising the option was remote and,
accordingly , we recorded a pre- and after-tax charge of $73 million  ($0.05  per share) to write off the recorded value of this call
option in 2015.

We are committed to providing timely , accurate and understandable informatio n to investors. Our commitment encompasses the

Report of Independent Register ed Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
PepsiCo, Inc.:
Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Contr ol over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash
Flows, and Equity for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 30, 2017 and the related notes (collectively ,
the “consolidated financial statements”). W e also have audited the Company’ s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 30, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Or ganizations of the T readway Commission.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly , in all material respects, the financial position
of the Company as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 30, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, ef fective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 30, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Or ganizations of the T readway Commission.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’ s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining ef fective internal control
over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the ef fectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management’ s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
the Company’ s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’ s internal control over financial reporting based
on our audits. W e are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and
the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement,
whether due to error or fraud, and whether ef fective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of
the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating ef fectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. W e believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Contr ol over Financial Reporting
A company’ s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’ s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’ s assets that
could have a material ef fect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of ef fectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures.  As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of
the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-1 5(e) of the Securities Exchan ge Act of 1934, as amended (the Exch ange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief

the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange
Commission rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Of ficer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
(b) Management’ s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Our mana gement is responsible for establishing
and maint aining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon criteria
established in Internal Contr ol – Integrated Framework  (2013) by the Com mittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective
as of December 30, 2017 .
Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm . KPM G LLP, an independent registered  public accounting firm, has
audited the consolidated financial statem ents included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued
their report, included herein, on the ef fectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Ther e were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
during our fourth fiscal quarter of 2017  that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.
During our fourth fiscal quarter of 2017 , we continued migrating certain of our financial processing systems to an enterprise-wide
systems solution. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business transformation initiative, and we plan to
continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesse s. In connection with these implementations and
resulting business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of our internal control over financial
reporting processes to maintain ef fective controls over our financial reporting. This transition has not materially af fected, and we do
not expect it to materially af fect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ARTICLE I
INTRODUCTION
PepsiCo, Inc. (the “Company”) established the PepsiCo Executive Income Deferral Program in 1972 to permit eligible
executives to defer certain cash awards made under its executive compensation programs. Subsequently, the PepsiCo
Executive Income Deferral Program (the “Plan”) was expanded to permit eligible executives to defer base pay, certain other
categories of executive compensation and gains on Performance Share Stock Options.
Except as otherwise provided, this document sets forth the terms of the Plan as in effect on July 1, 1997. As of that
date, it specifies the group of executives of the Company and certain affiliated employers eligible to make deferrals, the
procedures for electing to defer compensation and the Plan’s provisions for maintaining and paying out amounts that have
been deferred. Additional provisions applicable to certain executives are set forth in the Appendix, which modifies and
supplements the general provisions of the Plan.
Deferrals under the Plan that were earned and vested on or before December 31, 2004 are governed by a set of
documents (which includes this document) that set forth the pre-Section 409A terms of the Plan (the “Pre-409A Program”).
The terms of the Plan that are applicable to deferrals that are subject to Section 409A, i.e., generally, deferred amounts that are
earned or vested after December 31, 2004 (the “409A Program”) are governed by a separate document. This document sets
forth the terms of the Pre-409A Program as in effect on July 1, 1997 with revisions through December 20, 2017, while terms
in effect prior to July 1, 1997 are governed by other Pre-409A Program documents. Alternatively, the 409A Program
document reflects the provisions in effect from and after January 1, 2005, and the rights and benefits of individuals who are
participants in the Plan from and after that date (and of those claiming through or on behalf of such individuals) shall be
governed by the provisions of the 409A Program document and not the Pre-409A Program documents in the case of actions
and events occurring on or after January 1, 2005 with respect to deferrals that are subject to the 409A Program. For purposes
of the preceding sentence, the term “actions and events” shall include all distribution trigger events and dates. The rights and
benefits with respect to persons who only participated in the Plan prior to January 1, 2005 shall be governed by this document
and the other applicable provisions of the Pre-409A Program documents that were in effect at such time, and shall not be
governed by the 409A Program documents.
Together, the documents for the 409A Program and the documents for the Pre-409A Program describe the terms of a
single plan. However, amounts subject to the terms of the 409A Program and amounts subject to the terms of the Pre-409A
Program shall be tracked separately at all times. The preservation of the terms of the Pre-409A Program, without material
modification, and the separation between the 409A Program amounts and the
1
Pre-409A Program amounts are intended to permit the Pre-409A Program to remain exempt from Section 409A, and the
administration of the Plan shall be consistent with this intent.
The Plan is unfunded and unsecured. Amounts deferred by an executive are an obligation of that executive’s individual
employer. With respect to his employer, the executive has the rights of a general creditor.
2
ARTICLE II
DEFINITIONS
When used in this Plan, the following underlined terms shall have the meanings set forth below unless a different
meaning is plainly required by the context:
2.1 Account: The account maintained for a Participant on the books of his Employer to determine, from time to time,
the Participant's interest under this Plan. The balance in such Account shall be determined by the Plan Administrator. Each
Participant's Account shall consist of at least one Deferral Subaccount for each separate deferral under Section 3.2. In
accordance with Section 4.3, some or all of a separate deferral may be held in a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount. The Plan
Administrator may also establish such additional subaccounts as it deems necessary for the proper administration of the Plan.
Where appropriate, a reference to a Participant’s Account shall include a reference to each applicable subaccount that has been
established thereunder.
2.2 Base Compensation: An eligible Employee’s adjusted base salary, as determined by the Plan Administrator and to
the extent paid in U.S. dollars from an Employer’s U.S. payroll. For any applicable payroll period, an eligible Employee’s
adjusted base salary shall be determined after reductions for applicable tax withholdings, Employee authorized deductions
(including deductions for SaveUp, Benefits Plus and charitable donations), tax levies, garnishments and such other amounts as
the Plan Administrator recognizes as reducing the amount of base salary available for deferral.
2.3 Beneficiary: The person or persons (including a trust or trusts) properly designated by a Participant, as determined
by the Plan Administrator, to receive the amounts in one or more of the Participant’s subaccounts in the event of the
Participant's death. To be effective, any Beneficiary designation must be in writing, signed by the Participant, and filed with
the Plan Administrator prior to the Participant’s death, and it must meet such other standards as the Plan Administrator shall
require from time to time. If no designation is in effect at the time of a Participant's death or if all designated Beneficiaries
have predeceased the Participant, then the Participant’s Beneficiary shall be his estate. A Beneficiary designation of an
individual by name (or name and relationship) remains in effect regardless of any change in the designated individual’s
relationship to the Participant. A Beneficiary designation solely by relationship (for example, a designation of “spouse,” that
does not give the name of the spouse) shall designate whoever is the person in that relationship to the Participant at his death.
An individual who is otherwise a Beneficiary with respect to a Participant’s Account ceases to be a Beneficiary when all
payments have been made from the Account.
2.4 Bonus Compensation: An eligible Employee’s adjusted annual incentive award under his Employer’s annual
incentive plan or the Executive Incentive Compensation Plan, as determined and adjusted by the Plan Administrator and to the
extent paid in U.S. dollars
3
from an Employer’s U.S. payroll. An eligible Employee’s annual incentive awards shall be adjusted to reduce them for
applicable tax withholdings, Employee authorized deductions (including deductions for SaveUp, Benefits Plus and charitable
donations), tax levies, garnishments and such other amounts as the Plan Administrator recognizes as reducing the amount of
such awards available for deferral.
2.5 Code: The Internal Revenue Code, as amended.
2.6 Company: PepsiCo, Inc., a North Carolina corporation, or its successor or successors.
2.7 Deferral Subaccount: A subaccount of a Participant'’s Account maintained to reflect his interest in the Plan
attributable to each deferral of Base Compensation, Bonus Compensation, Performance Unit Payout and Stock Option Gains,
respectively, and earnings or losses credited to such subaccount in accordance with Section 4.1(b).
2.8 Disability: A Participant who is entitled to receive benefits under the PepsiCo Long Term Disability Plan shall be
deemed to suffer from a disability. Participants who are not eligible to participate in the PepsiCo Long Term Disability Plan
shall be deemed to suffer to from a disability if, in the judgment of the Plan Administrator, they satisfy the standards for
disability under the PepsiCo Long Term Disability Plan.
2.9 Effective Date: July 1, 1997.
2.10 Election Form: The form prescribed by the Plan Administrator on which a Participant specifies the amount of his
Base Compensation, Bonus Compensation, Performance Unit Payout or Stock Option Gains to be deferred pursuant to the
provisions of Article III.
2.11 Employee: Any person in a salaried classification of an Employer who (i) is receiving remuneration for personal
services rendered in the employment of the Employer, (ii) is either a United States citizen or a resident alien lawfully admitted
for permanent residence in the United States, and (iii) is paid in U.S. dollars from the Employer’s U.S. payroll.
2.12 Employer: Each division of the Company and each of the Company’s subsidiaries and affiliates that is currently
designated as an Employer by the Plan Administrator.
2.13 ERISA: The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.
2.14 Fair Market Value: For purposes of converting a Participant’s deferrals to PepsiCo Capital Stock as of any date,
the Fair Market Value of PepsiCo Capital Stock is determined as the average of the high and low price on such date for
PepsiCo Capital Stock
4
as reported on the principal exchange on which PepsiCo Capital Stock is traded as of the time in question, rounded to four
decimal places. For purposes of determining the value of a Plan distribution or for reallocating amounts between phantom
investment options under the Plan, the Fair Market Value of PepsiCo Capital Stock is determined as the closing price on the
applicable Valuation Date (identified based on the Plan Administrator’s current procedures) for PepsiCo Capital Stock, as
reported on the principal exchange on which PepsiCo Capital Stock is traded as of the time in question, rounded to four
decimal places.
2.15 Participant: Any Employee eligible pursuant to Section 3.1 who has satisfied the requirements for participation in
this Plan and who has an Account. A Participant includes any individual who deferred compensation prior to the Effective
Date and for whom any Employer maintains on its books an Account for such deferred compensation as of the Effective Date.
An active Participant is one who is currently deferring under Section 3.2.
2.16 Performance Unit Payout: The adjusted performance unit award payable to an Employee under the Company’s
Long Term Incentive Plan during a Plan Year, to the extent paid in U.S. dollars from an Employer’s U.S. payroll. An eligible
Employee’s performance unit award shall be adjusted to reduce it for applicable tax withholdings, Employee authorized
deductions, tax levies, garnishments and such other amounts as the Plan Administrator recognizes as reducing the amount of
such awards available for deferral.
2.17 Plan: The PepsiCo Executive Income Deferral Program, the plan set forth herein and in the 409A Program
document, as it may be amended and restated from time to time (subject to the limitations on amendment that are applicable
hereunder and under the 409A Program). The portion of the Plan that governs deferrals that are subject to Section 409A is
referred to as the “409A Program,” while the portion of the Plan that governs deferrals that are not subject to Section 409A,
which includes this document, is referred to as the “Pre-409A Program.”
2.18 Plan Administrator: The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company or its delegate or
delegates.
2.19 Plan Year: The 12-month period from January 1 to December 31.
2.20 Retirement: Termination of service with the Company and its affiliates after attaining eligibility for retirement. A
Participant attains eligibility for retirement when he attains at least age 55 with 10 or more years of service, or at least age 65
with 5 or more years of service (whichever occurs earliest) while in the employment of the Company or its affiliates. A
Participant’s service is determined under the terms of the PepsiCo Salaried Employees Retirement Plan.
2.21 Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount: The subaccount provided for by Section 4.3 to contain the portion of each separate
deferral that is subject to forfeiture.
5
2.22 Section 409A: Section 409A of the Code and the applicable regulations and other guidance of general
applicability that are issued thereunder.
2.23 Stock Option Gains: The gains on an eligible Employee’s Performance Share Stock Options that are available for
deferral under the Plan pursuant to Section 3.3(c). With respect to any options that are made subject to a Stock Option Gain
deferral election, the gains on such options shall be determined through a sale of related shares by the Plan Administrator net
of: (i) the exercise price of the options, (ii) any transaction costs incurred when such gains are captured through the sale of
related shares, and (iii) any related taxes that the Plan Administrator determines will not otherwise be satisfied by the
Participant. For purposes of such sales, the Plan Administrator may aggregate shares related to the options of different
Participants, sell them over one or more days and divide the net proceeds from such aggregate sales between the Participants
in a reasonable manner. The Plan Administrator shall have absolute discretion with respect to the timing and aggregation of
such sales.
2.24 Termination of Employment: A Participant’s cessation of employment with the Company, all Employers and all
other Company subsidiaries and affiliates (as defined for this purpose by the Plan Administrator). For purposes of determining
forfeitures under Section 4.3 and distributing a Participant’s Account under Section 4.4, the following shall apply:
(a) A Participant does not have a Termination of Employment when the business unit or division of the
Company that employs him is sold if the Participant and substantially all employees of that entity continue to be
employed by the entity or its successor after the sale. A Participant also does not have a Termination of Employment
when the subsidiary of the Company that employs him is sold if: (i) the Participant continues to be employed by the
entity or its successor after the sale, and (ii) the Participant’s interest in the Plan continues to be carried as a liability by
that entity or its successor after the sale through a successor arrangement. In each case, the Participant’s Termination of
Employment shall occur upon the Participant’s post-sale termination of employment from such entity or its successor
(and their related organizations, as determined by the Plan Administrator).
(b) With respect to any individual deferral, the term “Termination of Employment” may encompass a
Participant’s death or death may be considered a separate event, depending upon the convention the Plan Administrator
follows with respect to such deferral.
2.25 Valuation Date: Each date as of which Participant Accounts are valued in accordance with procedures of the Plan
Administrator that are currently in effect. As of the Effective Date, the Valuation Dates are March 31, June 30, September 30
and December 31. Values are determined as of the close of a Valuation Date or, if such date is not a business day, as of the
close of the immediately preceding business day.
6
ARTICLE III
PARTICIPATION
3.1 Eligibility to Participate.
(a) An Employee shall be eligible to defer compensation under the Plan while employed by an Employer
at salary grade level 14 or above. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, from time to time the Plan Administrator
may modify, limit or expand the class of Employees eligible to defer hereunder, pursuant to criteria for eligibility that
need not be uniform among all or any group of Employees. During the period an individual satisfies all of the
eligibility requirements of this section, he shall be referred to as an eligible Employee.
(b) Each eligible Employee becomes an active Participant on the date an amount is first withheld from
his compensation pursuant to an Election Form submitted by the Employee to the Plan Administrator under Section
3.3.
(c) An individual’s eligibility to participate actively by making deferrals under Section 3.2 shall cease
upon the earlier of:
(1) The date he ceases to be an Employee who is employed by an Employer at salary grade level
14 or above; or
(2) The date the Employee ceases to be eligible under criteria described in the last sentence of
subsection (a) above.
(d) An individual, who has been an active Participant under the Plan, ceases to be a Participant on the
date his Account is fully paid out.
3.2 Deferral Election.
(a) Each eligible Employee may make an election to defer under the Plan any whole percentage (up to
100%) of his Base Compensation, Bonus Compensation, Performance Unit Payout or Stock Option Gains in the
manner described in Section 3.3. Any percentage of Base Compensation deferred by an eligible Employee for a Plan
Year will be deducted each pay period during the Plan Year for which he has Base Compensation and is an eligible
Employee. The percentage of Bonus Compensation or Performance Unit Payout deferred by an Eligible Employee for
a Plan Year will be deducted from his payment under the applicable compensation program at the time it would
otherwise be made, provided he remains an eligible Employee at such time. Any Stock Option Gains deferred by an
eligible Employee shall be captured as of the date or dates applicable for the
7
category of underlying options under procedures adopted by the Plan Administrator, provided that the Plan
Administrator determines the eligible Employee’s rights in such options may still be recognized at such time.
(b) To be effective, an Eligible Employee’s Election Form must set forth the percentage of Base
Compensation, Bonus Compensation or Performance Unit Payout to be deferred (or for a deferral of Stock Option
Gains, the specific options on which any gains are to be deferred), the investment choice under Section 4.1 (which
investment must be stated in multiples of 5 percent), the deferral period under Section 3.4, the eligible Employee’s
Beneficiary designation, and any other information that may be requested by the Plan Administrator from time to time.
In addition, the Election Form must meet the requirements of Section 3.3 below.
3.3 Time and Manner of Deferral Election.
(a) Deferrals of Base Compensation. Subject to the next two sentences, an eligible Employee
must make a deferral election for a Plan Year with respect to Base Compensation at least two months prior to the Plan
Year in which the Base Compensation would otherwise be paid. An individual who newly becomes an eligible
Employee during a Plan Year (or less than three months prior to a Plan Year) may make a deferral election with respect
to Base Compensation to be paid during the balance of the current Plan Year within 30 days of the date the individual
becomes an eligible Employee. Such an individual may also make an election at this time with respect to Base
Compensation to be paid during the next Plan Year.
(b) Deferrals of Bonuses and Performance Unit Payouts. Subject to the next sentence, an eligible
Employee must make a deferral election for a Plan Year with respect to his Bonus Compensation or Performance Unit
Payout at least six months prior to the Plan Year in which the Bonus Compensation or Performance Unit Payout would
otherwise be paid. An individual who newly becomes an eligible Employee may make a deferral election with respect
to his Bonus Compensation or Performance Unit Payout to be paid during the succeeding Plan Year later than the date
applicable under the previous sentence so long as the deferral election is made: (i) within 30 days of the date the
individual becomes an eligible Employee, and (ii) sufficiently prior to the first day of such succeeding Plan Year to
ensure, in the discretionary judgment of the Plan Administrator, that the amount to be deferred will not have been
constructively received (under all the facts and circumstances).
(c) Deferrals of Stock Option Gains. From time to time, the Plan Administrator shall notify eligible
Employees with outstanding Performance Share Options which options then qualify for deferral of their related Stock
Option Gains. An eligible Employee who has qualifying options must make a deferral election with respect to his
related Stock Option Gains at least 6 months before such qualifying options’ proposed capture date (as defined below)
or, if earlier, in the calendar year
8
preceding the year of the proposed capture date. The “proposed capture date” for a set of options shall be the earliest
date that the Plan Administrator would capture a Participant’s Stock Option Gains in accordance with the deferral
agreement prepared for such purpose by the Plan Administrator.
(d) General Provisions. A separate deferral election under (a), (b) or (c) above must be made by
an eligible Employee for each category of a Plan Year’s compensation that is eligible for deferral. If an eligible
Employee fails to file a properly completed and executed Election Form with the Plan Administrator by the prescribed
time, he will be deemed to have elected not to defer any Base Compensation, Bonus Compensation, Performance Unit
Payout or Stock Option Gains, as the case may be, for the applicable Plan Year. An election is irrevocable once
received and determined by the Plan Administrator to be properly completed. Increases or decreases in the amount or
percentage a Participant elects to defer shall not be permitted during a Plan Year. Notwithstanding the preceding three
sentences, to the extent necessary because of extraordinary circumstances, the Plan Administrator may grant an
extension of any election period and may permit (to the extent necessary to avoid undue hardship to an eligible
Employee) the complete revocation of an election with respect to future deferrals. Any such extension or revocation
shall be available only if the Plan Administrator determines that it shall not trigger constructive receipt of income and
is desirable for plan administration, and only upon such conditions as may be required by the Plan Administrator.
(e) Beneficiaries. A Participant designates on the Election Form a Beneficiary to receive payment
in the event of his death of amounts credited to his subaccount for such deferral. A Beneficiary is paid in accordance
with the terms of a Participant's Election Form, as interpreted by the Plan Administrator in accordance with the terms
of this Plan. At any time, a Participant may change a Beneficiary designation for any or all subaccounts in a writing
that is signed by the Participant and filed with the Plan Administrator prior to the Participant’s death, and that meets
such other standards as the Plan Administrator shall require from time to time.
3.4 Period of Deferral. An eligible Employee making a deferral election shall specify a deferral period on his
Election Form by designating a specific payout date, one or more specific payout events or both a date and one or more
specific events from the choices that are made available to the eligible Employee by the Plan Administrator. From time to time
in its discretion, the Plan Administrator may condition a Participant’s right to designate one or more specific payout events on
the Participant’s also specifying a payout date. Subject to the next sentence, an eligible Employee’s elected period of deferral
shall run until the earliest occurring date or event specified on his Election Form. Notwithstanding an eligible Employee’s
actual election, an eligible Employee shall be deemed to have elected a period of deferral of not less than:
9
(a) For Base Compensation, at least 6 months after the Plan Year during which the Base Compensation
would have been paid absent the deferral;
(b) For Bonus Compensation, at least 1 year after the date the Bonus Compensation would have been
paid absent the deferral;
(c) For Performance Unit Payouts, at least 1 year after the date the Performance Unit Payout would have
been paid absent the deferral; and
(d) For Stock Option Gains, at least 1 year after the date the Stock Option Gain is credited to a Deferral
Subaccount for the benefit of the Participant.
10
ARTICLE IV
INTERESTS OF PARTICIPANTS
4.1 Accounting for Participants’ Interests.
(a) Deferral Subaccounts. Each Participant shall have a separate Deferral Subaccount credited
with the amount of each separate deferral of Base Compensation, Bonus Compensation, Performance Unit Payout or
Stock Option Gains made by the Participant under this Plan. A Participant’s deferral shall be credited to his Account as
soon as practicable following the date when the deferral of compensation actually occurs, as determined by the Plan
Administrator. A Participant’s Account is a bookkeeping device to track the value of his deferrals (and his Employer’s
liability therefor). No assets shall be reserved or segregated in connection with any Account, and no Account shall be
insured or otherwise secured.
(b) Account Earnings or Losses. As of each Valuation Date, a Participant’s Account shall be
credited with earnings and gains (and shall be debited for expenses and losses) determined as if the amounts credited to
his Account had actually been invested as directed by the Participant in accordance with this section (as modified by
Section 4.3, if applicable). The Plan provides only for “phantom investments,” and therefore such earnings, gains,
expenses and losses are hypothetical and not actual. However, they shall be applied to measure the value of a
Participant’s Account and the amount of his Employer’s liability to make deferred payments to or on behalf of the
Participant.
    
(c) Investment Options. Each of a Participant’s Subaccounts (other than those containing
Stock Option Gains) shall be invested on a phantom basis in any combination of phantom investment options
specified by the Participant (or following the Participant’s death, by his Beneficiary) from those offered by the
Plan Administrator for this purpose from time to time. Subsection (e) below governs the phantom investment
options available for deferrals of Stock Option Gains. The Plan Administrator may discontinue any phantom
investment option with respect to some or all Accounts, and it may provide for shifting a Participant’s phantom
investment from the discontinued option to a specified replacement option (unless the Participant selects
another replacement option in accordance with such requirements as the Plan Administrator may apply). As of
the Effective Date, the phantom investment options are:
(1) Interest Bearing Account.
(i) Effective from and after December 29, 2006, Participant Accounts
invested in this phantom option accrue a return based upon an interest rate that is 120% of the applicable
Federal long-term rate
11
(pursuant to Code Section 1274(d) or any successor provision) applicable for annual compounding, as
published by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service from time to time. Returns accrue during the period since the
last V aluation Date based upon 120% of the applicable Federal long-term rate (applicable for annual
compounding) in ef fect on the first business day after such V aluation Date and are compounded annually . An
amount deferred or transferred into this option is credited with the applicable rate of return beginning with
the date as of which the amount is treated as invested in this option by the Plan Administrator .
(ii) Effective for periods ending on December 28, 2006, Participant
Accounts invested in this phantom option accrue a return based upon the prime rate of interest
announced from time to time by Citibank, N.A. (or another bank designated by the Plan Administrator
from time to time). Returns accrue during the period since the last Valuation Date based on the prime
rate in effect on the first business day after such Valuation Date and are compounded annually. An
amount deferred or transferred into this option is credited with the applicable rate of return beginning
with the date as of which the amount is treated as invested in this option by the Plan Administrator.
(iii) Amounts that are invested in the phantom option under clause (ii)
above at the end of the day on December 28, 2006 shall be transferred to the phantom investment option
under clause (i) above effective as of the beginning of the day on December 29, 2006, and thereafter the
phantom investment option under clause (ii) above shall be terminated.
(iv) For the periods during which the phantom investment options under
clauses (i) and (ii) above are in effect, such phantom investment options are the “default” option to the
extent a default option is needed in order to make certain a Participant’s Account is 100% invested.
(2) PepsiCo Capital Stock Account. Participant Accounts invested in this phantom
option are adjusted to reflect an investment in PepsiCo Capital Stock. An amount deferred or transferred into
this option is converted to phantom shares of PepsiCo Capital Stock of equivalent value by dividing such
amount by the Fair Market Value of a share of PepsiCo Capital Stock on the date as of which the amount is
treated as invested in this option by the Plan Administrator. Only whole shares are determined. Any remaining
amount (and all amounts that would be received by the Account as dividends, if dividends were paid on
phantom shares of PepsiCo Capital Stock as they are
12
on actual shares) are credited to a dividend subaccount that is invested in the phantom option in paragraph (1)
above (the Interest Bearing Account).
(i) A Participant’s interest in the PepsiCo Capital Stock Account is valued
as of a Valuation Date by multiplying the number of phantom shares credited to his Account on such
date by the Fair Market Value of a share of PepsiCo Capital Stock on such date, and then adding the
value of the Participant’s dividend subaccount.
(ii) If shares of PepsiCo Capital Stock change by reason of any stock split,
stock dividend, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, spinoff, combination or exchange of shares or
other any other corporate change treated as subject to this provision by the Plan Administrator, such
equitable adjustment shall be made in the number of shares credited to an Account or subaccount as the
Plan Administrator may determine to be necessary or appropriate.
In no event will shares of PepsiCo Capital Stock actually be purchased or held under this Plan, and no
Participant shall have any rights as a shareholder of PepsiCo Capital Stock on account of an interest in this
phantom option. While this Plan refers to PepsiCo Capital Stock and the phantom PepsiCo Capital Stock
Account, such references to capital stock shall mean and refer to PepsiCo common stock from and after the date
when the Company changed to a common stock structure.
(3) SaveUp Accounts. From time to time, the Plan Administrator shall designate
which of the investment options under the Company’s Long Term Savings Plan (SaveUp) shall be available as
phantom investment options under this Plan. As of the Effective Date, such available phantom options are the
Equity-Index Account, Equity-Income Account, and the Security Plus Account. Participant Accounts invested
in these phantom options are adjusted to reflect an investment in the corresponding investment options under
SaveUp. An amount deferred or transferred into one of these options is converted to phantom units in the
applicable SaveUp fund of equivalent value by dividing such amount by the value of a unit in such fund on the
date as of which the amount is treated as invested in this option by the Plan Administrator. Thereafter, a
Participant’s interest in each such phantom option is valued as of a Valuation Date by multiplying the number of
phantom units credited to his Account on such date by the value of a unit in the applicable SaveUp fund.
(d) Method of Allocation. With respect to any deferral election by a Participant, the Participant must use
his Election Form to allocate the deferral in 5 percent increments among the phantom investment options then offered
by the Plan
13
Administrator. Thereafter, a Participant may reallocate previously deferred amounts in a subaccount by properly
completing and submitting a fund transfer form provided by the Plan Administrator and specifying, in 5 percent
increments, the reallocation of his Subaccount among the phantom investment options then offered by the Plan
Administrator for this purpose. Any such transfer form shall be effective as of the Valuation Date that follows its
receipt by at least the number of days that the Plan Administrator specifies for this purpose from time to time. If more
than one transfer form is received on a timely basis for a subaccount, the transfer form that the Plan Administrator
determines to be the most recent shall be followed.
(e) Investment Choices for Stock Option Gains. Deferrals of Stock Option gains initially may be
invested only in the PepsiCo Capital Stock Account. In the case of a Participant who has attained his Retirement or,
effective as of September 12, 2008, upon a Participant’s death or Disability, the Plan Administrator may make available
some or all of the other phantom investment options described in subsection (c) above. In this case, any election to
reallocate the balance in the Participant’s applicable Deferral Subaccount shall be governed by the foregoing provisions
of this section.
4.2 Vesting of a Participant’s Account. Except as provided in Section 4.3, a Participant’s interest in the value of his
Account shall at all times be 100 percent vested, which means that it will not forfeit as a result of his Termination of
Employment.
4.3 Risk of Forfeiture Subaccounts. A Participant may elect to defer Base Compensation, Bonus Compensation or
Performance Unit Payouts to a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount only if: (i) he had, as of June 1, 1994, a deferred compensation
subaccount maintained under a forfeiture agreement (as defined below), and (ii) he has not yet attained eligibility for
Retirement when the first amount would be deferred pursuant to his current risk-of-forfeiture election. A “forfeiture
agreement” is an agreement with the Company, any Employer, or one of their predecessors providing that the subaccount
would be forfeited if the employee terminated employment voluntarily or on account of misconduct prior to Retirement. A
Participant who meets these requirements may elect under Article III to defer some or all of his eligible compensation to a
Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount subject to the following terms. (The date when a Participant attains eligibility for Retirement is
specified in the definition of “Retirement.”)
(a) A Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount will be terminated and forfeited in the event that the
Participant has a Termination of Employment that is voluntary or because of his misconduct prior to the earliest of:
(1) The end of the deferral period designated in his Election Form for such deferral (or if
later, the end of such minimum period as may be required under Section 3.4);
14
(2) The date the Participant attains eligibility for Retirement; or
(3) The date indicated on his Election Form as the end of the risk of forfeiture condition
(but not before completing the minimum risk of forfeiture period required by the Plan Administrator from time
to time).
(b) A Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount shall become fully vested (and shall cease to be a Risk of Forfeiture
Subaccount) when:
(1) The Participant reaches any of the dates in subsection (a) above while still employed by the
Company or one of its affiliates, or
(2) On the date the Participant terminates involuntarily from his Employer (including death and
termination for Disability), provided that such termination is not for his misconduct.
    
(c) No amounts credited to a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount may be transferred to a subaccount of the
Participant that is not a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount. No amounts credited to a subaccount of the Participant that is
not a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount may be transferred to a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount.
(d) A Participant may initially direct and then reallocate his Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount to any of the
phantom investment options under the Plan that are currently available for such direction or reallocation, whichever
applies. During the period before a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount ceases to be a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount, the
return under any such phantom investment option shall be supplemented as follows.
(1) In the case of the PepsiCo Capital Stock Account, the Participant’s dividend subaccount
thereunder shall be credited with an additional year-end dividend amount equal to 2 percent of the average
closing price of PepsiCo Capital Stock for the 30 business days preceding the end of the Company’s fiscal year
multiplied by the number of phantom shares of PepsiCo Capital Stock credited to the Participant’s Account as
of the end of the year. If the Participant’s subaccount was not a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount for the entire year
(or if the Participant reallocated amounts to the PepsiCo Capital Stock Account after the beginning of the year),
this 2 percent additional dividend will be prorated down appropriately, as determined by the Plan Administrator.
In addition, the Participant’s dividend subaccount shall earn interest at a rate that is 2 percent above the rate
ordinarily applicable under the Interest Bearing Account for the period that it is contained within a Risk of
Forfeiture Subaccount.
15
(2) In the case of any other available phantom investment option, the return on each such option
shall be supplemented with an additional 2% annual return for the period that it is held within a Risk of
Forfeiture Subaccount (but prorated for periods of such investment of less than a year).
4.4 Distribution of a Participant’s Account. A Participant'’s Account shall be distributed in cash as provided in this
Section 4.4.
(a) Scheduled Payout Date. With respect to a specific deferral, a Participant’s “Scheduled Payout Date”
shall be the earlier of:
(1) The date selected by the Participant for such deferral in accordance with Section 3.4, or
(2) The first day of the calendar quarter that follows the earliest to occur event selected by the
Participant for such deferral in accordance with Section 3.4.
Notwithstanding the prior sentence, in the case of a deferral of Stock Option Gains, a Participant’s Scheduled Payout
Date for such deferral shall be first day of the calendar quarter following his Termination of Employment other than for
death, Disability or Retirement (or 12 months after the date of the deferral, if that would be later than such first day).
With respect to any deferral, if a Participant selects only a payout event that might not occur (such as Retirement) and
then terminates employment before the occurrence of the event, the Plan Administrator may adopt rules to specify the
Scheduled Payout Date that shall apply to the deferral, notwithstanding the terms of the Participant’s election. Unless
an election has been made in accordance with subsection (b) below, the Participant’s subaccount containing the deferral
shall be distributed to the Participant in a single lump sum as soon as practicable following the Scheduled Payout Date.
(b) Payment Election. A Participant may delay receipt of a subaccount beyond its Scheduled Payout
Date, or elect to receive installments rather than a lump sum, by making a payment election under this subsection. A
payment election must be made by the calendar year before the year containing the Scheduled Payout Date (or if
earlier, at least 6 months before the Scheduled Payout Date). Any payment election to receive a lump sum at a later
time must specify a revised payout date that is at least 12 months after the Scheduled Payout Date. Any payment
election to receive installment payments in lieu of a lump sum shall specify the amount (or method for determining)
each installment and a set of revised payout dates, the last of which must be at least 12 months after the Scheduled
Payout Date. With respect to any subaccount, only one election may be made under this subsection. Beneficiaries are
not permitted to make elections under this subsection. In addition, an election
16
under this subsection may not delay the distribution of a deferral of Stock Option Gains made by a Participant whose
employment has terminated other than for death, Disability or Retirement. Actual payments shall be made as soon as
practicable following a revised payout date.
(c) Valuation. In determining the amount of any individual distribution pursuant to subsection (a) or (b)
above, the Participant'’s subaccount shall continue to be credited with earnings and gains (and debited for expenses and
losses) under Sections 4.1 and 4.3 until the Valuation Date preceding the Scheduled Payout Date or revised payout date
for such distribution (whichever is applicable). In determining the value of a Participant’s remaining subaccount
following an installment distribution, such installment distribution shall reduce the value of the Participant’s
subaccount as of the close of the Valuation Date preceding the revised payout date for such installment.
(d) Limitations. The following limitations apply to distributions from the Plan.
(1) Installments may only be made quarterly, semi-annually or annually, for a period of no more
than 20 years, and not later than the Participant’s 80th birthday (or what would have been his 80th birthday, if
the Participant dies earlier).
(2) If a Participant has elected a Scheduled Payout Date that would be after his 80th birthday, the
Participant shall be deemed to have elected his 80th birthday as his Scheduled Payout Date.
(3) If a Participant has elected to defer income, which would qualify as performance-based
compensation under Code section 162(m), into a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount, then such subaccount may not
be paid out at any time while the Participant is a covered employee under Code section 162(m)(3), to the extent
the Plan Administrator determines it would result in compensation being paid to the Participant in such year that
would not be deductible under Code section 162(m). The payout of any such amount shall be deferred until a
year when the Participant is no longer a section 162(m) covered employee. The Plan Administrator may waive
the foregoing provisions of this paragraph to the extent necessary to avoid an undue hardship to the Participant.
This paragraph shall apply notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary.
(e) Upon a Participant’s death, his Beneficiary shall be paid each subaccount still standing to the
Participant’s credit under the Plan in accordance with the terms of the Participant’s payout election for such subaccount
under Section 3.4, or his payment election under subsection (b) above, whichever is applicable.
17
4.5 Acceleration of Payment in Certain Cases. Except as expressly provided in this Section 4.5, no payments shall be
made under this Plan prior to the date (or dates) applicable under Section 4.4.
(a) A Participant who is suffering severe financial hardship resulting from extraordinary and
unforeseeable events beyond the control of the Participant (and who does not have other funds reasonably available
that could satisfy the severe financial hardship) may file a written request with the Plan Administrator for accelerated
payment of all or a portion of the amount credited to his Account. A committee composed of representatives from the
Company'’s Compensation Department, Tax Department and Law Department, or such other parties as the Plan
Administrator may specify from time to time, shall have sole discretion to determine whether a Participant satisfies the
requirements for a hardship request and the amount that may be distributed (which shall not exceed the amount
reasonably necessary to alleviate the Participant’s hardship).
(b) After a Participant has filed a written request pursuant to this section, along with all supporting
material, the committee shall grant or deny the request within 60 days (or such other number of days as is customarily
applied from time to time) unless special circumstances warrant additional time.
(c) The Plan Administrator may adjust the standards for hardship withdrawals from time to time to the
extent it determines such adjustment to be necessary to avoid triggering constructive receipt of income under the Plan.
(d) A Beneficiary may also request a hardship distribution upon satisfaction of the foregoing
requirements and subject to the foregoing limitations.
(e) When determined to be necessary in the interest of sound plan administration, the Plan Administrator
may accelerate the payment of a class of Participants’ subaccounts hereunder. This shall only occur to the extent the
Plan Administrator determines that such acceleration will not trigger constructive receipt of subaccounts that are not
paid out.
(f) When some or all of a Participant’s subaccount is distributed pursuant to this section, the distribution
and the subaccount shall be valued as provided by the Plan Administrator, using rules patterned after those in Section
4.4(c) above, on the Valuation Date coincident with or immediately preceding the date on which the decision to make
accelerated payment is made (or if later, the date on which it is deemed to be effective).
18
ARTICLE V
PLAN ADMINISTRATOR
5.1 Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator is the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors
(the “Committee”) or its delegate or delegates, who shall act within the scope of their delegation pursuant to such operating
guidelines as the Committee shall establish from time to time. The Plan Administrator is responsible for the administration of
the Plan.
5.2 Action. Action by the Committee may be taken in accordance with procedures that the Committee adopts from
time to time or that the Company’s Law Department determines are legally permissible.
5.3 Rights and Duties. The Plan Administrator shall administer and manage the Plan and shall have all powers
necessary to accomplish that purpose, including (but not limited to) the following:
(a) To exercise its discretionary authority to construe, interpret, and administer this Plan;
(b) To exercise its discretionary authority to make all decisions regarding eligibility, participation and
deferrals, to make allocations and determinations required by this Plan, and to maintain records regarding Participants'
Accounts;
(c) To compute and certify to the Employer the amount and kinds of payments to Participants or their
Beneficiaries, and to determine the time and manner in which such payments are to be paid;
(d) To authorize all disbursements by the Employer pursuant to this Plan;
(e) To maintain (or cause to be maintained) all the necessary records for administration of this Plan;
(f) To make and publish such rules for the regulation of this Plan as are not inconsistent with the terms
hereof;
(g) To delegate to other individuals or entities from time to time the performance of any of its duties or
responsibilities hereunder;
(h) To establish or to change the phantom investment options or arrangements under Article IV;
19
(i) To hire agents, accountants, actuaries, consultants and legal counsel to assist in operating and
administering the Plan; and
(j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan except Section 8.5 (relating to compliance with
Section 409A), the Plan Administrator may take any action the Plan Administrator deems is necessary to assure
compliance with any policy of the Company respecting insider trading as may be in effect from time to time. Such
actions may include altering the effective date of phantom investment option transfers or the distribution date of
Deferral Subaccounts. Any such actions shall alter the normal operation of the Plan to the minimum extent necessary.
The Plan Administrator has the exclusive and discretionary authority to construe and to interpret the Plan, to decide all
questions of eligibility for benefits, to determine the amount and manner of payment of such benefits and to make any
determinations that are contemplated by (or permissible under) the terms of this Plan, and its decisions on such matters will be
final and conclusive on all parties. Any such decision or determination shall be made in the absolute and unrestricted
discretion of the Plan Administrator, even if (A) such discretion is not expressly granted by the Plan provisions in question, or
(B) a determination is not expressly called for by the Plan provisions in question, and even though other Plan provisions
expressly grant discretion or call for a determination. In the event of a review by a court, arbitrator or any other tribunal, any
exercise of the Plan Administrator’s discretionary authority shall not be disturbed unless it is clearly shown to be arbitrary and
capricious.
5.4 Compensation, Indemnity and Liability. The Plan Administrator will serve without bond and without
compensation for services hereunder. All expenses of the Plan and the Plan Administrator will be paid by the Employer. To
the extent deemed appropriate by the Plan Administrator, any such expense may be charged against specific Participant
Accounts, thereby reducing the obligation of the Employer. No member of the Committee, and no individual acting as the
delegate of the Committee, shall be liable for any act or omission of any other member or individual, nor for any act or
omission on his own part, excepting his own willful misconduct. The Employer will indemnify and hold harmless each
member of the Committee and any individual or individuals acting as the delegate of the Committee against any and all
expenses and liabilities, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, arising out of his membership on the Committee (or his
serving as the delegate of the Committee), excepting only expenses and liabilities arising out of his own willful misconduct.
5.5 Taxes. If the whole or any part of any Participant's Account becomes liable for the payment of any estate,
inheritance, income, or other tax which the Employer may be required to pay or withhold, the Employer will have the full
power and authority to withhold and pay such tax out of any moneys or other property in its hand for the account of the
Participant. To the extent practicable, the Employer will provide the Participant notice of
20
such withholding. Prior to making any payment, the Employer may require such releases or other documents from any lawful
taxing authority as it shall deem necessary.
5.6 Section 16 Compliance:
(a)    General. To the maximum extent possible, this Plan is intended to be a formula plan for purposes of
Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the “Act”). Accordingly, in the case of a deferral or
other action under the Plan that constitutes a transaction that could be covered by Rule 16b-3(d) or (e), if it were
approved by the Company’s Board of Directors or Compensation Committee (“Board Approval”), it is intended that
the Plan shall be administered by delegates of the Compensation Committee, in the case of a Participant who is subject
to Section 16 of the Act, in a manner that will permit the Board Approval of the Plan to avoid any additional Board
Approval of specific transactions to the maximum possible extent.
(b)    Approval of Distributions: From and after January 1, 2005, this Plan remains subject to the
Company’s policies requiring compliance with Section 16 of the Act. Accordingly, this Subsection shall govern the
distribution of a deferral that (i) is wholly or partly invested in the phantom PepsiCo Capital Stock Account at the time
the deferral would be valued to determine the amount of cash to be distributed to a Participant, (ii) either was the
subject of a re-deferral election or was not covered by an agreement, made at the time of the Participant’s original
deferral election, that any investments in the phantom PepsiCo Capital Stock Account would, once made, remain in
that account until distribution of the deferral, (iii) is made to a Participant who is subject to Section 16 of the Act at the
time the interest in the phantom PepsiCo Capital Stock Account would be liquidated in connection with the
distribution, and (iv) if paid at the time the distribution would be made without regard to this subsection, could result in
a violation of Section 16 of the Act because there is an opposite way transaction that would be matched with the
liquidation of the Participant’s interest in the PepsiCo Capital Stock Account (either as a “discretionary transaction,”
within the meaning of Rule 16b-3(b)(1), or as a regular transaction, as applicable) (a “Covered Distribution”). In the
case of a Covered Distribution, if the liquidation of the Participant’s interest in the phantom PepsiCo Capital Stock
Account in connection with the distribution has not received Board Approval by the time the distribution would be
made if it were not a Covered Distribution, or if it is a discretionary transaction, then provided that there is no material
modification for Section 409A purposes, the actual distribution to the Participant shall be delayed only until the earlier
of:
(1)    In the case of a transaction that is not a discretionary transaction, Board Approval of the
liquidation of the Participant’s interest in the phantom PepsiCo Capital Stock Account in connection with the
distribution, and
21
(2)    The date the distribution would no longer violate Section 16 of the Act, e.g., when the
Participant is no longer subject to Section 16 of the Act, when the Deferral Subaccount related to the
distribution is no longer invested in the phantom PepsiCo Capital Stock Account or when the time between the
liquidation and an opposite way transaction is sufficient.

CLAIMS PROCEDURE
6.1 Claims for Benefits. If a Participant, Beneficiary or other person (hereafter, "Claimant") does not receive
timely payment of any benefits which he believes are due and payable under the Plan, he may make a claim for benefits to the
Plan Administrator. The claim for benefits must be in writing and addressed to the Plan Administrator or to the Company. If
the claim for benefits is denied, the Plan Administrator will notify the Claimant in writing within 90 days after the Plan
Administrator initially received the benefit claim. However, if special circumstances require an extension of time for
processing the claim, the Plan Administrator will furnish notice of the extension to the Claimant prior to the termination of the
initial 90-day period and such extension may not exceed one additional, consecutive 90-day period. Any notice of a denial of
benefits should advise the Claimant of the basis for the denial, any additional material or information necessary for the
Claimant to perfect his claim, and the steps which the Claimant must take to have his claim for benefits reviewed.
6.2 Appeals. Each Claimant whose claim for benefits has been denied may file a written request for a review of
his claim by the Plan Administrator. The request for review must be filed by the Claimant within 60 days after he received the
written notice denying his claim. The decision of the Plan Administrator will be made within 60 days after receipt of a request
for review and will be communicated in writing to the Claimant. Such written notice shall set forth the basis for the Plan
Administrator's decision. If there are special circumstances which require an extension of time for completing the review, the
Plan Administrator's decision may be rendered not later than 120 days after receipt of a request for review.
6.3 Special Procedures for Disability Determinations: Notwithstanding Sections 6.1 and 6.2, for claims and
appeals relating to Disability benefits that are filed from and after January 1, 2002, such claim or appeal shall be processed
pursuant to the applicable provisions of Department of Labor Regulation Section 2560.503-1 relating to Disability benefits,
including Sections 2560.503-1(d), 2560.503-1(f)(3), 2560.503-1(h)(4) and 2560.503-1(i)(3).

ARTICLE VII
AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION
7.1 Amendments. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company has the right in its
sole discretion to amend this Plan in whole or in part at any time and in any manner; provided, however, that no such
amendment shall reduce the amount credited to the Account of any Participant as of the date such amendment is adopted. Any
amendment shall be in writing and adopted by the Committee or an officer of the Company who is authorized by the
Committee for this purpose. All Participants shall be bound by such amendment.
7.2 Termination of Plan. The Company expects to continue this Plan, but does not obligate itself to do so. The
Company, acting by the Compensation Committee of its Board of Directors, reserves the right to discontinue and terminate the
Plan at any time, in whole or in part, for any reason (including a change, or an impending change, in the tax laws of the United
States or any State). Termination of the Plan will be binding on all Participants (and a partial termination shall be binding
upon all affected Participants), but in no event may such termination reduce the amounts credited at that time to any
Participant'’s Account. If this Plan is terminated (in whole or in part), amounts theretofore credited to affected Participants'’
Accounts may either be paid in a lump sum immediately, or distributed in some other manner consistent with this Plan, as
determined by the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion.
24
ARTICLE VIII
MISCELLANEOUS
8.1 Limitation on Participant's Rights. Participation in this Plan does not give any Participant the right to be
retained in the Employer's or Company'’s employ (or any right or interest in this Plan or any assets of the Company or
Employer other than as herein provided). The Company and Employer reserve the right to terminate the employment of any
Participant without any liability for any claim against the Company or Employer under this Plan, except for a claim for
payment of deferrals as provided herein.
8.2 Unfunded Obligation of Individual Employer. The benefits provided by this Plan are unfunded. All amounts
payable under this Plan to Participants are paid from the general assets of the Participant’s individual Employer. Nothing
contained in this Plan requires the Company or Employer to set aside or hold in trust any amounts or assets for the purpose of
paying benefits to Participants. Neither a Participant, Beneficiary, nor any other person shall have any property interest, legal
or equitable, in any specific Employer asset. This Plan creates only a contractual obligation on the part of a Participant’s
individual Employer, and the Participant has the status of a general unsecured creditor of this Employer with respect to
amounts of compensation deferred hereunder. Such a Participant shall not have any preference or priority over, the rights of
any other unsecured general creditor of the Employer. No other Employer guarantees or shares such obligation, and no other
Employer shall have any liability to the Participant or his Beneficiary. In the event, a Participant transfers from the
employment of one Employer to another, the former Employer shall transfer the liability for deferrals made while the
Participant was employed by that Employer to the new Employer (and the books of both Employers shall be adjusted
appropriately).
8.3 Other Plans. This Plan shall not affect the right of any eligible Employee or Participant to participate in and
receive benefits under and in accordance with the provisions of any other employee benefit plans which are now or hereafter
maintained by any Employer, unless the terms of such other employee benefit plan or plans specifically provide otherwise or it
would cause such other plan to violate a requirement for tax favored treatment.
8.4 Receipt or Release. Any payment to a Participant in accordance with the provisions of this Plan shall, to the
extent thereof, be in full satisfaction of all claims against the Plan Administrator, the Employer and the Company, and the Plan
Administrator may require such Participant, as a condition precedent to such payment, to execute a receipt and release to such
effect.
8.5 Governing Law and Compliance. This Plan shall be construed, administered, and governed in all respects in
accordance with applicable federal law and, to the extent not preempted by federal law, in accordance with the laws of the
State of North
25
Carolina. If any provisions of this instrument shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable,
the remaining provisions hereof shall continue to be fully effective. In addition, at all times during each Plan Year, this Plan
shall be operated to preserve the status of deferrals under this Pre-409A Program as being exempt from Section 409A, i.e., to
preserve the grandfathered status of this Pre-409A Program. In all cases, the provisions of the prior sentence shall apply
notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Plan.
8.6 Adoption of Plan by Related Employers. The Plan Administrator may select as an Employer any division of
the Company, as well as any corporation related to the Company by stock ownership, and permit or cause such division or
corporation to adopt the Plan. The selection by the Plan Administrator shall govern the effective date of the adoption of the
Plan by such related Employer. The requirements for Plan adoption are entirely within the discretion of the Plan Administrator
and, in any case where the status of an entity as an Employer is at issue, the determination of the Plan Administrator shall be
absolutely conclusive.
8.7 Gender, Tense, Headings and Examples. In this Plan, whenever the context so indicates, the singular or
plural number and the masculine, feminine, or neuter gender shall be deemed to include the other. Headings and subheadings
in this Plan are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not considered in the construction of the provisions hereof.
Whenever an example is provided or the text uses the term “including” followed by a specific item or items, or there is a
passage having a similar effect, such passage of the Plan shall be construed as if the phrase “without limitation” followed such
example or term (or otherwise applied to such passage in a manner that avoids limitation on its breadth of application).
8.8 Successors and Assigns; Nonalienation of Benefits. This Plan inures to the benefit of and is binding upon
the parties hereto and their successors, heirs and assigns; provided, however, that the amounts credited to the Account of a
Participant are not (except as provided in Section 5.5) subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer,
assignment, pledge, encumbrance, charge, garnishment, execution or levy of any kind, either voluntary or involuntary, and any
attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber, charge or otherwise dispose of any right to any benefits
payable hereunder, including, without limitation, any assignment or alienation in connection with a separation, divorce, child
support or similar arrangement, will be null and void and not binding on the Plan or the Company or Employer.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan Administrator reserves the right to make payments in accordance with a divorce
decree, judgment or other court order as and when cash payments are made in accordance with the terms of this Plan from the
subaccount of a Participant. Any such payment shall be charged against and reduce the Participant’s Account.
8.9 Facility of Payment. Whenever, in the Plan Administrator'’s opinion, a Participant or Beneficiary entitled to
receive any payment hereunder is under a legal
26
disability or is incapacitated in any way so as to be unable to manage his financial affairs, the Plan Administrator may direct
the Employer to make payments to such person or to the legal representative of such person for his benefit, or to apply the
payment for the benefit of such person in such manner as the Plan Administrator considers advisable. Any payment in
accordance with the provisions of this section shall be a complete discharge of any liability for the making of such payment to
the Participant or Beneficiary under the Plan.
8.10 Separate Plans. This Plan document encompasses three separate plans of deferred compensation for all
legal purposes (including federal tax law, state tax law and, effective January 1, 1999, ERISA) as set forth in subsections (a),
(b) and (c) below.
(a) The portion of the Plan that provides for deferrals of Base Compensation and Bonus Compensation
(which shall be known as the “PepsiCo Executive Income Deferral Plan”).
(b) The portion of the Plan that provides for deferrals of Performance Unit Payouts (which shall be
known as the “PepsiCo Performance Unit Deferral Plan”).
(c) The portion of the Plan that provides for deferrals of Stock Option Gains (which shall be known as
the “PepsiCo Option Gains Deferral Plan”).
Together, these three separate plans of deferred compensation are referred to as the PepsiCo Executive Income Deferral
Program.

This 7th day of February, 2018, the above restated Plan is hereby adopted and approved by the Company’s duly
authorized officer to be effective as stated herein.

PEPSICO EXECUTIVE INCOME DEFERRAL PROGRAM
APPENDIX
The following Appendix articles modify or supplement the general terms of the Plan as it applies to certain executives.
Except as specifically modified in the Appendix, the foregoing provisions of the Plan shall fully apply. In the event of a
conflict between this Appendix and the foregoing provisions of the Plan, the Appendix shall govern with respect to the
conflict.
29
ARTICLE A
SPINOFF OF TRICON
This Article sets forth provisions that apply in connection with the Company’s spinoff of Tricon Global
Restaurants, Inc.
A.1 Definitions. When used in this Article, the following underlined terms shall have the meanings set forth
below. Except as otherwise provided in this Article, all terms that are defined in Article II of the Plan shall have the meaning
assigned to them by Article II.
(a) Distribution Date: The “Distribution Date” as that term is defined in the 1997 Separation Agreement
between PepsiCo, Inc. and Tricon.
(b) PepsiCo Account Holder: A Participant who has an interest in the PepsiCo Capital Stock Account on
the Reference Date.
(c) Reference Date: The date specified by the Plan Administrator for purposes of determining who shall
be credited with an interest in the Tricon Common Stock Account.
(d) Transferred Individual: A “Transferred Individual” as that term is defined in the 1997 Employee
Programs Agreement between PepsiCo, Inc. and Tricon.
(e) Transition Individuals: A “Transition Individual” as that term is defined in the 1997 Employee
Programs Agreement between PepsiCo, Inc. and Tricon.
(f) Tricon: Tricon Global Restaurants, Inc., a North Carolina Corporation.
(g) Tricon Account Holder: A PepsiCo Account Holder whose interest in the PepsiCo Capital Stock
Account on the Reference Date includes at least 10 phantom shares of PepsiCo Capital Stock.
(h) Tricon EID: Tricon Executive Income Deferral Program.
(i) Tricon Group: Tricon and its subsidiaries and affiliates, as determined by the Plan Administrator.
30
A.2 Transfer of Benefits and Liabilities. Effective as of the end of the day on the Distribution Date, all interests
in the Plan of (and Plan liabilities with respect to) nonterminated Transferred Individuals shall be transferred to the Tricon
EID. This transfer shall constitute a complete payout of these individuals’ Accounts for purposes of determining who is a
Participant or Beneficiary under the Plan. For this purpose, a Transferred Individual shall be considered “nonterminated” if he
is actively employed by (or on a leave of absence from and expected to return to) the Tricon Group. Following the
Distribution Date, Tricon shall succeed to all of PepsiCo’s authority to affect and govern Plan interests transferred in
accordance with this section (including through interpretation, plan amendment or plan termination).
A.3 Cessation of Employer Status. Effective as of the end of the day on the Distribution Date, any Employer
who is a member of the Tricon Group shall no longer qualify as Employers hereunder. Any individual whose Account is
transferred in accordance with Section A.2 shall not thereafter be able to defer any compensation (including Stock Option
Gains) under this Plan, unless he returns to employment with an Employer following the Distribution Date (and is an eligible
Employee at the time of the deferral).
A.4 Employment Transfers by Transition Individuals. If a Participant is transferred to the Tricon Group under
circumstances that cause him to be a Transition Individual, such transfer to the Tricon Group shall not be considered a
Termination of Employment or other event that could trigger distribution of the Participant’s interest in the Plan. In this case,
the Participant’s interest in the Plan (and all Plan liabilities with respect to the Participant) shall be retained by the Plan. For
purposes of determining the distribution of such Participant’s interest in the Plan, the Participant’s Termination of
Employment shall not be deemed to occur before his termination of employment with the Tricon Group.
A.5 Special Tricon Stock Investment Option. As of the Distribution Date, the Plan Administrator shall establish
a temporary phantom investment option under the Plan, the Tricon Common Stock Account, and each Tricon Account Holder
shall be credited with an interest in such account.
(a) Establishing the Account Holder’s Interest. The amount of a Tricon Account Holder’s interest is
determined by dividing by 10 the number of phantom shares of PepsiCo Capital Stock standing to his credit in the
PepsiCo Capital Stock Account on the Reference Date. The portion of the resulting quotient that is an integer shall be
the number of phantom shares of Tricon Common Stock that is credited to the Participant’s Tricon Common
31
Stock Account as of the Distribution Date. A Tricon Stock Holder’s interest in the Tricon Common Stock Account
shall also include a dividend subaccount. The initial balance in the dividend subaccount shall be zero, but it shall
thereafter be credited with all amounts that would be received for the Participant by the Tricon Common Stock
Account as dividends, if dividends were paid on phantom shares of Tricon Common Stock as they are on actual shares.
All amounts credited to this dividend subaccount shall be invested in the phantom option described in Section 4.1(c)(1)
(the Interest Bearing Account).
(b) Valuation and Adjustment: A Participant’s interest in the Tricon Common Stock Account is valued as
of a Valuation Date by multiplying the number of phantom shares credited to his Account on such date by the fair
market value of a share of Tricon Common Stock on such date, and then adding the value of the Participant’s dividend
subaccount.
(1) As of any date, the fair market value of Tricon Common Stock is determined for purposes of
this Article using procedures comparable to those used in determining the Fair Market Value of PepsiCo Capital
Stock, but with such modifications as the Plan Administrator may apply from time to time.
(2) If shares of Tricon Common Stock change by reason of any stock split, stock
dividend, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, spinoff, combination or exchange of shares or other any other
corporate change treated as subject to this provision by the Plan Administrator, such equitable adjustment shall
be made in the number of shares credited to an Account or subaccount as the Plan Administrator may determine
to be necessary or appropriate
In no event will shares of Tricon Common Stock actually be purchased or held under this Plan, and no Participant shall
have any rights as a shareholder of Tricon Common Stock on account of an interest in the Tricon Common Stock
Account.
(c) Investment Reallocations. In accordance with Section 4.1(e), a Tricon Account Holder may reallocate
amounts from his Subaccounts in the Tricon Common Stock Account to other phantom investment options under the
Plan that are available for this purpose. No Participant may reallocate amounts into the Tricon Common Stock
Account.
32
(d) Termination of the Tricon Common Stock Account. Effective as of the end of the day on December
31, 1999 (or such later date as the Plan Administrator shall specify), the Tricon Common Stock Account shall cease to
be available under the Plan. Any amount under the Plan still standing to the credit of a Participant on such date shall
automatically be reallocated to the phantom investment option described in Section 4.1(c)(1) (the Interest Bearing
Account) unless the Participant selects a different replacement option in accordance with such requirements as the Plan
Administrator may apply.
A.6 PepsiCo Account Holders with Less Than 10 Shares: The interest in the PepsiCo Capital Stock Account of
any PepsiCo Account Holder who does not qualify to be a Tricon Account Holder shall be adjusted as of the Distribution
Date. Pursuant to this adjustment, the value of his dividend subaccount under the PepsiCo Capital Stock Account shall be
increased by the product of (a) and (b) below:
(a) The number of phantom shares of PepsiCo stock credited to the Participant’s Account under the
PepsiCo Capital Stock Account divided by 10.
(b) The fair market value of a share of Tricon Common Stock on the Distribution Date.
33
ARTICLE B
INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF PBG
This Article sets forth provisions that apply in connection with PBG’s initial public offering.
B.1 Definitions. When used in this Article, the following underlined terms shall have the meanings set forth
below. Except as otherwise provided in this Article, all terms that are defined in Article II of the Plan shall have the meaning
assigned to them by Article II.
(a) Offering Date: The “Offering Date” as that term is defined in the Separation Agreement between
PepsiCo, Inc. and PBG.
(b) PBG: Pepsi Bottling Group, Inc.
(c) PBG EID: PBG Executive Income Deferral Program.
(d) PBG Group: PBG and its subsidiaries and affiliates, as determined by the Plan Administrator.
(e) Transferred Individual: A “Transferred Individual” as that term is defined in the Employee Programs
Agreement between PepsiCo, Inc. and PBG.
(f) Transition Individuals: A “Transition Individual” as that term is defined in the Employee Programs
Agreement between PepsiCo, Inc. and PBG.
B.2 Transfer of Benefits and Liabilities. Effective as of the end of the day on the Offering Date, all interests in
the Plan of (and Plan liabilities with respect to) nonterminated Transferred Individuals shall be transferred to the PBG EID.
This transfer shall constitute a complete payout of these individuals’ Accounts for purposes of determining who is a
Participant or Beneficiary under the Plan. For this purpose, a Transferred Individual shall be considered “nonterminated” if he
is actively employed by (or on a leave of absence from and expected to return to) the PBG Group, as of the end of the day on
the Offering Date.
B.3 Cessation of Employer Status. Effective as of the end of the day on the Offering Date, any Employer who is
a member of the PBG Group shall no
34
longer qualify as an Employer hereunder. Any individual whose Account is transferred in accordance with Section B.2 shall
not thereafter be able to defer any compensation (including Stock Option Gains) under this Plan, unless he returns to
employment with an Employer following the Offering Date (and is an eligible Employee at the time of the deferral).
Following the Offering Date, PBG shall succeed to all of PepsiCo’s authority to affect and govern Plan interests transferred in
accordance with this section (including through interpretation, plan amendment or plan termination).
B.4 Employment Transfers by Transition Individuals.
(a) Transfers to PBG. If a Participant is transferred to the PBG Group under circumstances that cause
him to be a Transition Individual, such transfer to the PBG Group shall not be considered a Termination of
Employment or other event that could trigger distribution of the Participant’s interest in the Plan. In this case, the
Participant’s interest in the Plan (and all Plan liabilities with respect to the Participant) may be retained by the Plan, or
they may be transferred to the PBG EID, as determined by the Plan Administrator in its discretion. If a transfer of the
Participant’s interest occurs, this transfer shall constitute a complete payout of the Participant’s Account for purposes
of determining who is a Participant or Beneficiary under the Plan. If a transfer does not occur, for purposes of
determining the distribution of such Participant’s interest in the Plan, the Participant’s Termination of Employment
shall not be deemed to occur before his termination of employment with the PBG Group.
(b) Transfers from PBG. If an individual is transferred by the PBG Group to an Employer under
circumstances that cause him to be a Transition Individual and such individual’s interest in the PBG EID is transferred
to this Plan, such Individual shall become a Participant in this Plan. In connection with any such transfer of the
individual’s interest, the individual’s phantom investment in PBG capital stock under the PBG EID shall be carried
over and replicated hereunder until December 31, 2000 (or such other date as may be specified by the Plan
Administrator). Any other phantom investment of the individual under the PBG EID may be carried over and
replicated hereunder, or it may be converted to a phantom investment available under the Plan (depending upon the
procedures then applied by the Plan Administrator).
B.5 Special PBG Stock Investment Option. To the extent required by Section B.4 (and as otherwise made
available by the Plan Administrator from time to
35
time), the Plan Administrator shall establish a temporary phantom investment option under the Plan, the PBG Capital Stock
Account.
(a) General Principles. The PBG Capital Stock Account shall be administered under rules that are similar
to those applicable to the PepsiCo Capital Stock Account, but with such modifications as the Plan Administrator may
apply from time to time.
(b) Valuation and Adjustment: A Participant’s interest in the PBG Capital Stock Account is valued as of
a Valuation Date by multiplying the number of phantom shares credited to his Account on such date by the fair market
value of a share of PBG Capital Stock on such date, and then adding the value of the Participant’s dividend subaccount.
If shares of PBG Capital Stock change by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, merger,
consolidation, spinoff, combination or exchange of shares or other any other corporate change treated as subject to this
provision by the Plan Administrator, such equitable adjustment shall be made in the number of shares credited to an
Account or subaccount as the Plan Administrator may determine to be necessary or appropriate. In no event will shares
of PBG Capital Stock actually be purchased or held under this Plan, and no Participant shall have any rights as a
shareholder of PBG Capital Stock on account of an interest in the PBG Capital Stock Account.
(c) Investment Reallocations. In accordance with Section 4.1(e), a PBG Account Holder may reallocate
amounts from his Subaccounts in the PBG Capital Stock Account to other phantom investment options under the Plan
that are available for this purpose. Except as expressly authorized by the Plan Administrator, no Participant may
reallocate amounts into the PBG Capital Stock Account.
(d) Termination of the PBG Capital Stock Account. Effective as of the end of the day on December 31,
2000 (or such later date as the Plan Administrator shall specify), the PBG Capital Stock Account shall cease to be
available under the Plan. Any amount under the Plan still standing to the credit of a Participant on such date shall
automatically be reallocated to the phantom investment option described in Section 4.1(c)(1) (the Interest Bearing
Account) unless the Participant selects a different replacement option in accordance with such requirements as the Plan
Administrator may apply.

ARTICLE I
INTRODUCTION
The Pepsi Bottling Group, Inc. ( “PBG”) established the PBG Executive Income Deferral Program (the “Plan”) to
permit eligible executives to defer base pay, certain cash and stock awards made under its executive compensation programs,
and certain gains on stock options. The Plan is a successor to the PepsiCo Executive Income Deferral Program and was
originally adopted effective as of April 7, 1999. Thereafter, the Plan was amended and restated in its entirety effective as of
October 11, 2000 (subject to other specific effective dates set forth in the restatement). PepsiCo, Inc. (the “Company”)
assumed sponsorship of the Plan from PBG, effective as of February 26, 2010. For periods on and after February 26, 2010,
this document shall be read, interpreted and operated in light of this reacquisition. The Plan is amended and restated in its
entirety effective as of December 20, 2017 (subject to other specific effective dates set forth in this restatement). This
document applies only to Plan deferrals that were earned and vested prior to January 1, 2005. Later deferrals, which are
subject to Code section 409A, are governed by a separate document.
This document sets forth the terms of the Plan, specifying the group of executives of the Company and certain
affiliated employers that are eligible to make deferrals, the procedures for electing to defer compensation and the Plan’s
provisions for maintaining and paying out amounts that have been deferred. Additional provisions applicable to certain
executives are set forth in the Articles A and B of the Appendix, which modifies and supplements the general provisions of
the Plan.
The Plan is unfunded and unsecured, except as provided in Article B of the Appendix. Amounts deferred by an
executive are an obligation of that executive’s individual employer. With respect to his or her employer, the executive has the
rights of a general creditor.
    
1
ARTICLE II
DEFINITIONS
When used in this Plan, the following underlined terms shall have the meanings set forth below unless a different
meaning is plainly required by the context:
2.1 Account: The account maintained for a Participant on the books of his or her Employer to determine, from
time to time, the Participant's interest under this Plan. The balance in such Account shall be determined by the Plan
Administrator. Each Participant's Account shall consist of at least one Deferral Subaccount for each separate deferral under
Section 3.2. In accordance with Section 4.3, some or all of a separate deferral may be held in a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount.
The Plan Administrator may also establish such additional Deferral Subaccounts as it deems necessary for the proper
administration of the Plan. The Plan Administrator may also combine Deferral Subaccounts to the extent it deems separate
accounts are not needed for sound recordkeeping. Where appropriate, a reference to a Participant’s Account shall include a
reference to each applicable Deferral Subaccount that has been established thereunder.
2.2 Base Compensation: An eligible Executive’s adjusted base salary, as determined by the Plan Administrator
and to the extent paid in U.S. dollars from an Employer’s U.S. payroll. For any applicable payroll period, an eligible
Executive’s adjusted base salary shall be determined after reductions for applicable tax withholdings, Executive authorized
deductions (including deductions for the PBG 401(k) Plan, Benefits Plus and charitable donations), tax levies, garnishments
and such other amounts as the Plan Administrator recognizes as reducing the amount of base salary available for deferral.
2.3 Beneficiary: The person or persons (including a trust or trusts) properly designated by a Participant, as
determined by the Plan Administrator, to receive the amounts in one or more of the Participant’s Deferral Subaccounts in the
event of the Participant's death. To be effective, any Beneficiary designation must be in writing, signed by the Participant, and
filed with the Plan Administrator prior to the Participant’s death, and it must meet such other standards (including any
requirement for spousal consent) as the Plan Administrator shall require from time to time. If no designation is in effect at the
time of a Participant's death or if all designated Beneficiaries have predeceased the Participant, then the Participant’s
Beneficiary shall be his or her estate. A Beneficiary designation of an individual by name (or name and relationship) remains
in effect regardless of any change in the designated individual’s relationship to the Participant. A Beneficiary designation
solely by relationship (for example, a designation of “spouse,” that does not give the name of the spouse) shall designate
whoever is the person in that relationship to the Participant at his or her death. An individual who is otherwise a Beneficiary
with respect to a Participant’s Account ceases to be a Beneficiary when all payments have been made from the Account.

applicable Valuation Date (identified based on the Plan Administrator’s current procedures) for PepsiCo Capital Stock (or
PBG Common Stock) as reported by Bloomberg, L.P., or any successor thereto or any other financial reporting service

shall not be deemed on account of Misconduct hereunder unless the senior personnel executive of the Company shall confirm
that any such termination is on account of Misconduct as defined hereunder. Any voluntary termination in anticipation of an
involuntary Termination of Employment on account of Misconduct shall be deemed to be a Termination of Employment on
account of Misconduct.

understood as referring to the Compensation Committee, the Senior Vice President, Total Rewards and those delegated by the
Senior Vice President, Total Rewards other than the recordkeeper. All delegations made under the authority granted by this
Section are subject to Section 5.6.

or PBG and designated as eligible for deferral under the Plan by the Plan Administrator pursuant to Section 3.3(c). With
respect to any options that are made subject to a Stock Option Gain deferral election, the gains on such options shall be
determined through a sale of related shares by the issuer of the underlying shares net of: (i) the exercise price of the options,
(ii) any transaction costs incurred when such gains are captured through the sale of related shares, and (iii) any related taxes
that the issuer determines will not otherwise be satisfied by the Participant. For purposes of such sales, the issuer may
aggregate shares related to the options of different Participants, sell them over one or more days and divide the net proceeds

respect to the timing and aggregation of such sales.
2.27 Termination of Employment: A Participant’s cessation of employment with the Company, all Employers

determining forfeitures under Section 4.3 and distributing a Participant’s Account under Section 4.4, the following shall apply:
(a) A Participant does not have a Termination of Employment when the business unit or division of the
Company that employs him is sold if the Participant and substantially all employees of that entity continue to be
employed by the entity or its successor after the sale. A Participant also does not have a Termination of Employment
when the subsidiary of the Company that employs him is sold if: (i) the Participant continues to be employed by the
entity or its successor after the sale, and (ii) the Participant’s interest in the Plan continues to be carried as a liability by
that entity or its successor after the sale through a successor arrangement. In each case, the Participant’s Termination of
Employment shall occur upon the Participant’s post-sale termination of employment from such entity or its successor
(and their related organizations, as determined by the Plan Administrator).
(b) With respect to any individual deferral, the term “Termination of Employment” may encompass a
Participant’s death or death may be considered a separate event, depending upon the convention the Plan Administrator
follows with respect to such deferral.

ARTICLE III
PARTICIPATION
3.1 Eligibility to Participate.
(a) An Executive shall be eligible to defer compensation under the Plan while employed by an Employer
as an Executive classified (or grandfathered) as Band II or above (or an equivalent level for employees not under the
band system). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, from time to time the Plan Administrator may modify, limit or
expand the class of Executives eligible to defer hereunder, pursuant to criteria for eligibility that need not be uniform
among all or any group of Executives. During the period an individual satisfies all of the eligibility requirements of this
section, he or she shall be referred to as an eligible Executive.
(b) Each eligible Executive becomes an active Participant on the date an amount is first withheld from
his or her compensation pursuant to an Election Form submitted by the Executive to the Plan Administrator under
Section 3.3.
(c) An individual’s eligibility to participate actively by making deferrals under Section 3.2 shall cease
upon the election termination date (as defined below) occurring after the earlier of:
(1) The date he or she ceases to be an Executive who is described in the first sentence of
subsection (a) above (unless a less restrictive eligibility standard has been adopted in accordance with the
second sentence of subsection (a), in which case only Paragraph (2) below shall apply); or
(2) The date the Executive ceases to be eligible under criteria described in the second sentence of
subsection (a) above.
For purposes of this subsection, an individual’s election termination date shall be a date as soon as administratively
practicable following the cessation of eligibility (or such other date as may be determined in accordance with rules of
the Plan Administrator).
(d) An individual, who has been an active Participant under the Plan, ceases to be a Participant on the
date his or her Account is fully paid out.
8
3.2 Deferral Election.
(a) Each eligible Executive may make an election to defer under the Plan any whole percentage (up to
100%) of his or her Base Compensation, Bonus Compensation, Performance Unit Payout and Stock Option Gains in
the manner described in Section 3.3. The Plan Administrator may also permit the Participant to specify two alternative
deferral percentages that will be applicable to Bonus Compensation; one deferral percentage will apply to a
Participant’s Bonus Compensation if his or her bonus is equal to or greater than the target amount, and the other
deferral percentage will apply to a Participant’s Bonus Compensation if his or her bonus is less than the target amount.
Any percentage of Base Compensation deferred by an eligible Executive for a Plan Year will be deducted each pay
period during the Plan Year for which he or she has Base Compensation and is an eligible Executive. The percentage of
Bonus Compensation or Performance Unit Payout deferred by an eligible Executive for a Plan Year will be deducted
from his or her payment under the applicable compensation program at the time it would otherwise be made, provided
he or she remains an eligible Executive at such time. Any Stock Option Gains deferred by an eligible Executive shall
be captured as of the date or dates applicable for the category of underlying options under procedures adopted by the
Plan Administrator, provided that the Plan Administrator determines the eligible Executive’s rights in such options may
still be recognized at such time.
(b) To be effective, an eligible Executive’s Election Form must set forth the percentage of Base
Compensation, Bonus Compensation or Performance Unit Payout to be deferred (or for a deferral of Stock Option
Gains, the specific options on which any gains are to be deferred), the investment choice under Section 4.1 (which
investment must be stated in multiples of 5 percent), the deferral period under Section 3.4, the eligible Executive’s
Beneficiary designation, and any other information that may be requested by the Plan Administrator from time to time.
In addition, the Election Form must meet the requirements of Section 3.3 below.
(c) Notwithstanding subsection (a) above, the Plan Administrator in its discretion may implement rules
and procedures from time to time that allow Participants (i) to elect to defer Base Compensation and/or Bonus
Compensation in amounts other than whole percentages, such as in whole dollar amounts, or (ii) to specify a dollar
maximum that would limit their percentage deferral elections of Base Compensation and/or Bonus Compensation.
3.3 Time and Manner of Deferral Election.
(a) Deferrals of Base Compensation. Subject to the next sentence, an eligible Executive must
make a deferral election for a Plan Year with respect to Base Compensation at least two months prior to the Plan Year
in which the Base
9
Compensation would otherwise be paid. An individual who newly becomes an eligible Executive will have 30 days
from the date the individual becomes an eligible Executive to make an election with respect to compensation for
payroll cycles that begin after the election is received (if this 30-day period is a longer election period than applies
under the preceding sentence).
(b) Deferrals of Bonuses and Performance Unit Payouts. Subject to the next two sentences, an
eligible Executive must make a deferral election for a Plan Year with respect to his or her Bonus Compensation or
Performance Unit Payout at least six months prior to the Plan Year in which the Bonus Compensation or Performance
Unit Payout would otherwise be paid. An individual who newly becomes an eligible Executive may make a deferral
election with respect to his or her Bonus Compensation or Performance Unit Payout to be paid during the succeeding
Plan Year later than the date applicable under the previous sentence so long as the deferral election is made: (i) within
30 days of the date the individual becomes an eligible Executive, and (ii) sufficiently prior to the first day of such
succeeding Plan Year to ensure, in the discretionary judgment of the Plan Administrator, that the amount to be deferred
will not have been constructively received (under all the facts and circumstances).
(c) Deferrals of Stock Option Gains. With respect to each grant of PepsiCo or PBG stock options that are
held by eligible Executives, the Plan Administrator shall designate at such time as it deems appropriate whether gains
on the grant shall be eligible for deferral. Such designation may apply to all (or less than all) of the Executives that
hold such grant. Thereafter, the Plan Administrator shall notify Executives holding designated options that such
options then qualify for deferral of their related Stock Option Gains. Subject to the next sentence, an eligible Executive
who has such qualifying options must make a deferral election with respect to his or her related Stock Option Gains at
least 6 months before such qualifying options’ proposed capture date (as defined below) or, if earlier, in the calendar
year preceding the year of the proposed capture date. The “proposed capture date” for a set of options shall be the
earliest date that the issuer of the underlying stock would capture a Participant’s Stock Option Gains in accordance
with the deferral agreement prepared for such purpose by the Plan Administrator.
(d) General Provisions. A separate deferral election under (a), (b) or (c) above must be made by
an eligible Executive for each category of a Plan Year’s compensation that is eligible for deferral. If an eligible
Executive fails to file a properly completed and executed Election Form with the Plan Administrator by the prescribed
time, he or she will be deemed to have elected not to defer any Base Compensation, Bonus Compensation,
Performance Unit Payout or Stock Option Gains, as the case may be, for the applicable Plan Year. An election is
irrevocable once received and determined by the Plan Administrator to be properly completed.
10
Increases or decreases in the amount or percentage a Participant elects to defer shall not be permitted during a Plan
Year. Notwithstanding the preceding three sentences, to the extent necessary because of circumstances beyond the
control of the Executive, the Plan Administrator may grant an extension of any election period and may permit (to the
extent deemed necessary for orderly Plan administration or to avoid undue hardship to an eligible Executive) the
complete revocation of an election with respect to future deferrals. Any such extension or revocation shall be available
only if the Plan Administrator determines that it shall not trigger constructive receipt of income and is desirable for
plan administration, and only upon such conditions as may be required by the Plan Administrator.
(e) Beneficiaries. A Participant designates on the Election Form a Beneficiary to receive
payment, in the event of his or her death, of the amounts credited to his or her applicable Deferral Subaccount;
provided, however, the Plan Administrator may require a Participant to make an aggregate Beneficiary designation,
which shall apply to some or all of his or her Deferral Subaccounts (as specified in the discretion of the Plan
Administrator) on a uniform basis. A Beneficiary is paid in accordance with the terms of a Participant's Election Form,
as interpreted by the Plan Administrator in accordance with the terms of this Plan. At any time, a Participant may
change a Beneficiary designation for his or her Deferral Subaccounts in a writing that is signed by the Participant and
filed with the Plan Administrator prior to the Participant’s death, and that meets such other standards as the Plan
Administrator shall require from time to time.
3.4 Period of Deferral. An eligible Executive making a deferral election shall specify a deferral period on his or
her Election Form by designating a specific payout date, one or more specific payout events or both a date and one or more
specific events from the choices that are made available to the eligible Executive by the Plan Administrator. From time to time
in its discretion, the Plan Administrator may condition a Participant’s right to designate one or more specific payout events on
the Participant also specifying a payout date. Subject to the next sentence, an eligible Executive’s elected period of deferral
shall run until the earliest occurring date or event specified on his or her Election Form. Notwithstanding an eligible
Executive’s actual election, an eligible Executive shall be deemed to have elected a period of deferral of not less than:
(a) For Base Compensation, at least until January 1 of the second Plan Year following the Plan Year
during which the Base Compensation would have been paid absent the deferral (until 6 months after the Plan Year
during which the Base Compensation would have been paid for deferral elections made before the Start Date);
11
(b) For Bonus Compensation, at least 2 years after the date the Bonus Compensation would have been
paid absent the deferral (1 year for deferral elections made before the Start Date);
(c) For Performance Unit Payouts, at least 2 years after the date the Performance Unit Payout would
have been paid absent the deferral (1 year for deferral elections made before the Start Date); and
(d) For Stock Option Gains, at least 2 years after the date the Stock Option Gain is credited to a Deferral
Subaccount for the benefit of the Participant (1 year for deferral elections made before the Start Date).
12
ARTICLE IV
INTERESTS OF PARTICIPANTS
4.1 Accounting for Participants’ Interests.
(a) Deferral Subaccounts. Each Participant shall have at least one separate Deferral Subaccount
for each separate deferral of Base Compensation, Bonus Compensation, Performance Unit Payout or Stock Option
Gains made by the Participant under this Plan. A Participant’s deferral shall be credited to his or her Account as soon
as practicable following the date when the deferral of compensation actually occurs, as determined by the Plan
Administrator. A Participant’s Account is a bookkeeping device to track the value of his or her deferrals (and his or her
Employer’s liability therefor). No assets shall be reserved or segregated in connection with any Account, and no
Account shall be insured or otherwise secured.
(b) Account Earnings or Losses. As of each Valuation Date, a Participant’s Account shall be
credited with earnings and gains (and shall be debited for expenses and losses) determined as if the amounts credited to
his or her Account had actually been invested as directed by the Participant in accordance with this section (as
modified by Section 4.3, if applicable). The Plan provides only for “phantom investments,” and therefore such
earnings, gains, expenses and losses are hypothetical and not actual. However, they shall be applied to measure the
value of a Participant’s Account and the amount of his or her Employer’s liability to make deferred payments to or on
behalf of the Participant.
    
(c) Investment Options. Each of a Participant’s Deferral Subaccounts (other than those
containing Stock Option Gains) shall be invested on a phantom basis in any combination of phantom
investment options specified by the Participant (or following the Participant’s death, by his or her Beneficiary)
from those offered by the Plan Administrator for this purpose from time to time. Subsection (e) below governs
the phantom investment options available for deferrals of Stock Option Gains. The Plan Administrator may
discontinue any phantom investment option with respect to some or all Accounts, and it may provide rules for
transferring a Participant’s phantom investment from the discontinued option to a specified replacement option
(unless the Participant selects another replacement option in accordance with such requirements as the Plan
Administrator may apply).
13
(1) Phantom Investment Options Beginning January 1, 2001. Effective as of January 1,
2001, the phantom investment options offered under the Plan are as follows:
(i) Phantom PBG Stock Account. Participant Accounts invested in this phantom
option are adjusted to reflect an investment in PBG Common Stock. An amount deferred or transferred
into this option is converted to phantom shares (or units) of PBG Common Stock of equivalent value by
dividing such amount by the Fair Market Value of a share of PBG Common Stock (or of a unit in the
Account) on the date as of which the amount is treated as invested in this option by the Plan
Administrator. The Plan Administrator shall adopt a fair valuation methodology for valuing a phantom
investment in this option, such that the value shall reflect the complete value of an investment in PBG
Common Stock in accordance with Clause (A) or (B) below.
(A) The Plan Administrator may value a phantom investment in PBG
Common Stock pursuant to an accounting methodology which unitizes partial shares as well as
any amounts that would be received by the Account as dividends (if dividends were paid on
phantom shares/units of PBG Common Stock as they are on actual shares of equivalent value).
For the time period this methodology is chosen, partial shares and the above dividends shall be
converted to units and credited to the Participant’s Phantom PBG Stock Account.
(B) The Plan Administrator may also value a phantom investment in PBG
Common Stock by separately accounting for partial shares and any amounts that would be
received by the Account as dividends (if dividends were paid on phantom shares of PBG
Common Stock as they are on actual shares). For the time period this methodology is chosen, a
dividend subaccount shall be created to separately account for the dollar value of the partial
shares and the dividends and such dividend subaccount shall be invested in a phantom investment
option designated by the Plan Administrator from those currently in effect.
A Participant’s interest in the Phantom PBG Stock Account is valued as of a Valuation Date by
multiplying the number of phantom shares (or units) credited to his or her Account on such date by the
Fair Market Value of a share of PBG Common Stock (or of a unit in the Account) on such date, and then
adding the value of the Participant’s dividend
14
subaccount (if the methodology in clause (B) above is used). If shares of PBG Common Stock change by
reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, spin-off, combination
or exchange of shares or other any other corporate change treated as subject to this provision by the Plan
Administrator, such equitable adjustment shall be made in the number and kind of phantom shares/units
credited to an Account or subaccount as the Plan Administrator may determine to be necessary or
appropriate. In no event will shares of PBG Common Stock actually be purchased or held under this
Plan, and no Participant shall have any rights as a shareholder of PBG Common Stock on account of an
interest in this phantom option.
    
In accordance with the preceding paragraph, and effective as of February 26, 2010, the portion of
a Participant’s Account that is invested in the Phantom PBG Stock Account immediately prior to
February 26, 2010 shall be converted to an investment in the Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Account,
which is a phantom investment fund that replicates the PepsiCo Common Stock Fund under the PepsiCo
401(k) Plan for Salaried Employees. As of February 26, 2010, such conversion shall be applied by
converting the Participant’s phantom units in the Phantom PBG Stock Account into phantom units in the
Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Account in a manner that provides an equivalent phantom value
before and after the conversion.
(ii) PBG 401(k) Accounts. From time to time, the Plan Administrator shall designate
which (if any) of the investment options under the Company’s 401(k) Plan shall be available as phantom
investment options under this Plan. Effective as of January 1, 2001, such available phantom options are
the Security Plus Fund, Bond Index Fund, Total U.S. Equity Index Fund, Large Cap Equity Index Fund,
Mid Cap Equity Index Fund, Small Cap Equity Index Fund and the International Equity Index Fund.
Participant Accounts invested in these phantom options are adjusted to reflect an investment in the
corresponding investment options under the PBG 401(k) Plan. An amount deferred or transferred into
one of these options is converted to phantom units in the applicable PBG 401(k) fund of equivalent value
by dividing such amount by the value of a unit in such fund on the date as of which the amount is treated
as invested in this option by the Plan Administrator. Thereafter, a Participant’s interest in each such
phantom option is valued as of a Valuation Date by multiplying the number of phantom units credited to
his or her Account on such date by the value of a unit in the applicable PBG 401(k) fund on such date.
15
(iii) Other Accounts. From time to time, the Plan Administrator shall designate which (if
any) other investment options shall be available as phantom investment options under this Plan. These
may be in addition to those provided for above. They may also be in lieu of some or all of them. Any of
these phantom investment options shall be administered under procedures implemented from time to
time by the Plan Administrator.
(2) Phantom Investment Options Before January 1, 2001. For Plan Years ending before January 1,
2001, the phantom investment options offered under the Plan shall be those phantom investment options
provided for in Section 4.1(c)(1), except as modified and supplemented below:
(i) Phantom PBG Stock Account. Investments in the Phantom PBG Stock Account
shall be governed by the provisions of Section 4.1(c)(1)(i), except that the valuation methodology in
Section 4.1(c)(1)(i)(B) shall be used and that amounts credited to the dividend subaccount shall be
invested in the phantom Interest Bearing Cash Account.
(ii) PBG 401(k) Accounts. Investments in any phantom options based on the Company’s
401(k) Plan shall be governed by the provisions of Section 4.1(c)(1)(ii), except that the available
phantom options shall be the Equity-Index Account, the Equity-Income Account and the Security Plus
Account.
(iii) Phantom Interest Bearing Cash Account. Participant Accounts may be invested in this
phantom option and shall accrue a return based upon the prime rate of interest announced from time to
time by Citibank, N.A. (or another bank designated by the Plan Administrator from time to time).
Returns accrue during the period since the last Valuation Date based on the prime rate in effect on the
first business day after such Valuation Date and are compounded annually. An amount deferred or
transferred into this option is credited with the applicable rate of return beginning with the date as of
which the amount is treated as invested in this option by the Plan Administrator.
(3) Transfer Rules for 2001 Investment Option Change. Unless a Participant selects
another replacement option prior to January 1, 2001 in accordance with such requirements as the Plan
Administrator may implement, the Plan Administrator shall transfer and convert a Participant’s phantom
investments effective as of January 1, 2001 as follows:
16
(i) Phantom investments in the Interest Bearing Cash Account shall be converted and
transferred into the Security Plus Fund;
(ii) Phantom investments in the Security Plus Account shall be converted and transferred
into the Security Plus Fund;
(iii) Phantom investments in the Equity-Index Account shall be converted and transferred
into the Large Cap Index Fund; and
(iv) Phantom investments in the Equity-Income Account shall be converted and
transferred into the Total U.S. Equity Index Fund.
All the above conversions and transfers shall be effectuated pursuant to procedures implemented by the Plan
Administrator.
(d) Method of Allocation. With respect to any deferral election by a Participant, the Participant must use
his or her Election Form to allocate the deferral in 5 percent increments among the phantom investment options then
offered by the Plan Administrator. Thereafter, a Participant may reallocate previously deferred amounts in a Deferral
Subaccount by properly completing and submitting a fund transfer form provided by the Plan Administrator and
specifying, in 5 percent increments, the reallocation of his or her Deferral Subaccount among the phantom investment
options then offered by the Plan Administrator for this purpose. The Plan Administrator may provide that such
allocations or reallocations are to be made in such different increment as is selected by the Plan Administrator. Any
such transfer form shall be effective as of the date specified by the Plan Administrator in its discretion from time to
time. The Plan Administrator may specify any date as the effective date of such transfer forms, including the Valuation
Date, and the Plan Administrator may also specify a minimum number of days in advance of which such transfer form
must be received in order for the form to become effective as of the specified effective date. Notwithstanding the
preceding provisions of this subsection, the Plan Administrator may at any time alter the effective date of any
allocation pursuant to Section 5.3(j). If more than one transfer form is received on a timely basis for a Deferral
Subaccount, the transfer form that the Plan Administrator determines to be the most recent shall be followed. In the
case of a Participant who is determined by the Plan Administrator to be subject to Section 16 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Act”), the reallocation of any Subaccount of the Participant may be delayed
to the extent the Plan Administrator deems it necessary to satisfy Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Act. The
preceding sentence shall apply notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary.
17
(e) Investment Choices for Stock Option Gains. Deferrals of Stock Option Gains initially may be
invested only in the Phantom PBG Stock Account. In the case of a Participant who has attained eligibility for
Retirement, the Plan Administrator may make available some or all of the other phantom investment options described
in subsection (c) above. In this case, any election to reallocate the balance in the Participant’s applicable Deferral
Subaccount shall be governed by the foregoing provisions of this section.
4.2 Vesting of a Participant’s Account. Except as provided in Section 4.3, a Participant’s interest in the value of
his or her Account shall at all times be 100 percent vested, which means that it will not forfeit as a result of his or her
Termination of Employment.
4.3 Risk of Forfeiture Subaccounts. A Participant may elect to defer Base Compensation, Bonus Compensation
or Performance Unit Payouts to a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount only if: (i) he or she had, as of June 1, 1994, a deferred
compensation subaccount under the Prior Plan maintained under a forfeiture agreement (as defined below), and (ii) he or she
has not yet attained eligibility for Retirement when the first amount would be deferred pursuant to his or her current risk-of-
forfeiture election. A “forfeiture agreement” is an agreement with the Company, any Employer, or one of their predecessors
providing that the subaccount would be forfeited if the employee terminated employment voluntarily or on account of
Misconduct prior to Retirement. A Participant who meets these requirements may elect under Article III to defer some or all
of his or her Base Compensation, Bonus Compensation or Performance Unit Payouts to a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount
subject to the following terms. (The date when a Participant attains eligibility for Retirement is specified in the definition of
“Retirement.”)
(a) A Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount will be terminated and forfeited in the event that the
Participant has a Termination of Employment that is voluntary or because of his or her Misconduct prior to the earliest
of:
(1) The end of the deferral period designated in his or her Election Form for such deferral
(or if later, the end of such minimum period as may be required under Section 3.4);
(2) The date the Participant attains eligibility for Retirement; or
(3) The date indicated on his or her Election Form as the end of the risk of forfeiture
condition (but not before completing the minimum risk of forfeiture period required by the Plan Administrator
from time to time).
(b) A Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount shall become fully vested (and shall cease to be a Risk of Forfeiture
Subaccount) when:
18
(1) The Participant reaches any of the dates in subsection (a) above while still employed by the
Company or one of its affiliates (as defined by the Plan Administrator for this purpose), or
(2) On the date the Participant terminates involuntarily from his or her Employer (including death
and termination for Disability), provided that such termination is not for his or her Misconduct.
    
(c) No amounts credited to a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount may be transferred to a subaccount of the
Participant that is not a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount. No amounts credited to a subaccount of the Participant that is
not a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount may be transferred to a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount.
(d) A Participant may initially direct and then reallocate his or her Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount to any
of the phantom investment options under the Plan that are currently available for such direction or reallocation,
whichever applies. During the period before a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount ceases to be a Risk of Forfeiture
Subaccount, the return under any such phantom investment option shall be supplemented as follows.
(1) In the case of the Phantom PBG Stock Account:
(A) If the Plan Administrator is using the dividend subaccount valuation methodology of
Section 4.1(c)(1)(i)(B), the Participant’s dividend subaccount thereunder shall be credited with an
additional year-end dividend amount equal to 2 percent of the average closing price of PBG Common
Stock for the 30 business days preceding the end of the Company’s fiscal year multiplied by the number
of phantom shares of PBG Common Stock credited to the Participant’s Account as of the end of the year.
In addition, the Participant’s dividend subaccount shall earn interest at a rate that is 2 percent above the
rate ordinarily applicable under the phantom investment option in which the dividend subaccount is
invested for the period that it is contained within a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount.
(B) If the Plan Administrator is using the unit valuation methodology of Section 4.1(c)(1)
(i)(A), the Participant’s interest in the PBG Phantom Stock Account shall be increased in value by 2% as
of the end of the Plan Year.
If the Participant’s subaccount was not a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount for the entire year (or if the Participant
reallocated amounts to the Phantom PBG
19
Stock Account after the beginning of the year), the above additional investment return for the year will be
prorated down appropriately, as determined by the Plan Administrator.
(2) In the case of any other available phantom investment option for the Plan Year, the return on
each such option shall be supplemented with an additional 2% annual return for the period that it is held within
a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount (but prorated for periods of such investment of less than a year).
4.4 Distribution of a Participant’s Account. A Participant's Account shall be distributed as provided in this
Section 4.4, subject to Section 5.3(j). The portion of any Deferral Subaccount that is invested in the Phantom PBG Stock
Account may be distributed, at the option of the Plan Administrator, either in the form of cash or in whole shares of PBG
Common Stock (with cash for any partial share and, if applicable, the value of the dividend subaccount). The Plan
Administrator may also adopt a rule that eliminates the option to pay out cash under the prior sentence (except for any partial
share and, if applicable, the value of the dividend subaccount). All other Deferral Subaccount balances shall be distributed in
cash.
(a) Scheduled Payout Date. With respect to a specific deferral, a Participant’s “Scheduled Payout Date”
shall be the earlier of:
(1) The first day of the calendar quarter (or at the Plan Administrator’s Option, the first
Distribution Date) that follows the date selected by the Participant for such deferral in accordance with Section
3.4, or
(2) The first day of the calendar quarter (or at the Plan Administrator’s Option, the first
Distribution Date) that follows the earliest to occur event selected by the Participant for such deferral in
accordance with Section 3.4.
With respect to any deferral, if a Participant selects only a payout event that might not occur (such as Retirement) and
then terminates employment before the occurrence of the event, the Plan Administrator may adopt rules to specify the
Scheduled Payout Date that shall apply to the deferral, notwithstanding the terms of the Participant’s election. Unless
an election has been made in accordance with subsection (b) below (or unless subsection (f) requires an earlier
distribution), the Participant’s Deferral Subaccount containing the deferral shall be distributed to the Participant in a
single lump sum as soon as practicable following the Scheduled Payout Date.
(b) Payment Election. Unless subsection (f) below requires an earlier payout, a Participant may delay
receipt of a Deferral Subaccount beyond its
20
Scheduled Payout Date, or elect to receive installments rather than a lump sum, by making a payment election under
this subsection. A payment election must be made by the end of the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar
year containing the Scheduled Payout Date (or if earlier, at least 6 months before the Scheduled Payout Date). This
deadline applies without regard to whether the Participant has received any notice of the deadline or the availability of
a payment election. Any payment election to receive a lump sum at a later time must specify a revised payout date that
is at least 2 years after the Scheduled Payout Date. Any payment election to receive installment payments in lieu of a
lump sum shall specify the amount (or method for determining) each installment and a set of revised payout dates, the
last of which must be at least 2 years after the Scheduled Payout Date. With respect to any Deferral Subaccount, only
one election may be made under this subsection. Beneficiaries are not permitted to make elections under this
subsection. Actual payments shall be made as soon as practicable following a revised payout date.
(c) Valuation. In determining the amount of any individual distribution pursuant to subsection (a), (b) or
(f), the Participant's Deferral Subaccount shall continue to be credited with earnings and gains (and debited for
expenses and losses) under Sections 4.1 and 4.3 until the Valuation Date preceding the Scheduled Payout Date or
revised or earlier payout date for such distribution (whichever is applicable). In determining the value of a Participant’s
remaining Deferral Subaccount following an installment distribution, such installment distribution shall reduce the
value of the Participant’s Deferral Subaccount as of the close of the Valuation Date preceding the revised payout date
for such installment.
(d) Limitations. The following limitations apply to distributions from the Plan:
(1) Installments may only be made at the time intervals as specified by the Plan Administrator in
its discretion for this purpose from time to time. Specifically, the Plan Administrator may allow monthly,
quarterly, semi-annual or annual installments. However, installments may be paid over a period of no more than
20 years, and not later than the Participant’s 80th birthday (or what would have been his or her 80th birthday, if
the Participant dies earlier).
(2) If a Participant has elected a Scheduled Payout Date that would be after his or her 80th
birthday, the Participant shall be deemed to have elected his or her 80th birthday as his or her Scheduled Payout
Date.
(3) If a Participant has elected to defer income, which would qualify as performance-based
compensation under Code section 162(m), into a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount, then such subaccount may not
be paid out at
21
any time while the Participant is a covered employee under Code section 162(m)(3), to the extent the Plan
Administrator determines it would result in compensation being paid to the Participant in such year that would
not be deductible under Code section 162(m). The payout of any such amount shall be deferred until a year
when the Participant is no longer a section 162(m) covered employee. The Plan Administrator may waive the
foregoing provisions of this paragraph to the extent necessary to avoid an undue hardship to the Participant.
This paragraph shall apply notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary.
(4) In the case of a Participant who is determined by the Plan Administrator to be subject to
Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Act”), the Participant’s Scheduled Payout
Date and related distribution may be delayed to the extent the Plan Administrator deems it necessary to satisfy
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Act. This paragraph shall apply notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to
the contrary.
(e) Upon a Participant’s death, his or her Beneficiary shall be paid each Deferral Subaccount still
standing to the Participant’s credit under the Plan in accordance with the terms of the Participant’s payout election for
such subaccount under Section 3.4, or his or her payment election under subsection (b) above, whichever is applicable.
Any claim to be paid any amounts standing to the credit of a Participant in connection with the Participant’s death must
be received by the Plan Administrator at least 14 days before any such amount is paid out by the Plan Administrator.
Any claim received thereafter is untimely, and it shall not lie against the Plan, the Company, any Employer, the Plan
Administrator or any other party acting for one or more of them.
(f) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) above, if a Participant’s Termination of Employment is
voluntary (but not counting a Retirement) or is on account of his or her Misconduct, all of the Participant’s Deferral
Subaccounts shall be distributed as provided in this subsection.
(1) If the total balance of all of the Participant’s Deferral Subaccounts as of the end of the
calendar quarter (or such other period as the Plan Administrator specifies from time to time) during which the
Termination of Employment occurs equals $25,000 or less, all Deferral Subaccounts shall be distributed to the
Participant as a single lump sum as soon as practicable after the first day of the calendar quarter (or at the Plan
Administrator’s option, the first Distribution Date) that follows the Participant’s last day of employment.
22
(2) If the total balance of all of the Participant’s Deferral Subaccounts as of the end of the
calendar quarter (or such other period as the Plan Administrator specifies from time to time) during which the
Termination of Employment occurs is greater than $25,000, all Deferral Subaccounts shall be distributed to the
Participant as a single lump sum as soon as practicable after the first day of the calendar quarter (or at the Plan
Administrator’s option, the first Distribution Date) that follows at least one year after the Participant’s last day
of employment.
Notwithstanding (1) and (2) above, a Deferral Subaccount shall not be distributed under this subsection before the end
of the minimum period of deferral that is applicable to the Deferral Account under Section 3.4. If the preceding
sentence delays payout of a distribution, payout shall be made as soon as practicable after the minimum period of
deferral.
4.5 Acceleration of Payment in Certain Cases. Except as expressly provided in this Section 4.5, no payments
shall be made under this Plan prior to the date (or dates) applicable under Section 4.4.
(a) A Participant who is suffering severe financial hardship resulting from extraordinary and
unforeseeable events beyond the control of the Participant (and who does not have other funds reasonably available
that could satisfy the severe financial hardship) may file a written request with the Plan Administrator for accelerated
payment of all or a portion of the amount credited to his or her Account. A committee composed of representatives
from the Company's Compensation Department, Tax Department and Law Department, or such other parties as the
Plan Administrator may specify from time to time, shall have sole discretion to determine whether a Participant
satisfies the requirements for a hardship request and the amount that may be distributed (which shall not exceed the
amount reasonably necessary to alleviate the Participant’s hardship).
(b) After a Participant has filed a written request pursuant to this section, along with all supporting
material, the committee shall grant or deny the request within 60 days (or such other number of days as is customarily
applied from time to time) unless special circumstances warrant additional time.
(c) The Plan Administrator may adjust the standards for hardship withdrawals from time to time to the
extent it determines such adjustment to be necessary to avoid triggering constructive receipt of income under the Plan.
(d) A Beneficiary may also request a hardship distribution upon satisfaction of the foregoing
requirements and subject to the foregoing limitations.
23
(e) When determined to be necessary in the interest of sound plan administration, the Plan Administrator
may accelerate the payment of a class of Participants’ Deferral Subaccounts hereunder. This shall only occur to the
extent the Plan Administrator determines that such acceleration will not trigger constructive receipt of Deferral
Subaccounts that are not paid out.
(f) When some or all of a Participant’s Deferral Subaccount is distributed pursuant to this section, the
distribution and such subaccount shall be valued as provided by the Plan Administrator, using rules patterned after
those in Section 4.4(c) above, on the Valuation Date coincident with or immediately preceding the date on which the
decision to make accelerated payment is made (or if later, the date on which it is deemed to be effective).
4.6 Conversion of Deferral Subaccounts by Certain Participants. Participants who are employed as an Executive
classified as Band VI or above (or an equivalent level for employees not under the band system) may elect to convert all or
any portion of one or more Deferral Subaccounts (other than a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount) to a form of split-dollar life
insurance pursuant to the terms and conditions of this section.
(a) To convert a Deferral Subaccount, the Participant must make a conversion election in the manner
specified by the Plan Administrator from time to time. Any such election for a Deferral Subaccount must be made prior
to making a payment election under Section 4.4(b) for the Deferral Subaccount and not later than the earlier of: (i) the
end of the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year containing the Scheduled Payout Date applicable to
such subaccount as set forth in Section 4.4(a) above, and (ii) the date 6 months before the Scheduled Payout Date. This
deadline applies without regard to whether the Participant has received any notice of the deadline or the availability of
a conversion election. In addition to other items or information that the Plan Administrator may require or request from
time to time, the Participant must specify which Deferral Subaccounts the Participant desires to convert, the portion of
each such Deferral Subaccount to be converted and the Participant must relinquish in writing all of his or her rights to
the converted portion of such Deferral Subaccounts.
(b) To implement a conversion election, the Participant must also execute a split-dollar life insurance
agreement with the Company in a form to be determined by the Plan Administrator. Such agreement shall set forth the
interests of the Company and the Participant in the life insurance policy and, in addition to any other provisions that the
Plan Administrator or Company shall require, such agreement shall (i) provide for the Company to receive, out of the
life insurance policy’s death proceeds, an amount equal to the cash value of the policy (or if greater, the total amount of
premiums paid for the policy), (ii) require the Company to purchase and pay the premiums on a life insurance policy
on the life of the Participant
24
(or, at the Participant’s election, on the joint lives of the Participant and the Participant’s spouse), and (iii) specify the
owner of the life insurance policy.
(c) The conversion of a Participant’s Deferral Subaccounts shall be administered under rules and
procedures implemented from time to time by the Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator may require the
Participant from time to time to execute other agreements, forms or elections as may be necessary to properly
effectuate the conversion.
(d) The conversion election provided by this Section 4.6 may be eliminated or otherwise restricted at any
time in the discretion of the Plan Administrator.
25
ARTICLE V
PLAN ADMINISTRATOR
5.1 Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator is the Compensation and Management Development
Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Committee”) or its delegate or delegates, who shall act within the
scope of their delegation pursuant to such operating guidelines as the Committee shall establish from time to time. The Plan
Administrator is responsible for the administration of the Plan.
5.2 Action. Action by the Committee may be taken in accordance with procedures that the Committee adopts
from time to time or that the Company’s Law Department determines are legally permissible.
5.3 Powers of the Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator shall administer and manage the Plan and shall
have all powers necessary to accomplish that purpose, including (but not limited to) the following:
(a) To exercise its discretionary authority to construe, interpret, and administer this Plan;
(b) To exercise its discretionary authority to make all decisions regarding eligibility, participation and
deferrals, to make allocations and determinations required by this Plan, and to maintain records regarding Participants'
Accounts;
(c) To compute and certify to the Employer the amount and kinds of payments to Participants or their
Beneficiaries, and to determine the time and manner in which such payments are to be paid;
(d) To authorize all disbursements by the Employer pursuant to this Plan;
(e) To maintain (or cause to be maintained) all the necessary records for administration of this Plan;
(f) To make and publish such rules for the regulation of this Plan as are not inconsistent with the terms
hereof;
(g) To delegate to other individuals or entities from time to time the performance of any of its duties or
responsibilities hereunder;
26
(h) To establish or to change the phantom investment options or arrangements under Article IV;
(i) To hire agents, accountants, actuaries, consultants and legal counsel to assist in operating and
administering the Plan; and
(j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the Plan Administrator may take any action it
deems appropriate in furtherance of any policy of the Company respecting insider trading as may be in effect from time
to time. Such actions may include, but are not limited to, altering the effective date of allocations or distributions of
Accounts or Deferral Subaccounts.
The Plan Administrator has the exclusive and discretionary authority to construe and to interpret the Plan, to decide all
questions of eligibility for benefits, to determine the amount and manner of payment of such benefits and to make any
determinations that are contemplated by (or permissible under) the terms of this Plan, and its decisions on such matters will be
final and conclusive on all parties. Any such decision or determination shall be made in the absolute and unrestricted
discretion of the Plan Administrator, even if (A) such discretion is not expressly granted by the Plan provisions in question, or
(B) a determination is not expressly called for by the Plan provisions in question, and even though other Plan provisions
expressly grant discretion or call for a determination. As a result, benefits under this Plan will be paid only if the Plan
Administrator decides in its discretion that the applicant is entitled to them. In the event of a review by a court, arbitrator or
any other tribunal, any exercise of the Plan Administrator’s discretionary authority shall not be disturbed unless it is clearly
shown to be arbitrary and capricious.
5.4 Compensation, Indemnity and Liability. The Plan Administrator will serve without bond and without
compensation for services hereunder. All expenses of the Plan and the Plan Administrator will be paid by the Employer. To
the extent deemed appropriate by the Plan Administrator, any such expense may be charged against specific Participant
Accounts, thereby reducing the obligation of the Employer. No member of the Committee, and no individual acting as the
delegate of the Committee, shall be liable for any act or omission of any other member or individual, nor for any act or
omission on his or her own part, excepting his or her own willful Misconduct. The Employer will indemnify and hold
harmless each member of the Committee and any employee of PBG (or a PBG affiliate, if recognized as an affiliate for this
purpose by the Plan Administrator) acting as the delegate of the Committee against any and all expenses and liabilities,
including reasonable legal fees and expenses, arising out of his or her membership on the Committee (or his or her serving as
the delegate of the Committee), excepting only expenses and liabilities arising out of his or her own willful Misconduct.
5.5 Taxes. If the whole or any part of any Participant's Account becomes liable for the payment of any estate,
inheritance, income, employment, or other tax which the
27
Employer may be required to pay or withhold, the Employer will have the full power and authority to withhold and pay such
tax out of any moneys or other property in its hand for the account of the Participant. To the extent practicable, the Employer
will provide the Participant notice of such withholding. Prior to making any payment, the Employer may require such releases
or other documents from any lawful taxing authority as it shall deem necessary.
5.6 Section 16 Compliance. This Plan is intended to be a formula plan for purposes of Section 16 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Act”). Accordingly, in the case of a deferral or other action under the Plan
that constitutes a transaction that could be covered by Rule 16b-3(d) or (e) of the Act, if it were approved by the Company’s
Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee (“Board Approval”), it is intended that the Plan shall be administered by
delegates of the Compensation Committee, in the case of a Participant who is subject to Section 16 of the Act, in a manner
that will permit the Board Approval of the Plan to avoid any additional Board Approval of specific transactions to the
maximum extent possible.
28
ARTICLE VI
CLAIMS PROCEDURE
6.1 Claims for Benefits. If a Participant, Beneficiary or other person (hereafter, "Claimant") does not receive
timely payment of any benefits which he or she believes are due and payable under the Plan, he or she may make a claim for
benefits to the Plan Administrator. The claim for benefits must be in writing and addressed to the Plan Administrator or to the
Company. If the claim for benefits is denied, the Plan Administrator will notify the Claimant in writing within 90 days after
the Plan Administrator initially received the benefit claim. However, if special circumstances require an extension of time for
processing the claim, the Plan Administrator will furnish notice of the extension to the Claimant prior to the termination of the
initial 90-day period and such extension may not exceed one additional, consecutive 90-day period. Any notice of a denial of
benefits should advise the Claimant of the basis for the denial, any additional material or information necessary for the
Claimant to perfect his or her claim, and the steps which the Claimant must take to have his or her claim for benefits
reviewed.
6.2 Appeals. Each Claimant whose claim for benefits has been denied may file a written request for a review of
his or her claim by the Plan Administrator. The request for review must be filed by the Claimant within 60 days after he or she
received the written notice denying his or her claim. The decision of the Plan Administrator will be made within 60 days after
receipt of a request for review and will be communicated in writing to the Claimant. Such written notice shall set forth the
basis for the Plan Administrator's decision. If there are special circumstances which require an extension of time for
completing the review, the Plan Administrator's decision may be rendered not later than 120 days after receipt of a request for
review.
29
ARTICLE VII
AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION
7.1 Amendments. The Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors of
the Company, or its delegate, has the right in its sole discretion to amend this Plan in whole or in part at any time and in any
manner, including the manner of making deferral elections, the terms on which distributions are made, and the form and
timing of distributions. However, except for mere clarifying amendments necessary to avoid an inappropriate windfall, no
Plan amendment shall reduce the amount credited to the Account of any Participant as of the date such amendment is adopted.
Any amendment shall be in writing and adopted by the Committee or an officer of the Company who is authorized by the
Committee for this purpose. All Participants and Beneficiaries shall be bound by such amendment.
7.2 Termination of Plan. The Company expects to continue this Plan, but does not obligate itself to do so. The
Company, acting by the Compensation and Management Development Committee of its Board of Directors (or its delegate),
reserves the right to discontinue and terminate the Plan at any time, in whole or in part, for any reason (including a change, or
an impending change, in the tax laws of the United States or any State). Termination of the Plan will be binding on all
Participants (and a partial termination shall be binding upon all affected Participants), but in no event may such termination
reduce the amounts credited at that time to any Participant's Account. If this Plan is terminated (in whole or in part), amounts
theretofore credited to affected Participants' Accounts may either be paid in a lump sum immediately, or distributed in some
other manner consistent with this Plan, as determined by the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion.
30
ARTICLE VIII
MISCELLANEOUS
8.1 Limitation on Participant's Rights. Participation in this Plan does not give any Participant the right to be
retained in the Employer's or Company's employ (or any right or interest in this Plan or any assets of the Company or
Employer other than as herein provided). The Company and Employer reserve the right to terminate the employment of any
Participant without any liability for any claim against the Company or Employer under this Plan, except for a claim for
payment of deferrals as provided herein.
8.2 Unfunded Obligation of Individual Employer. The benefits provided by this Plan are unfunded. All amounts
payable under this Plan to Participants are paid from the general assets of the Participant’s individual Employer. Nothing
contained in this Plan requires the Company or Employer to set aside or hold in trust any amounts or assets for the purpose of
paying benefits to Participants. Neither a Participant, Beneficiary, nor any other person shall have any property interest, legal
or equitable, in any specific Employer asset. This Plan creates only a contractual obligation on the part of a Participant’s
individual Employer, and the Participant has the status of a general unsecured creditor of this Employer with respect to
amounts of compensation deferred hereunder. Such a Participant shall not have any preference or priority over, the rights of
any other unsecured general creditor of the Employer. No other Employer guarantees or shares such obligation, and no other
Employer shall have any liability to the Participant or his or her Beneficiary. In the event, a Participant transfers from the
employment of one Employer to another, the former Employer shall transfer the liability for deferrals made while the
Participant was employed by that Employer to the new Employer (and the books of both Employers shall be adjusted
appropriately).
8.3 Other Plans. This Plan shall not affect the right of any eligible Executive or Participant to participate in and
receive benefits under and in accordance with the provisions of any other employee benefit plans which are now or hereafter
maintained by any Employer, unless the terms of such other employee benefit plan or plans specifically provide otherwise or it
would cause such other plan to violate a requirement for tax favored treatment.
8.4 Receipt or Release. Any payment to a Participant in accordance with the provisions of this Plan shall, to the
extent thereof, be in full satisfaction of all claims against the Plan Administrator, the Employer and the Company, and the Plan
Administrator may require such Participant, as a condition precedent to such payment, to execute a receipt and release to such
effect.
8.5 Governing Law. This Plan shall be construed, administered, and governed in all respects in accordance with
applicable federal law and, to the extent not preempted by
31
federal law, in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. If any provisions of this instrument shall be held by a court
of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions hereof shall continue to be fully effective.
8.6 Adoption of Plan by Related Employers. The Plan Administrator may select as an Employer any division of
the Company, as well as any corporation related to the Company by stock ownership, and permit or cause such division or
corporation to adopt the Plan. The selection by the Plan Administrator shall govern the effective date of the adoption of the
Plan by such related Employer. The requirements for Plan adoption are entirely within the discretion of the Plan Administrator
and, in any case where the status of an entity as an Employer is at issue, the determination of the Plan Administrator shall be
absolutely conclusive.
8.7 Gender, Tense and Examples. In this Plan, whenever the context so indicates, the singular or plural number
and the masculine, feminine, or neuter gender shall be deemed to include the other. Whenever an example is provided or the
text uses the term “including” followed by a specific item or items, or there is a passage having a similar effect, such passage
of the Plan shall be construed as if the phrase “without limitation” followed such example or term (or otherwise applied to
such passage in a manner that avoids limitation on its breadth of application).
8.8 Successors and Assigns; Nonalienation of Benefits. This Plan inures to the benefit of and is binding upon
the parties hereto and their successors, heirs and assigns; provided, however, that the amounts credited to the Account of a
Participant are not (except as provided in Section 5.5) subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer,
assignment, pledge, encumbrance, charge, garnishment, execution or levy of any kind, either voluntary or involuntary, and any
attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber, charge or otherwise dispose of any right to any benefits
payable hereunder, including, without limitation, any assignment or alienation in connection with a separation, divorce, child
support or similar arrangement, will be null and void and not binding on the Plan or the Company or Employer.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan Administrator reserves the right to make payments in accordance with a divorce
decree, judgment or other court order as and when cash payments are made in accordance with the terms of this Plan from the
Deferral Subaccount of a Participant. Any such payment shall be charged against and reduce the Participant’s Account.
8.9 Facility of Payment. Whenever, in the Plan Administrator's opinion, a Participant or Beneficiary entitled to
receive any payment hereunder is under a legal disability or is incapacitated in any way so as to be unable to manage his or
her financial affairs, the Plan Administrator may direct the Employer to make payments to such person or to the legal
representative of such person for his or her benefit, or to apply the payment for the benefit of such person in such manner as
the Plan Administrator considers advisable. Any payment in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be a complete
discharge
32
of any liability for the making of such payment to the Participant or Beneficiary under the Plan.
8.10 Separate Plans. This Plan document encompasses two separate plans of deferred compensation for all legal
purposes (including ERISA, federal tax law, and state tax law) as set forth in subsections (a) and (b) below.
(a) The portion of the Plan that provides for deferrals of Base Compensation, Bonus Compensation and
Performance Unit Payouts (which shall be known as the “PBG Executive Income Deferral Plan”).
(b) The portion of the Plan that provides for deferrals of Stock Option Gains (which shall be known as
the “PBG Option Gains Deferral Plan”).
Together, these two separate plans of deferred compensation are referred to as the PBG Executive Income Deferral Program,
and are severable for any and all purposes as directed by the Company. (However, see Section B.6(a) of Article B which also
provides for a separate plan.)
33
This 7th day of February, 2018, the above restated Plan is hereby adopted and approved by the Company’s duly
authorized officer to be effective as stated herein.

PBG EXECUTIVE INCOME DEFERRAL PROGRAM
APPENDIX
The following Appendix articles modify and supplement the general terms of the Plan as it applies to certain
executives as provided therein.
    
35
ARTICLE A
INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF PBG
This Article sets forth provisions that apply in connection with the Company’s initial public offering. Except as
specifically modified in this Appendix Article A, the foregoing provisions of the Plan shall fully apply. In the event of a
conflict between this Article A and the foregoing provisions of the Plan, this Article A shall govern with respect to the
conflict.
A.1 Definitions: When used in this Article, the following underlined terms shall have the meanings set forth
below. Except as otherwise provided in this Article, all terms that are defined in Article II of the Plan shall have the meaning
assigned to them by Article II.
(a) Employee Programs Agreement: The 1999 Employee Programs Agreement between PepsiCo and
PBG.
(b) Offering Date: The “Offering Date” as that term is defined in the 1999 Separation Agreement
between PepsiCo and PBG.
(c) PepsiCo: PepsiCo, Inc., a North Carolina Corporation.
(d) PepsiCo Group: PepsiCo and its subsidiaries and affiliates, as determined by the Plan Administrator.
(e) Transferred Individual: A nonterminated “Transferred Individual” as that term is defined in the
Employee Programs Agreement. For this purpose, a Transferred Individual shall be considered “nonterminated” if he
or she is actively employed by (or on a leave of absence from and expected to return to) the Company and any of its
affiliates, as of the end of the day on the Offering Date.
(f) Transition Individuals: A “Transition Individual” as that term is defined in the Employee Programs
Agreement.
A.2 Assumption of Benefits and Liabilities. Effective as of the beginning of the day on the Start Date, all
interests in the Prior Plan of (and Prior Plan liabilities with respect to) Transferred Individuals shall be assumed by this Plan.
(a) In the case of a Transferred Individual, effective as of the beginning of the day on the Start Date, his
or her Account shall be credited with the amount that stood to his or her credit under the Prior Plan immediately prior
to the Start Date. The allocation of this amount to phantom investment options under this Plan shall mirror
36
the allocation then in effect for the Transferred Individual under the Prior Plan (except to the extent the Plan
Administrator permits, and an authorized Executive makes, an investment change at a special Valuation Date offered to
such Executive in connection with PBG’s initial public offering).
(b) Any deferral election made under the Prior Plan for a Transferred Individual shall be carried over and
continued under this Plan, subject to the provisions of this Plan (as interpreted by the Plan Administrator).
Notwithstanding the prior sentence, following the Start Date, to the extent permitted by the Plan Administrator, a
Transferred Individual may revise any Prior Plan deferral election during the period before the deadline for making
such election has been reached.
(c) A Transferred Individual who has made a deferral election with respect to a performance unit award
payable to him under the PepsiCo Long Term Incentive Plan shall, once the deferral occurs, be credited with such
deferral solely under this Plan. Any designation to have some or all of this deferral invested in the PepsiCo capital
stock account under the Prior Plan shall be converted to a designation for investment in a phantom investment option
under this Plan (other than the Phantom PepsiCo Stock Account) which is designated by the Plan Administrator for this
purpose.
A.3 Special PepsiCo Stock Investment Option. As of the Start Date, the Plan Administrator shall establish a
temporary phantom investment option under the Plan, the Phantom PepsiCo Stock Account. In no event will shares of
PepsiCo capital stock actually be purchased or held under this Plan, and no Participant shall have any rights as a shareholder
of PepsiCo capital stock on account of an interest in the Phantom PepsiCo Stock Account.
(a) General Principles: The Phantom PepsiCo Stock Account shall be administered under rules that are
similar to those applicable to the Phantom PBG Stock Account, but with such modifications as the Plan Administrator
may apply from time to time.
(b) Valuation and Adjustment: A Participant’s interest in the Phantom PepsiCo Stock Account is valued
as of a Valuation Date by multiplying the number of phantom shares credited to his or her Account on such date by the
fair market value of a share of PepsiCo capital stock on such date, and then adding the value of the Participant’s
dividend subaccount. If shares of PepsiCo capital stock change by reason of any stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, merger, consolidation, spin-off, combination or exchange of shares, complete or partial liquidation or
other corporate change treated as subject to this provision by the Plan Administrator, such equitable adjustment shall be
made in the number and kind of phantom shares
37
credited to an Account or subaccount as the Plan Administrator may determine to be necessary or appropriate.
(c) Investment Allocations and Reallocations. No deferrals after the Start Date may be directed for
investment in the Phantom PepsiCo Stock Account, except for a deferral of a Transferred Individual’s 1999 base salary
that he or she directed for investment in the Phantom PepsiCo Stock Account prior to the Start Date. In accordance
with Section 4.1(d), a Participant with an interest in the Phantom PepsiCo Stock Account may reallocate amounts from
his or her Subaccounts in the Phantom PepsiCo Stock Account to other phantom investment options under the Plan that
are available for this purpose (e.g., in the case of Stock Option Gains, no other phantom options are available for this
purpose). No Participant may reallocate amounts into the Phantom PepsiCo Stock Account.
(d) Termination of the Phantom PepsiCo Stock Account. Effective as of the end of the day on December
31, 2000 (the “effective time”), the Phantom PepsiCo Stock Account shall cease to be available under the Plan. Unless
a Participant selects another phantom investment option prior to the effective time, in accordance with such
requirements as the Plan Administrator may implement, the Participant’s phantom investment in the Phantom PepsiCo
Stock Account shall be transferred and converted by the Plan Administrator into an investment in the Phantom Security
Plus Fund as of the effective time. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, any Stock Option Gains that are invested in the
Phantom PepsiCo Stock Account shall be automatically transferred and converted by the Plan Administrator into an
investment in the Phantom PBG Stock Account as of the effective time.
A.4 Employment Transfers by Transition Individuals. This section shall apply to individuals who transfer
between PBG and PepsiCo under circumstances that cause them to be Transition Individuals.
(a) Transfers to PepsiCo. If a Participant, who is a Transition Individual, is transferred to the PepsiCo
Group, such transfer to the PepsiCo Group shall not be considered a Termination of Employment or other event that
could trigger distribution of the Participant’s interest in the Plan. In this case, the Participant’s interest in the Plan (and
all Plan liabilities with respect to the Participant) may be retained by the Plan, or they may be transferred to the
PepsiCo Executive Income Deferral Program as determined by the Plan Administrator in its discretion. If a transfer of
the Participant’s interest occurs, this transfer shall constitute a complete payout of the Participant’s Account for
purposes of determining who is a Participant or Beneficiary under the Plan. If a transfer does not occur, for purposes of
determining the distribution of such Participant’s interest in the Plan, the Participant’s Termination of Employment
shall not be deemed to occur before his or her termination of employment with the PepsiCo Group.
38
(b) Transfers from PepsiCo. If an individual is transferred by the PepsiCo Group to an Employer under
circumstances that cause him to be a Transition Individual and such individual’s interest in the PepsiCo Executive
Income Deferral Program is transferred to this Plan, such Transition Individual shall become a Participant in this Plan.
In connection with any such transfer of the individual’s interest, the individual’s phantom investment in PepsiCo
capital stock under the PepsiCo Executive Income Deferral Program shall be carried over and replicated hereunder
until December 31, 2000 (except to the extent the Plan Administrator permits, and an authorized Executive makes, an
investment change at a special Valuation Date offered to such Executive in connection with the transfer). Any other
phantom investment of the individual under the PepsiCo Executive Income Deferral Program may be carried over and
replicated hereunder, or it may be converted to a phantom investment available under the Plan (depending upon the
procedures then applied by the Plan Administrator). In determining the time of payout of a Transition Individual who
has an interest transferred to this Plan, the elections of the Participant under the PepsiCo Executive Income Deferral
Program shall be given effect, subject to this Plan’s provisions on payouts (as interpreted by the Plan Administrator).
39
ARTICLE B
SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AWARDS
Effective as of December 21, 1999, this Article B sets forth provisions that apply in connection with cash and
stock awards that have been granted to certain executives under the 1999 Executive Incentive Compensation Plan. Except as
specifically modified in this Appendix Article B, the foregoing provisions of the Plan shall fully apply. In the event of a
conflict between this Article B and the foregoing provisions of the Plan, this Article B shall govern with respect to the
conflict.
B.1 Definitions: When used in this Article B, the following underlined terms shall have the meanings set forth
below. Except as otherwise provided in this Article B, all terms that are defined in Article II of the Plan shall have the
meaning assigned to them by Article II.
(a) PBG Group: The group of corporations or other entities comprised of (i) PBG and all of its divisions,
subsidiaries and affiliates, (ii) PepsiCo, and (iii) such other corporations and entities as the Plan Administrator
designates from time to time.
(b) Cash Award: The Supplemental Executive Incentive Compensation award that PBG granted in cash
to certain executives under the 1999 Executive Incentive Compensation Plan.
(c) Change of Control: A Change of Control occurs on a date when (1) any individual, corporation,
partnership, group, associate or other entity, other than PepsiCo, is or becomes the “beneficial owner” (as defined in
Rule 13D-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), directly or indirectly, of 50% or more of the combined voting
power of PBG’s outstanding securities ordinarily having the right to vote at elections of directors, (2) any individual,
corporation, partnership, group, associate or other entity is or becomes the “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rule 13D-
3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), directly or indirectly, of 50% or more of the combined voting power of
PepsiCo’s outstanding securities ordinarily having the right to vote at elections of directors, (3) the approval by the
shareholders of PBG of a plan or agreement providing for a merger or consolidation of PBG, other than with PepsiCo,
or for a sale, exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of PBG, or (4) the approval by the
shareholders of PepsiCo of a plan or agreement providing for a merger or consolidation of PepsiCo, other than with
PBG, or for a sale, exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of PepsiCo.
40
(d) Employee: Any person who received a Cash Award or Stock Award under the Trust Agreement and
is currently rendering services to a member of the PBG Group.
(e) Extension Form: The form prescribed by the Plan Administrator on which an Employee extends the
Vesting Date of his or her Stock Award pursuant to the provisions of this Article B.
(f) PepsiCo: PepsiCo, Inc., a North Carolina corporation, and any successor or successors thereto.
(g) Stock Award: The Supplemental Executive Incentive Compensation award that PBG granted to
certain executives under the 1999 Executive Incentive Compensation Plan that is invested and payable in PBG
Common Stock. If an Employee completes an Extension Form pursuant to Section B.3 below and elects a Vesting Date
to apply to the award, each portion of the award that has a different Vesting Date (whether future or current) shall be
considered to be a separate Stock Award hereunder.
(h) Trust Agreement: The Trust Agreement (including any and all appendices), by and between PBG and
Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Company, as amended and restated from time to time.
(i) Vesting Date: The date on which a Stock Award will no longer be subject to a risk of forfeiture as
provided in the Trust Agreement or Section B.4, whichever applies.
        
B.2 Deferral of Cash Awards and Stock Awards.
(a) An Employee’s Cash Award shall be deferred under this Plan pursuant to the terms and conditions of
the Trust Agreement and shall become vested and distributed to the Employee or his or her beneficiary in the amount
and at the time as provided by the Trust Agreement.
(b) Prior to February 1, 2003, an Employee’s Stock Award shall be deferred under this Plan pursuant to
the terms and conditions of the Trust Agreement and, unless the Vesting Date is extended pursuant to this Article B, the
Stock Award shall become vested and distributed to the Employee or his or her beneficiary in the amount and form and
at the time as provided by the Trust Agreement. If the Employee extends the Vesting Date of the Stock Award pursuant
to this Article B (so that the Vesting Date extends beyond February 1, 2003), such extension shall be governed by the
terms and conditions of this Article B. Except as specifically modified in this Article B, the provisions of the Trust
Agreement shall fully apply. In
41
the event of a conflict between this Article B and the provisions of the Trust Agreement, this Article B shall govern
with respect to the conflict.
B.3 Extension of Vesting for Stock Awards.
(a) Manner of Election. Each Employee with a Stock Award may elect to extend the vesting under the
Plan of his or her Stock Award by completing and filing with the Plan Administrator an Extension Form for such
purpose. Such Extension Form must be completed in the manner and within the time limits prescribed by this Article B
and the Plan Administrator from time to time.
The Extension Form shall permit the Employee to elect a delayed Vesting Date to apply to all or only a portion of the
Stock Award. To be effective, an Employee’s Extension Form must set forth the Vesting Date that will be applicable to
the Stock Award, the Employee’s Beneficiary designation and any other information that may be requested by the Plan
Administrator from time to time. In addition, the Extension Form must meet the requirements of Sections B.3(b) and
(c) below. If permitted by the Plan Administrator, an Employee may select a different Beneficiary for his or her Stock
Awards than the Beneficiary selected for his or her Deferral Subaccounts.     
(b) Timing of Election. If an Employee desires to extend the vesting and receipt of his or her
Stock Award beyond February 1, 2003, an Employee must initially so elect by completing and filing an Extension
Form with the Plan Administrator by July 31, 2002. Subsequent vesting extensions (if any) of a Stock Award must be
made by an Employee at least 6 months prior to the then applicable Vesting Date or, if earlier, in the calendar year
preceding the calendar year of the then applicable Vesting Date. If an Employee fails to file a properly completed and
executed Extension Form with the Plan Administrator by the prescribed time, he or she will be deemed to have elected
not to extend the vesting and receipt of his or her Stock Award. An Extension Form is irrevocable once received and
determined by the Plan Administrator to be properly completed, and changes or modifications thereafter shall not be
permitted. Notwithstanding the preceding, to the extent necessary because of circumstances beyond the control of the
Employee, the Plan Administrator may grant a delay of any extension period and may permit (to the extent deemed
necessary for orderly Plan administration or to avoid undue hardship to an Employee) the complete revocation of an
Extension Form. Any such delay or revocation shall be available only if the Plan Administrator determines that it shall
not trigger constructive receipt of income (or other early taxation of income) and that it is desirable for Plan
administration, and only upon such conditions as may be required by the Plan Administrator.
(c) Period of Extension. An Employee shall specify a Vesting Date on his or her Extension Form
by designating a specific date from the choices that are then made available to the Employee by the Plan Administrator.
Notwithstanding an
42
Employee’s actual election, an Employee shall be deemed to have elected a Vesting Date that is not less than 24
months from the previous Vesting Date, but no later than September 30, 2009. In addition, notwithstanding an
Employee’s actual election, if an Employee selects a Vesting Date that is later than September 30, 2009, an Employee
shall be deemed to have elected a Vesting Date of September 30, 2009.
B.4 Forfeiture. An Employee’s interest in a Stock Award shall be terminated and the Stock Award shall be
forfeited in the event that the Employee’s employment is terminated with the PBG Group and such termination is voluntary or
on account of his or her Misconduct prior to the date the Stock Award vests in accordance with Section B.5(a) below.
        
B.5 Vesting and Distribution.
(a) Vesting. A Stock Award shall become fully vested (and shall cease to be subject to forfeiture) on the
earliest of the following to occur:
(1) When the Employee reaches the Vesting Date applicable to the Stock Award while employed
by a member of the PBG Group or while on an approved leave of absence (as determined by the Plan
Administrator);
(2) When the Employee terminates employment, voluntarily or involuntarily, from any and all
members of the PBG Group on account of the Employee’s death or Disability;
(3) When the Employee is involuntarily terminated from the PBG Group following a Change of
Control (regardless of whether such termination is on account of Misconduct), unless it is determined otherwise
by a majority of the “Outside Directors” (within the meaning of Code section 162(m)) serving on the PBG
Board of Directors on December 23, 1999 (the “Incumbent Outside Directors”) or subsequently elected to the
PBG Board of Directors by a vote of at least three-fourths of the directors constituting the Incumbent Outside
Directors;
(4) When the Employee is involuntarily terminated from the PBG Group and such involuntary
termination is not on account of Misconduct; or
(5) September 30, 2009.
(b) Distribution.
(1) Once an Employee’s Stock Award becomes fully vested as provided in Section B.5(a) above,
the Stock Award, in the amount and form
43
determined pursuant to the Trust Agreement, shall be distributed in a lump sum to the Employee or his or her
Beneficiary as soon as practicable after the first Distribution Date coincident with or next following the full
vesting of such Stock Award as provided in Section B.5(a) above.
(2) In the case of a Participant who is determined by the Plan Administrator to be subject to
Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Act”), a distribution required under
paragraph (1) above may be delayed to the extent the Plan Administrator deems it necessary to satisfy Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Act. This paragraph shall apply notwithstanding any provision of this Article B to
the contrary.
B.6 General Provisions.
(a) This Article B (which together with the corresponding provisions of the Trust Agreement shall be
known as the “PBG SEIC Deferral Plan”) shall encompass a plan of deferred compensation that is separate and distinct
from the PBG Executive Income Deferral Plan and the PBG Option Gains Deferral Plan (as defined in Section 8.10)
for all legal purposes (including ERISA, federal tax law and state tax law). Together, these three plans of deferred
compensation shall be referred to as the PBG Executive Income Deferral Program, and all three such plans are
severable for any and all purposes as directed by the Company. Additionally, Cash Awards may only be deferred for a
maximum time period of 27 months and Stock Awards may only be deferred for a maximum time period of ten years.
Therefore, since the Cash Awards and Stock Awards do not provide retirement income to the Employees and do not
result in a deferral of income by Employees for periods extending to the termination of their covered employment or
beyond, the PBG SEIC Deferral Plan is not subject to ERISA.
(b) In addition to those Plan provisions which may be in conflict with this Article B (and therefore the
provisions of this Article B governs pursuant to the first paragraph of this Article B), Section 4.2, Section 4.5, Section
4.6, Section 8.2 and Article VI of this Plan shall neither apply to this Article B nor to any Cash Award or Stock Award.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
ARTICLE I  
Foreword
The PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan (“PEP” or “Plan”) has been established by PepsiCo for the
benefit of salaried employees of the PepsiCo Organization who participate in the PepsiCo Salaried Employees
Retirement Plan (“Salaried Plan”). PEP provides benefits for eligible employees whose pension benefits under the
Salaried Plan are limited by the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, PEP
provides benefits for certain eligible employees based on the pre-1989 Salaried Plan formula (see, for example, Part B
thereof).
1989 Restatement . The Plan was amended and restated in its entirety in 1989.
409A Program Document 2005 Restatement . The Plan was last amended and restated in its entirety
effective as of January 1, 2005. The 2005 restatement sets forth the terms of the Plan that are applicable to benefits
that are subject to Section 409A, i.e., generally , benefits that are earned or vested after December 31, 2004 or
materially modified within the meaning of T reas. Reg. § 1.409A-6(a)(4) (the “409A Program”).
Amendments to the 2005 Restatement . The 2005 restatement was amended to reflect the merger into
this Plan of the PBG Pension Equalization Plan (“PBG PEP”), ef fective at the end of the day on December 31, 2011.
The PBG PEP document that was in ef fect on April 1, 2009, as amended through January 1, 2011 (the “409A PBG
PEP Document”) is attached hereto as Appendix Article PBG 409A and shall continue to govern PBG PEP benefits that
were subject to the 409A PBG PEP Document prior to the Plan merger , except for certain administrative provisions that
are now governed by the main portion of the 409A PepsiCo PEP Document as is
- 1 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
explained in Appendix Article PBG 409A. There has been no change to the time or form of payment of benefits that are
subject to Internal Revenue Code Section 409A (“Section 409A”) under either the PepsiCo PEP or PBG PEP
Documents as a result of the merger or the revisions to the 409A PepsiCo PEP Document and 409A PBG PEP
Document.
2017 Restatement . This restatement of the 409A Program Document is ef fective as of January 1, 2017.
Interplay of this 409A Program and Pre-409A Program . All benefits under the Plan that are not subject to
the 409A Program (i.e., generally , benefits that are earned or vested before January 1, 2005 and not materially
modified thereafter within the meaning of T reas. Reg. § 1.409A-6(a)(4)) shall be governed by the Plan Document for
the Pre-Section 409 Program (the “Pre-409A Program”). Together , this document and the document for the Pre‑409A
Program describe the terms of a single plan. However , amounts subject to the terms of this 409A Program and
amounts subject to the terms of the Pre-409A Program shall be tracked separately at all times. The preservation of the
terms of the Pre-409A Program, without material modification, and the separation between the 409A Program amounts
and the Pre-409A Program amounts are intended to be suf ficient to permit the pre-409A Program to remain exempt
from Section 409A as grandfathered benefits.

ARTICLE II  
Definitions and Construction
2.1    Definitions : This section provides definitions for certain words and phrases listed below . Where the
following words and phrases, in boldface and underlined, appear in this Plan document (including the Foreword) with
initial capitals they shall have the meaning set forth below , unless a dif ferent meaning is plainly required by the context.
Accrued Benefit : The Pension payable at Normal Retirement Date determined in accordance with
Article V , based on the Participant’ s Highest A verage Monthly Earnings and Credited Service at the date of
determination.
Actuarial Equivalent : Except as otherwise specifically set forth in the Plan or any Appendix to the
Plan with respect to a specific benefit determination, a benefit of equivalent value computed on the basis of the
factors set forth below . The application of the following assumptions to the computation of benefits payable
under the Plan shall be done in a uniform and consistent manner . In the event the Plan is amended to provide
new rights, features or benefits, the following actuarial factors shall not apply to these new elements unless
specifically adopted by the amendment.
(1)    Annuities and Inflation Protection : To determine the amount of a Pension payable in
the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity or optional form of survivor annuity , as an annuity with
inflation protection, or as a period certain and life annuity , the Plan Administrator shall select the factors

- 3 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
factors selected by the Plan Administrator are set forth in Schedule 1, below (prior factors appear in the
Appendix). Thereafter , the Plan Administrator shall review such initial factors from time to time and shall

otherwise added by this paragraph (3) in order by their base compensation, from the lowest to the

sentence and the methods for identifying Key Employees set forth in subparagraph (i) or (ii) above,
taken together , would result in more than 200 individuals being counted as Key Employees as of
any December 31 determination date, then the number of individuals treated as Key Employees
pursuant to subparagraph (i) or (ii), who are not described in the first sentence of this
subparagraph (iii), shall be reduced to 200 by eliminating from consideration those employees
otherwise added by such subparagraph in order of their base compensation, from the lowest base

has occurred is determined based on whether the facts and circumstance indicate that the Company and
the Employee reasonably anticipated that no further services would be performed after a certain date or
that the level of bona fide services the Employee would perform after such date (as an employee or
independent

services performed over the immediately preceding 36-month period (or the full period in which the
Employee provided services to the Company if the Employee has been providing services for less than

payment of the benefit under the qualifying plan that are legally

not exceed the amount allowed under Code Section 409A and (3) the reduction is made at the same time and in the

accordance with the elections made at his initial Annuity Starting Date.
(c)    Determination of Marital Status . Effective January 1, 2014, in any case in which the form of
payment of a Participant’ s 409A Pension is determined by his marital status on his Annuity Starting Date, the
Plan Administrator shall assume the Participant is unmarried on his Annuity Starting Date unless the Participant
provides notice to the Plan prior to his Annuity Starting Date, which is deemed suf ficient and satisfactory by the
Plan Administrator , that he is married. The Participant shall give such notification to the Plan Administrator when
he makes the election described in subsection (a) above or in accordance with such other procedures that are
established by the Plan Administrator for this purpose (if any). Notwithstanding the two prior sentences, the Plan
Administrator may adopt rules that provide for a dif ferent outcome than specified above.
6.4    Special Rules for Survivor Options : The following special rules shall apply for the survivor options
available under Section 6.2.
(a)    Effect of Certain Deaths : If a Participant makes an election under Section 6.3(a) to receive his
409A Retirement Pension in the form of an optional Annuity that includes a benefit for a surviving beneficiary
under Section 6.2 and the Participant
- 65 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
or his beneficiary (beneficiaries in the case of the optional form of payment in Section 6.2(a)(2)(iv)) dies prior to
the Annuity Starting Date of such Annuity , the election shall be disregarded. If the Participant dies after this
Annuity Starting Date but before his 409A Retirement Pension actually commences, the election shall be given
effect and the amount payable to his surviving Eligible Spouse or other beneficiary shall commence on the first
day of the month following his death (any back payments due the Participant shall be payable to his estate). In
the case of a Participant who has elected the form of payment described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(iv), if such
Participant: (i) dies after his Annuity Starting Date, (ii) without a surviving primary or contingent beneficiary , and
(iii) before receiving 120 payments under the form of payment, then the remaining payments due under such
form of payment shall be paid to the Participant’ s estate. If payments have commenced under such form of
payment to a Participant’ s primary or contingent beneficiary and such beneficiary dies before payments are
completed, then the remaining payments due under such form of payment shall be paid to such beneficiary’ s
estate.
(b)    Non-Spouse Beneficiaries : If a Participant’ s beneficiary is not his Eligible Spouse, he may not
elect:
(1)    The 100 percent survivor option described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(i) if his Eligible
Domestic Partner or other non-spouse beneficiary is more than 10 years younger than he is, or
(2)    The 75 percent survivor option described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(ii) if his Eligible
Domestic Partner or other non-spouse beneficiary is more than 19 years younger than he is.
- 66 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
6.5    Designation of Beneficiary : A Participant who has elected under Section 6.2 to receive all or part of
his Retirement Pension in a form of payment that includes a survivor option shall designate a beneficiary who will be
entitled to any amounts payable on his death. Such designation shall be made on the election form used to choose
such optional form of payment or an approved election form filed under the Salaried Plan, whichever is applicable. In
the case of the survivor option described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(iv), the Participant shall be entitled to name both a
primary beneficiary and a contingent beneficiary . A Participant (whether active or former) shall have the right to change
or revoke his beneficiary designation at any time prior to his Annuity Starting Date. The designation of any beneficiary ,
and any change or revocation thereof, shall be made in accordance with rules adopted by the Plan Administrator . A
beneficiary designation shall not be ef fective unless and until filed with the Plan Administrator . If no beneficiary is
properly designated and a Participant’ s elects a survivor ’s option described in Section 6.2(a)(2), the Participant’ s
beneficiary shall be his Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner , as applicable. A Participant entitled to a V ested
Pension does not have the right or ability to name a beneficiary; if the Participant is permitted under Section 6.2 to elect
an optional form of payment, then his beneficiary shall be his Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner , as
applicable, on his Annuity Starting Date.
6.6    Required Delay for Key Employees : Notwithstanding Section 6.1 above, if a Participant is classified
as a Key Employee upon his Separation from Service (or at such other time for determining Key Employee status as
may apply under Section 409A), then distributions to the Participant shall commence as follows:
- 67 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(a)    Distribution of a Retirement Pension : In the case of a Key Employee Participant who is
entitled to a 409A Retirement Pension, distributions shall commence on the earliest first of the month that is at
least six months after the date the Participant Separates from Service (or , if earlier , the Participant’ s death). For
periods before 2009, commencement of distributions, however , shall not be delayed under the preceding
sentence if the Participant’ s 409A Retirement Pension commences at the same time as his pension under the
Salaried Plan in accordance with Section 6.1(b)(3)(i).
(b)    Distribution of a V ested Pension . In the case of a Participant who is entitled to a 409A V ested
Pension, distributions shall commence as provided in Section 6.1(b), or if later , on the earliest first of the month
that is at least six months after the Participant’ s Separation from Service (or , if earlier , the Participant’ s death).
For periods before 2009, commencement of distributions, however , shall not be delayed under the preceding
sentence if the Participant’ s 409A V ested Pension commences at the same time as his pension under the
Salaried Plan in accordance with Section 6.1(b)(3)(i).
(c)    Interest Paid for Delay . Any payments to the Participant that are delayed in accordance with
the provisions of this Section 6.6 shall be increased for earnings at the interest rate used to compute the
Actuarial Equivalent lump sum value through the date the check for payment is prepared, with such delayed
payment and accumulated interest paid as a lump sum payment to the Participant on the date payment occurs in
accordance with subsection (a) or (b) above, whichever is applicable. If a Participant’ s beneficiary or estate is
paid under subsection (a) or (b) above as a result of his death, then any payments that would have been made
to the Participant and that
- 68 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
were delayed in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.6 shall be paid as otherwise provided in the
Plan, with interest at the rate specified in the preceding sentence through the date the check for payment is
prepared.
6.7    Payment of FICA and Related Income T axes : As provided in subsections (a) through (c) below , a
portion of a Participant’ s 409A Pension shall be paid as a single lump sum and remitted directly to the Internal Revenue
Service (“IRS”) in satisfaction of the Participant’ s FICA Amount and the related withholding of income tax at source on
wages (imposed under Code Section 3401 or the corresponding withholding provisions of the applicable state, local or
foreign tax laws as a result of the payment of the FICA Amount) and the additional withholding of income tax at source
on wages that is attributable to the pyramiding of wages and taxes.
(a)    Timing of Payment:  As of the date that the Participant’ s FICA Amount and related income tax
withholding are due to be deposited with the IRS, a lump sum payment equal to the Participant’ s FICA Amount
and any related income tax withholding shall be paid from the Participant’ s 409A Pension and remitted to the
IRS (or other applicable tax authority) in satisfaction of such FICA Amount and income tax withholding related to
such FICA Amount. The classification of a Participant as a Key Employee (as defined in Section 2.1) shall have
no ef fect on the timing of the lump sum payment under this subsection (a).
(b)    Reduction of 409A Pension . To reflect the payment of a Participant’ s FICA Amount and any
related income tax liability , the Participant’ s 409A Pension shall be reduced, ef fective as of the date for payment
of the lump sum in
- 69 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
accordance with subsection (a) above, with such reduction being the Actuarial Equivalent of the lump sum
payment used to satisfy the Participant’ s FICA Amount and related income tax withholding. It is expressly
contemplated that this reduction may occur ef fective as of a date that is after the date payment of a Participant’ s
409A Pension commences.
(A)    No Ef fect on Commencement of 409A Pension . The Participant’ s 409A Pension shall
commence in accordance with the terms of this Plan. The lump sum payment to satisfy the Participant’ s
FICA Amount and related income tax withholding shall not af fect the time of payment of the Participant’ s
actuarially reduced 409A Pension, including not af fecting any required delay in payment to a Participant
who is classified as a Key Employee.

ARTICLE VII  
Administration
7.1    Authority to Administer Plan : The Plan shall be administered by the Plan Administrator , which shall
have the authority to interpret the Plan and issue such regulations as it deems appropriate. The Plan Administrator
shall maintain Plan records and make benefit calculations, and may rely upon information furnished it by the Participant
in writing, including the Participant’ s current mailing address, age and marital status. The Plan Administrator ’s
interpretations, determinations, regulations and calculations shall be final and binding on all persons and parties
concerned. Neither the Company nor the Plan Administrator shall be a fiduciary of the Plan, and any restrictions that
might apply to a party in interest under section 406 of ERISA shall not apply under the Plan, including with respect to
the Company or the Plan Administrator .
7.2    Facility of Payment : Whenever , in the Plan Administrator ’s opinion, a person entitled to receive any
payment of a benefit or installment thereof hereunder is under a legal disability or is incapacitated in any way so as to
be unable to manage his financial af fairs, the Plan Administrator may make payments to such person or to the legal
representative of such person for his benefit, or the Plan Administrator may apply the payment for the benefit of such
person in such manner as it considers advisable. Any payment of a benefit or installment thereof in accordance with the
provisions of this section shall be a complete discharge of any liability for the making of such payment under the
provisions of the Plan.
- 71 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
7.3    Claims Procedure : The Plan Administrator shall have the exclusive discretionary authority to
construe and to interpret the Plan, to decide all questions of eligibility for benefits and to determine the amount of such
benefits, and its decisions on such matters are final and conclusive. As a result, benefits under this Plan will be paid
only if the Plan Administrator decides in its discretion that the person claiming such benefits is entitled to them. This
discretionary authority is intended to be absolute, and in any case where the extent of this discretion is in question, the
Plan Administrator is to be accorded the maximum discretion possible. Any exercise of this discretionary authority shall
be reviewed by a court, arbitrator or other tribunal under the arbitrary and capricious standard ( i.e., the abuse of
discretion standard). If, pursuant to this discretionary authority , an assertion of any right to a benefit by or on behalf of a
Participant or beneficiary (a “claimant”) is wholly or partially denied, the Plan Administrator , or a party designated by the
Plan Administrator , will provide such claimant within the 90-day period following the receipt of the claim by the Plan
Administrator , a comprehensible written notice setting forth:
(a)    The specific reason or reasons for such denial;
(b)    Specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based;
(c)    A description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to submit to
perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and
(d)    A description of the Plan’ s claim review procedure (including the time limits applicable to such
process and a statement of the claimant’ s right to bring a civil action under ERISA following a further denial on
review).
- 72 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
If the Plan Administrator determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim it
may extend the response period from 90 to 180 days. If this occurs, the Plan Administrator will notify the claimant
before the end of the initial 90-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by
which the Plan Committee expects to make the final decision. The claim review procedure is available upon written
request by the claimant to the Plan Administrator , or the designated party , within 60 days after receipt by the claimant of
written notice of the denial of the claim. Upon review , the Plan Administrator shall provide the claimant a full and fair
review of the claim, including the opportunity to submit to the Plan Administrator comments, document, records and
other information relevant to the claim and the Plan Administrator ’s review shall take into account such comments,
documents, records and information regardless of whether it was submitted or considered at the initial determination.
The decision on review will be made within 60 days after receipt of the request for review , unless circumstances
warrant an extension of time not to exceed an additional 60 days. If this occurs, notice of the extension will be furnished
to the claimant before the end of the initial 60-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension
and the date by which the Plan Administrator expects to make the final decision. The final decision shall be in writing
and drafted in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant; include specific reasons for the decision with
references to the specific Plan provisions on which the decision is based; and provide that the claimant is entitled to
receive, upon request ad free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, and other
information relevant to his or her claim for benefits.
Any claim under the Plan that is reviewed by a court, arbitrator or any other tribunal shall be reviewed
solely on the basis of the record before the Plan Administrator at the
- 73 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
time it made its determination. In addition, any such review shall be conditioned on the claimant’ s having fully
exhausted all rights under this section as is more fully explained in Section 7.5. Any notice or other notification that is
required to be sent to a claimant under this section may be sent pursuant to any method approved under Department of
Labor Regulation Section 2520.104b-1 or other applicable guidance.
7.4    Effect of Specific References : Specific references in the Plan to the Plan Administrator ’s discretion
shall create no inference that the Plan Administrator ’s discretion in any other respect, or in connection with any other
provision, is less complete or broad.
7.5    Claimant Must Exhaust the Plan’ s Claims Procedures Before Filing in Court:  Before filing any Claim
(including a suit or other action) in court or in another tribunal, a Claimant must first fully exhaust all of the Claimant’ s
rights under the claims procedures of Section 7.3.
(a)    Upon review by any court or other tribunal, the exhaustion requirement of this Section 7.5 is
intended to be interpreted to require exhaustion in as many circumstances as possible (and any steps necessary
to clarify or ef fect this intent may be taken).
(b)    In any action or consideration of a Claim in court or in another tribunal following exhaustion of
the Plan’ s claims procedure as described in this Section 7.5, the subsequent action or consideration shall be
limited, to the maximum extent permissible, to the record that was before Plan Administrator in the claims
procedure.
(c)    The exhaustion requirement of this Section 7.5 shall apply: (i) regardless of whether other
Disputes that are not Claims (including those that a court
- 74 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
might consider at the same time) are of greater significance or relevance, (ii) to any rights the Plan Administrator
may choose to provide in connection with novel Disputes or in particular situations, (iii) regardless of whether the
rights are actual or potential and (iv) even if the Plan Administrator has not previously defined or established
specific claims procedures that directly apply to the submission and consideration of such Claim (in which case
the Plan Administrator (upon notice of the Claim) shall either promptly establish such claims procedures or shall
apply (or act by analogy to) the claims procedures of Section 7.5 that apply to claims for benefits).
(d)    The Plan Administrator may make special arrangements to consider a Claim on a class basis
or to address unusual conflicts concerns, and such minimum arrangements in these respects shall be made as
are necessary to maximize the extent to which exhaustion is required.
(e)    For purposes of this Section 7.5, the following definitions apply .
(i)    A “Dispute” is any claim, dispute, issue, action or other matter .
(ii)    A “Claim” is any Dispute that implicates in whole or in part any one or more of
the following –
(A)    The interpretation of the Plan
(B)    The interpretation of any term or condition of the Plan
(C)    The interpretation of the Plan (or any of its terms or conditions) in light of
applicable law;

validly adopted or put into ef fect;
(E)    The administration of the Plan;
(F)    Whether the Plan, in whole or in part, has violated any terms, conditions
or requirements of ERISA or other applicable law or regulation, regardless of whether such

conditions or requirements of the Plan;
(G)    A request for Plan benefits or an attempt to recover Plan benefits;
(H)    An assertion that any entity or individual has breached any fiduciary duty;

Administrator , or (ii) relates to the Plan in any way .

claim filed under Article VII and any action filed in state or federal court by or on behalf of a former or current Employee,

denial of Plan benefits or for the alleged interference with or violation of ERISA-protected rights must be brought within
two years of the date the Petitioner ’s cause of action first accrues. For purposes of this subsection, a cause of action

identified to the Petitioner by the Plan Administrator on which payments shall commence, or (iii) when the Petitioner
has actual or constructive knowledge of the facts that are the basis of his claim. For purposes of this subsection, a
cause of action with respect to the alleged interference with ERISA-protected rights shall be deemed to accrue when
the claimant has actual or constructive knowledge of the acts that are alleged to interfere with ERISA-protected rights.
Failure to bring any such claim or cause of action within this two-year time frame shall preclude a Petitioner , or any
representative of the Petitioner , from filing the claim or cause of action. Correspondence or other communications
following the mandatory appeals process described in Section 7.3 shall have no ef fect on this two-year time frame.

employment of an Employer , or as a limitation of the right of an Employer to discharge any of its Employees, with or
without cause.
8.2    Nonalienation of Benefits : Benefits payable under the Plan or the right to receive future benefits
under the Plan shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer , assignment, pledge,

payable hereunder , including any assignment or alienation in connection with a divorce, separation, child support or
similar arrangement, shall be null and void and not binding on the Company . The Company shall not in any manner be
liable for , or subject to, the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements or torts of any person entitled to benefits
hereunder .
8.3    Unfunded Plan : The Company’ s obligations under the Plan shall not be funded, but shall constitute
liabilities by the Company payable when due out of the Company’ s general funds. To the extent the Participant or any
other person acquires a right to receive benefits under this Plan, such right shall be no greater than the rights of any

- 78 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
8.4    Action by the Company : Any action by the Company under this Plan may be made by the Board of
Directors of the Company or by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, with a report of any actions

(a)    General : It is the intention of the Company that the Plan shall be construed in accordance
with the applicable requirements of Section 409A. Further , in the event that the Plan shall be deemed not to

their designees or agents shall be liable to any Participant or other person for actions, decisions or
determinations made in good faith.
(b)    Non-duplication of benefits : In the interest of clarity , and to determine benefits in compliance
with the requirements of Section 409A, provisions have been included in this 409A Document describing the
calculation of benefits under certain specific circumstances, for example, provisions relating to the inclusion of
salary continuation during certain window severance programs in the calculation of Highest A verage Monthly
Earnings, as specified in Appendix B. Notwithstanding this or any
- 79 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
similar provision, no duplication of benefits may at any time occur under the Plan. Therefore, to the extent that a
specific provision of the Plan provides for recognizing a benefit determining element (such as pensionable
earnings or service) and this same element is or could be recognized in some other way under the Plan, the
specific provision of the Plan shall govern and there shall be absolutely no duplicate recognition of such element
under any other provision of the Plan, or pursuant to the Plan’ s integration with the Salaried Plan. This provision
shall govern over any contrary provision of the Plan that might be interpreted to support duplication of benefits.
8.7    Section 457A : To avoid the application of Code section 457A (“Section 457A”) to a Participant’ s
Pension, the following shall apply to a Participant who transfers to a work location outside of the United States to

(c) below at that time; and
(c)    The Participant shall have no legal right to (and the Participant shall not receive) any Benefit
Enhancement that relates to Service or age attainment from and after the Covered T ransfer to the extent such
Benefit Enhancement would constitute compensation that is includable in income under Section 457A.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, subsection (a) above shall not apply to a Participant who has a Covered T ransfer if,
prior to the Covered T ransfer , the Company provides a written communication (either to the Participant individually , to a
group of similar Participants, to Participants generally , or in any other way that causes the communication to apply to
the Participant – i.e., an “applicable communication”) that these subsections do not apply to the Covered T ransfer in
question. Subsection (b) shall cease to apply as of the earlier of – (i) the date the Participant returns to service for a
member of the PepsiCo Organization that is a United States corporation or a pass-through entity that is wholly owned
by a United States corporation, or (ii) the ef fective date for such cessation that is stated in an applicable

ARTICLE X  
ERISA Plan Structure
This Plan document in conjunction with the plan document(s) for the Pre-409A Program encompasses
three separate plans within the meaning of ERISA, as are set forth in subsections (a), (b) and (c). This division into
separate plans became ef fective as of July 1, 1996; previously the plans set forth in subsections (b) and (c) were a
single plan within the meaning of ERISA.
(a)    Excess Benefit Plan : An excess benefit plan within the meaning of section 3(36) of ERISA,
maintained solely for the purpose of providing benefits for Salaried Plan participants in excess of the limitations
on benefits imposed by section 415 of the Code.
(b)    Excess Compensation T op Hat Plan : A plan maintained by the Company primarily for the
purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated
employees within the meaning of sections 201(2) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA. The plan provides benefits for
Salaried Plan participants in excess of the limitations imposed by section 401(a)(17) of the Code on benefits
under the Salaried Plan (after taking into account any benefits under the Excess Benefit Plan). For ERISA
reporting purposes, this portion of PEP may be referred to as the PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan I.
(c)    Preservation T op Hat Plan : A plan maintained by the Company primarily for the purpose of
providing deferred compensation for a select group of
- 84 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
management or highly compensated employees within the meaning of sections 201(2) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA.
The plan provides preserves benefits for those Salaried Plan participants described in section 5.2(a) hereof, by
preserving for them the pre-1989 level of benefit accrual that was in ef fect before the Salaried Plan’ s
amendment ef fective January 1, 1989 (after taking into account any benefits under the Excess Benefit Plan and
Excess Compensation T op Hat Plan). For ERISA reporting purposes, this portion of PEP shall be referred to as
the PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan II.
Benefits under this Plan shall be allocated first to the Excess Benefit Plan, to the extent of benefits paid for the purpose
indicated in (a) above; then any remaining benefits shall be allocated to the Excess Compensation T op Hat Plan, to the
extent of benefits paid for the purpose indicated in (b) above; then any remaining benefits shall be allocated to the
Preservation T op Hat Plan. These three plans are severable for any and all purposes as directed by the Company .
In addition to the above, to the extent that lump sum termination benefits are paid under this Plan in
connection with a severed employee’ s Special Early Retirement (as defined in Appendix Article D) under a temporary
severance program sponsored by the Company , this portion of the Plan shall be a component of the Company’ s
unfunded severance plan that includes the temporary program of severance benefits in question. As a component of a
severance plan, the lump sum termination benefits are welfare benefits, and this portion is part of a “welfare benefit

(2)    Operating Rules for 2006 and 2007 . To ensure that the Company did not fail to identify any

C.3    Benefit Formula for International T ransfer Participants :
Except as provided in this Section C.3, an International T ransfer Participant’ s benefit under the Plan shall be
determined using a calculation methodology that is substantially similar to that which applies under Section 5.1 of the
Plan.
(a)    Total Pension for International T ransfer Participant : Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, an
International T ransfer Participant’ s “Total Pension” (as defined in Section 5.1(c)(1) of the Plan) shall be
calculated as if he continued to receive Credited Service and Earnings under the Salaried Plan while working for
the April 2007 Foreign Subsidiary to which he transferred following his employment with an Employer based in
the United States, without regard to the actual date on which he ceased receiving Credited Service and Earnings
under the Salaried Plan. However , the T otal Pension of an International T ransfer Participant whose transfer to an
April 2007 Foreign Subsidiary occurred prior to 1992 shall not take into account Credited Service and Earnings
for employment with the April 2007 Foreign Subsidiary prior to 1992.
(b)    Calculation of International T ransfer Participant’ s Benefit : The International T ransfer Participant’ s
benefit under the Plan shall be calculated by reducing his T otal Pension as determined under subsection (a)
above (expressed as a lump sum as of his benefit commencement date under the Plan) by the following
amounts:
(1)    The amount of his actual benefit under the Salaried Plan (expressed as a lump sum amount
on his benefit commencement date), and
(2)    Any amounts paid to him from a “qualifying plan” as that term is defined under Section 3.5(c)
(4) of Part B of the Salaried Plan (T ransfers and Non-Duplication) with respect to his assignment with the
April 2007 Foreign

(a)    Total Pension for PIRP T ransfer Participant : Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a PIRP
Transfer Participant’ s “Total Pension” (as defined in Section 5.1(c)(1) of the Plan) shall be calculated as provided
in paragraphs (1) and (2) below .
(1)    First, a PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s Total Pension shall be calculated as if he were an eligible
employee under the Salaried Plan for the entire Y ear of T ransfer , and as if he received Credited Service
and Earnings under the Salaried Plan for the Y ear of T ransfer equal to – (i) his actual Credited Service
and Earnings under the Salaried Plan for the Y ear of T ransfer , increased by  (ii) any other compensation
and service for the Y ear of T ransfer that would have been recognized as PIRP-DB Salary and PIRP DB

(2)    If (during a year a PIRP T ransfer Participant is otherwise accruing benefits under this Plan)
the PIRP T ransfer Participant would be credited with PIRP-DB Salary that cannot be recognized under
PIRP as a result of Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB, and if this PIRP-DB Salary would be considered for accrual
purposes
- 113 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
under PIRP-DB in connection with PIRP-DB Pensionable Service that is not recognized under this Plan,
the increase in the PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s Accrued Benefit under PIRP that is related to this PIRP-DB
Pensionable Service and that is blocked by Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB shall be added to the PIRP T ransfer
Participant’ s Accrued Benefit under this Plan. In the case of a PIRP T ransfer Participant who has a
Separation from Service on or after January 1, 2017, this increase in the PIRP T ransfers Participant’ s
Accrued Benefit under this Plan shall result in an appropriate increase, determined in the Company’ s
discretion, in the T otal Pension determined under paragraph (1) above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
determining Credited Service and Earnings under this subsection (a), no compensation or service shall be
taken into account more than once, and a PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s Total Pension shall be determined
in a way that avoids any duplication of benefits that will be provided to or on behalf of the PIRP T ransfer
Participant under PIRP-DB (after applying Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB) or another plan maintained or
contributed to by the Company or an af filiate, but without applying any of fset that would violate Code
Section 409A.
(b)    Calculation of PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s Benefit : The PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s benefit under the
Plan shall be calculated by reducing his T otal Pension as determined under subsection (a) above by the
reductions that are normally applicable under Article V . In addition, in the case of a PIRP T ransfer Participant
who has a Separation from Service on or after January 1, 2017, if (during a year a PIRP T ransfer Participant is
otherwise accruing benefits under this Plan) the value of the PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s benefit under PIRP-DB
would increase (if Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB did not
- 114 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
apply) as a result of the PIRP T ransfer Participant becoming eligible for early retirement under PIRP-DB, then
the projected increase in value of the PIRP-DB benefit at the PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s retirement under PIRP-
DB, which will be blocked by Section 9.14 of PIRP , shall result in an appropriate increase, determined in the
Company’ s discretion, in the Participant’ s benefit under this Plan that is payable at the time and in the form
applicable under this Plan. The appropriate increase shall be determined net of any expected increase in the
value of the benefit under this Plan related to becoming eligible for Early Retirement under this Plan. In addition,
a PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s appropriate increase shall be determined in a way that avoids any duplication of
benefits that will be provided to or on behalf of the PIRP T ransfer Participant under PIRP-DB (after applying
Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB) or another plan maintained or contributed to by the Company or an af filiate, but
without applying any of fset that would violate Code Section 409A.
C.6    Alternative Arrangements Permitted :
Notwithstanding any provision of this Article or the Plan to the contrary , the Company and a Participant who
would qualify as an International T ransfer Participant under Section C.2 above may agree in writing to disregard the

APPENDIX ARTICLE D 
Band 4 or Higher Rehired Y um Participants
D.1    Scope:
Effective May 1, 2009, this Article provides special rules for calculating the benefit of a transferred Participant
whose transfer would be an Eligible T ransfer under Section TRI.2(e) of the Part B of the Salaried Plan but for the fact
that such individual is reemployed by the Company on or after May 1, 2009, into a position that is classified as Band 4
(or its equivalent) or higher . For purposes of determining such Participant’ s Total Pension within the meaning of Section
5.1(c)(1), but not for purposes of determining such Participant’ s Salaried Plan Pension within the meaning of Section
5.1(c)(2), such Participant’ s position on reemployment will be deemed to be classified as below Band 4 (or its
equivalent), so that the Participant’ s transfer is eligible to be treated as an Eligible T ransfer (subject to the other
conditions thereof) and the Participant is eligible for the imputed service provisions of Section TRI.4(b) and (c). Such
Participant’ s benefit otherwise shall be subject to the Plan’ s usual conditions and shall be paid in accordance with the
Plan’ s usual terms. All benefits paid under this Article are subject to Code section 409A.

APPENDIX ARTICLE F - 
U.K. Supplementary Appendix Participants with U.S. Service
F.1    Scope :
This Article applies to “Covered U.K. Employees” as defined in Section F .2 below . The benefit of a Covered U.K.
Employee shall be determined as provided in Section F .3 below . Once a benefit is determined for a Covered U.K.
Employee under this Article, it shall be paid in accordance with the Plan’ s normal terms regarding the time and form of
payment. All benefits payable under this Article are subject to Code section 409A. This Article has been restated
effective January 1, 2016 (the original version of this Article was ef fective January 1, 2011, and it applied, in
accordance with its prior terms, to periods of service before January 1, 2016).
F.2    “Covered U.K. Employee” Defined :
A “Covered U.K. Employee” is a participant in the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan (“U.K. Participant”) who – (i)
becomes subject to United States income taxes, e.g., by transferring to a position with the Company in the United
States or otherwise (hereinafter referenced as “Engages in U.S. Service”), (ii) continues to accrue benefits under the
PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan after he Engages in U.S. Service, (iii) would have also accrued a benefit under the U.K.
Supplementary Pension Appendix for such period following when he Engages in U.S. Service (except for the
unavailability of accruals under such Appendix for the period a U.K. Participant Engages in U.S. Service), (iv)
subsequently either – (A) is localized in the United States as an employee of the PepsiCo Organization, or (B)
terminates employment with the PepsiCo Organization (provided this occurs before the date the U.K. Participant
commences an assignment with the PepsiCo Organization that is located outside the United States, as defined
- 123 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
in the Code), and (v) only after fully satisfying all of the preceding clauses, is then designated by the Company (in its
completely unfettered discretion) as a Covered U.K. Employee and thereby granted a legally binding right to a benefit
under this Article F at the time of the designation. The period that a U.K. Participant Engages in U.S. Service shall
begin on the first day that he becomes subject to United States income taxes (his “U.S. Commencement Date”), and it
shall end on the date he is no longer subject to U.S. income taxes or , if earlier , the date his Plan benefits under this
Article F commence (his “U.S. Cessation Date”).
F.3    Benefit for Covered U.K. Employees :
A Covered U.K. Employee’ s benefit under the Plan shall be determined by calculating, as of his Modified U.S.
Cessation Date, his “T otal U.K. Supplementary Benefit” and then subtracting from this amount his “Frozen U.K.
Supplementary Benefit.” For this purpose, a Covered U.K. Employee’ s—
(a)    “Modified U.S. Cessation Date” is the earliest of the following – (i) the date he is no longer subject to
U.S. income taxes, (ii) the date he first satisfies clause (iv) of Section F .2, (iii) the date he commences an
assignment with the PepsiCo Organization that is located outside the United States (as defined in the Code), or
(iv) the date his Plan benefits under this Article F commence.
(b)    “T otal U.K. Supplementary Benefit” is equal to the total benefit that he would have under the terms of
the U.K. Supplementary Pension Appendix, calculated based on all service and compensation with the
Company through his Modified U.S. Cessation Date that is counted in the calculation of his benefit under the
PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan (or that would be counted but for a limitation applicable to the plan under
- 124 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
U.K. law), and with such total benefit expressed in the form of a single lump sum that is payable as of the date
his benefits under this Article F commence, and
(c)    “Frozen U.K. Supplementary Benefit” is equal to the total benefit that he had under the terms of the
U.K. Supplementary Pension Appendix as of immediately before his U.S. Commencement Date, and with such
total benefit expressed in the form of a single lump sum that is payable as of the date his benefits under this
Article F commence.
The calculation provided for in the preceding sentence shall be made in accordance with the operating rules set forth in
Section F .4 below .
F.4    Operating Rules:
The following operating rules apply to the calculation in Section F .3. above.
(a)    In general, accruals under the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan for the period after a Covered U.K.
Employee’ s U.S. Cessation Date shall not reduce the benefit under this Article F determined under Section F .3.
Notwithstanding the prior sentence and anything in Section F .3 to the contrary , to the extent a Covered U.K.
Employee’ s accruals under the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan for the period after a Covered U.K. Employee’ s U.S.
Cessation Date have more than fully of fset the Covered U.K. Employee’ s accruals under the U.K.
Supplementary Pension Appendix (and the excess would have been of fset against the benefit under this Article
F had such benefit accrued under the U.K. Supplementary Appendix), then any such excess as of the date
benefits under this Article F commence (expressed as a lump sum as of such date) shall be of fset against the
benefits under this Article F to the extent such of fset would not violate Code Section 409A.
- 125 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(b)    In determining the value of a lump sum under this Article F , the actuarial assumptions that are used
shall be actuarial assumptions that comply with Section 417(e) of the Code and, specifically , are the Code
Section 417(e) assumptions that would be used under the PepsiCo Salaried Employees Retirement Plan to pay
a retirement lump sum as of the date applicable that the lump sum in question is to be determined under this
Article F .
(c)    A Covered U.K. Employee’ s Frozen U.K. Supplementary Benefit shall be determined on the basis of
assuming that the Covered U.K. employee voluntarily terminated employment and any other service relationship
with the PepsiCo Organization as of immediately before his U.S. Commencement Date.
(d)    This subsection applies if the terms of the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan or the U.K. Supplementary
Pension Appendix are amended during a year in a way that would change the results under the Section F .3
calculation, and such amendment otherwise applies earlier than the immediately following year . In this case, to
the extent that doing is necessary to comply with Code Section 409A, the calculation in Section F .3 shall be
made by delaying the application of the amendment so that it is prospectively ef fective starting with the
immediately following year .
(e)    In the event a Covered U.K. Employee (i) has earned a benefit under this Article F , (ii) has reached
his U.S. Cessation Date, and (iii) then again Engages in U.S. Service and meets all of the requirements to be a
Covered U.K. Employee when he again Engages in U.S. Service, the foregoing terms shall be applied again to
determine if he earns a benefit for the new period that he Engages in U.S. Service, except that any resulting
benefit from this new period shall be reduced by the lump sum value of any
- 126 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
prior benefit under this Article F (as necessary to completely avoid any duplication of benefits).
(f)    In the event a Covered U.K. Employee (i) has earned a benefit under this Article F , (ii) has reached
his U.S. Cessation Date, and (iii) then is employed by the PepsiCo Organization in a classification that would be
eligible for an accrual under the provisions of the Plan other than this Article F (the “Other Provisions”), then the
Other Provisions shall be applied to determine if he earns a benefit under the Other Provisions for the new
period of service, except that any resulting benefit from this new period of service shall be reduced by the lump
sum value of any prior benefit under this Article F (as necessary to completely avoid any duplication of benefits).
F.5    No Other Benefits :
A Covered U.K. Employee shall not be entitled to any other benefits under this Plan or the Salaried Plan while
he is a Covered U.K. Employee (or while he would be a Covered U.K. Employee if clauses (iv) and (v) of Section F .2.
were not included in the definition of Covered U.K. Employee). In addition, prior to the time that an individual has
satisfied all of the requirements to be considered a Covered U.K. Employee, the individual has no legally binding right
to a benefit under this Article F . Accordingly , for the avoidance of doubt, at any point before such time, the Company
may take action that prevents the individual from becoming entitled to a benefit under this Article F ( e.g., by deciding
that it will not designate the individual as a Covered U.K. Employee, in an unfettered exercise of the Company’ s
discretion), regardless of the services performed or other actions taken by the individual through this point in time, and
regardless of any other factor .

APPENDIX ARTICLE PBG
Effective as of the end of the day on December 31, 2011, the PBG PEP is hereby merged with and into the PepsiCo
PEP, with the PepsiCo PEP as the surviving plan after the merger . The following Appendix Article PBG governs PBG
PEP benefits that were subject to the 409A PBG PEP Document prior to the merger , except as follows: Articles VII
(Administration), VIII (Miscellaneous), IX (Amendment and T ermination), X (ERISA Plan Structure) and XI (Applicable
Law) of the main section of this document shall govern PBG PEP benefits that were subject to the 409A PBG PEP
Document. There shall be no change to the time or form of payment of benefits that are subject to Code section 409A
under either the PepsiCo PEP or PBG PEP Document as a result of the plan merger or the revisions made to the 409A
PBG PEP Document when it was incorporated into this Appendix.
ARTICLE I T O APPENDIX ARTICLE PBG - HIST ORY AND PURPOSE
1.1    History of Plan . The Pepsi Bottling Group, Inc. (“PBG”) established the PBG Pension Equalization Plan (“PEP”
or “Plan”) ef fective April 6, 1999 for the benefit of salaried employees of the PBG Organization who participate in the
PBG Salaried Employees Retirement Plan (“Salaried Plan”). The Plan was initially established as a successor plan to
the PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan, due to PBG’ s April 6, 1999 initial public of fering, and the Plan included
historical PepsiCo provisions which are relevant for eligibility and benefit determinations under the Plan. The Plan
provides benefits for eligible employees whose pension benefits under the Salaried Plan are limited by the provisions of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, the Plan provides benefits for certain eligible employees
based on the pre-1989
- 130 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Salaried Plan formula. Effective April 1, 2009, the Plan also provides benefits for employees whose eligible pay under
the Salaried Plan is reduced due to the employees’ elective deferrals under the PBG Executive Income Deferral
Program and for certain executives who would be “Grandfathered Participants” under the Salaried Plan but for their
classification as salary band E3-E8 or MP (or its equivalent, for periods on and after the Ef fective T ime). The Plan is
intended as a nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plan for federal income tax purposes. For purposes of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), the Plan is structured as two plans. The portion of the
Plan that provides benefits based on limitations imposed by Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) is
intended to be an “excess benefit plan” as described in Section 4(b)(5) of ERISA. The remainder of the Plan is intended
to be a plan described in Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA providing benefits to a select group of
management or highly-compensated employees.
The Plan has been amended from time to time, most recently in the form of an amendment and complete restatement
effective as of April 1, 2009 (“2009 Restatement”). PBG further amended the Plan as a result of the merger of PBG with
and into Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Company , Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of PepsiCo, Inc. (the “Company”),
pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of August 3, 2009 among PBG, the Company and Pepsi-Cola
Metropolitan Company , Inc., and to facilitate the Company’ s assumption of PBG’ s role as the Plan’ s sponsor .
1.2    Effect of Amendment and Restatement . The Plan as in ef fect on October 3, 2004 is referred to herein as the
Prior Plan.
Except as otherwise explicitly provided in Section 6.1(b)(3) of this Plan, a Participant’ s benefit (including death
benefits), determined under the terms of the Plan as in ef fect on October 3,
- 131 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
2004 as if the Participant had terminated employment on December 31, 2004, without regard to any compensation paid
or services rendered after 2004, or any other events af fecting the amount of or the entitlement to benefits (other than
the Participant’ s survival or the Participant’ s election under the terms of the Plan with respect to the time or form of
benefit) (the “Grandfathered Benefit”) shall be paid at the time and in the form provided by the terms of the Plan as in
effect on October 3, 2004.
The benefit of a Participant accrued under this Plan based on all compensation and services taken into account by the
Prior Plan and this Plan, less the Participant’ s Grandfathered Benefit, shall be paid in the times and in the form as
provided in this Plan. Except as otherwise explicitly provided in this Plan, this Plan superseded the Prior Plan ef fective
January 1, 2009, with respect to amounts accrued and vested after 2004 by Participants who had not commenced
receiving benefits as of January 1, 2009. The Plan was administered in accordance with a good faith interpretation of
Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and IRS regulations and guidance thereunder from January 1, 2005
through December 31, 2008. Amounts accrued under this Plan after 2004 shall be treated as payable under a separate
Plan for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.

Partner” does not apply to a Participant’ s Eligible Spouse or to an individual who is of the opposite sex of
the Participant. A Participant who lives in a state that permits same-sex marriage is not permitted to have

state started to permit same-sex marriage or same-sex civil unions less than 12 months before the

(i)    That the Participant’ s social security wages in any year prior to Retirement or
severance are equal to the T axable W age Base in such year , and
(ii)    That he will not receive any social security wages after Retirement or severance.
However , in computing a V ested Pension under Section 4.2, the estimate of the old-age insurance

for the twelve-month period commencing of the applicable April 1st date. However , if there are at least
200 Specified Employees without regard to this provision, then it shall not apply . If there are less than 200

(4)    Identification of Specified Employees Between February 26, 2010 and March 31, 2010 .

the Code, which permits “service recipients to simply combine the pre-transaction separate lists of
specified employees where it is determined that such treatment would be administratively less
burdensome.”
(5)     Identification of Specified Employees on and After April 1, 2010 . Notwithstanding the
foregoing, for the periods on after April 1, 2010, Key Employees shall be identified as follows:
(i)     For the period that begins on April 1, 2010, and ends on March 31, 2011, an employee
shall be a Specified Employee (subject to subparagraph (iii) below) if he was classified as at least

considered to be at least a Band IV or its equivalent as of a date if the employee is classified as
one of the following types of employees in the PepsiCo Organization on that date: (i) a Band IV
employee or above in a PepsiCo Business, (ii) a Level E7 employee or above in a PBG Business,
or (iii) a Salary Grade 19 employee or above at a P AS Business.
(ii)    For the twelve-month period that begins on April 1, 2011, and for each twelve-month

(iii)    Notwithstanding the rule of administrative convenience in paragraph (3) above, an
employee shall be a Specified Employee for the 12-month period that begins on any April 1, if as of the preceding
December 31 the employee would be a specified
- 142 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
employee, within the meaning of T reasury Regulation 1.409A-1(i), or any successor , by applying as of such December
31 the default rules that apply under such regulation for determining the minimum number of a service recipient’ s
specified employees. If the preceding sentence and the methods for identifying Specified Employees set forth in
subparagraph (i) or (ii) above, taken together , would result in more than 200 individuals being counted as Specified
Employees as of any December 31 determination date, then the number of individuals treated as Specified Employees
pursuant to subparagraph (i) or (ii), who are not described in the first sentence of this subparagraph (iii), shall be
reduced to 200 by eliminating from consideration those employees otherwise added by such subparagraph in order of
their base compensation, from the lowest base compensation to the highest.
(iv)    For purposes of this paragraph (5), “P AS Business” means each employer , division of
an employer or other organizational subdivision of an employer that the Company classifies as part of the P AS
business; “PBG Business” means each employer , division of an employer or other organizational subdivision of an
employer that the Company classifies as part of the PBG business; and “PepsiCo Business” means each employer ,
division of an employer or other organizational subdivision of an employer that the Company classifies as part of the
PepsiCo business.
The method for identifying Specified Employees set forth in this definition is intended as an alternative method of

applied consistently with the rules applicable to such alternative arrangements.

form and payable as of such time; over
(2)    The amount of the monthly pension benefit that is in fact payable to such Salaried Plan
Participant under the Salaried Plan, expressed in such form and payable as of such time.
The amount of the monthly pension benefit so determined, less the portion of such benefit that is the
Participant’ s Grandfathered Benefit, shall be payable as provided in Section 6.2.
- 145 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(b)    Different Form than Salaried Plan . If a Participant’ s PEP Pension will be paid in a dif ferent form
(whether in whole or in part) or will commence as of a dif ferent time than his pension benefit under the Salaried
Plan, his PEP Pension shall be the product of:
(1)    The greater of:
(i)    the monthly pension benefit which would have been payable to such Participant under
the Salaried Plan without regard to (I) the Compensation Limitation; (II) the Section 415 Limitation;
(III) the exclusion from Earnings of amounts deferred at the election of the Participant under the
EID on or after April 1, 2009 and before January 1, 2011; and (IV) the March 31, 2009 through
December 31, 2010 exclusion from the Salaried Plan definition of a Grandfathered Participant of a
Participant who, as of such date, was classified as salary band E3-E8 or MP and had attained age
50 and completed five years of Service or whose sum of his age and years of Service was at least
65; and
(ii)    if applicable, the amount determined in accordance with Section 4.2, expressed in the
form and payable as of such time as applies to his PEP Pension under this Plan, multiplied by
(2)    A fraction, the numerator of which is the value of the amount determined in Section 4.1(b)(1),
reduced by the value of his pension under the Salaried Plan, and the denominator of which is the value of
the amount determined in Section 4.1(b)(1) (with value determined on a reasonable and
- 146 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
consistent basis, in the discretion of the Plan Administrator , with respect to similarly situated employees).
The amount of the monthly pension benefit so determined, less the portion of such benefit that is the
Participant’ s Grandfathered Benefit, shall be payable as provided in Section 6.2.
Notwithstanding the above, in the event any portion of the accrued benefit of a Participant under this Plan
or the Salaried Plan is awarded to an alternate payee pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order , as such
terms are defined in Section 414(p) of the Code, the Participant’ s total PEP Pension shall be adjusted, as the
Plan Administrator shall determine, so that the combined benefit payable to the Participant and the alternate
payee from this Plan and the Salaried Plan is the amount determined pursuant to subsections 4.1(a) and (b)
above, as applicable.
4.2    PEP Guarantee . Subject to Section 8.7, a Participant who is eligible under subsection (a) below shall be
entitled to a PEP Guarantee benefit determined under subsection (b) below , if any .
(a)    Eligibility . A Participant shall be covered by this section if the Participant has 1988 pensionable
earnings from an Employer of at least $75,000. For purposes of this section, “1988 pensionable earnings”
means the Participant’ s remuneration for the 1988 calendar year that was recognized for benefit accrual
received under the Salaried Plan as in ef fect in 1988. “1988 pensionable earnings” does not include
remuneration from an entity attributable to any period when that entity was not an Employer .
(b)    PEP Guarantee Formula . The amount of a Participant’ s PEP Guarantee shall be determined under
paragraph (1), subject to the special rules in paragraph (2).
- 147 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(1)    Formula . The amount of a Participant’ s PEP Guarantee under this paragraph shall be
determined as follows:
(i)    Three percent of the Participant’ s Highest A verage Monthly Earnings for the first 10
years of Credited Service, plus
(ii)    One percent of the Participant’ s Highest A verage Monthly Earnings for each year of
Credited Service in excess of 10 years, less
(iii)    One and two-thirds percent of the Participant’ s Primary Social Security Amount
multiplied by years of Credited Service not in excess of 30 years.
In determining the amount of a V ested Pension, the PEP Guarantee shall first be calculated on the
basis of (I) the Credited Service the Participant would have earned had he continued to accrue Credited
Service until his Normal Retirement Age, and (II) his Highest A verage Monthly Earnings and Primary
Social Security Amount at the earlier of his Severance from Service Date or the date such Participant
ceased to accrue additional benefits under both the Salaried Plan and this Plan, and then shall be
reduced by multiplying the resulting amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Participant’ s
actual years of Credited Service on the earlier of his Severance from Service Date or the date such
Participant ceased to accrue additional benefits under both the Salaried Plan and this Plan and the
denominator of which is the years of Credited Service he would have earned had he continued to accrue
Credited Service until his Normal Retirement Age.
- 148 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(2)    Calculation . The amount of the PEP Guarantee shall be determined pursuant to paragraph
(1) above, subject to the following special rules:
(i)    Surviving Eligible Spouse’ s or Eligible Domestic Partner ’s Annuity : Subject to
subparagraph (iii) below and the last sentence of this subparagraph, if the Participant has an
Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner and has commenced receipt of an Annuity under this
section, the Participant’ s Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall be entitled to receive a
survivor annuity equal to 50 percent of the Participant’ s Annuity under this section, with no
corresponding reduction in such Annuity for the Participant. Annuity payments to a surviving
Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall begin on the first day of the month coincident
with or following the Participant’ s death and shall end with the last monthly payment due prior to
the Eligible Spouse’ s or Eligible Domestic Partner ’s death. If the Eligible Spouse or Eligible
Domestic Partner is more than 10 years younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable
under this subparagraph shall be adjusted as provided below .
(A)    For each full year more than 10 but less than 21 that the surviving Eligible
Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner is younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit
payable to such spouse shall be reduced by 0.8 percent.
- 149 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(B)    For each full year more than 20 that the surviving Eligible Spouse or Eligible
Domestic Partner is younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable to such
spouse shall be reduced by an additional 0.4 percent.
This subparagraph applies only to a Participant who retires on or after his Early Retirement
Date.
(ii)    Reductions . The following reductions shall apply in determining a Participant’ s PEP
Guarantee.
(A)    If the Participant will receive an Early Retirement Pension, the payment amount
shall be reduced by 3/12ths of 1 percent for each month by which the benefit
commencement date precedes the date the Participant would attain his Normal Retirement
Date.
(B)    If the Participant is entitled to a V ested Pension, the payment amount shall be reduced
to the Actuarial Equivalent of the amount payable at his Normal Retirement Date (if payment
commences before such date), and the reductions set forth in the Salaried Plan for any Pre-
Retirement Spouse’ s coverage or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s coverage shall apply .
(C)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his PEP Guarantee in a form that
provides an Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner benefit, continuing for the life of the
surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner , that is greater than that provided under
subparagraph
- 150 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(i). In this instance, the Participant’ s PEP Guarantee under this section shall be reduced so that the
total value of the benefit payable on the Participant’ s behalf is the Actuarial Equivalent of the PEP
Guarantee otherwise payable under the foregoing provisions of this section.
(D)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his PEP Guarantee in a form that
provides a survivor annuity for a beneficiary who is not his Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic
Partner . In this instance, the Participant’ s PEP Guarantee under this section shall be reduced so
that the total value of the benefit payable on the Participant’ s behalf is the Actuarial Equivalent of a
Single Life Annuity for the Participant’ s life.
(E)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his PEP Guarantee in an Annuity form
that includes inflation protection described in the Salaried Plan. In this instance, the Participant’ s
PEP Guarantee under this section shall be reduced so that the total value of the benefit payable on
the Participant’ s behalf is the Actuarial Equivalent of the elected Annuity without such protection.
(iii)    Lump Sum Conversion . The amount of the PEP Guarantee determined under this section for
a Participant whose Retirement Pension will be distributed in the form of a lump sum shall be the
Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant’ s PEP Guarantee determined under this section, taking into
account the value of any survivor benefit under subparagraph (i) above and any early retirement
reductions under subparagraph (ii)(A) above.
- 151 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(iv)    April 1, 2009 Salaried Plan Changes.
(A)    The amount of the PEP Guarantee determined under this section for a Participant
who, as of March 31, 2009, was classified as salary band E3-E8 or MP and who had attained age
50 and completed five years of Service or (inclusively) whose sum of his age and years of Service
was at least 65 shall be determined as if such Participant were a Grandfathered Participant in the
Salaried Plan on April 1, 2009 (so that Earnings and Credited Service were not frozen as of March
31, 2009 for the period April 1, 2009 through December 31, 2010).
(B)    Highest A verage Monthly Earnings shall be determined without regard to the exclusion
from Earnings under the Salaried Plan of amounts deferred at the election of the Participant under
the EID on or after April 1, 2009 and before January 1, 2011.
4.3    Certain Adjustments . Pensions determined under the foregoing sections of this Article are subject to
adjustment as provided in this section. For purposes of this section, “specified plan” shall mean the Salaried Plan or a
nonqualified pension plan similar to this Plan. A nonqualified pension plan is similar to this Plan if it is sponsored by a
member of the PBG Organization and if its benefits are not based on participant pay deferrals (this category of similar
plans includes the PepsiCo Prior Plan).
(a)    Adjustments for Rehired Participants . This subsection shall apply to a current or former
Participant who is reemployed after his Annuity Starting Date and (i) whose benefit under the Salaried Plan is
recalculated based on an additional period of Credited Service, or (ii) whose benefit under the Salaried Plan
would have been
- 152 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
recalculated, based on an additional period of Credited Service if the Participant would have been considered a
Grandfathered Participant as defined in Section 3.7 of the Salaried Plan if the Participant was not classified by
the Employer as salary band E3-E8 or MP . In such event, the Participant’ s PEP Pension shall be recalculated
hereunder . For this purpose, the PEP Guarantee under Section 4.2 is adjusted for in-service distributions and
prior distributions in the same manner as benefits are adjusted under the Salaried Plan, but by taking into
account benefits under this Plan and any specified plans.
(b)    Adjustment for Increased Pension Under Other Plans . If the benefit paid under a specified plan
on behalf of a Participant is increased after PEP benefits on his behalf have been determined (whether the
increase is by order of a court, by agreement of the plan administrator of the specified plan, or otherwise), the
PEP benefit for the Participant shall be recalculated. If the recalculation identifies an overpayment hereunder ,
the Plan Administrator shall take such steps as it deems advisable to recover the overpayment. It is specifically
intended that there shall be no duplication of payments under this Plan and any specified plans.
(c)    No Benefit Offsets That W ould V iolate Section 409A . If a Participant has earned a benefit under a
plan maintained by a member of the PepsiCo/PBG Organization that is a “qualifying plan” for purposes of the
“Non-Duplication” rule in Section 3.8 of Part A of the Salaried Plan and the “T ransfers and Non-Duplication” rule
in Section 3.6 of Part C of the Salaried Plan, such T ransfers and Non-Duplication rules shall apply when
calculating the amount determined under Section 4.1(a)(1) or 4.1(b)(1) above (as applicable) only to the extent
the application of such rule will not result in a change in the time or form of payment of such pension that is
prohibited by Section 409A. For
- 153 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
purposes of the limit on of fsets in the preceding sentence, it is the Company’ s intent to undertake to make
special arrangements with respect to the payment of the benefit under the qualifying plan that are legally
permissible under the qualifying plan, and compliant with Section 409A, in order to avoid such a change in time
or form of payment to the maximum extent possible; to the extent that Section 409A compliant special
arrangements are timely put into ef fect in a particular situation, the limit on of fsets in the prior sentence will not
apply .
4.4    Reemployment of Certain Participants . In the case of a current or former Participant who is reemployed
and is eligible to reparticipate in the Salaried Plan after his Annuity Starting Date, payment of his non-Grandfathered
PEP Pension will not be suspended. If such Participant accrues an additional PEP Pension for service after such
reemployment, his PEP Pension on his subsequent Separation from Service shall be reduced by the present value of
PEP benefits previously distributed to such Participant, as determined by the Plan Administrator .
4.5    Vesting; Misconduct . Subject to Section 8.7, a Participant shall be fully vested in his Accrued Benefit at
the time he becomes fully vested in his accrued benefit under the Salaried Plan. Notwithstanding the preceding, or any
other provision of the Plan to the contrary , a Participant shall forfeit his or her entire PEP Pension if the Plan
Administrator determines that such Participant has engaged in “Misconduct” as defined below , determined without
regard to whether the Misconduct occurred before or after the Participant’ s Severance from Service. The Plan
Administrator may , in its sole discretion, require the Participant to pay to the Employer any PEP Pension paid to the
Participant within the twelve month period immediately preceding a date on which the Participant has engaged in such
Misconduct, as determined by the Plan Administrator .
- 154 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
“Misconduct” means any of the following, as determined by the Plan Administrator in good faith: (i) violation of
any agreement between the Company or Employer and the Participant, including but not limited to a violation relating to
the disclosure of confidential information or trade secrets, the solicitation of employees, customers, suppliers, licensors
or contractors, or the performance of competitive services, (ii) violation of any duty to the Company or Employer ,
including but not limited to violation of the Company’ s Code of Conduct; (iii) making, or causing or attempting to cause
any other person to make, any statement (whether written, oral or electronic), or conveying any information about the
Company or Employer which is disparaging or which in any way reflects negatively upon the Company or Employer
unless required by law or pursuant to a Company or Employer policy; (iv) improperly disclosing or otherwise misusing
any confidential information regarding the Company or Employer; (v) unlawful trading in the securities of the Company
or of another company based on information garnered as a result of that Participant’ s employment or other relationship
with the Company; (vi) engaging in any act which is considered to be contrary to the best interests of the Company or
Employer , including but not limited to recruiting or soliciting employees of the Employer; or (vii) commission of a felony
or other serious crime or engaging in any activity which constitutes gross misconduct. Notwithstanding the foregoing
and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Plan shall prohibit the Participant from communicating with government
authorities concerning any possible legal violations.  The Company nonetheless asserts and does not waive its
attorney-client privilege over any information appropriately protected by the privilege.

time. If the Participant dies after such election becomes ef fective but before his non-Grandfathered PEP
Pension actually commences, the election shall be given ef fect and the amount payable to his surviving
Eligible Spouse or other beneficiary shall commence on the first day of the month following his death (any
back payments due the Participant shall be payable to his estate). In the case of a Participant who
elected a 10 Y ear Certain and Life Annuity , if such Participant dies: (i) after benefits have commenced; (ii)
without a surviving primary or contingent beneficiary , and (iii) before receiving 120 payments under the
form of payment, then the remaining payments due under such form of payment shall be paid to the
Participant’ s estate. If payments have commenced under such form of payment to a Participant’ s primary
or contingent beneficiary and such beneficiary dies before payments are completed,
- 159 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
then the remaining payments due under such form of payment shall be paid to such beneficiary’ s estate.

more than 19 years younger than he is.
6.3    Designation of Beneficiary . A Participant who has elected to receive all or part of his pension in a form of
payment that includes a survivor option shall designate a beneficiary who will be entitled to any amounts payable on his
death. Such designation shall be made on a PEP Election Form. A Participant shall have the right to change or revoke
his beneficiary designation at any time prior to when his election is finally ef fective. The designation of any beneficiary ,
and any change or revocation thereof, shall be made in accordance with rules adopted by the Plan Administrator . A
beneficiary designation shall not be ef fective unless and until filed with the Plan Administrator
6.4    Determination of Single Lump Sum Amounts . Except as otherwise provided below , a Single Lump Sum
payable under Article V or Section 6.1 shall be determined in the same manner as the single lump sum payment option
prescribed in Section 6.1(b)(3) of the Salaried Plan.
(a)    Vested Pensions . If on the date of Separation from Service of a Participant such Participant is not
entitled to retire with an immediate pension under the Salaried Plan, the Single Lump Sum payable to the
Participant under Section 6.1 shall

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
be determined in the same manner as the single lump sum payment option prescribed in Section 6.1(b)(3) of the
Salaried Plan but substituting (for Plan Y ears beginning before 2012) the applicable segment rates for the
blended 30 year T reasury and segment rates that would otherwise be applicable.
(b)    2008 Reorganization . Notwithstanding subsection (a) above, the Single Lump Sum payment for a
Participant whose employment was involuntarily terminated as a result of the 2008 Reorganization on or after
November 1, 2008 and on or before December 19, 2008 shall be determined based on the applicable interest
rates and mortality used by the Salaried Plan for optional lump sum distributions in December 2008, provided
that in no event shall such Single Lump Sum payment be less than the Single Lump Sum determined based on
the applicable interest rates and mortality used by the Salaried Plan for lump sum distributions for the month in
which the Single Lump Sum is distributed to the Participant.
6.5    Section 162(m) Postponement . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary , no PEP
Pension shall be paid to any Participant prior to the earliest date on which the Company’ s federal income tax deduction
for such payment is not precluded by Section 162(m) of the Code. In the event any payment is delayed solely as a
result of the preceding restriction, such payment shall be made as soon as administratively feasible following the first
date as of which Section 162(m) of the Code no longer precludes the deduction by the Company of such payment.
Amounts deferred because of the Section 162(m) deduction limitation shall be increased by simple interest for the
period of delay at the annual rate of six percent (6%).

ARTICLE I – INTRODUCTION
PepsiCo, Inc. (the "Company") established the PepsiCo Director Deferral Program (the “Plan”) to permit Eligible Directors
to defer certain compensation paid to them as Directors.
The Plan consists of two primary components, each of which is subject to separate documentation: (i) deferrals under the
Plan that were earned and vested prior to the 2004-2005 Compensation Y ear (the “Pre-409A Program”), and (ii) and deferrals under
the Plan that were not earned and vested prior to the 2004-2005 Compensation Y ear (the “409A Program”). The 409A Program is
governed by this document. The Pre-409A Program is governed by a separate set of documents. Except as otherwise provided
herein, this document reflects the provisions in ef fect from and after January 1, 2005, and the rights and benefits of individuals who
are Participants in the Plan from and after that date (and of those claiming through or on behalf of such individuals) shall be
governed by the provisions of this document in the case of actions and events occurring on or after January 1, 2005, with respect to
deferrals that are subject to the 409A Program. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “actions and events” shall include
all distribution trigger events and dates. The rights and benefits with respect to persons who only participated in the Plan prior to
January 1, 2005 shall be governed by the applicable provisions of the Pre-409A Program documents that were in ef fect at such
time, and shall not be governed by the 409A Program documents.
The Plan was restated on March 10, 201 1. This restatement amended the Plan’ s rules regarding installment payment options
by (i) adding a 10-year installment payment option to the Plan, and (ii) eliminating the prohibition on the payment of installments
after a Participant has attained age 80. The restatement also extended the minimum deferral period for elective deferrals to the first
day of the Plan Y ear following the date that is 12 months after the date the Director Compensation would otherwise be payable to
the Participant. All of these changes are ef fective for deferral elections made on and after March 1 1, 201 1.
The document for the 409A Program was restated as of September 19, 2012. This restatement reflected changes in the
Company’ s payment of Retainer Compensation, which shifted from payment annually in advance (on each October 1) to
semiannually in arrears (with the first payment in arrears to be made in December 2013 for services as a Director during the period
June 1, 2013 to November 30, 2013).
The document for the 409A Program was restated as of February 2, 2017. This restatement reflected the shift in
responsibility of reviewing and reportin g on director compensation from the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to
the Compensation Committee approved by the Board of Directors on November 17, 2016.
The docum ent for the 4049A Program was most recently restated as of December 20, 2107, to reflect the Company’ s
transferring its stock exchange listing from the New Y ork Stock Exchange to The Nasdaq Global Select Market.
1
Together , the documents for the 409A Program and the documents for the Pre-409A Program describe the terms of a single
plan. However , amounts subject to the terms of this 409A Program and amounts subject to the terms of the Pre-409A Program shall
be tracked separately at all times. The preservation of the terms of the Pre-409A Program, without material modification, and the
separation between the 409A Program amounts and the Pre-409A Program amounts are intended to permit the Pre-409A Program
to remain exempt from Section 409A and the administration of the Plan shall be consistent with this intent.
For federal income tax purposes, the Plan is intended to be a nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plan that is
unfunded and unsecured. For purposes of ERISA, the Plan is intended to be exempt from ERISA coverage as a plan that solely
benefits non-employees (or alternatively , a plan described in Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA providing benefits
to a select group of management or highly compensated employees).

from his or her compensation pursuant to an Election Form submitted by the Director to the Plan Administrator under Section 4.01
or, effective October 1, 2007, the date on which a Mandatory Deferral is first credited to the Plan on his or her behalf under Section
4.05.

An individual’ s eligibility to participate actively by making deferrals under Section 4.01 shall cease as soon as
administratively practicable following the date he or she ceases to be a Director .

An individual, who has been an active Participant under the Plan, ceases to be a Participant on the date his or her Account is
fully paid out.

ARTICLE IV– DEFERRAL OF COMPENSA TION
4.01     Deferral Election :
(a)    Each Eligible Director may make an election to defer under the Plan in 10% increments up to 100% of his or
her Retainer Compensation for an applicable period in the manner described in Section 4.02. Such election to defer shall apply to
Retainer Compensation in accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) below , whichever applies as of the time in question.
(1)    Effective for Compensation Y ears beginning on or after October 1, 2013 (October 1, 2012, for a
Director joining the Board after 201 1), a Director ’s deferral election shall apply to Retainer Compensation that, in the
absence of a deferral election, would be paid to the Director during a single calendar year . A newly Eligible Director may
only defer the portion of his or her Retainer Compensation, which otherwise would be payable in the calendar year in which
he or she becomes an Eligible Director , to the extent that it is earned for services performed after the date of his or her
election. For this purpose, if a valid Election Form is received prior to the date on which the Eligible Director becomes a
Director and the Election Form is ef fective under Section 4.02 as of the date on which the Eligible Director becomes a
Director , then the Director shall be deemed to earn all of his or her Retainer Compensation for the calendar year in which he
or she becomes an Eligible Director after the date of the election; otherwise, only Retainer Compensation earned for months
that begin after when the newly Eligible Director ’s Election Form is received are subject to deferral. Any Retainer
Compensation deferred by an Eligible Director for a calendar year will be deducted on each payment date during the
calendar year for which he or she has Retainer Compensation and is an Eligible Director . In accordance with the default rule
in Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-2(a)(13), Retainer Compensation that is paid – (i) following the end of a calendar year (in
accordance with normal payment timing arrangements for the payroll period that contains the last day of such calendar
year), and (ii) for services performed during such calendar year , shall be treated as Retainer Compensation for services
performed during the following calendar year (and will be subject to deferral only in accordance with a deferral election for
such following calendar year).
(2)    Effective for Compensation Y ears beginning before October 1, 2013 (October 1, 2012, for a Director
joining the Board after 201 1), a Director ’s deferral election shall apply to Retainer Compensation that is earned for services
performed in the corresponding Compensation Y ear. A newly Eligible Director may only defer the portion of his or her
eligible Retainer Compensation for the Compensation Y ear in which he or she becomes an Eligible Director that is earned
for services performed after the date of his or her election. For this purpose, if a valid Election Form is received prior to the
date on which the Eligible Director becomes a Director and the Election Form is ef fective under Section 4.02 as of the date
on which the Eligible Director becomes a Director , then the Director shall be deemed to receive all of his or her Retainer
Compensation for the Compensation Y ear in which he or she becomes an Eligible Director after the date of the election.
Any Retainer Compensation deferred by an Eligible Director for a Compensation Y ear will be deducted for each payment
period during the Compensation Y ear for which he or she has Retainer Compensation and is an Eligible Director . Retainer
12
Compensation paid after the end of a Compensation Y ear for services performed during such initial Compensation Y ear
shall be treated as Director Compensation for services performed during such initial Compensation Y ear.
(b)    To be ef fective, an Eligible Director ’s Election Form must set forth the percentage of Retainer Compensation
to be deferred and any other information that may be requested by the Plan Administrator from time to time. In addition, the
Election Form must meet the requirements of Section 4.02.
4.02     Time and Manner of Deferral Election :
(a)    Deferral Election Deadlines . An Eligible Director must make a deferral election for Retainer Compensation in
accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) below , whichever applies as of the time in question.
(1)    Effective for Compensation Y ears beginning on or after October 1, 2013 (October 1, 2012, for a
Director joining the Board after 201 1), a Director ’s deferral election for Retainer Compensation shall be made no later than
November 15 of the calendar year that immediately precedes the calendar year in which such Retainer Compensation would
be paid in the absence of a deferral election. If November 15 of such calendar year is not a business day , then the deferral
election must be made by the first business day following November 15 of such year . A newly Eligible Director may submit
an Election Form (i) prior to becoming an Eligible Director , or (ii) on or after becoming an Eligible Director , but any form
submitted must be received within 30 days of when he or she first becomes an Eligible Director (and such Election Form
will be ef fective immediately upon receipt or , if later , the commencement of the individual’ s status as an Eligible Director).
(2)    Effective for Compensation Y ears beginning before October 1, 2013 (October 1, 2012, for a Director
joining the Board after 201 1), a Director ’s deferral election for Retainer Compensation earned for services performed in a
Compensation Y ear shall be made no later than December 31 of the calendar year immediately prior to the beginning of the
Compensation Y ear (although the Plan Administrator may adopt policies that encourage or require earlier submission of
election forms). If December 31 of such year is not a business day , then the deadline for deferral elections will be the first
business day preceding December 31 of such year . In addition, an individual, who has been nominated for Director status,
must submit an Election Form prior to becoming an Eligible Director or otherwise prior to rendering services as an Eligible
Director , and such Election Form will be ef fective immediately upon commencement of the individual’ s status as an
Eligible Director or otherwise upon commencement of his or her services as an Eligible Director .
(b)    General Provisions . A separate deferral election under subsection (a) above must be made by an Eligible
Director in accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) below , whichever applies as of the time in question.
13
(1)    Effective for Compensation Y ears beginning on or after October 1, 2013 (October 1, 2012, for a
Director joining the Board after 201 1), a separate deferral election under subsection (a) above must be made by an Eligible
Director for each calendar year ’s Retainer Compensation. If a properly completed and executed Election Form is not
actually received by the Plan Administrator (or , if authorized by the Plan Administrator for this purpose, the Recordkeeper)
by the time prescribed in subsection (a)(1) above, the Eligible Director will be deemed to have elected not to defer any
Retainer Compensation for the applicable calendar year . Except as provided in the next sentence, an election is irrevocable
once received and determined by the Plan Administrator to be properly completed (and such determination shall be made
not later than the last date for making the election in question). Increases or decreases in the amount or percentage an
Eligible Director elects to defer for a calendar year shall not be permitted from and after the beginning of the calendar year
to which the deferral election applies (or in the case of a Newly Eligible Director ’s first calendar year , from and after the
effective date of his or her deferral election for such calendar year). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if an Eligible
Director receives a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emer gency pursuant to Section 6.06, the Plan Administrator
may cancel the Eligible Director ’s deferral election for the calendar year in which such distribution occurs. If an election is
cancelled because of a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emer gency , such cancellation shall permanently apply to
the deferral election for such calendar year , and the Director may be eligible to make a new deferral election only for a
subsequent calendar year (and only as permitted by the rules in Sections 4.01 and 4.02).
(2)    Effective for Compensation Y ears beginning before October 1, 2013 (October 1, 2012, for a Director
joining the Board after 201 1), a separate deferral election under subsection (a) above must be made by an Eligible Director
for each Compensation Y ear’s Retainer Compensation that is eligible for deferral. If a properly completed and executed
Election Form is not actually received by the Plan Administrator (or , if authorized by the Plan Administrator for this
purpose, the Recordkeeper) by the time prescribed in subsection (a)(2) above, the Eligible Director will be deemed to have
elected not to defer any Retainer Compensation for the applicable Compensation Y ear. Except as provided in the next
sentence, an election is irrevocable once received and determined by the Plan Administrator to be properly completed (and
such determination shall be made not later than the last date for making the election in question). Increases or decreases in
the amount or percentage an Eligible Director elects to defer shall not be permitted from and after the beginning of the
calendar year during which the applicable Compensation Y ear begins (or in the case of a Newly Eligible Director ’s first
Compensation Y ear, from and after the date he or she becomes an Eligible Director); provided that if an Eligible Director
receives a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emer gency pursuant to Section 6.06, the Plan Administrator may
cancel the Eligible Director ’s deferral election for the year in which such distribution occurs. If an election is cancelled
because of a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emer gency , such cancellation shall permanently apply to the
deferral election for such year , and the Director may be eligible to make a new deferral election only for a subsequent year
(and only as permitted by the rules in Sections 4.01 and 4.02).
14
(c)    Beneficiaries . A Participant may designate on the Election Form (or in some other manner authorized by the
Plan Administrator) one or more Beneficiaries to receive payment, in the event of his or her death, of the amounts credited to his or
her Account; provided that, to be ef fective, any Beneficiary designation must be in writing, signed by the Participant, and must
meet such other standards (including any requirement for spousal consent) as the Plan Administrator shall require from time to
time. The Beneficiary designation must also be filed with the Plan Administrator (or Recordkeeper , if designated by the Plan
Administrator for this purpose) prior to the Participant’ s death. An incomplete Beneficiary designation, as determined by the Plan
Administrator (or Recordkeeper , if designated by the Plan Administrator for this purpose), shall be void and of no ef fect. In
determining whether a Beneficiary designation that relates to the Plan is in ef fect, unrevoked designations that were received under
the Pre-409A Program or prior to the Ef fective Date shall be considered. A Beneficiary designation of an individual by name
remains in ef fect regardless of any change in the designated individual’ s relationship to the Participant. Any Beneficiary
designation submitted to the Plan Administrator (or Recordkeeper , if designated by the Plan Administrator for this purpose) that
only specifies a Beneficiary by relationship shall not be considered an ef fective Beneficiary designation and shall be void and of no
effect. If more than one Beneficiary is specified and the Participant fails to indicate the respective percentage applicable to two or
more Beneficiaries, then each Beneficiary for whom a percentage is not designated will be entitled to an equal share of the portion
of the Account (if any) for which percentages have not been designated. At any time, a Participant may change a Beneficiary
designation for his or her Account in a writing that is signed by the Participant and filed with the Plan Administrator (or
Recordkeeper , if designated by the Plan Administrator for this purpose) prior to the Participant’ s death, and that meets such other
standards as the Plan Administrator shall require from time to time. An individual who is otherwise a Beneficiary with respect to a
Participant’ s Account ceases to be a Beneficiary when all payments have been made from the Account.
4.03     Period of Deferral; Form of Payment :
(a)    Period of Deferral . An Eligible Director making a deferral election shall specify a deferral period on his or
her Election Form by designating either a Specific Payment Date or the date he or she incurs a Separation from Service. Solely for
elections made prior to March 1 1, 201 1, an Eligible Director ’s Specific Payment Date shall not be later than his or her 80th birthday
(and the specification of such a later date shall be deemed instead to specify the Director ’s 80th birthday as the Specific Payment
Date). In addition, an Eligible Director shall be deemed to have elected a period of deferral of not less than the first day of the Plan
Year after (i) for elections made on or after March 1 1, 201 1, the date that is 12 months after the date the Retainer Compensation
would have been paid absent the deferral, and (ii) for elections made prior to March 1 1, 201 1, the end of the Plan Y ear during
which the Director Compensation would have been paid absent the deferral. If the Specific Payment Date selected by an Eligible
Director would result in a period of deferral that is less than the minimum, the Eligible Director shall be deemed to have selected a
Specific Payment Date equal to the minimum period of deferral as provided in the preceding sentence. If an Eligible Director fails
to affirmatively designate a period of deferral on his or her Election Form, he or she shall be deemed to have specified the date on
which he or she incurs a Separation from Service.
15
(b)    Form of Payment . This subsection (b) is ef fective for elective deferral elections filed for Compensation Y ears
beginning from and after October 1, 2009; see the Appendix for rules applicable prior to that date.
(1)    Elections on or After March 1 1, 201 1. Effective for elections made on or after March 1 1, 201 1, an
Eligible Director making a deferral election shall specify a form of payment on his or her Election Form by designating
either a lump sum payment or annual installment payments to be paid over a period 5 or 10 years.
(2)    Elections Prior to March 1 1, 201 1. Effective for elections made prior to March 1 1, 201 1, an Eligible
Director making a deferral election shall specify a form of payment on his or her Election Form by designating either a
lump sum payment or annual installment payments to be paid over a period of 5 years but not later than the Eligible
Director ’s 80th birthday . If the Eligible Director elects installment payments and the installments would otherwise extend
beyond the Eligible Director ’s 80th birthday , such election shall be treated as an election for installments over a period of
whole and partial years that ends on the Eligible Director ’s 80th birthday; provided that the amounts to be distributed in
connection with the installments prior to the Eligible Director ’s 80th birthday shall be determined in accordance with
Section 6.08 by assuming that the installments shall continue for the full number of installments with the entire remaining
amount of the relevant Deferral Subaccount distributed on the Eligible Director ’s 80th birthday .
If an Eligible Director fails to make a form of payment election for a deferral under paragraphs (1) or (2) above, he or she shall be
deemed to have elected a lump sum payment. Initial form of payment elections for Mandatory Deferrals are governed by Section
4.05.
4.04     Second Look Election :
(a)    General . Subject to Subsection (b) below , a Participant who has made a valid initial deferral in accordance
with the foregoing provisions of this Article may subsequently make another one-time election regarding the time and/or form of
payment of his or her deferral. This opportunity to modify the Participant’ s initial election is referred to as a “Second Look
Election.”
(b)    Requirements for Second Look Elections . A Second Look Election must be made on an Election Form that
the Plan Administrator provides for this purpose, and it must comply with all of the following requirements:
(1)    If a Participant’ s initial election specified payment based on a Specific Payment Date, the Participant
may only make a Second Look Election if the election is made at least 12 months before the Participant’ s original Specific
Payment Date. In addition, in this case the Participant’ s Second Look Election must provide for a new Specific Payment
Date that is at least 5 years after the original Specific Payment Date. For Second Look Elections made prior to March 1 1,
2011, if the Specific Payment Date applicable pursuant to the Second Look Election is after the Participant’ s 80th birthday ,
either by the Participant’ s choice or if necessary to comply with the 5-year rule stated above, the Second Look Election is
void.
16
(2)    If a Participant’ s initial election specified payment based on the Participant’ s Separation from
Service, the Participant may only make a Second Look Election if the election is made at least 12 months before the
Participant’ s Separation from Service. In addition, in this case the Participant must elect a new Specific Payment Date that
turns out to be at least 5 years after the Participant’ s Separation from Service. If the new Specific Payment Date selected in
the Second Look Election turns out to be less than five years after the Participant’ s Separation from Service, the Second
Look Election is void.
(3)    A Participant may make only one Second Look Election for each individual deferral, and each
Second Look Election must comply with all of the relevant requirements of this Section.
(4)    A Participant who uses a Second Look Election to change the form of the Participant’ s payment from
a lump sum to installments shall be subject to the rules for installment payment elections in Sections 4.03(b)(1) and (2), and
such installment payments must begin no earlier than 5 years after when the lump sum payment would have been paid
based upon the Participant’ s initial election.
(5)    If a Participant’ s initial election specified payment in the form of installments and the Participant
wants to elect instead payment in a lump sum, the earliest payment date of the lump sum must be no earlier than 5 years
after the first payment date that applied under the Participant’ s initial installment election.
(6)    For purposes of this Section and compliance with Section 409A, all of a Participant’ s installment
payments related to a specific deferral election shall be treated as a single payment.
A Second Look Election will be void and payment will be made based on the Participant’ s original election under Section
4.03 if all of the relevant provisions of this subsection (b) are not satisfied in full. However , if a Participant’ s Second Look Election
becomes ef fective in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b), the Participant’ s original election shall be superseded
(including any Specific Payment Date specified therein), and the original election shall not be taken into account with respect to the
deferral that is subject to the Second Look Election.
(c)    Plan Administrator ’s Role . Each Participant has the sole responsibility to elect a Second Look Election by
contacting the Plan Administrator (or , if authorized by the Plan Administrator , the Recordkeeper) and to comply with the
requirements of this Section. The Plan Administrator or the Recordkeeper may provide a notice of a Second Look Election
opportunity to some or all Participants, but the Recordkeeper and Plan Administrator is under no obligation to provide such notice
(or to provide it to all Participants, in the event a notice is provided only to some Participants). The Recordkeeper and the Plan
Administrator have no discretion to waive or otherwise modify any requirement for a Second Look Election set forth in this Section
or in Section 409A.
17
4.05     Mandatory Deferrals:
(a)    General . As provided in this Section, the Board of Directors of the Company may require that Director
Compensation be deferred under the Plan. Such portion of an Eligible Director ’s Director Compensation that the Board of Directors
of the Company requires to be deferred under this Section 4.05 shall be referred to as a “Mandatory Deferral.”
(b)    Time for Committee’ s Determination . To be ef fective hereunder , any determination by the Board of Directors
of the Company to require a Mandatory Deferral of a portion of an Eligible Director ’s Director Compensation must be made no
later than the December 31 immediately preceding the calendar year in which the Eligible Director performs the services to which
such Director Compensation relates (or , to the extent the Eligible Director is not permitted to make any payment election with
respect to such Mandatory Deferral and it would result in a later deadline, immediately prior to the time the Eligible Director first
has a legally binding right to such Director Compensation). As of such date or time, the determination by the Board of Directors of
the Company to require the deferral of the Director Compensation shall be irrevocable. Any Mandatory Deferral shall be credited to
a separate Deferral Subaccount that is maintained for such Mandatory Deferral.
(c)    Current Mandatory Deferrals . Pursuant to a September 14, 2007 resolution of the Board of Directors of the
Company , a Mandatory Deferral of $150,000 shall be credited as of October 1 of each year to each individual who is an Eligible
Director on such October 1, commencing with a Mandatory Deferral on October 1, 2007; provided that (1) a Director newly
appointed or elected to the Board of Directors of the Company shall be credited with a pro-rated Mandatory Deferral as of the
commencement date of his or her status as a Director , with such pro-rated amount determined by multiplying such Mandatory
Deferral by the ratio of the number of full and partial quarters remaining during the Applicable 12-Month Period (as defined below)
as of such commencement date over four , and (2) the Board of Directors of the Company retains the discretion to change the
amount subject to Mandatory Deferral or eliminate Mandatory Deferrals entirely with respect to Applicable 12-Month Periods after
the 2007-2008 Compensation Y ear. At the same time, any such discretion shall not alter the determination to defer Director
Compensation to the extent such determination has become irrevocable with respect to specific Director Compensation in
accordance with subsection (b) above. However , the preceding sentence shall not limit the discretion of the Company’ s Board of
Directors to forfeit outright specific Director Compensation. For purposes of this Section, “Applicable 12-Month Period” shall
mean the 12-month period that begins on October 1 of a year and ends on September 30 of the following year .
(d)    Time and Form of Payment . Each Mandatory Deferral shall be distributed in accordance with Section 6.07.
The Eligible Director shall specify the form of payment of each of his or her Mandatory Deferrals in accordance with the
following:
(1)    Elections on or After March 1 1, 201 1. Effective for elections made on or after March 1 1, 201 1, an
Eligible Director shall designate either a lump sum payment or annual installment payments to be paid over a period of 5 or
10 years.
18
(2)    Elections Prior to March 1 1, 201 1. Effective for elections made prior to March 1 1, 201 1, an Eligible
Director shall designate either a lump sum payment or annual installment payments to be paid over a period of 5 years.
Installments are not available if the first installment would begin on or after the Eligible Director ’s 80th birthday . If the
Eligible Director elects installment payments and the installments would otherwise begin before and extend beyond the
Eligible Director ’s 80th birthday , such election shall be treated as an election for installments over a period of whole and
partial years that ends on the Eligible Director ’s 80th birthday; provided that the amounts to be distributed in connection
with the installments prior to the Eligible Director ’s 80th birthday shall be determined in accordance with Section 6.08 by
assuming that the installments shall continue for the full number of installments, with the entire remaining amount of the
relevant Deferral Subaccount distributed on the Eligible Director ’s 80th birthday . No such election shall be permitted for the
Mandatory Deferral for the 2007-2008 Compensation Y ear.
If permitted under paragraphs (1) or (2) above, an Eligible Director shall make a form of payment election with respect to a
Mandatory Deferral no later than December 31 immediately preceding the calendar year in which the Eligible Director provides the
services to which the Mandatory Deferral relates (although the Plan Administrator may adopt policies that encourage or require
earlier submission of election forms). In addition, an individual shall not be eligible to make a form of payment election for a
Mandatory Deferral granted to an individual for his first Applicable 12-Month Period as an Eligible Director , unless such individual
submits the election prior to becoming an Eligible Director or otherwise prior to rendering services as an Eligible Director , and then
such election shall be ef fective immediately upon commencement of the individual’ s status as an Eligible Director or otherwise
upon commencement of his or her services as an Eligible Director . If an Eligible Director does not (or is not permitted to) make a
form of payment election for a Mandatory Deferral, the Mandatory Deferral shall be paid in a lump sum. The Eligible Director
shall be entitled to elect to change the time and form of payment in accordance with Section 4.04 only to the extent expressly
permitted by the Board of Directors.
19
ARTICLE V– INTERESTS OF P ARTICIP ANTS
5.01     Accounting for Participants’ Interests :
(a)    Deferral Subaccounts . Each Participant shall have at least one separate Deferral Subaccount for each separate
deferral of Director Compensation made by or for the Participant under this Plan. A Participant’ s deferral shall be credited as of the
date of the deferral to his or her Account as soon as administratively practicable following the date the compensation would be paid
in the absence of a deferral (or as specified in Section 4.05, in the case of a Mandatory Deferral). A Participant’ s Account is a
bookkeeping device to track the value of the Participant’ s deferrals and the Company’ s liability therefor . No assets shall be reserved
or segregated in connection with any Account, and no Account shall be insured or otherwise secured.
(b)    Account Earnings or Losses . As of each V aluation Date, a Participant’ s Account shall be credited with
earnings and gains (and shall be debited for expenses and losses) determined as if the amounts credited to the Participant’ s Account
had actually been invested in accordance with this Article. The Plan provides only for “phantom investments,” and therefore such
earnings, gains, expenses and losses are hypothetical and not actual. However , they shall be applied to measure the value of a
Participant’ s Account and the amount of the Company’ s liability to make deferred payments to or on behalf of the Participant.
5.02     Phantom Investment of Account :
(a)    General . Each of a Participant’ s Deferral Subaccounts shall be invested on a phantom basis as provided in this
Section.
(1)    Participants Who Are Currently Directors . The Deferral Subaccounts of a Participant who is
currently a Director shall be invested on a phantom basis solely in PepsiCo Common Stock pursuant to subsection (b)
below .
(2)    All Other Participants . Not before the later of a Participant’ s diversification date (as defined below)
and March 1 1, 201 1, the Deferral Subaccounts of a Participant who ceases to be a Director may be invested on a phantom
basis in any combination of phantom investment options specified by the Participant (or following the Participant’ s death,
by his or her Beneficiary) from the option in subsection (b) and those options of fered by the Plan Administrator under
subsection (c) below for this purpose from time to time. A Participant’ s diversification date shall be the first day of the
calendar quarter beginning after the first anniversary of when he or she ceases to be a Director . Prior to the later of a
Participant’ s diversification date and March 1 1, 201 1, the Deferral Subaccounts of a Participant who ceases to be a Director
shall be invested on a phantom basis solely in PepsiCo Common Stock pursuant to subsection (b) below . The ef fective date
of an investment election that is permissible under this subsection is determined under subsection (d) below .
(3)    Participants Who Return to Director Status . If a former Director subsequently returns to Director
status, deferrals made during the period prior to his or
20
her return to Director status shall be subject to paragraph (2) above, and deferrals made during the period in which he or she
is again a Director shall be subject to paragraph (1) above.
(b)    Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock . Participant Accounts invested in this phantom option are adjusted to
reflect an investment in PepsiCo Common Stock. An amount deferred into this option is converted to phantom shares (or units) of
PepsiCo Common Stock of equivalent value by dividing such amount by the Fair Market V alue of a share of PepsiCo Common
Stock (or of a unit in the Account) on the V aluation Date as of which the amount is treated as invested in this option by the Plan
Administrator . The Plan Administrator shall adopt a fair valuation methodology for valuing a phantom investment in this option,
such that the value shall reflect the complete value of an investment in PepsiCo Common Stock in accordance with the following
paragraphs below .
(1)    The Plan Administrator shall value a phantom investment in PepsiCo Common Stock pursuant to an
accounting methodology which unitizes partial shares as well as any amounts that would be received by the Account as
dividends (if dividends were paid on phantom shares/units of PepsiCo Common Stock as they are on actual shares of
equivalent value). For the time period this methodology is chosen, partial shares and the above dividends shall be converted
to units and credited to the Participant’ s investment in the phantom PepsiCo Common Stock.
(2)    A Participant’ s interest in the phantom PepsiCo Common Stock is valued as of a V aluation Date by
multiplying the number of phantom shares (or units) credited to his or her Account on such date by the Fair Market V alue of
a share of PepsiCo Common Stock (or of a unit in the Account) on such date.
(3)    If shares of PepsiCo Common Stock change by reason of any stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, mer ger, consolidation, spin-of f, combination or exchange of shares or any other corporate change treated as
subject to this provision by the Plan Administrator , such equitable adjustment shall be made in the number and kind of
phantom shares/units credited to an Account or Deferral Subaccount as the Plan Administrator may determine to be
necessary or appropriate.
(4)    In no event will shares of PepsiCo Common Stock actually be purchased or held under this Plan, and
no Participant shall have any rights as a shareholder of PepsiCo Common Stock on account of an interest in this phantom
option.
(c)    Other Funds . From time to time, the Plan Administrator shall designate which (if any) other investment
options shall be available as phantom investment options under the Plan. These phantom investment options shall be described in
materials provided to Participants from time to time. Any of these phantom investment options shall be administered under
procedures implemented from time to time by the Plan Administrator . Unless otherwise specified in these materials or procedures,
in the case of any such phantom investment option that is based on a unitized fund, an amount deferred or transferred into such
option is converted to phantom units in the applicable fund of equivalent value by dividing such amount by the NA V of a unit in
such fund on the V aluation Date as of which the amount is treated as invested in this
21
option by the Plan Administrator . Thereafter , a Participant’ s interest in each such phantom option is valued as of a V aluation Date
(or a Distribution V aluation Date) by multiplying the number of phantom units credited to his or her Account on such date by the
NAV of a unit in such fund on such date. The Plan Administrator may discontinue any phantom investment option with respect to
some or all Accounts, and it may provide rules for transferring a Participant’ s phantom investment from the discontinued option to
a specified replacement option (unless the Participant selects another replacement option in accordance with such requirements as
the Plan Administrator may apply).
(d)    Fund T ransfers . A Participant may reallocate previously deferred amounts in a Deferral Subaccount (to the
extent subsection (c)’ s phantom investment options are available for such amounts) by properly completing and submitting a fund
transfer form provided by the Plan Administrator or Recordkeeper and specifying, in one percent increments, the reallocation of his
or her Deferral Subaccount among the phantom investment options then of fered by the Plan Administrator for this purpose. (The
rules relating to non-paper formats for Election Forms shall also apply to the fund transfer form.) If a fund transfer form provides
for investing less than or more than 100% of the Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount, it will be void and disregarded. Any transfer
form that is not void under the preceding sentence shall be ef fective as of the V aluation Date next occurring after its receipt by the
Recordkeeper , but the Plan Administrator or Recordkeeper may also specify a minimum number of days in advance of which such
transfer form must be received in order for the form to become ef fective as of such next V aluation Date. If more than one fund
transfer form is received on a timely basis, the form that the Plan Administrator or Recordkeeper determines to be the most recent
shall be followed.
(e)    Authority of Recordkeeper . Any valuation or other determination that is required to be made under this
Section by the Plan Administrator may also be made by the Recordkeeper , if the Recordkeeper has been authorized by the Plan
Administrator to make such valuation or determination.

Section, the Plan Administrator may at any time alter the ef fective date of any investment or allocation involving the Phantom
PepsiCo Common Stock Fund pursuant to Section 7.03(j) (relating to safeguards against insider trading). The Plan Administrator
may also, to the extent necessary to ensure compliance with Rule 16b-3(f) of the Act, arrange for tracking of any such transaction
defined in Rule 16b-3(b)(1) of the Act and bar any such transaction to the extent it would not be exempt under Rule 16b-3(f). The
Company may also impose blackout periods pursuant to the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 whenever the
Company determines that circumstances warrant. Further , the Company may impose quarterly blackout periods on insider trading
in the Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund as needed (as determined by the Company), timed to coincide with the release of the
Company’ s quarterly earnings reports. The commencement and termination of these blackout periods in each quarter , the parties to
which they apply and the activities they restrict shall be as set forth in the of ficial insider trading policy promulgated by the
Company from time to time. These provisions shall apply notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary except Section
7.07 (relating to compliance with Section 409A).

5.03     Vesting of a Participant’ s Account :
A Participant’ s interest in the value of his or her Account shall at all times be 100% vested, which means that it will not
forfeit as a result of his or her Separation from Service.

(a)    Effective for Mandatory Deferrals and elective deferrals of Director Compensation that are credited to the
Plan during or subsequent to the 201 1-2012 Compensation Y ear, a Participant who engages in “Prohibited Misconduct” shall, at the
sole discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company (and in addition to any other remedies available to the Board and/or the

credited to the Plan during or subsequent to the 201 1-2012 Compensation Y ear.
(b)    For purposes of subsection (a) above, “Prohibited Misconduct” shall mean: (i) the use for profit or disclosure
to unauthorized persons of confidential information or trade secrets of the Company; (ii) the breach of any contract with the
Company or violation of any obligation to the Company , including, without limitation, a violation of the Company’ s Worldwide
Code of Conduct; (iii) engaging in unlawful trading in the securities of the Company or of another company based on information
gained as a result of the Participant’ s position with the Company; or (iv) the commission of a felony or other serious crime. Nothing
contained in the Plan or in any other confidentiality provision to which the Participant may be subject as a result of the Participant
serving as a Director , shall prohibit the Participant from communicating with government authorities concerning any possible legal
violations without notice to the Company , participating in government investigations, and/or receiving any applicable award for
providing information to government authorities.  The Company nonetheless asserts and does not waive its attorney-client privilege
over any information appropriately protected by the privilege.

ARTICLE VI– DISTRIBUTIONS
6.01     General :
A Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount(s) shall be distributed as provided in this Article, subject in all cases to Section 7.03(j)
(relating to safeguards against insider trading) and Section 7.06 (relating to compliance with Section 16 of the Act). All Deferral
Subaccount balances shall be distributed in cash; provided, however , that ef fective for distributions made after September 12, 2008,
the distribution of a Participant’ s interest in phantom PepsiCo Common Stock shall be paid in shares of PepsiCo Common Stock
which will be deemed to have been distributed under the PepsiCo, Inc. 2007 Long T erm Incentive Plan or any successor plan
thereto and will count against the limit on the number of shares of PepsiCo Common Stock available for distribution thereunder . If
the number of shares of PepsiCo Common Stock to be distributed is not a whole number of shares, the number of shares to be
distributed will be rounded down to the closest whole number of shares and the remaining amount will be paid in cash based on the
Fair Market V alue of a share of PepsiCo Common Stock on the Distribution V aluation Date corresponding to the distribution. In no
event shall any portion of a Participant’ s Account be distributed earlier or later than is allowed under Section 409A. The following
general rules shall apply for purposes of interpreting the provisions of this Article VI.
(a)    Section 6.02 (Distributions Based on a Specific Payment Date) applies when a Participant has elected to defer
until a Specific Payment Date and the Specific Payment Date is reached before the Participant’ s Disability or death. If such a
Participant dies prior to the Specific Payment Date, Section 6.04 shall apply to the extent it would result in an earlier distribution of
all or part of a Participant’ s Account. If such a Participant becomes Disabled prior to the Specific Payment Date, Section 6.05 shall
apply to the extent it would result in an earlier distribution of all or part of a Participant’ s Account.
(b)    Section 6.03 (Distributions on Account of a Separation from Service) applies when a Participant has elected
to defer until a Separation from Service and then the Participant Separates from Service (other than as a result of death).
Subsections (c) and (d) of this Section provide for when Section 6.04 or 6.06 take precedence over Section 6.03.
(c)    Section 6.04 (Distributions on Account of Death) applies when the Participant dies. If a Participant is entitled
to receive or is receiving a distribution under Section 6.02 or 6.03 (see below) at the time of his or her death, Section 6.04 shall take
precedence over those sections to the extent Section 6.04 would result in an earlier distribution of all or part of a Participant’ s
Account.
(d)    Section 6.05 (Distributions on Account of Disability) applies when the Participant becomes Disabled. If a
Participant who becomes Disabled dies, Section 6.04 shall take precedence over Section 6.05 to the extent it would result in an
earlier distribution of all or part of a Participant’ s Account. If a Participant is entitled to receive or is receiving a distribution under
Section 6.02 or 6.03 at the time of his Disability , Section 6.05 shall take precedence over those sections to the extent Section 6.05
would result in an earlier distribution of all or part of a Participant’ s Account.
24
(e)    Section 6.06 (Distributions on Account of Unforeseeable Emer gency) applies when the Participant incurs an
Unforeseeable Emer gency prior to when a Participant’ s Account is distributed under Sections 6.02 through 6.05. In this case, the
provisions of Section 6.06 shall take precedence over Sections 6.02 through 6.05 to the extent Section 6.06 would result in an
earlier distribution of all or part of the Participant’ s Account.
6.02     Distributions Based on a Specific Payment Date :
This Section shall apply to distributions that are to be made upon the occurrence of a Specific Payment Date. In the event a
Participant’ s Specific Payment Date for a Deferral Subaccount is reached before (i) the Participant’ s Disability or (ii) the
Participant’ s death, such Deferral Subaccount shall be distributed based on the occurrence of such Specific Payment Date in
accordance with the following terms and conditions:
(a)    If a Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount is to be paid in the form of a lump sum pursuant to Sections 4.03 or
4.04, whichever is applicable, the Deferral Subaccount shall be valued as of the last Distribution V aluation Date that occurs on or
immediately precedes the Specific Payment Date, and the resulting amount shall be paid in a single lump sum on the Specific
Payment Date.
(b)    If a Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount is to be paid in the form of installments pursuant to Section 4.03 or
4.04, whichever is applicable, the Deferral Subaccount shall be valued as of the last Distribution V aluation Date that occurs on or
immediately precedes the Specific Payment Date and the first installment payment shall be paid on the Specific Payment Date.
Thereafter , installment payments shall continue in accordance with the schedule elected by the Participant on the Election Form or
the Second Look Election (whichever is applicable, and subject in each case to the provisions of this Plan that constrain such
elections), except as provided in Sections 6.04, 6.05 and 6.06 (relating to distributions on account of death, Disability and
Unforeseeable Emer gency). The amount of each installment shall be determined under Section 6.08. Notwithstanding the preceding
provisions of this Subsection, if before the date the last installment distribution is processed for payment the Participant would be
entitled to a distribution in accordance with Sections 6.04 or 6.05 (relating to a distribution on account of death or Disability), the
remaining balance of the Participant’ s Deferral Subaccounts that would otherwise be distributed based on such Specific Payment
Date shall instead be distributed in accordance with Section 6.04 or 6.05 (relating to distributions on account of death or
Disability), whichever applies, but only to the extent it would result in an earlier distribution of the Participant’ s Subaccounts in the
case of Section 6.04 or 6.05.
6.03     Distributions on Account of a Separation from Service :
This Section shall apply to distributions that are to be made upon Separation from Service. When used in this Section, the
phrase “Separation from Service” shall only refer to a Separation from Service that is not for Disability or death.
(a)    If the Participant’ s Separation from Service is prior to the Specific Payment Date that is applicable to a
Deferral Subaccount, the Participant’ s deferral election pursuant to Sections 4.03 or 4.04 ( i.e., time and form of payment) shall
continue to be given
25
effect, and the Deferral Subaccounts shall be distributed based upon the provisions of Section 6.02.
(b)    If the Participant has selected payment of his or her deferral on account of Separation from Service,
distribution of the related Deferral Subaccount shall commence as follows:
(1)    for deferrals of Director Compensation other than Mandatory Deferrals, distribution of the related
Deferral Subaccount shall commence on the first day of the Plan Y ear following the end of the Plan Y ear in which the
Participant’ s Separation from Service occurs; and
(2)    for Mandatory Deferrals, distribution of the related Deferral Subaccount shall commence on the first
day of the calendar quarter beginning after the first anniversary of the Participant’ s Separation from Service occurs.
(c)    The distribution provided in subsection (b) shall be made in either a single lump sum payment or in
installment payments depending upon the Participant’ s deferral election under Sections 4.03, 4.04 or 4.05. If the Deferral
Subaccount is to be paid in the form of a lump sum, the Deferral Subaccount shall be valued as of the last Distribution V aluation
Date that occurs on or immediately precedes the date of the Participant’ s Separation from Service and the resulting amount shall be
distributed in a lump sum on the date specified in subsection (b) above. If a Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount is to be paid in the
form of installments pursuant to Section 4.03 or 4.04, whichever is applicable, the Deferral Subaccount shall be valued as of the
last Distribution V aluation Date that occurs on or immediately precedes the date of the Participant’ s Separation from Service and
the first installment payment shall be paid on the date specified in subsection (b) above. Thereafter , installment payments shall
continue in accordance with the schedule elected by the Participant on his/her deferral election form or Second Look Election (and
subject in each case to the provisions of this Plan that constrain such elections), except as provided in Sections 6.04, 6.05 and 6.06
(relating to distributions on account of death, Disability and Unforeseeable Emer gency). The amount of each installment shall be
determined under Section 6.08. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Subsection, if before the date the last installment
distribution is processed for payment the Participant would be entitled to a distribution in accordance with Sections 6.04 or 6.05
(relating to a distribution on account of death or Disability), the remaining balance of the Participant’ s Deferral Subaccounts that
would otherwise be distributed based on such Separation from Service shall instead be distributed in accordance with Section 6.04
or 6.05 (relating to distributions on account of death or Disability), whichever applies, but only to the extent it would result in an
earlier distribution of the Participant’ s Subaccounts in the case of Section 6.04 or 6.05.
(d)    Notwithstanding subsections (a), (b) and (c) above, if the Participant is classified as a Key Employee at the
time of the Participant’ s Separation from Service (or at such other time for determining Key Employee status as may apply under
Section 409A), then such Participant’ s Account shall not be paid, as a result of the Participant’ s Separation from Service, earlier
than the date that is at least 6 months after the Participant’ s Separation from Service. In such event:
26
(1)    any applicable lump sum payment shall be valued as of the Distribution V aluation Date that
corresponding to the date that is 6 months after the date of the Participant’ s Separation from Service and the resulting
amount shall be distributed on the date that is 6 months after the date of the Participant’ s Separation from Service; and
(2)    any installment payments that would otherwise have been paid during such 6 month period shall be
valued as of the Distribution V aluation Date that corresponds to the date that is 6 months after the date of the Participant’ s
Separation from Service pursuant to Section 6.08 and the resulting amount(s) shall be distributed in a lump sum on the date
that is 6 months after the date of the Participant’ s Separation from Service and the installment stream shall continue from
that point in accordance with the applicable schedule.
(e)    If the Participant is receiving installment payments for one or more Deferral Subaccounts in accordance with
Section 6.02 at the time of his or her Separation from Service, such installment payments shall continue to be paid based upon the
Participant’ s deferral election (but subject to acceleration under Sections 6.04, 6.05 and 6.06 relating to distributions on account of
death, Disability and Unforeseeable Emer gency).
6.04     Distributions on Account of Death :
(a)    Upon a Participant’ s death, the Participant’ s Account under the Plan shall be valued as of the first Distribution
Valuation Date of the first Plan Y ear following the Participant’ s death and the resulting amount shall be distributed in a single lump
sum payment on such date. If the Participant is receiving installment payments at the time of the Participant’ s death, such
installment payments shall continue in accordance with the terms of the Participant’ s deferral election that governs such payments
until the time that the lump sum payment is due to be paid under the provisions of the preceding sentence of this Subsection.
Immediately prior to the time that such lump sum payment is to be paid all installment payments shall cease and the remaining
balance of the Participant’ s Account shall be distributed at such scheduled payment time in a single lump sum. Amounts paid
following a Participant’ s death, whether a lump sum or continued installments, shall be paid to the Participant’ s Beneficiary . If
some but not all of the persons designated as Beneficiaries by a Participant to receive his or her Account at death predecease the
Participant, the Participant’ s surviving Beneficiaries shall be entitled to the portion of the Participant’ s Account intended for such
pre-deceased persons in proportion to the surviving Beneficiaries’ respective shares.
(b)    If no designation is in ef fect at the time of a Participant’ s death (as determined by the Plan Administrator) or
if all persons designated as Beneficiaries have predeceased the Participant, then the payments to be made pursuant to this Section
shall be distributed as follows:
(1)    If the Participant is married at the time of his/her death, all payments made pursuant to this Section
shall be paid to the Participant’ s spouse; and
27
(2)    If the Participant is not married at the time of his/her death, all payments made pursuant to this
Section shall be paid to the Participant’ s estate.
The Plan Administrator shall determine whether a Participant is “married” and shall determine a Participant’ s “spouse” based on
the state or local law where the Participant has his/her primary residence at the time of death. The Plan Administrator is authorized
to make any applicable inquires and to request any documents, certificates or other information that it deems necessary or
appropriate in order to make the above determinations.
(c)    Prior to the time the value of the Participant’ s Account is distributed under this Section, the Participant’ s
Beneficiary may apply for a distribution under Section 6.06 (relating to a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emer gency).
(d)    Any claim to be paid any amounts standing to the credit of a Participant in connection with the Participant’ s
death must be received by the Recordkeeper or the Plan Administrator at least 14 days before any such amount is paid out by the
Recordkeeper . Any claim received thereafter is untimely , and it shall be unenforceable against the Plan, the Company , the Plan
Administrator , the Recordkeeper or any other party acting for one or more of them.
6.05     Distributions on Account of Disability :
If a Participant incurs a Disability , the Participant’ s Account shall be distributed in accordance with the terms and conditions
of this Section.
(a)    Prior to the time that an amount would become distributable under this Article, if a Participant believes he or
she is suf fering from a Disability , the Participant shall file a written request with the Recordkeeper for payment of the entire amount
credited to his or her Account in connection with Disability . After a Participant has filed a written request pursuant to this Section,
along with all supporting material that may be required by the Recordkeeper from time to time, the Recordkeeper shall determine
within 45 days (or such other number of days as allowed by applicable law if special circumstances warrant additional time)
whether the Participant meets the criteria for a Disability . In addition, to the extent required under Section 409A, if the Company
becomes aware that the Participant appears to meet the criteria for a Disability , the Company shall advise the Recordkeeper and the
Recordkeeper shall proceed to determine if the Participant meets the criteria for a Disability under this Plan, even if the Participant
has yet not applied for payment from this Plan. To the extent practicable, the Participant shall be expected to permit whatever
medical examinations are necessary for the Recordkeeper to make its determination. If the Recordkeeper determines that the
Participant has satisfied the criteria for a Disability , the Participant’ s Account shall be valued as of the Distribution V aluation Date
that occurs on or immediately precedes the date on which the Participant became Disabled and the resulting amount shall be
distributed in a single lump sum payment on the first day of the Plan Y ear following the end of the Plan Y ear in which the
Disability determination is made.
(b)    If the Participant is receiving installment payments at the time of the Participant’ s Disability , such installment
payments shall continue to be paid in accordance with the provisions of the Participant’ s applicable deferral election until the time
that the lump sum
28
payment is due to be paid under the provisions of Subsection (a). Immediately prior to the time that such lump sum payment is
scheduled to be paid, all installment payments shall cease and the remaining balance of the Participant’ s Account shall be
distributed at the time specified in Subsection (a) in a single lump sum.
6.06     Distributions on Account of Unforeseeable Emer gency :
Prior to the time that an amount would become distributable under Sections 6.02 through 6.05, a Participant or Beneficiary
may file a written request with the Recordkeeper for accelerated payment of all or a portion of the amount credited to the
Participant’ s Account based upon an Unforeseeable Emer gency . After an individual has filed a written request pursuant to this
Section, along with all supporting material that may be required by the Recordkeeper from time to time, the Recordkeeper shall
determine within 60 days (or such other number of days that is necessary if special circumstances warrant additional time) whether
the individual meets the criteria for an Unforeseeable Emer gency . If the Recordkeeper determines that an Unforeseeable
Emer gency has occurred, the Participant or Beneficiary shall receive a distribution from his or her Account on the date that such
determination is finalized by the Recordkeeper . However , such distribution shall not exceed the dollar amount necessary to satisfy
the Unforeseeable Emer gency (plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution) after
taking into account the extent to which the Unforeseeable Emer gency is or may be relieved through reimbursement or
compensation by insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the Participant’ s assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets
would not itself cause severe financial hardship).
6.07     Distributions of Mandatory Deferrals :
This Section 6.07 shall govern the distribution of all Mandatory Deferrals under the Plan. Subject to the last sentence of this
Section 6.07, a Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount(s) for Mandatory Deferrals shall be distributed upon the earliest of the following
to occur:
(a)    The Participant’ s Separation from Service (other than on account of a Disability or death) pursuant to the
distribution rules of Section 6.03;
(b)    The Participant’ s death pursuant to the distribution rules of Section 6.04;
(c)    The Participant’ s Disability pursuant to the distribution rules of Section 6.05; or
(d)    The occurrence of an Unforeseeable Emer gency with respect to the Participant pursuant to the distribution
rules of Section 6.06.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company may specify dif ferent terms for the distribution of
Mandatory Deferrals. Such specification may always occur not later than when the Mandatory Deferral becomes irrevocable under
Section 4.05(c). Such specification may also occur later , but only to the extent that such later specification satisfies the
requirements of Section 4.04 (as if it were an election by the Participant). In addition, to the extent expressly permitted by the
Board of Directors, the Participant may make a Second Look Election under Section 4.04.
29
6.08     Valuation :
In determining the amount of any individual distribution pursuant to this Article, the Participant's Deferral Subaccount shall
continue to be credited with earnings and gains (and debited for expenses and losses) as specified in Article V until the Distribution
Valuation Date that is used in determining the amount of the distribution under this Article. If a particular Section in this Article
does not specify a Distribution V aluation Date to be used in calculating the distribution, the Participant's Deferral Subaccount shall
continue to be credited with earnings and gains (and debited for expenses and losses) as specified in Article V until the Distribution
Valuation Date on or most recently preceding the date of such distribution. In determining the value of a Participant’ s remaining
Deferral Subaccount following an installment distribution from the Deferral Subaccount (or a partial distribution under Section
6.06 relating to a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emer gency), such distribution shall reduce the value of the
Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount as of the close of the Distribution V aluation Date on or most recently preceding the payment date
for such installment (or partial distribution). The amount to be distributed in connection with any installment payment shall be
determined by dividing the value of a Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount as of such Distribution V aluation Date (determined before
reduction of the Deferral Subaccount as of such Distribution V aluation Date in accordance with the preceding sentence) by the
remaining number of installments to be paid with respect to the Deferral Subaccount.
6.09     Impact of Section 16 of the Act on Distributions :
The provisions of Section 7.06 shall apply in determining whether a Participant’ s distribution shall be delayed beyond the
date applicable under the preceding provisions of this Article VI.
6.10     Actual Payment Date :
An amount payable on a date specified in this Article VI shall be paid no later than the later of (a) the end of the calendar
year in which the specified date occurs, or (b) the 15th day of the third calendar month following such specified date. In addition,
the Participant (or Beneficiary) is not permitted to designate the taxable year of the payment.

409A), the Plan Administrator or the Recordkeeper may take any action the Plan Administrator determines is necessary to assure
compliance with any policy of the Company respecting insider trading as may be in ef fect from time to time. Such actions may
include altering the distribution date of Deferral Subaccounts. Any such actions shall alter the normal operation of the Plan to the
minimum extent necessary .
The Plan Administrator has the exclusive and discretionary authority to construe and to interpret the Plan, to decide all
questions of eligibility for benefits, to determine the amount and manner of payment of such benefits and to make any
determinations that are contemplated by (or permissible under) the terms of this Plan, and its decisions on such matters will be final

not expressly called for by the Plan provisions in question, and even though other Plan provisions expressly grant discretion or call
for a determination. As a result, benefits under this Plan will be paid only if the Plan Administrator decides in its discretion that the
applicant is entitled to them. In the event of a review by a court, arbitrator or any other tribunal, any exercise of the Plan
Administrator ’s discretionary authority shall not be disturbed unless it is clearly shown to be arbitrary and capricious.
7.04     Compensation, Indemnity and Liability :
The Plan Administrator will serve without bond and without compensation for services hereunder . All expenses of the Plan
and the Plan Administrator will be paid by the Company . To the extent deemed appropriate by the Plan Administrator , any such

employee of the Company (or a Company af filiate, if recognized as an af filiate for this purpose by the Plan Administrator) acting as
the delegate of the Board of Directors against any and all expenses and liabilities, including reasonable legal fees and expenses,
arising in connection with this Plan out of his or her membership on the Board of Directors (or his or her serving as the delegate of
the Board of Directors), excepting only expenses and liabilities arising out of his or her own willful misconduct or bad faith.

The Company shall withhold from amounts due under this Plan, any amount necessary to enable the Company to remit to
the appropriate government entity or entities on behalf of the Participant as may be required by the federal income tax provisions of
the Code, by an applicable state’ s income tax provisions, and by an applicable city , county or municipality’ s earnings or income tax
provisions. Further , the Company shall withhold from the payroll of, or collect from, a Participant the amount necessary to remit on
behalf of the Participant any Social Security and/or Medicare taxes which may be required with respect to amounts deferred or
accrued by a
32
Participant hereunder , as determined by the Company . In addition, to the extent required by Section 409A, amounts deferred under
this Plan shall be reported to the Internal Revenue Service as provided by Section 409A, and any amounts that become taxable
hereunder pursuant to Section 409A shall be reported as taxable compensation to the Participant as provided by Section 409A.
7.06     Section 16 Compliance :
(a)    In General . This Plan is intended to be a formula plan for purposes of Section 16 of the Act. Accordingly , in
the case of a deferral or other action under the Plan that constitutes a transaction that could be covered by Rule 16b-3(d) or (e), if it
were approved by the Company’ s Board of Directors or Compensation Committee (“Board Approval”), it is intended that the Plan
shall be administered by delegates of the Board of Directors, in the case of a Participant who is subject to Section 16 of the Act, in
a manner that will permit the Board Approval of the Plan to avoid any additional Board Approval of specific transactions to the
maximum possible extent.
(b)    Approval of Distributions : This Subsection shall govern the distribution of a deferral that (i) is being
distributed to a Participant in cash, (ii) is wholly or partly invested in the Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund at the time the
deferral would be valued to determine the amount of cash to be distributed to a Participant, (iii) either was the subject of a Second
Look Election or was not covered by an agreement or Plan provisions, applicable at the time of the Participant’ s original deferral
election, that any investments in the Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund would, once made, remain in that fund until
distribution of the deferral, (iv) is made to a Participant who is subject to Section 16 of the Act at the time the interest in the
Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund would be liquidated in connection with the distribution, and (v) if paid at the time the
distribution would be made without regard to this subsection, could result in a violation of Section 16 of the Act because there is an
opposite way transaction that would be matched with the liquidation of the Participant’ s interest in the PepsiCo Common Stock
Fund (either as a “discretionary transaction,” within the meaning of Rule 16b-3(b)(1), or as a regular transaction, as applicable) (a
“Covered Distribution”). In the case of a Covered Distribution, if the liquidation of the Participant’ s interest in the Phantom
PepsiCo Common Stock Fund in connection with the distribution has not received Board Approval by the time the distribution
would be made if it were not a Covered Distribution, or if it is a discretionary transaction, then the actual distribution to the
Participant shall be delayed only until the earlier of:
(1)    In the case of a transaction that is not a discretionary transaction, Board Approval of the liquidation
of the Participant’ s interest in the Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund in connection with the distribution, or
(2)    The date the distribution would no longer violate Section 16 of the Act, e.g., when the Participant is
no longer subject to Section 16 of the Act, or when the time between the liquidation and an opposite way transaction is
sufficient.
33
7.07     Conformance with Section 409A :
Effective from and after January 1, 2009, at all times during each Plan Y ear, this Plan shall be operated (i) in accordance
with the requirements of Section 409A, and (ii) to preserve the status of deferrals under the Pre-409A Program as being exempt
from Section 409A, i.e., to preserve the grandfathered status of the Pre-409A Program. In all cases, the provisions of this Section
shall apply notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Plan that is not contained in this Section.
34
ARTICLE VIII– CLAIMS PROCEDURE
8.01     Claims for Benefits:
If a Participant, Beneficiary or other person (hereafter , "Claimant") does not receive timely payment of any benefits which
he or she believes are due and payable under the Plan, he or she may make a claim for benefits to the Plan Administrator . The claim
for benefits must be in writing and addressed to the Plan Administrator . If the claim for benefits is denied, the Plan Administrator
will notify the Claimant within 90 days after the Plan Administrator initially received the benefit claim. However , if special
circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim, the Plan Administrator will furnish notice of the extension to
the Claimant prior to the termination of the initial 90-day period and such extension may not exceed one additional, consecutive 90-
day period. Any notice of a denial of benefits shall advise the Claimant of the basis for the denial, any additional material or
information necessary for the Claimant to perfect his or her claim, and the steps which the Claimant must take to appeal his or her
claim for benefits.
8.02     Appeals of Denied Claims :
Each Claimant whose claim for benefits has been denied may file a written appeal for a review of his or her claim by the
Plan Administrator . The request for review must be filed by the Claimant within 60 days after he or she received the notice denying
his or her claim. The decision of the Plan Administrator will be communicated to the Claimant within 60 days after receipt of a
request for appeal. The notice shall set forth the basis for the Plan Administrator's decision. If special circumstances require an
extension of time for processing the appeal, the Plan Administrator will furnish notice of the extension to the Claimant prior to the
termination of the initial 60-day period and such extension may not exceed one additional, consecutive 60-day period. In no event
shall the Plan Administrator ’s decision be rendered later than 120 days after receipt of a request for appeal.
8.03     Special Claims Procedures for Disability Determinations:
Notwithstanding Sections 8.01 and 8.02 to the contrary , if the claim or appeal of the Claimant relates to Disability benefits,
such claim or appeal shall be processed pursuant to the applicable provisions of Department of Labor Regulation Section 2560.503-
1 relating to Disability benefits, including Sections 2560.503-1(d), 2560.503-1(f)(3), 2560.503-1(h)(4) and 2560.503-1(i)(3).

ARTICLE IX– AMENDMENT AND TERMINA TION
9.01     Amendment of Plan:
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company has the right in its sole discretion to amend this
Plan in whole or in part at any time and in any manner , including the manner of making deferral elections, the terms on which
distributions are made, and the form and timing of distributions. However , except for mere clarifying amendments necessary to
avoid an inappropriate windfall, no Plan amendment shall reduce the amount credited to the Account of any Participant as of the
date such amendment is adopted. Any amendment shall be in writing and adopted by the Committee. All Participants and
Beneficiaries shall be bound by such amendment. Any amendments made to the Plan shall be subject to any restrictions on
amendment that are applicable to ensure continued compliance under Section 409A.
9.02     Termination of Plan :
(a)    The Company expects to continue this Plan, but does not obligate itself to do so. The Company , acting by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, or through its entire Board of Directors, reserves the right to discontinue and
terminate the Plan at any time, in whole or in part, for any reason (including a change, or an impending change, in the tax laws of
the United States or any State). Termination of the Plan will be binding on all Participants (and a partial termination shall be
binding upon all af fected Participants) and their Beneficiaries, but in no event may such termination reduce the amounts credited at
that time to any Participant's Account. If this Plan is terminated (in whole or in part), the termination resolution shall provide for
how amounts theretofore credited to af fected Participants' Accounts will be distributed.
(b)    This Section is subject to the same restrictions related to compliance with Section 409A that apply to Section
9.01. In accordance with these restrictions, the Company intends to have the maximum discretionary authority to terminate the Plan
and make distributions in connection with a change in ownership or ef fective control of the Company or a change in ownership of a
substantial portion of the assets of the Company , all within the meaning of Section 409A (a “Change in Control”), and the
maximum flexibility with respect to how and to what extent to carry this out following a Change in Control as is permissible under
Section 409A. The previous sentence contains the exclusive terms under which a distribution may be made in connection with any
change in control with respect to deferrals made under this 409A Program.
36
ARTICLE X– MISCELLANEOUS
10.01     Limitation on Participant's Rights :
Participation in this Plan does not give any Participant the right to be retained in the service of the Company . The Company

Plan, except for a claim for payment of deferrals as provided herein.
10.02     Unfunded Obligation of the Company:
The benefits provided by this Plan are unfunded. All amounts payable under this Plan to Participants are paid from the

assets for the purpose of paying benefits to Participants. Neither a Participant, Beneficiary , nor any other person shall have any
property interest, legal or equitable, in any specific Company asset. This Plan creates only a contractual obligation on the part of
the Company , and the Participant has the status of a general unsecured creditor of the Company with respect to amounts of
compensation deferred hereunder . Such a Participant shall not have any preference or priority over , the rights of any other
unsecured general creditor of the Company . No other Company af filiate guarantees or shares such obligation, and no other
Company af filiate shall have any liability to the Participant or his or her Beneficiary .
10.03     Other Plans:
This Plan shall not af fect the right of any Eligible Director or Participant to participate in and receive benefits under and in
accordance with the provisions of any other Director compensation plans which are now or hereafter maintained by the Company ,
unless the terms of such other plan or plans specifically provide otherwise or it would cause such other plan to violate a
requirement for tax favored treatment.
10.04     Receipt or Release:
Any payment to a Participant in accordance with the provisions of this Plan shall, to the extent thereof, be in full satisfaction
of all claims against the Plan Administrator , the Recordkeeper and the Company , and the Plan Administrator may require such
Participant, as a condition precedent to such payment, to execute a receipt and release to such ef fect.
10.05     Governing Law:
This Plan shall be construed, administered, and governed in all respects in accordance with applicable federal law and, to
the extent not preempted by federal law , in accordance with the laws of the State of North Carolina. If any provisions of this
instrument shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions hereof shall
continue to be fully ef fective.
37
10.06     Gender , Tense and Examples:
In this Plan, whenever the context so indicates, the singular or plural number and the masculine, feminine, or neuter gender
shall be deemed to include the other . Whenever an example is provided or the text uses the term “including” followed by a specific
item or items, or there is a passage having a similar ef fect, such passage of the Plan shall be construed as if the phrase “without
limitation” followed such example or term (or otherwise applied to such passage in a manner that avoids limitation on its breadth of
application).
10.07     Successors and Assigns; Nonalienation of Benefits:
This Plan inures to the benefit of and is binding upon the parties hereto and their successors, heirs and assigns; provided,
however , that the amounts credited to the Account of a Participant are not (except as provided in Section 7.05) subject in any
manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer , assignment, pledge, encumbrance, char ge, garnishment, execution or levy of any
kind, either voluntary or involuntary , and any attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer , assign, pledge, encumber , char ge or
otherwise dispose of any right to any benefits payable hereunder , including, without limitation, any assignment or alienation in
connection with a separation, divorce, child support or similar arrangement, will be null and void and not binding on the Plan or the
Company . Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan Administrator reserves the right to make payments in accordance with a divorce
decree, judgment or other court order as and when cash payments are made in accordance with the terms of this Plan from the
Deferral Subaccount of a Participant. Any such payment shall be char ged against and reduce the Participant’ s Account.
10.08     Facility of Payment:

Administrator may direct the Company to make payments to such person or to the legal representative of such person for his or her
benefit, or to apply the payment for the benefit of such person in such manner as the Plan Administrator considers advisable. Any

APPENDIX
APPENDIX AR TICLE A – TRANSITION PROVISIONS
This Article A provides the transition rules for the Plan that were ef fective at some time during the period beginning
January 1, 2005 and ending December 31, 2008. The time period during which each provision in this Article A was ef fective shall
be provided herein.
I. Cancellation Elections:
Pursuant to Q&A-20(a) of IRS Notice 2005-1, each Eligible Director shall have the right to cancel his or her election to
defer Director Compensation for the 2004-2005 Compensation Y ear. Such election to cancel must be filed with the Plan
Administrator prior to the end of the 2004-2005 Compensation Y ear and must follow any other procedures and timing requirements
established by the Plan Administrator for this purpose (such procedures and timing requirements to be consistent with the
requirements of Q&A-20(a)). Any Eligible Director who makes an election to cancel such deferral election shall have the Director
Compensation related to such deferral election paid to him or her (plus any applicable earnings or minus any applicable losses)
from his or her Account by December 31, 2005 and such amount shall be reported as taxable income to the Eligible Director for the
2005 calendar year .
II. Modifications to Article IV :
Section 4.03(b) shall read as follows ef fective for deferral elections made for Compensation Y ears beginning before October
1, 2009:
(b)    Form of Payment . The default form of payment for initial deferral elections is a single lump sum that shall be
paid at the time applicable under Article IV . A Participant may only change the default payment from a lump sum to
installments by means of a Second Look Election that meets all of the requirements of Section 4.04. Form of payment
elections for Mandatory Deferrals are governed by Section 4.05.
III. Modifications to Article VI:
The rules set forth in this Article A, Section III apply to any distributions that have occurred or would occur based on
events, including any Separations from Service, or Specific Payment Dates that occurred prior to January 1, 2009.
For purposes of this Article A, Section III, the term “Retirement” shall mean Separation from Service after attaining
eligibility for retirement. A Participant attains eligibility for retirement when he or she attains age 50 while serving as a director on
the Board of Directors of the Company .
For purposes of this Article A, Section III, a new Section 6.05 is added as specified below , and existing Sections 6.05 and
6.06 (as set forth in the main portion of the Plan document) are renumbered as Sections 6.06 and 6.07 respectively .
A For this purpose, Sections 6.01(a)-(f)  read as follows:
A-1
(a) Section 6.02 (Distributions Based on a Specific Payment Date) applies when a Participant has elected to defer until a
Specific Payment Date and the Specific Payment Date is reached before the Participant’ s (i) Separation from Service
(other than for Retirement), (ii) Disability , or (iii) death. However , if such a Participant Separates from Service
(other than for Retirement or death) prior to the Specific Payment Date (or prior to processing of the first installment
payment due in connection with the Specific Payment Date), Section 6.03 shall apply . If such a Participant dies prior
to the Specific Payment Date, Section 6.04 shall apply to the extent it would result in an earlier distribution of all or
part of a Participant’ s Account. If such a Participant becomes Disabled prior to the Specific Payment Date, Section
6.06 shall apply to the extent it would result in an earlier distribution of all or part of a Participant’ s Account.
(b) Section 6.03 (Distributions on Account of a Separation from Service) applies (i) when a Participant has elected to
defer until a Separation from Service and then the Participant Separates from Service (other than for Retirement or
death), or (ii) when applicable under Subsection (a) above).
(c) Section 6.04 (Distributions on Account of Death) applies when the Participant dies. If a Participant is entitled to
receive or is receiving a distribution under Section 6.02, 6.03 or 6.05 (see below) at the time of his or her death,
Section 6.04 shall take precedence over those sections to the extent Section 6.04 would result in an earlier
distribution of all or part of a Participant’ s Account.
(d) Section 6.05 (Distributions on Account of Retirement) applies when a Participant has elected to defer until a
Separation from Service and then the Participant Separates from Service on account of his or her Retirement.
Subsections (c) and (e) of this Section provide for when Section 6.04 or Section 6.06 take precedence over Section
6.05.
(e) Section 6.06 (Distributions on Account of Disability) applies when the Participant becomes Disabled. If a
Participant who becomes Disabled dies, Section 6.04 shall take precedence over Section 6.06 to the extent it would
result in an earlier distribution of all or part of a Participant’ s Account. If a Participant is entitled to receive or is
receiving a distribution under Section 6.02, 6.03 or 6.05 at the time of his Disability , Section 6.06 shall take
precedence over those sections to the extent Section 6.06 would result in an earlier distribution of all or part of a
Participant’ s Account.
(f) Section 6.07 (Distributions on Account of Unforeseeable Emer gency) applies when the Participant incurs an
Unforeseeable Emer gency prior to when a Participant’ s Account is distributed under Sections 6.02 through 6.06. In
this case, the provisions of Section 6.07 shall take precedence over Sections 6.02 through 6.06 to the extent Section
6.07 would result in an earlier distribution of all or part of the Participant’ s Account.
B For this purpose, Section 6.02  reads as follows:
A-2
This Section shall apply to distributions that are to be made upon the occurrence of a Specific Payment Date. In the event a
Participant’ s Specific Payment Date for a Deferral Subaccount is reached before (i) the Participant’ s Disability , or (ii) the
Participant’ s Separation from Service (other than Retirement) or (iii) the Participant’ s death, such Deferral Subaccount shall
be distributed based on the occurrence of such Specific Payment Date in accordance with the following terms and
conditions:
(a) If the Participant has not made a valid Second Look Election that includes installment payments, the Deferral
Subaccount shall be valued as of the Distribution V aluation Date that corresponds to the Participant’ s Specific
Payment Date, and the resulting amount shall be paid in a single lump sum.
(b) If the Participant has made a valid Second Look Election that includes installment payments, the first installment
payment shall be paid (based on the schedule elected in the Participant’ s Second Look Election) on the Specific
Payment Date. Thereafter , installment payments shall continue in accordance with the schedule elected by the
Participant, except as provided in Sections 6.03, 6.04, 6.06 and 6.07 (relating to distributions on account of a
Separation from Service, death, Disability and Unforeseeable Emer gency). The amount of each installment shall be
determined under Section 6.08. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Subsection, if before the date the
first installment distribution is processed for payment the Participant Separates from Service other than for
Retirement) or the Participant would be entitled to a distribution in accordance with Sections 6.03, 6.04 or 6.06
(relating to a distribution on account of Separation from Service, death or Disability), the Participant’ s Deferral
Subaccounts that would otherwise be distributed based on such Specific Payment Date shall instead be distributed in
accordance with Section 6.04 or 6.05 (relating to distributions on account of death or Disability), whichever applies,
but only to the extent it would result in an earlier distribution of the Participant’ s Subaccounts in the case of Section
6.04 or 6.06.
C For this purpose, Section 6.03  reads as follows:
A Participant’ s total Account shall be distributed upon the occurrence of a Participant's Separation from Service (other than
for Retirement, Disability or death) in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Section. When used in this Section,
the phrase “Separation from Service” shall only refer to a Separation from Service that is not for Retirement, Disability or
death.
(a) Subject to subsections (b) and (c), a Participant’ s total Account balance, shall be distributed in a single lump sum
payment on the first day of the first Plan Y ear after the date of the Participant’ s Separation from Service.
(b) If the Participant incurs a Separation from Service after making a valid Second Look Election (and before the first
payment has been processed in accordance with such Second Look Election), each Deferral Subaccount to which the
Second Look Election applies shall be distributed in a single lump sum payment on the
A-3
latest of the following: (1) the first day of the calendar quarter beginning on or after the fifth anniversary of the
payment date selected in the Participant’ s original deferral election under Section 4.03, (2) the first day of the Plan
Year following the Separation from Service, or (3) the date applicable under Subsection (c). However , if the Plan
Administrator determines that Section 409A would permit a lump sum payment to be made earlier than the date
specified in clause (1) of the preceding sentence, then the preceding sentence shall be applied by substituting the
earliest date permissible under Section 409A for the date in clause (1). If the Participant’ s Separation from Service
occurs on or after the date the first payment is processed, payment will be made in accordance with the Second Look
Election (but subject to acceleration under Sections 6.04, 6.06 and 6.07 relating to distributions on account of death,
Disability and Unforeseeable Emer gency).
(c) If the Participant is classified as a Key Employee at the time of the Participant’ s Separation from Service (or at such
other time for determining Key Employee status as may apply under Section 409A), then such Participant’ s Account
shall not be paid, as a result of the Participant’ s Separation from Service, earlier than the date that is at least 6
months after the Participant’ s Separation from Service.
D For this purpose, a new Section 6.05  reads as follows:
6.05    Distributions on Account of Retirement :
If a Participant incurs a Separation from Service on account of his or her Retirement, the Participant’ s Account shall be
distributed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Section.
(a) If the Participant’ s Retirement is prior to the Specific Payment Date that is applicable to a Deferral Subaccount, the
Participant’ s deferral election pursuant to Sections 4.03 or 4.04 ( i.e., time and form of payment) shall continue to be
given ef fect, and the Deferral Subaccounts shall be distributed based upon the provisions of Section 6.02.
(b) If the Participant has selected payment of his or her deferral on account of Separation from Service, distribution of
the related Deferral Subaccount shall commence on the first day of the first Plan Y ear after the date of the
Participant’ s Separation from Service. Such distribution shall be made in a single lump sum payment under Section
4.03. However , if the Participant is classified as a Key Employee at the time of the Participant’ s Retirement (or at
such other time for determining Key Employee status as may apply under Section 409A), then such Participant’ s
Account shall not be paid, as a result of the Participant’ s Retirement, earlier than the date that is at least 6 months
after the Participant’ s Retirement.
(c) If the Participant is receiving installment payments for one or more Deferral Subaccounts in accordance with
Section 6.02 at the time of his or her Retirement, such installment payments shall continue to be paid based upon the
Participant’ s Second Look Election (but subject to acceleration under Sections 6.04, 6.06 and
A-4
6.07 relating to distributions on account of death, Disability and Unforeseeable Emer gency).
IV.    Modification to Article VII .
For periods ef fective from and after January 1, 2005 and on or before December 31, 2008, the language of Section 7.07
shall be replaced in its entirety with the following language:
7.07    Conformance with Section 409A :
At all times during each Plan Y ear, this Plan shall be operated (i) in accordance with the requirements of Section
409A, and (ii) to preserve the status of deferrals under the Pre-409A Program as being exempt from Section 409A, i.e., to
preserve the grandfathered status of the Pre-409A Program. Any action that may be taken (and, to the extent possible, any
action actually taken) by the Plan Administrator , the Recordkeeper or the Company shall not be taken (or shall be void and
without ef fect), if such action violates the requirements of Section 409A or if such action would adversely af fect the
grandfather of the Pre-409A Program. If the failure to take an action under the Plan would violate Section 409A, then to the
extent it is possible thereby to avoid a violation of Section 409A, the rights and ef fects under the Plan shall be altered to
avoid such violation. A corresponding rule shall apply with respect to a failure to take an action that would adversely af fect
the grandfather of the Pre-409A Program. Any provision in this Plan document that is determined to violate the
requirements of Section 409A or to adversely af fect the grandfather of the Pre-409A Program shall be void and without
effect. In addition, any provision that is required to appear in this Plan document to satisfy the requirements of Section
409A, but that is not expressly set forth, shall be deemed to be set forth herein, and the Plan shall be administered in all
respects as if such provision were expressly set forth. A corresponding rule shall apply with respect to a provision that is
required to preserve the grandfather of the Pre-409A Program. In all cases, the provisions of this Section shall apply
notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Plan that is not contained in this Section.

of Section 5(a) as one (1) share of Common Stock for every share of Common Stock subject thereto. Any
shares of Common Stock subject to Full-V alue A wards granted on or after May 5, 2010 shall be counted
7
against the maximum share limitation of Section 5(a) as three (3) shares of Common Stock for every share of
Common Stock subject thereto. A wards that by their terms do not permit settlement in shares of Common
Stock shall not reduce the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan.
(ii) (A)    To the extent that any A ward of Options or SARs, whether granted before, on or after May 5, 2010, is
forfeited, cancelled, settled in cash rather than shares (pursuant to the terms of an A ward that permits
but does not require cash settlement), returned to the Company for failure to satisfy vesting
requirements or other conditions of the A ward, or otherwise terminates without an issuance of shares
of Common Stock being made thereunder , the maximum share limitation of Section 5(a) shall be
credited with one (1) share of Common Stock for each share of Common Stock subject to such
Award of Options or SARs, and such number of credited shares of Common Stock may again be
made subject to A wards under the Plan, subject to the foregoing maximum share limitation.

cash settlement), returned to the Company for failure to satisfy vesting requirements or other
conditions of the A ward, or otherwise terminates without an issuance of shares of Common Stock
being made thereunder , the maximum share limitation of Section 5(a) shall be credited with three (3)
shares of Common Stock for each share of Common Stock subject to such Full-V alue A ward and
such number of credited shares of Common Stock may again be made subject to A wards under the
Plan, subject to the foregoing maximum share limitation.
(B) To the extent that any Full-V alue A ward granted before May 5, 2010 is forfeited, cancelled, settled in
cash rather than shares (pursuant to the terms of an A ward that permits but does not require cash
settlement), returned to the Company for failure to satisfy vesting requirements or other conditions of
the A ward, or otherwise terminates without an issuance of shares of Common Stock being made
thereunder , the maximum share limitation of
8
Section 5(a) shall be credited with one (1) share of Common Stock for each share of Common Stock
subject to such Full-V alue A ward, and such number of credited shares of Common Stock may again
be made subject to A wards under the Plan subject to the foregoing maximum share limitation.
(iii) Any shares of Common Stock that are tendered by a Participant or withheld as full or partial payment of
withholding or other taxes or as payment for the exercise or conversion price of an A ward under the Plan
shall not be added back to the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan.
Upon exercise of a stock-settled Stock Appreciation Right, the number of shares subject to the A ward that
are then being exercised shall be counted against the maximum aggregate number of shares of Common
Stock that may be issued under the Plan as provided above, on the basis of one share for every share subject
thereto, regardless of the actual number of shares used to settle the Stock Appreciation Right upon exercise.
(iv) Any shares of Common Stock underlying A wards granted through the assumption of, or in substitution for ,
outstanding awards previously granted to individuals who become employees of the Company as a result of a
merger, consolidation, acquisition or other corporate transaction involving the Company shall not, unless
required by law or regulation, count against the reserve of available shares of Common Stock under the Plan.

exercise of an A ward shall not increase the number of shares available for future grant of A wards.
(c) Share Limitation. No more than five percent (5%) of the shares of Common Stock authorized under Section 5(a)
may be issued in connection with the following A wards whether granted before or after May 5, 2010:

required tax withholding or intra-family transfers permitted by the Committee), subject to acceleration due to
the Participant’ s death or total disability ,
in each case described in (i), (ii) or (iii) above, as specified in the applicable A ward agreement; provided that such
limitations shall not be applicable to Payment Shares to Non-Employee Directors.

any calendar year (under all plans of the Company) shall not exceed $100,000 or such other amount as may

such shares shall be determined at the time the Option is granted. ISOs shall contain such other provisions as
the Committee shall deem advisable but shall in all events be consistent with and contain or be deemed to
contain all provisions required in order to qualify as incentive stock options under Code Section 422. No
more than 195 million of the shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance under the Plan may be issued

granted under the Plan with an Option Exercise Price above the then-current Fair Market V alue may be

shares of Common Stock covered by an Option unless and until such shares of Common Stock have been

of tandem SARs or Options, as the case may be.
(ii) Exercise Price. The exercise price per share of Common Stock covered by a SAR granted pursuant to the
Plan shall be equal to or , at the Committee’ s discretion, greater than Fair Market V alue on the date the SAR
is granted, unless the SAR was granted through the assumption of, or in substitution for , outstanding awards
previously granted to individuals who became employees of the Company as a result of a mer ger,
consolidation, acquisition or other corporate transaction involving the Company (in which case the
assumption or substitution shall be accomplished in a manner that permits the SAR to be exempt from Code
Section 409A).
(iii) Term. The term of a SAR shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, but, in no event shall
the term exceed ten (10) years from the date of grant, provided, however , that A wards of NQSOs and SARs
covering up to five (5) million shares of Common Stock, in the aggregate, may be issued with a term of up to
fifteen (15) years.

the Committee, during the Restriction Period, Participants who hold Restricted Stock Units shall be credited
with dividend equivalents in respect of such Restricted Stock Units; provided that, unless otherwise
determined by the Committee, such dividend equivalents shall be

expressed in absolute terms or relative to the performance of other entities. For the avoidance of doubt, any
Performance Measures that are financial metrics, may be determined in accordance with United States
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) or may be adjusted when established to include or
exclude any items otherwise includable or excludable under GAAP .

under Code Section 162(m) and the regulations thereunder without adversely af fecting the treatment of the
Award under the Performance-Based Exception, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may provide for the
manner in which performance will be measured against the Performance Goals (or may adjust the
Performance Goals) to reflect the impact of specific corporate transactions, accounting or tax law changes,
asset write-downs, significant litigation or claim adjustment, foreign exchange gains and losses, disposal of a
segment of a business, discontinued operations, refinancing or repurchase of bank loans or debt securities,

Performance-Based Exception under Code Section 162(m): (A) the Committee shall interpret the Plan and
this Section 7(d) in light of Code Section 162(m) and the regulations thereunder; (B) the Committee shall not
amend the A ward in any way that
17

(a) Awards. Non-Employee Directors are eligible to receive any type of A ward under the Plan, subject to the terms
applicable to such A wards under Section 7 for each such category of A ward and subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 8(c). The Committee retains the discretion to change the amount and terms of the Payment Shares described
in Section 8(b) and/or the types of A wards to Non-Employee Directors; provided that any change to the amount of
such Non-Employee Director A wards is subject to the limitation in Section 8(c).
(b) Payment Shar es. A current or former Non-Employee Director ’s interest in phantom shares of Common Stock under
the Director Deferral Program, which results from mandatory deferrals of annual Non-Employee Director equity
grants and an elective or mandatory deferral of Non-Employee Director cash payments, shall be paid in shares of
Common Stock (“Payment Shares”) pursuant to the Plan while the Plan remains in ef fect, to the extent the Director
Deferral Program provides for the stock settlement of such phantom shares. The number of Payment Shares a
current or former Non-Employee Director is entitled to receive shall be equal to the number of the Non-Employee
Director ’s phantom shares of Common
18
Stock under the Director Deferral Program on the applicable distribution valuation date, and such Payment Shares
shall be distributed on the same date such Non-Employee Director would otherwise be entitled to receive the cash
payment under the Director Deferral Program in lieu of which the Payment Shares are being distributed.
(c) Limitations. The maximum amount of A wards denominated in shares of Common Stock that can be granted to any
Non-Employee Director during a single calendar year shall not exceed $500,000 in the aggregate plus an additional
$250,000 for one-time A wards in the calendar year in which a Non-Employee Director initially becomes a member
of the Board. The maximum amount of any cash retainers, even if electively deferred and paid in shares of Common
Stock, that can be granted to any Non-Employee Director during a single calendar year shall not exceed $500,000 in

is to be paid in cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination thereof, shall be deferred or may , in its sole discretion, approve
deferral elections made by Participants. Deferrals shall be for such periods and upon such terms as the Committee may determine in
its sole discretion, which terms shall be designed to comply with Code Section 409A.
10. Dilution and Other Adjustments.
In the event of any mer ger, reor ganization, consolidation, recapitalization, stock dividend, extraordinary cash dividend,
stock split, combination or exchange of shares or other change in corporate structure af fecting any class of Common Stock, the
Committee shall make such adjustments in the class and aggregate number of shares which may be delivered under the Plan as
described in Section 5, the individual award maximums under Section 6, the class, number , and Option Exercise Price of
outstanding Options, the class, number and exercise price of outstanding SARs and the class and number of shares subject to any
other A wards granted under the Plan (provided the number of shares of any class subject to any A ward shall always be a whole
number), as may be, and to such extent (if any), determined to be appropriate and equitable by the Committee, and any such
adjustment may , in the sole discretion of the Committee, take the form of Options covering more than one class of Common Stock.
Such adjustment shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes of the Plan. Any adjustment of an
19
Option or SAR under this Section 10 shall be accomplished in a manner that permits the Option or SAR to be exempt from Code
Section 409A.
11. Change in Control.
(a) Impact of Event . Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary , in the event of a Change in
Control, the following provisions of this Section 1 1 shall apply except to the extent an A ward agreement provides
for a dif ferent treatment (in which case the A ward agreement shall govern and this Section 1 1 shall not be
applicable):
(i) If and to the extent that outstanding A wards under the Plan (A) are assumed by the successor corporation (or
affiliate thereto) or continued or (B) are replaced with equity awards that preserve the existing value of the
Awards at the time of the Change in Control and provide for subsequent payout in accordance with a vesting
schedule and Performance Goals, as applicable, that are the same or more favorable to the Participants than
the vesting schedule and Performance Goals applicable to the A wards, then all such A wards or such
substitutes thereof shall remain outstanding and be governed by their respective terms and the provisions of
the Plan subject to Section 1 1(a)(iv) below .
(ii) If and to the extent that outstanding A wards under the Plan are not assumed, continued or replaced in
accordance with Section 1 1(a)(i) above, then upon the Change in Control the following treatment (referred to
as “Change-in-Control T reatment”) shall apply to such A wards: (A) outstanding Options and SARs shall
immediately vest and become exercisable; (B) the restrictions and other conditions applicable to outstanding
Restricted Shares, Restricted Stock Units and Stock A wards, including vesting requirements, shall
immediately lapse; such A wards shall be free of all restrictions and fully vested; and, with respect to
Restricted Stock Units, shall be payable immediately in accordance with their terms or , if later , as of the
earliest permissible date under Code Section 409A; and (C) outstanding Performance A wards granted under
the Plan shall immediately vest and shall become immediately payable in accordance with their terms as if
the Performance Goals have been achieved at the tar get performance level.

then in connection with the application of the Change-in-Control T reatment set forth in Section 1 1(a)(ii)
above, the Board may , in its sole discretion, provide for cancellation of such outstanding A wards at the time
of the Change in Control in which case a payment of cash, property or a combination thereof shall be made
to each such Participant upon the consummation of the Change in Control that is determined by the Board in
its sole discretion and that is at least equal to the excess (if any) of the value of the consideration that would
be received in such Change in Control by the holders of PepsiCo’ s securities relating to such A wards over the
exercise or purchase price (if any) for such A wards (except that, in the case of an Option or SAR, such
payment shall be limited as necessary to prevent the Option or SAR from being subject to Code Section
409A).
(iv) If and to the extent that (A) outstanding A wards are assumed, continued or replaced in accordance with
Section 1 1(a)(i) above and (B) a Participant’ s employment with, or performance of services for , the
Company is terminated by the Company for any reasons other than Cause or by such Participant for Good
Reason, in each case, within the two-year period commencing on the Change in Control, then, as of the date
of such Participant’ s termination, the Change-in-Control T reatment set forth in Section 1 1(a)(ii) above shall
apply to all assumed or replaced A wards of such Participant then outstanding.
(v) Outstanding Options or SARs that are assumed, continued or replaced in accordance with Section 1 1(a)(i)
may be exercised by the Participant in accordance with the applicable terms and conditions of such A ward as
set forth in the applicable A ward agreement or elsewhere; provided, however , that Options or SARs that

(D) PepsiCo shareholders approve a plan of complete liquidation of PepsiCo or the sale or disposition of

Change in Control.
12. Miscellaneous Provisions.
(a) Misconduct.
(i) Except as otherwise provided in agreements covering A wards hereunder , a Participant shall forfeit all rights

nothing in this Plan, any A ward or any agreement covering any A ward hereunder shall prohibit
communication with a government agency , regulator or legal authority concerning any possible violations of

(ii) In addition, to the extent provided in the applicable A ward agreement, in the event any accounting
adjustment is required to be made to the Company’ s financial results and the Committee determines that an
Executive Of ficer’s gross negligence or misconduct caused or contributed to the need for the accounting

registered to the Participant as the owner .

(d) Assignment or T ransfer . Except as otherwise provided under the Plan, no A ward under the Plan or any rights or
interests therein shall be transferable other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. The Committee may ,
in its discretion, provide that an A ward (other than an ISO) is transferable without the payment of any consideration
to a Participant’ s family member , whether directly or by means of a trust or otherwise, subject to such terms and
conditions as the Committee may impose. For this purpose, “family member” has the meaning given to such term in
the General Instructions to the Form S-8 registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933. All A wards under
the Plan shall be exercisable, during the Participant’ s lifetime, only by the Participant or a person who is a permitted
transferee pursuant to this Section 12(d). Once awarded, the shares of Common Stock (other than Restricted Shares)

retaining shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market V alue on the date the tax is to be determined that is equal to
the amount of such statutory minimum applicable withholding tax (rounded, if necessary , to the next highest whole
number of shares of Common Stock); provided, however , that, subject to any restrictions or limitations that the
Committee deems appropriate, a Participant may elect to satisfy such statutory minimum applicable withholding tax
through cash or cash proceeds; and, provided, further , however , that to the extent that PepsiCo is able to retain
shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market V alue that exceeds the statutory minimum applicable withholding tax
without financial accounting implications, PepsiCo may retain such number of shares of Common Stock (up to the
number of shares having a Fair Market V alue equal to the relevant tax liability calculated using the maximum
individual statutory rate of tax) as the Company shall determine in its sole discretion to satisfy the tax liability
associated with any A ward.
25
(f) Curr ency and Other Restrictions . The obligations of the Company to make delivery of A wards in cash or Common
Stock shall be subject to currency or other restrictions imposed by any governmental authority or regulatory body

right to be retained in the employ or service of the Company , and the Plan shall not interfere with or limit in any way
the right of the Company to terminate any person’ s employment or service at any time. Except as set forth herein, no
employee or other person shall have any claim or right to be granted an A ward under the Plan. By accepting an
Award, the Participant acknowledges and agrees that (i) the A ward will be exclusively governed by the terms of the
Plan, including the right reserved by the Company to amend or cancel the Plan at any time without the Company
incurring liability to the Participant (except, to the extent the terms of the A ward so provide, for A wards already
granted under the Plan), (ii) A wards are not a constituent part of salary and the Participant is not entitled, under the
terms and conditions of employment, or by accepting or being granted A wards under the Plan to require A wards to
be granted to him or her in the future under the Plan or any other plan, (iii) the value of A wards received under the
Plan shall be excluded from the calculation of termination indemnities or other severance payments or benefits, and
(iv) the Participant shall seek all necessary approval under , make all required notifications under , and comply with
all laws, rules and regulations applicable to the ownership of Options and shares of Common Stock and the exercise
of Options, including, without limitation, currency and exchange laws, rules and regulations.
(h) Beneficiary Designation . To the extent allowed by the Committee, each Participant under the Plan may , from time to
time, name any beneficiary or beneficiaries (who may be named on a contingent or successive basis) to whom any
benefit under the Plan is to be paid in case of his or her death before he or she receives any or all of such benefit.
Unless the Committee determines otherwise, each such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the same
Participant, shall be in a form prescribed by the Committee, and shall be ef fective only when filed by the Participant
in writing with the Company during the Participant’ s lifetime. In the absence of any such designation, benefits
remaining unpaid at the Participant’ s death shall be paid to the Participant’ s estate.
(i) Costs and Expenses . The cost and expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by PepsiCo and not char ged to
any A ward or to any Participant.
26

Committee may direct that cash be paid in lieu of fractional shares or may round of f fractional shares, in its
discretion.
(k) Funding of Plan . The Plan shall be unfunded and any benefits under the Plan shall represent an unsecured promise
to pay by the Company . PepsiCo shall not be required to establish or fund any special or separate account or to make
any other segregation of assets to assure the payment of any A ward under the Plan and the existence of any such
account or other segregation of assets shall be consistent with the “unfunded” status of the Plan.
(l) Indemnification . Provisions for the indemnification of of ficers and directors of the Company in connection with the
administration of the Plan shall be as set forth in PepsiCo’ s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws as in ef fect from
time to time.

any successor to PepsiCo, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase,
merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of PepsiCo.
(n) Compliance with Code Section 409A . The Plan is intended to satisfy the requirements of Code Section 409A and any
regulations or guidance that may be adopted thereunder from time to time, including any transition relief available
under applicable guidance related to Code Section 409A. Accordingly , to ensure the exemption from Code Section
409A of potentially exempt A wards and the compliance with Code Section 409A of other A wards, any payment that
under the terms of the Plan or an agreement is to be made as soon as practicable relative to a date shall be made not
later than 60 days after such date, and the Participant may not determine the time of payment. Pursuant to Section
13(b), the Plan may be amended or interpreted by the Committee as it determines necessary or appropriate in
accordance with Code Section 409A and to avoid a plan failure under Code Section 409A(a)(1). If a Participant is a
“specified employee” as defined in Code Section 409A at the time of the Participant’ s separation from service with
the Company , then solely to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of any additional tax under Code Section
409A, the commencement of any payments or benefits under an A ward shall be deferred until the date that is six
months following the Participant’ s separation from service (or such other period as required to comply with Code
Section 409A).

traded in order to be ef fective.
(c) Governing Law . Except as otherwise provided in agreements covering A wards hereunder , all questions pertaining to
