Table of ContentsPART I
ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
The Company
With a history dating back to 1886, American Water is the largest and most geographically diverse, publicly-trade
d water and wastewater utility company inthe
 United States, as measured by both operating revenues and population served. A holding company originally incorporated in Delaware in 1936, the Companyemploys
 approximately  7,000  professionals  who  provide  drinking  water,  wastewater  and  other  related  services  to  over  15  million  people  in  46  states.  TheCompany
 conducts the majority of its business through regulated utilities that provide water and wastewater services, collectively presented as the “RegulatedBusinesses.” The Company
 also operates market-based businesses that provide complementary services. Individually, these businesses do not meet the criteria of areportable
 segment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), and are collectively presented as the “Market-Based Businesses,” which is consistent with how m
anagement assesses the results of these businesses.Throughout this
 Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” and “American Water” mean AmericanWater Works Company, Inc. and i
ts subsidiaries, taken together as a whole. References to “parent company” mean American Water Works Company, Inc., withoutits subsidiaries.
Regulated Businesses
The Company’s primary business involv
es the ownership of utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential, commercial, industrial, publicauthority,
 fire service and sale for resale customers. The Company’s utilities operate in over 1,700 communities in 16 states in the United States, with 3.5 millionactive customers
 in its water and wastewater networks. Services provided by the Company’s utilities are subject to regulation by multiple state utility commissionsor
 other entities engaged in utility regulation, collectively referred to as public utility commissions (“PUCs”). Federal, state and local governments also regulateenvironmental, health and safety, and water
 quality and water accountability matters. The Company reports the results of the services provided by its utilities in theRegulated
 Businesses segment. Operating revenues for the Regulated Businesses were $3,255 million for 2020, $3,094 million for 2019 and $2,984 million for2018, accounting for 86%, 86% and 87%, r
espectively, of the Company’s total operating revenues for the same periods.Presented
 in the table below is a geographic summary of the Regulated Businesses’ operating revenues and the number of customers the Company serves,by type of service, for and as o

Table of  ContentsCustomers
The
 Company’s Regulated Businesses have a large and geographically diverse customer base. A customer is defined as a person, business, municipality orany other entity that purchases the Company’s water or wa
stewater services as of the last business day of a reporting period. One single customer may purchase theCompany’s
 services for use by multiple individuals or businesses. Examples of these customers are homes, apartment complexes, businesses and governmentalentities.
The
 vast majority of the Company’s regulated water customers are metered, which allows the Company to measure and bill for its customers’ water usage,typically
 on a monthly basis. The Company employs a variety of methods of customer meter reading to monitor consumption. These methods range from meterswith
 mechanical registers where consumption is manually recorded by meter readers, to meters with electronic registers capable of transmitting consumption datato
 proximity devices or via radio frequency to mobile or fixed network data collectors. The Company’s wastewater customers are billed either a flat rate or basedupon their water consumption.
Residential
 customers make up a substantial portion of the Company’s customer base in all of the states in which it operates. The Company also serves (i)commercial
 customers, such as food and beverage providers, commercial property developers and proprietors, and energy suppliers, (ii) fire service customers,where
 the Company supplies water through its distribution systems to public fire hydrants for firefighting purposes and to private fire customers for use in firesuppression
 systems in office buildings and other facilities, (iii) industrial customers, such as large-scale manufacturers, mining and production operations, (iv)public
 authorities, such as government buildings and other public sector facilities, including schools and universities, and (v) other utilities and community waterand wastewater systems in the 
form of bulk contracts for the supply of water or the treatment of wastewater for their own customers.The following chart
 depicts the allocation of the Company’s Regulated Businesses’ operating revenue of $3,255 million by type, including a breakout of thetotal water services 
revenues by class of customer, for the year ended December 31, 2020:
(a)
Includes water revenues from public authorities and other utilities and community water syste ms under bulk contracts.(b)

Customer
 growth in the Company’s Regulated Businesses is primarily from (i) adding new customers to its customer base through acquisitions of waterand/or wastewater utili
ty systems, (ii) population growth in its authorized service areas, and (iii) sale of water to other water utilities and community water systems.Capital Investment
The
 Company plans to invest between $22 billion and $25 billion over the next 10 years, including acquisitions, for capital improvements to its RegulatedBusinesses’
 water and wastewater infrastructure, largely for pipe replacement and upgrading aging water and wastewater treatment facilities. The Company hasproactively improved its
 pipe renewal rate from a 250-year replacement cycle in 2009 to an expected 110-year replacement cycle by 2025, which it anticipates willenable
 the Company to replace nearly 2,200 miles of mains and collection pipes between 2021 and 2025. In addition, from 2021 to 2025, the Company’s capitalinvestment
 in treatment plants, storage tanks and other key, above-ground facilities is expected to increase, further addressing infrastructure renewal, resiliency,water
 quality,  operational  efficiency,  technology  and  innovation,  and  emerging  regulatory  compliance  needs.  Additionally,  the  Company  continues  to  investsignificantly
 in resiliency projects to address the impacts of climate and weather variability by hardening its assets. Recently completed projects include a $15million
 emergency power generation system installation at New Jersey’s Raritan Millstone Water Treatment Plant which provides automated standby power in theevent
 of a power failure, and $23 million and $27 million Water Treatment Plant Improvement projects to retire obsolete pumping and water treatment facilitieslocated in 100-year floodp
lains in both Muncie and Richmond, Indiana, respectively.Regulation and Rate Making
The
 operations of the Company’s Regulated Businesses are generally subject to regulation by PUCs in the states in which they operate, with the primaryresponsibility
 of the PUCs being the promotion of the overall public interest by balancing the interest of customers and utility investors. Specific authority mightdiffer from state to
 state, but in most states, PUCs review and approve rates charged to customers, accounting treatments, long-term financing programs and cost ofcapital,
 operation  and  maintenance  (“O&M”)  expenses,  capital  expenditures,  taxes,  affiliated  transactions  and  relationships,  reorganizations,  mergers  andacquisitions, and dispositions, along with imposing certain penalties or
 granting certain incentives. Regulatory policies vary from state to state and can change overtime. These policies wil
l affect the timing, as well as the extent, of recovery of expenses and the realized return on invested capital.Periodic
 changes in customer rates generally occur through the filing of a rate case by the utility with the PUC. The timing of rate case filings is typicallydetermined
 by either periodic requirements in the regulatory jurisdiction or by the utility’s need to increase its revenue requirement to recover capital investmentcosts,
 changes in operating revenues, operating costs or other market conditions. The Company attempts to minimize “regulatory lag,” which is the time betweenthe occurrence of an event
 that triggers a change in the utility’s revenue requirement and the recognition in rates of that change.6

Table of  ContentsThe
 Company’s Regulated Businesses support regulatory practices at the PUCs and state legislatures that mitigate the adverse impact of regulatory lag.Presented in the table be
low are examples of approved regulatory practices:Regulatory Practices
Description States Allowed Infrastructure replacement
surcharge mechanisms
Allows  rates  to  change  periodically,  outside  a  general  rate  case  proceeding,  to  reflect  recovery  of  capital  investmentsmade
 to  replace  infrastructure  necessary  to  sustain  safe  and  reliable  services  for  the  Company’s  customers.  Thesemechanisms typically involve periodic filings and reviews to ensure transparency.
IA, IL, IN, KY, MO, NJ,NY, PA, TN, VA, WV
Future test year
A  “test  year”  is  a  period  used  for  setting  rates,  and  a  future  test  year  describes  the  first  12  months  that  new  rates  areproposed
 to  be  effective.  The  use  of  a  future  test  year  allows  current  or  projected  revenues,  expenses  and  capitalinvestments to be collected on a more timely bas
is.CA, HI, IA, IL, IN, KY,NY, PA, TN, VA
Hybrid test year
A  historical test year sets rates using data from a 12-month period that ends prior to a general rate case filing. A hybridtest
 year allows an update to historical data for “known and measurable” changes that occur subsequent to the historicaltest year.
MD, MO, NJ, WVUtility plant recovery mechanisms
Allows recovery of the full return on utility plant costs during the construction period, instead of capita lizing an allowancefor
 funds used during construction (“AFUDC”). In addition, some states allow the utility to seek pre-approval of certaincapital projects and associated costs. In this pre-approval process, the PUC may assess the prudency of such projects.
CA, IL, KY, NY, PA,TN, VA
Expense mechanisms
Allows  changes in certain operating expenses, which may fluctuate based on conditions beyond the utility’s control, to berecovered outside of a general rate case proceeding or deferred until the next general rate case proceeding.
CA, IL, MD, MO, NJ,NY, PA, TN, VA
Revenue stability mechanisms
Adjusts  rates periodically to ensure that a utility recovers the revenues authorized in its general rate case, regardless ofsales
 volume, including recognition of declining sales resulting from reduced consumption, while providing an incentivefor customers to use water more efficiently.
CA, IL, NYConsolidated tariffs
Use  of  a  unified  rate  structure  for  water  systems  owned  and  operated  by  a  single  utility,  which  may  or  may  not  bephysically
 interconnected.  The  consolidated  tariff  pricing  structure  may  be  used  fully  or  partially  in  a  state,  and  isgenerally
 used to moderate the price impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs, while lowering administrative costs forcustomers. Pennsylvania also permits a blending of water and wastewater revenue requirements.
CA, IA, IL, IN, KY, MD,MO, NJ, NY, PA, VA,

Deferred accounting
A regulators’ willingness to defer recognition of financial impacts when setting rates for utilities. All The
 Company  pursues enhancements  to  these  regulatory  practices  to  facilitate  efficient  recovery  of  its costs  and  capital  investments  and to  continue  toprovide
 safe, clean, reliable and affordable services to its customers. The ability to seek regulatory treatment using the regulatory practices described above doesnot
 guarantee  that  the  PUCs  will  accept  the  Company’s  proposal  in  the  context  of  a  particular  rate  case,  and  these  regulatory  practices  may  reduce,  but  noteliminate,
 regulatory lag associated with traditional rate making processes. It is also the Company’s strategy to expand the use of these mechanisms in areas wherethey may not currently app
ly and enhance certain mechanisms where they already exist.Acquisitions and Strategic Growth
The
 U.S. water and wastewater industries include investor-owned systems as well as municipal systems that are owned and operated by local governmentsor
 governmental subdivisions. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), as of 2017, approximately 84% of the water market is served bymunicipal
 systems  and  approximately  98%  of  the  country’s  wastewater  systems  are  government  owned.  The  EPA  also  estimates,  as  of  2017,  that  there  areapproximately
 50,000 community water systems and approximately 15,000 community wastewater systems in the United States, with approximately 80% of thecommunity water systems se
rving a population of 3,000 or less.A
 fundamental aspect of the Company’s growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions of water and/or wastewater systems in geographic proximity to areaswhere
 the Company operates its Regulated Businesses. The proximity of acquisition opportunities to the Company’s regulated footprint allows it to integrate andmanage
 the acquired systems and operations primarily using the Company’s existing management (although the Company typically retains the majority, if not all,of
 the employees of the acquired systems) and to achieve operational efficiencies and prioritize capital investment needs. The Company’s current customer mix of93%
 water and 7% wastewater also presents strategic opportunities for wastewater growth and systems consolidation, allowing the Company to add wastewatercustomers
 where it already serves water customers. The Company intends to continue to expand its regulated footprint geographically  by acquiring water andwastewater
 systems  in  its  existing  markets  and,  if  appropriate,  pursuing  acquisition  opportunities  in  certain  domestic  markets  where  the  Company  does  notcurrently operate its Regulated Businesses. 
Before entering new regulated markets, the Company will evaluate the business and regulatory climates to ensure that itwill
 have the opportunity to achieve an appropriate rate of return on its investment while maintaining its high standards for providing safe, reliable and affordableservices to its custome
rs, as well as a line of sight to grow the Company’s base customers to attain efficiencies after entering the new domestic market.Increasingly
 stringent  environmental,  health  and  safety,  and  water  quality  and  water  accountability  regulations,  the  amount  of  infrastructure  in  need  ofsignificant
 capital investment, financial challenges and industry legislation are several elements, among others, that may drive more municipalities to considerselling their water and was
tewater assets.7

On
 November  20,  2019,  the  Company  and  the  Company’s  New  York  subsidiary  entered  into  a  Stock  Purchase  Agreement  (the  “Stock  PurchaseAgreement”)
 with Liberty Utilities Co. which it subsequently assigned to its indirect, wholly owned subsidiary Liberty Utilities (Eastern Water Holdings) Corp.(“Liberty”),
 pursuant to which Liberty will purchase all of the capital stock of the New York subsidiary (the “Stock Purchase”) for an aggregate purchase price ofapproximately
 $608 million in cash, subject to adjustment as provided in the Stock Purchase Agreement. The Company’s regulated New York operations haveapproximately
 125,000 customers in the State of New York. Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp., Liberty’s ultimate parent company, executed and delivered anabsolute
 and  unconditional  guaranty  of  the  performance  of  the  obligations  of  Liberty  under  the  Stock  Purchase  Agreement.  The  Stock  Purchase  is  subject  tovarious conditions, including obtaining approvals and satisfying or
 waiving other closing conditions. The Stock Purchase Agreement has an initial termination dateof June 30, 2021. Either party may
 extend the agreement beyond June 30, 2021, and the Company intends to extend the agreement, if necessary, provided all of theconditions
 to closing have been or are capable of being met, other than obtaining regulatory approvals. If not otherwise extended, the ultimate termination date isDecember
 31,  2021.  Liberty  may  also  terminate  the  Stock  Purchase  Agreement  if  any  governmental  authority  initiates  a  condemnation  or  eminent  domainproceeding against a ma
jority of the consolidated properties of the New York subsidiary, taken as a whole.In
 the fourth quarter of 2020, the Governor of New York proposed legislation that, among other things, requires the New York State Department of PublicService (“NYSDPS”)
 to study whether private water suppliers should be placed under municipal control. On February 3, 2021, the Governor issued a press releaseannouncing
 that  he  directed  the  NYSDPS  Special  Counsel  to  commence  and  lead  a  municipalization  feasibility  study  to  be  completed  by  April  1,  2021.Meanwhile,
 the Company’s New York subsidiary continues to work constructively with the NYSDPS and is taking the actions necessary to complete the StockPurchase.
 Subject to satisfying or waiving the various conditions to closing, and assuming no prior termination of the Stock Purchase Agreement by Liberty asdescribed
 above, the Company remains confident that the Stock Purchase will be completed, though the date of the close of the transaction could be impacted bythe timing of the work to be co
mpleted by the NYSDPS Special Counsel.Industry Legislation
In
 2017, New Jersey enacted the Water Quality Accountability Act (the “WQAA”), which sets operational standards for all water utilities in New Jersey,including
 municipal and investor-owned utilities  with more than 500 service  connections.  This law imposes requirements  in areas such as cybersecurity,  assetmanagement, water quality reporting, remediation of notices of violation, and hydra
nt and valve maintenance. The WQAA requires the most senior water manager,or
 either the executive director for municipal utility authorities or the mayor or chief executive officer for municipally owned public water systems, to certify thatthe
 system meets the requirements under the WQAA. In an effort to strengthen accountability under the WQAA, the New Jersey Senate held three hearings on theWQAA during 2020. The New Jersey Assembly has also
 heard legislation to strengthen the WQAA in one committee, and referral to the Assembly AppropriationsCommittee is pending.
The
 Company’s regulated subsidiaries in California, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia have access to fairmarket
 value legislation for private sector investment in public sector water and wastewater systems. The Company supports full optionality for municipalities,including
 state legislation that enables the consolidation of the largely fragmented water and wastewater industries through third-party fair market valuations ofpurchased property. Fair market value assessment of water and waste
water systems is an alternative to the traditional depreciated original cost method of valuation,which
 allows the Company to offer municipalities a purchase price for their system assets that is reflective of the assets’ fair market value, while providing theCompany with increased opportunity 
to recover the purchase price over the life of the purchased system assets, subject to PUC approval.In
 2020,  legislation  in  Indiana  was  passed  that  created  an  appraisal  process  to  establish  fair  value  for  non-municipal  utilities  and  a  presumption  that  apurchase
 price not exceeding the appraised value is reasonable. That legislation also requires that all new municipal water and wastewater systems are subject tothe
 jurisdiction of the utility regulatory commission for ten years. Separate legislation authorizes recovery for above ground infrastructure, without a full rate case,for
 service  enhancements  that  are  completed  for  health,  safety  or  environmental  concerns.  That  same  legislation  also  removed  relocations  completed  for  roadconstruction from the dis
tribution system improvement charge recovery caps.Consolidated
 tariffs use a unified rate structure for systems owned and operated by a single utility, which may or may not be physically interconnected.Consolidated tariff
 pricing moderates the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs and promotes a more universal water infrastructure investment in a state. Asa
 result, consolidated tariffs can make it easier to incorporate new systems into an existing utility, support economies of scale for even the smallest of systems andprioritize
 capital needs across the state. Overall, the Company believes that consolidated tariffs bring cost-effective, high quality services to a larger number ofcustomers.
 Twelve of the Company’s regulated jurisdictions currently have some form of consolidated tariff pricing, including California, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvan
ia, Virginia and West Virginia.8

Table of  ContentsIn
 2020, legislation in West Virginia was passed that allows for expanded asset valuation in connection with the acquisition of a utility or utility assets,combined
 water and wastewater revenue requirements and the expansion of permitted uses by municipalities of proceeds from the sale of a water or wastewatersystem. The
 legislation also allows inclusion of contributed property in a system’s asset valuation and rate base recognition for the full purchase price approved bythe Public Service Commission of 
West Virginia.In
 December 2020, Congress passed and the President signed into law a $900 billion COVID-19 relief and $1.4 trillion U.S. government appropriationspackage
 for 2021, which included $638 million for a low-income water assistance program and $2.8 billion for capitalization grants under the Clean Water andDrinking Water State Revolving Funds. The Comp
any is awaiting further guidance on the distribution of these funds.Competition
The
 Company’s Regulated Businesses generally do not face direct competition in their existing markets because (i) the Company operates in those marketspursuant
 to franchises, charters, certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations (collectively, “CPCNs”) issued by state PUCs or otherauthorities,
 and (ii) the high cost of constructing a new water and wastewater system in an existing market creates a significant barrier to market entry. However,the Company’s
 Regulated Businesses do face competition from governmental agencies, other investor-owned utilities, large industrial customers with the ability toprovide
 their  own  water  supply/treatment  process  and  strategic  buyers  that  are  entering  new  markets  and/or  making  strategic  acquisitions.  When  pursuingacquisitions,
 the Company’s largest investor-owned competitors, based on a comparison of operating revenues and population served, include Essential Utilities,Inc.
 (formerly known as Aqua America, Inc.), Suez North America, American States Water Company and California Water Service Group. From time to time, theCompany
 also faces competition from infrastructure funds, multi-utility companies and others, such as Algonquin Power and Utilities Corp., Eversource Energyand Corix.
Condemnation and Eminent Domain
All
 or portions of the Regulated Businesses’ utility assets could be acquired by state, municipal or other government entities through one or more of thefollowing
 methods: (i) eminent domain (also known as condemnation); (ii) the right of purchase given or reserved by a municipality or political subdivision whenthe
 original CPCN was granted; and (iii) the right of purchase given or reserved under the law of the state in which the utility subsidiary was incorporated or fromwhich
 it  received  its  CPCN.  The  acquisition  consideration  related  to  such  a  proceeding  initiated  by  a  local  government  may  be  determined  consistent  withapplicable eminent do
main law, or may be negotiated or fixed by appraisers as prescribed by the law of the state or in the particular CPCN.As such, the Regulated Businesses are periodically
 subject to condemnation proceedings in the ordinary course of business. For example, a citizens group inMonterey,
 California  successfully  added  “Measure  J”  to  the  November  2018  election  ballot  asking  voters  to  decide  whether  the  Monterey  Peninsula  WaterManagement
 District  (the  “MPWMD”)  should  conduct  a  feasibility  study  concerning  the  potential  purchase  of  the  Monterey  water  service  system  assets  (the“Monterey
 system assets”) of the Company’s California subsidiary, and, if feasible, to proceed with a purchase of those assets without an additional public vote.This
 service territory represents approximately 40,000 customers. In November 2018, Measure J was certified to have passed. In August 2019, the MPWMD’sGeneral
 Manager  issued  a  report  that  recommends  that  the  MPWMD  board  (1)  develop  criteria  to  determine  which  water  systems  should  be  considered  foracquisition;
 (2) examine the feasibility of acquiring the Monterey system assets and consider public ownership of smaller systems only if the MPWMD becomesthe
 owner of a larger system; (3) evaluate whether the acquisition of the Monterey system assets by the MPWMD is in the public interest and sufficiently satisfiesthe
 criterion of “feasible” as provided in Measure J; (4) ensure there is significant potential for cost savings before agreeing to commence an acquisition; and (5)develop more fully alt
ernate operating plans before deciding whether to consider a Resolution of Necessity.In
 November 2019, the MPWMD issued a preliminary valuation and cost of service analysis report, finding in part that (1) an estimate of the Montereysystem
 assets’ total value plus adjustments would be approximately $513 million, (2) the cost of service modeling results indicate significant annual reductions inrevenue
 requirements and projected monthly water bills, and (3) the acquisition of the Monterey system assets by the MPWMD would be economically feasible.On
 June  12,  2020,  the  MPWMD  issued  a  draft  environmental  impact  report  for  the  potential  acquisition  of  the  Monterey  system  assets  and  a  related  districtboundary
 adjustment that would be required if the MPWMD were to acquire and operate certain of the Monterey system assets located outside the MPWMD’sboundaries. On
 September 15, 2020, the MPWMD gave notice of its intention to appraise the Monterey system assets and related property interests. On September29,
 2020, the Company’s California subsidiary declined to make the Monterey system assets and related property interests available for inspection or to complywith
 any of the other requests contained in the MPWMD’s notice. On October 7, 2020, the MPWMD issued a final environmental impact report (“FEIR”), and onNovember
 4, 2020, the MPWMD certified the FEIR, which purports to analyze the environmental impacts of the MPWMD’s project to (1) acquire the Montereysystem
 assets through the power of eminent domain, if necessary, and (2) expand its geographic boundaries to include all parts of this system. On November 25,2020,
 the Company’s California subsidiary filed a petition challenging this certification in court. See Item 3—Legal Proceedings—Challenge of Certification—Proposed Monterey System Final Environm
ental Impact Report.9

Table of  ContentsThe
 MPWMD will be required to file an application with the Local Agency Formation Commission of Monterey County (“LAFCO”) seeking approval tobecome
 a  retail  water  provider  and  annex  approximately  56  parcels  of  land  into  the  MPWMD’s  boundaries.  Approval  by  LAFCO  is  a  precondition  to  theMPWMD’s ability to file
 an eminent domain proceeding against the Company’s California subsidiary to acquire the Monterey system assets. If the MPWMD wereto
 make a final determination that an acquisition of the Monterey system assets is feasible, it would then need to file a multi-year eminent domain proceedingagainst
 the  Company’s  California  subsidiary.  In  that  proceeding,  it  would  first  need  to  establish  its  right  to  take  the  Monterey  system  assets.  If  such  right  isestablished, the amount of 
just compensation to be paid to the California subsidiary for such assets would then need to be determined.Also, five
 municipalities in the Chicago, Illinois area (approximately 30,300 customers in total) formed a water agency and filed an eminent domain lawsuitagainst
 the Company’s Illinois subsidiary in January 2013, seeking to condemn the water pipeline that serves those five municipalities. Before filing its eminentdomain
 lawsuit, the water agency made an offer of $38 million for the pipeline. The parties have filed with the court updated valuation reports. Although the dateof the valuation tria
l is not currently scheduled, it is not likely to commence until the second quarter of 2021.Furthermore,
 the  law  in  certain  jurisdictions  in  which  the  Regulated  Businesses  operate  provides  for  eminent  domain  rights  allowing  private  propertyowners to file a lawsuit to seek just compensation against a public utilit
y, if a public utility’s infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of damageto that
 property. In these actions, the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently. In California, lawsuits have been filed in connectionwith
 large-scale natural events such as wildfires. Some of these lawsuits have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities triggered the natural eventthat
 resulted in damage to the property. In some cases, the PUC has allowed certain costs or losses incurred by the utility to be recovered from customers in rates,but
 in other cases such recovery  in rates has been disallowed. Also, the utility  may have obtained insurance  that could respond to some or all of such losses,although the utility would be a
t risk for any losses not ultimately subject to rate or insurance recovery or losses that exceed the limits of such insurance.Water Supply and Wastewater Services
The
 Company’s Regulated Businesses generally own the physical assets used to store, pump, treat and deliver water to its customers and collect, treat,transport
 and recycle wastewater. Typically, the Company does not own the water, which is held in public trust and is allocated to the Company through contracts,permits
 and allocation rights granted by federal and state or multi-state agencies or through the ownership of water rights pursuant to local law. The Company isdependent
 on  defined  sources  of  water  supply  and  obtains  its  water  supply  from  surface  water  sources  such  as  reservoirs,  lakes,  rivers  and  streams;  fromgroundwater
 sources, such as wells and aquifers; and water purchased from third-party water suppliers. The level of water treatment the Company applies variessignificantly
 depending upon the quality of the water source and customer stipulations. Surface water sources typically generally require significant treatment,while groundwater sources often 
require chemical treatment only.10

 Company’s  ability  to  meet  the  existing  and  future  water  demands  of  its  customers  depends  on  an  adequate  water  supply.  Drought,  governmentalrestrictions,
 overuse of sources of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats, contamination or other factors may limit the availability of ground andsurface
 water. The Company employs a variety of measures in an effort to obtain adequate sources of water supply, both in the short-term and over the long-term.The geographic diversity of the Company’s service areas may mitigate some of the economic effects on the water suppl
y associated with weather extremes it mightencounter
 in any particular service territory. For example, in any given summer, some areas may experience drier than average weather, which may reduce theamount of source water ava
ilable, while other areas the Company serves may experience wetter than average weather.11

Table of  ContentsThe
 Company evaluates quality, quantity, growth needs and alternate sources of water supply as well as transmission and distribution capacity to providewater
 service to its customers. Water supply is seasonal in nature and weather conditions can have a pronounced effect on supply. In order to ensure that theCompany
 has adequate water supply, it uses long-term planning processes and maintains contingency plans to minimize the potential impact on service caused byclimate
 variability and a wide range of weather fluctuations. In connection with supply planning for most surface or groundwater sources, the Company employsmodels
 to determine safe yields under different rainfall and drought conditions. Surface and ground water levels are routinely monitored so that supply capacitydeficits
 may, to the extent possible, be predicted and mitigated through demand management and additional supply development. An example of the Company’suse
 of long-term  planning  to ensure  that  it has adequate  water supply is its involvement  in the Monterey  Peninsula  Water  Supply Project  (the “Water  SupplyProject”)
 in California. The Water Supply Project includes the construction of a desalination plant, to be owned by the Company’s California subsidiary, and theconstruction
 of wells that would supply water to the desalination plant. In addition, the Water Supply Project also includes the California subsidiary’s purchase ofwater
 from a groundwater replenishment project (the “GWR Project”) between Monterey One Water (formerly known as the Monterey Regional Water PollutionControl
 Agency)  and  the  MPWMD.  The  Water  Supply  Project  is  intended,  among  other  things,  to  fulfill  obligations  of  the  California  subsidiary  to  eliminateunauthorized
 diversions  from  the  Carmel  River  as  required  under  orders  of  the  California  State  Water  Resources  Control  Board  (the  “SWRCB”).  For  moreinformation,
 see Item 3—Legal Proceedings—Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions and Note 17—Commitments and Contingencies—Contingencies—Alternative 
Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Wastewater services 
involve the collection of wastewater from customers’ premises through sewer lines. The wastewater is then transported through a sewernetwork
 to a treatment facility, where it is treated to meet required regulatory standards for wastewater before being returned to the environment. The solid wasteby-product of the treat
ment process is disposed of or recycled in accordance with applicable standards and regulations.Seasonality
Customer
 demand  for  the  Company’s  water  service  is  affected  by  weather  and  tends  to  vary  with  temperature  and  amount  and  frequency  of  rainfall.Customer
 demand is generally greater during the warmer months, primarily due to increased water usage for irrigation systems and other outdoor water use. Assuch,
 the Company typically expects its operating revenues to be the highest in the third quarter of each year. Weather that is hotter and/or drier than averagegenerally
 increases operating revenues, whereas, weather that is cooler and/or wetter than average generally serves to suppress customer water demand and canreduce
 water  operating  revenues.  Three  of  the  Company’s  jurisdictions,  California,  Illinois  and  New  York,  have  adopted  revenue  stability  mechanisms  whichpermit
 the Company to collect state PUC-authorized revenue for a given period which is not tied to the volume of water sold during that period, thereby lesseningthe impact of weather v
ariability. See Regulated Businesses—Regulation and Rate Making for additional information regarding revenue stability mechanisms.Market-Based Businesses
The
 Company’s  Market-Based  Businesses  provide  home  services  primarily  to  residential  and  smaller  commercial  customers  and  water  and  wastewaterservices
 to the U.S. government on military installations, as well as municipalities, and utility customers. These businesses are not subject to regulation by statePUCs
 and the services provided generally do not require significant capital investment. Operating revenues for the Company’s Market-Based Businesses were$540
 million  for  2020,  $539  million  for  2019  and  $476  million  for  2018,  accounting  for  14%,  15%  and  14%,  respectively,  of  the  Company’s  total  operatingrevenues for the same pe
riods.The Company’s primary Market
-Based Businesses include the following operating segments:•
Homeowner Services Group (“HOS”), which provides va rious warranty protection programs and other home services to residential customers;•
Military  Services  Group  (“MSG”),  which  enters  into  long-term  contracts  with  the  U.S.  government  to  provide  water  and  wastewater  services  onvarious military installations.
The
 Company also has five contracts with municipal customers to operate and manage water and wastewater facilities and provide other related servicesthrough its Contract Services Group 
(“CSG”).12

Table of  ContentsHomeowner Services Group
The Company’s Homeowner Services Group, which inc
ludes the operations of Pivotal Home Solutions (“Pivotal”) acquired in June 2018, provides warrantyprotection
 programs and other home services to residential customers for interior and exterior water and sewer lines, interior gas and electric lines, heating andcooling
 systems, water heaters and other home appliances, as well as power surge protection and other related services. The Company develops partnerships withmunicipalities,
 utilities  and  other  organizations  to  offer  protection  programs  to  customers  serviced  by,  or  affiliated  with,  those  municipalities,  utilities  andorganizations.
 The  term  of  these  partnership  agreements  with  the  municipalities,  utilities  and  other  organizations  is  typically  three  to  five  years,  with  mutualoptional renewals. As of Decembe
r 31, 2020, HOS had approximately 3 million customer contracts in 43 states.Military Services Group
The
 Company’s  Military  Services  Group  operates  on  17  military  installations  under  50-year  contracts  with  the  U.S.  government  as  part  of  its  UtilitiesPrivatization
 Program. The scope of these contracts generally includes the operation and maintenance of the installation’s water and wastewater systems and acapital program
 focused on asset replacement and, in certain instances, systems expansion. The replacement of assets assumed when a contract is awarded to MSGis
 completed either through a discrete set of projects executed in the first five years of the contract or through the long term recapitalization program performedover
 the life of the contract. Traditionally, both of these programs are funded from the contract fee. At times, new assets are required to support the installation’smission, and the construction of these assets is funde
d by the U.S. government as separate modifications or amendments to the contract. The capital for these assetshistorically has
 not been funded through the Company’s debt or equity issuances; rather, the Company has used limited working capital for short-term needs underthese contracts. In April 2018, the U.
S. Army instituted a requirement that a bidder must offer financing in its proposal for these new capital projects under existingcontracts,
 but the U.S. Army’s implementation of this requirement on existing contracts has limited the need for such financing. However, recent U.S. Army andNavy
 Utilities Privatization solicitations have included requirements for the successful bidder to finance discrete initial capital projects over either a five- or ten-year
 period after project completion. Three of MSG’s current contracts require such capital project financing, which the Company is currently addressing throughinternal sources of liqu
idity.The
 contract price for six of MSG’s contracts with the U.S. government is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations, andevery
 three years thereafter. Price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period, to reflect changes in contractobligations
 and anticipated market conditions. The remaining 11 contracts with the U.S. government are subject to annual price adjustments under a mechanismcalled
 “Economic Price Adjustment.” All 17 contracts could be terminated, in whole or in part, prior to the end of the 50-year term for convenience of the U.S.government,
 or  as  a  result  of  default  or  non-performance  by  the  MSG  subsidiary  performing  the  contract.  In  either  event,  pursuant  to  termination  provisionsapplicable
 to all of these contracts, MSG would be entitled to recover allowable costs that it may have incurred under the contract, plus the contract profit marginon
 incurred costs. MSG’s backlog of revenue associated with its contracts with the U.S. government is approximately $6.2 billion, with an average remainingcontract term of 41 years.
Competition
The
 Company’s Market-Based Businesses face competition from a number of service providers, including HomeServe USA and Cinch Home Services inHOS, and American States Water Company, Sue
z North America, and Veolia Environnement S.A. in MSG.Environmental, Health and Safety, Water Quality and Other Regula
tionThe
 Company’s  water  and  wastewater  operations,  including  the  services  provided  by  both  its  Regulated  Businesses  and  Market-Based  Businesses,  aresubject
 to  extensive  federal,  state  and  local  laws  and  regulations  governing  the  protection  of  the  environment,  health  and  safety,  the  provision  of  water  andwastewater
 services, particularly with respect to the quality of water the Company delivers to its customers, and the manner in which it collects, treats, discharges,recycles
 and disposes of wastewater. In the United States, these regulations are developed under federal legislation including the Safe Drinking Water Act, theReduction
 of Lead in Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act, and under a variety of applicable state laws. Environmental, health and safety, and waterquality
 regulations are complex and may vary from state to state in those instances where a state has adopted a standard that is more stringent than the federalstandard.
 For example, while the EPA has issued a non-enforceable Health Advisory for the combined level of two perfluorinated compounds (perfluorooctanoicacid, or
 PFOA, and perfluorooctane sulfonate, or PFOS), the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection was the first state agency to establish a standardfor
 perfluorononanoic acid, or PFNA, in 2018 and has since established maximum containment levels for PFOA and PFOS, with implementation occurring inJanuary
 2021. The Company is also subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the storage of hazardous materials, the managementand disposal of hazardous and solid wa
stes, discharges to air and water, the cleanup of contaminated sites, dam safety and other matters relating to the protection ofthe environment and heal
th and safety. PUCs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services the Company delivers.13

Table of  ContentsThe
 Company  maintains  an  environmental  program  that  includes  responsible  business  practices  focused  on  compliance  with  environmental  laws  andregulations
 and  the  effective  use  of  natural  resources,  recognizing  that  drinking  water  standards  have  generally,  over  time,  increased  in  number  and  becomeincreasingly
 more  stringent.  As newer or stricter  standards  are  introduced,  the Company’s capital  and operating  costs needed to comply  with them  will likelyincrease.
 The Company incurs substantial costs associated with compliance with the environmental, health and safety, and water quality standards to which itsoperations are subject 
and the Company invests in technology solutions for enhanced detection and monitoring of water quality issues. The Company estimates thatit
 will make  capital  expenditures  of approximately  $725 million  over the next five  years,  including  $155 million  in 2021, for environmental  control  facilities,which
 the Company defines for this purpose as any project (or portion thereof) that involves the preservation of air, water or land. The Company believes that itsoperations are mate
rially in compliance with, and in many cases surpass, minimum standards required by applicable environmental laws and regulations.The
 Company’s  operations  also  involve  the  use,  storage  and  disposal  of  hazardous  substances  and  wastes.  For  example,  the  Company’s  water  andwastewater
 treatment  facilities  store  and  use  chlorine  and  other  chemicals  that  generate  wastes  that  require  proper  handling  and  disposal  under  applicableenvironmental
 requirements. The Company also could incur remedial costs in connection with any contamination relating to its operations or facilities or its off-site disposal of wastes. The Compreh
ensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), authorizes the EPA, and comparablestate
 laws authorize state environmental authorities, to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedialactions at
 any site that is determined to present an actual or potential threat to human health or the environment because of an actual or threatened release of one ormore
 hazardous substances. Parties that generated or transported hazardous substances to such sites, as well as current and former owners and operators of suchsites,
 may be deemed liable, without regard to fault, under CERCLA or comparable state laws. Although the Company is not aware of any material cleanup ordecontamination obliga
tions, the discovery of contamination or the imposition of such obligations in the future could result in additional costs to the Company. TheCompany’s facilities and op
erations are also subject to requirements under the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act and inspections thereunder.Safe Drinking Water Act
The
 Safe Drinking Water Act and related regulations establish national quality standards for drinking water. The EPA has issued rules governing the levelsof numerous, naturally occu
rring and man-made chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water, and continues to propose newrules.
 These  rules  also  prescribe  testing  requirements  for  detecting  regulated  contaminants,  the  treatment  systems  that  may  be  used  for  removing  thosecontaminants,
 and other requirements. To date, the EPA has set standards for over 90 contaminants and water quality indicators for drinking water, and there is aprocess in place to make 
a regulatory determination on at least five additional compounds every five years.To
 help  formulate  the  basis  for  future  regulations,  the  EPA  has  the  authority  to  require  monitoring  for  additional,  unregulated  contaminants  under  theUnregulated
 Contaminant Monitoring Rule (the “Monitoring Rule”). The Company’s facilities have participated in the data gathering effort for the MonitoringRule
 in  previous  rounds,  which  occurs  every  five  years,  including  the  fourth  round  that  concluded  at  the  end  of  2020.  There  are  millions  of  other  chemicalcompounds
 that are not regulated, many of which lack a testing methodology, occurrence data, health effects information and/or cost effective treatment options.The process
 of developing new drinking water standards is long and complex, but the Company actively participates with the EPA and other water industry groupsby sharing research and wate
r quality operational knowledge. See Research and Development—Contaminants of Emerging Concern for additional information.To
 effect the removal or inactivation of microbial contaminants, the EPA has established various rules to improve the disinfection and filtration of drinkingwater and to reduce consume
rs’ exposure to disinfectants and/or the by-products of their use in the disinfection process. Examples of these rules are the Long-Term2
 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (the “Long-Term 2 Rule”), the Stage 2 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproduct Rule, and the Ground Water Rule,which
 is applicable to systems providing water from underground sources. In 2016, the revised Total Coliform Rule implemented a “find and fix” process whereexceeding
 bacterial trigger levels requires an assessment to correct any sanitary defects. The Company is within the EPA’s time frame for compliance with all ofthese
 standards,  which  includes  sample  collection,  data  analysis,  and,  in  some  instances  engineering  planning  and  implementation  of  treatment  enhancements.Recent
 monitoring as required by the Long-Term 2 Rule has indicated that approximately 30 of the Company’s surface water systems have recently completed orneed
 to implement additional disinfection protection mechanisms against Cryptosporidium. In many cases, this will involve installing ultraviolet light disinfectionsystems,
 and  although  several  plants  have  already  completed  assessments  and  upgrades,  an  estimated  $150  million  to  $250  million  of  investment  will  still  berequired
 to upgrade the remaining facilities for Cryptosporidium disinfection. Further, the EPA is actively considering regulations for a number of contaminants,including
 strontium,  hexavalent  chromium,  fluoride,  nitrosamines,  some  pharmaceuticals  and  certain  volatile  organic  compounds.  The  Company  does  notanticipate that any su
ch regulations, if enacted, will require implementation in 2021.14

Table of  ContentsThe
 Company conducted over ten million water quality and turbidity tests in 2020 at its laboratory facilities and plant operations, including continuousonline
 instrumentations such as monitoring turbidity levels, disinfectant residuals and adjustments to chemical treatment based on changes in incoming water. TheCompany
 participates in the Partnership for Safe Water, the EPA’s voluntary program to meet more stringent goals for reducing microbial contaminants. With 68of the Company’s 79
 surface water treatment plants receiving the EPA program’s prestigious “Director” award, which recognizes utilities that (i) have completed acomprehensive
 self-assessment  report,  (ii)  created  an  action  plan  for  continuous  improvement,  and  (iii)  produced  high-quality  drinking  water,  the  Companyaccounts
 for  approximately  one-third  of  the  plants  receiving  such  awards  nationwide.  In  addition,  66  of  the  Company’s  surface  water  treatment  plants  havereceived
 the “Five-Year Phase III” award, 61 plants have received the “Ten-Year Phase III” award, 57 plants have received the “Fifteen-Year Phase III” award,and
 26 plants have received the “Twenty-Year Phase III” award; these awards recognize plants that have met the Director award status for five, 10, 15 and 20years,
 respectively. Further, nine of the Company’s surface water plants have received the “Presidents” award, which recognizes treatment plants that achieve thePartnership’s rigorous individu
al filter effluent turbidity standards.Although
 it is difficult to project the ultimate costs of complying with the above or other pending or future requirements, the Company expects current costrequirements
 under the Safe Drinking Water Act and other similar laws to be recoverable through the regulatory process and therefore compliance costs are notexpected
 to have a material impact on its operations or financial condition. In addition, capital expenditures and operating costs to comply with environmentalmandates
 have been traditionally recognized by PUCs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates. As a result, the Company expects to recover the operatingand capital costs resul
ting from these pending or future requirements.Lead and Copper Rule and Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act
In 1991, the
 EPA published the Lead and Copper Rule (“LCR”) to control lead and copper in drinking water and, since that time, has issued minor revisionsin
 2000, 2004 and 2007, enhancing monitoring, reporting and public education requirements. In 2011, Congress enacted the Reduction of Lead in Drinking WaterAct
 regarding the use and introduction into commerce of lead pipes, plumbing fittings for fixtures, solder and flux. While these advances have made an impact inreducing lead
 exposure in drinking water, legacy lead plumbing materials, primarily in building plumbing, still remain in many communities. The failure of certainwater
 systems in the United States to comply with the requirements of the LCR has received recent media attention and scrutiny, and in certain cases, has led to anumber
 of investigations and the imposition of significant penalties and sanctions against the operators of those systems and others. As part of its ongoing watermain
 replacement and service line renewal projects, the Company has started to replace lead service lines (“LSLs”) in accordance with current scientific guidance.Also, the
 Company utilizes appropriate corrosion control techniques as necessary to comply with current water quality regulatory requirements. The EPA finalizedrevisions to the LCR (the “Revised LCR”) on January 15,
 2021 that are designed to provide more effective protection of public health by reducing exposure to leadand copper
 in drinking water. The Company is in the process of reviewing the Revised LCR and will be developing an implementation strategy to comply with thenew
 requirements, which are mandated by January 2024. Capital expenditures and operating costs associated with compliance with any of these rule revisionscannot
 be presently determined until the Company’s review of the new rule is completed, but, as previously noted, costs associated with compliance with federalwater quality regulat
ions have been traditionally recognized by PUCs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates.The
 Company  currently  estimates  that  less  than  5%  of  the  service  lines  within  its  regulated  service  territories  contain  lead  on  either  the  Company  orcustomer
 portion  of  the  service  line.  The  Company  is  replacing  LSLs  as  part  of  its  ongoing  water  main  replacement  and  service  line  renewal  projects.  TheCompany’s
 goal is to work with the communities it currently serves to replace a significant majority of presently known LSLs in most of its service areas by theend of
 2030, at an estimated cost ranging from $600 million to $1.2 billion. The Company believes this will be attainable for most of its service areas where publicpolicy
 is supportive of this goal. With regard to future acquisitions, the Company will work with those communities as part of the acquisition process to set LSLremoval
 goals appropriate for those systems. The prioritization of LSL removal is dependent on several factors, including the Company’s planned water main andservice
 line renewal projects, adjacent projects by municipalities or other utilities, LCR compliance monitoring results, and cooperation with its customers withrespect
 to replacing the customer-owned portion of the LSL as necessary. In certain cases, these and other factors may result in a shorter or longer time frame forreplacement.
 Because replacing the external LSL in its entirety is advised by several water industry organizations including the U.S. National Drinking WaterAdvisory Council, the
 Lead Service Line Replacement Collaborative, and the American Water Works Association, the Company’s preferred approach is to replacethe
 entire external LSL if lead is found on either the Company or customer portion of the service line; full LSL replacement is also consistent with the RevisedLCR.
 The  Lead  Service  Line  Replacement  Collaborative  is  a  diverse  group  of  public  health,  water  utility,  environmental,  labor,  consumer  and  housingorganizations
 from across the country working together to encourage communities to accelerate the full replacement of LSLs through collaborative efforts at thelocal level.

Table of  ContentsClean Water Act
The Clean Water Act regulates discharges from drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities into lakes, rivers, streams and groun
dwater. In addition torequirements
 applicable  to  the  Company’s  wastewater  collection  systems,  its  operations  require  discharge  permits  under  the  National  Pollutant  DischargeElimination
 System (“NPDES”) permit program established under the Clean Water Act, which must be renewed every five years. Pursuant to the NPDES permitprogram,
 the EPA and implementing states set maximum discharge limits for wastewater effluents and overflows from wastewater collection systems. Dischargesthat
 exceed the limits specified under NPDES permits can lead to the imposition of fines and penalties, and persistent non-compliance could lead to significantfines
 and penalties and other compliance costs. In addition, the difficulty of obtaining and complying with NPDES permits, and renewing expiring permits, mayimpose
 time and cost burdens on the Company’s operations. From time to time, discharge violations occur at the Company’s facilities, some of which result infines. The Company does not expect any su
ch violations or fines to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition.Research and Development
The Company’s Research and Development Program
The
 Company maintains an industry-leading research and development (“R&D”) program that is designed to enhance its services, support its complianceactivities,
 improve service quality and operational effectiveness, and provide environmental leadership. For more than three decades from its inception, AmericanWater’s
 R&D program has evolved into an industry-leading effort and has achieved numerous advancements in the science of drinking water, wastewater, anddesalination.
 Through  laboratory  and  industry  resources  and  the  team’s  expertise,  efforts  are  focused  on  contaminants  of  emerging  concern,  including  but  notlimited
 to COVID-19, PFAS, Legionella, cyanotoxin-forming algal blooms, a variety of pathogens (for example, Cryptosporidium, Giardia, enteric viruses, andvarious
 bacteria), microbial indicators and disinfection byproducts. The Company’s R&D personnel are located at the Company’s corporate headquarters and attwo
 laboratory  testing  facilities  in  New  Jersey  and  Illinois,  the  latter  housing  its  quality  control  and  testing  laboratory,  which  supports  the  Company’s  R&Dactivities through tes
ting and analysis.The
 Company continues to leverage its expertise and collaborates with the EPA and state agencies to help establish effective environmental, health andsafety,
 and water quality standards and regulations. This relationship includes the sharing of the Company’s research, such as its treatment and distribution systemoptimization
 research  and  its  national  water  quality  monitoring  data.  The  Company’s  engagement  with  the  EPA  provides  it  with  early  insight  into  emergingregulatory
 issues  and  initiatives,  thereby  allowing  the  Company  to  anticipate  and  to  accommodate  its  future  compliance  requirements.  The  Company  alsofrequently
 engages  with  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control,  other  state  environmental  agencies,  and  national  and  international  water  research  foundations.  TheCompany believes that continu
ed R&D activities are critical for providing safe, reliable and affordable services, as well as maintaining its leadership position in theindustry, which provides the Company with a 
competitive advantage as it seeks business and operational growth.Contaminants of Emerging Concern
Contaminants
 of  emerging  concern  include  numerous  chemicals  such  as  pharmaceuticals,  personal  care  products,  pesticides,  herbicides,  endocrinedisrupting compounds and industria
l chemicals, as well as certain naturally occurring microbes, such as bacteria, viruses and parasites, which have been detected indrinking
 water supplies, for which the risk to the public’s health is not fully understood and/or has not been assessed. Technological advances have only recentlymade
 it possible to detect many of these contaminants at trace levels. The ability to detect contaminants, even at trace levels, has invited discussion about thesecontaminants among regul
ators and government agencies, which in turn shapes the public’s perception of drinking water quality.The
 Chemicals Abstract Service Registry contains over 173 million registered chemicals, with an estimated 1,400 species of disease-causing microbes thatcan
 affect  humans.  The  Company  is  continually  investigating  new  substances  and  contaminants,  employing  a  team  of  scientists,  engineers  and  public  healthprofessionals
 to  identify  threats  to  its  water  supply,  to  act  on  emerging  regulations  and  new  health  advisories,  and  to  evaluate  the  benefits  of  alternative  oradvanced
 treatment technologies. The Company utilizes water quality testing equipment and implements new and emerging technologies to help detect potentialwater supply contamination 
issues. Examples of the Company’s efforts include:•
monitoring impacts of th e COVID-19 pandemic on environmental virus loads and removal efforts through wastewater systems;•
characterizing factors that contribute to the formation of potentially carcinogenic disinfection by-products to define best practices for their mitigation; •
using  its  research  findings  to  communicate  information  to  its  customers  regarding  potential  actions  to  limit  occurrences  of  Legionella  in  theirbuildings; in this
 regard, the Centers for Disease Control statistics indicate that water-associated disease from Legionella is on the rise, with exposuretypically associated wi

Overview
The
 Company’s  people  are  a  critical  part  of  its  business,  and  the  Company’s  investment  in  its  people  begins  with  recruitment  of  diverse  talent.  TheCompany
 believes that representing the communities in which it serves plays a key role in its ability to serve its customers and improves its talent. The Companypromotes
 an inclusive culture where its employees are given the opportunity to develop to their fullest potential and understand that they directly contribute to theCompany’s
 ability to operate, grow and serve its customers. The Company believes that investing in the health, well-being and safety of its employees is a keycomponent
 of its people and culture goals, and that these investments in its people allow employees to generate great ideas, provide quality customer service andmake a difference 
in the lives of the Company’s customers.Employee Safety
A
 longstanding value and strategy of the Company is safety. In this regard, the Company continues to focus on the safety of its employees and contractorsso that
 they may return home from work in the same, or better, condition than when they arrived. At work, safety includes both physical and emotional well-being.The
 Company assesses occupational health and safety to measure performance across the entire organization, with the ultimate goal of achieving zero injuries orsafety incidents.
To
 uphold  this  commitment,  the  Company’s  employees  completed  over  100,000  hours  of  employee  safety  training  during  2020.  Additionally,  throughfrequent
 labor-management  meetings,  the  Company  encourages  open  exchanges  to  explore  new  ways  to  further  enhance  safety  on  the  job.  All  employees  areempowered
 to support safety by taking the time they need to complete a task safely and to use “Stop Work Authority” — the power to stop working immediatelywhenever
 they believe a task is unsafe — to address the hazard or issue with management. This authority is stated on the back of every employee’s identificationbadge.
For
 2020, while the number of injuries for purposes of the Company’s Days Away Restricted or Transferred (“DART“) rate increased by 5% compared to2019, the Company had its lowest ORIR injury rate in
 its recorded history, achieving a 16% reduction compared to 2019. In 2020, the Company also experienced a2.6%
 decrease in labor hours compared to 2019. For 2020, the Company’s ORIR was 0.99 (63 injuries) and its DART rate was 0.63 (40 injuries), compared to aDART rate of 0.57 in 2019.

Table of  ContentsThe
 Company  maintains  active  memberships  with  groups  such  as  American  Corporate  Partners  (ACP),  CEO  Action  for  Diversity  and  Inclusion,Disability:IN,
 Paradigm for Parity, and Out and Equal, to further enhance its ability to recruit and retain diverse employees. Among this year’s recognitions, theCompany was
 named a 2020 Noteworthy Company by DiversityInc, a leading U.S. ranker of companies by diversity, equity and inclusion. The Company was alsoa
 top scorer on the 2020 Disability Equality Index and was recognized by U.S. Veterans Magazine as a veteran-friendly company and as an organization with aveteran-friendly suppl
ier diversity program.In
 keeping  with  the  Company’s  values,  the  Company  does  not  tolerate  discrimination,  harassment  or  retaliation  by  or  toward  any  employee,  vendor,customer
 or other person in its workplace. All employees are required to complete anti-harassment, workplace respect and dignity, unconscious bias and inclusionand
 diversity training. In addition, annual Code of Ethics training is provided to all employees, which includes education on using the Company’s anonymoushotline for reporting pot
ential Code of Ethics violations.To
 assist  these  efforts,  the  Company  has  established  an  Inclusion  and  Diversity  Advisory  Council,  which  oversees  the  formation  of  employee  businessresource
 groups  to  support  the  Company’s  inclusion  and  diversity  efforts.  In  2019,  the  Company’s  Inclusion  and  Diversity  Advisory  Council  launched  theInclusion
 and Diversity Champions Network, where employees serve as liaisons with other local workforces. Furthermore, in October 2020, the Company namedits first Chief Inclusion Of
ficer, as well as its first Director, Inclusion and Diversity, reflecting the Company’s views on the importance of inclusion and diversity.Talent Development
The
 Company provides learning opportunities and work experiences to equip its employees with the tools, skills, and competencies they need to operatesafely
 and effectively and to grow professionally. To this end, the Company has established a Talent Management Center of Expertise to help develop and deployprograms
 that  are  designed  to  attract,  motivate,  develop  and  retain  talented  employees,  and  foster  a  learning  culture.  The  Company  requires  every  employee,including
 its union-represented employees, to complete a minimum of 20 hours of training each year. All active, full-time employees hired before October 1, 2020met
 this requirement for 2020, with over 350,000 hours of total training completed during the year, including approximately 100,000 hours of safety training. Inaddition
 to required role-based training, managers assist employees to identify professional development opportunities to help them reach their full potential andgrow
 their  careers.  Additionally,  in  2020,  approximately  59%  of  the  Company’s  internal  employee  transfers  and  promotions  were  diverse  (defined  as female, minority, disability, m
ilitary, military spouse, and LGBTQ+ status, based on employee self-identification), which  reflects the Company’s commitment to employeedevelopment and caree
r growth as well as the Company’s focus on inclusion and reflecting the communities in which the Company operates.Developing
 talent and ensuring a pipeline to executive leadership is a critical priority for the Company. During 2020, the Company engaged in successionplanning
 activities  for  the  Company’s  critical  positions  and  executive  leaders.  These  succession  plans  seek  to  promote  diversity,  as  well  as  retention  anddevelopment, to assist in prov
iding continued leadership for the growth and future of the Company’s business.Workforce Data
As
 of  December  31,  2020,  the  Company  had  approximately  7,000  employees.  For  2020,  the  Company’s  employee  turnover  rate,  which  the  Companydefines
 as the ratio of the number of separated employees during the year to all active employees as of December 31, 2020, was 7.4%, down from 9.7% in 2019.American
 Water  continues  to  seek  to  reduce  employee  turnover  by  establishing  an  inclusive  culture,  developing  its  employees,  and  providing  competitivecompensation and benefits.
As

Table of  ContentsITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS
We
 operate  in  a  market  and  regulatory  environment  that  involves  significant  risks,  many  of  which  are  beyond  our  control.  In  addition  to  the  otherinformation
 included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, the following material factors should be considered in evaluating our business and futureprospects.
 Any of the following risks, either alone or taken together, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations,cash flows and liquidity.
Risks Related to Our Industry and Business Operations
Our
 utility  operations  are  subject  to  extensive  regulation  by  state  PUCs  and  other  regulatory  agencies,  which  significantly  affects  our  business,  financialcondition,
 results of operations and cash flows. Our utility operations also may be subject to fines, penalties and other sanctions for an inability to meet theseregulatory requirements.
Our
 Regulated Businesses provide water and wastewater services to our customers through subsidiaries that are subject to regulation by state PUCs. Thisregulation
 affects the rates we charge our customers and has a significant impact on our business and operations. Generally, the state PUCs authorize us to chargerates
 that  they  determine  are  sufficient  to  recover  our  prudently  incurred  operating  expenses,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  operating  and  maintenance  costs,depreciation, financ
ing costs and taxes, and provide us with the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on invested capital.Our
 ability to successfully implement our business plan and strategy depends on the rates authorized by the various state PUCs. We periodically file rateincrease
 applications with state PUCs. The ensuing administrative process may be lengthy and costly. Our rate increase requests may or may not be approved, ormay be partially approv
ed, and any approval may not occur in a timely manner. Moreover, a PUC may not approve a rate request to an extent that is sufficient to:•
cover our expenses, including pur chased water and costs of chemicals, fuel and other commodities used in our operations;•
enable us to recover our inv estment; and•
provide us with an opportunity to ea rn an appropriate rate of return on our investment.Approval
 of the PUCs is also required in connection with other aspects of our utilities’ operations. Some state PUCs are empowered to impose financialpenalties,
 fines and other sanctions for non-compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Our utilities are also required to have numerous permits, approvalsand
 certificates from the PUCs that regulate their businesses and authorize acquisitions, dispositions, debt and/or equity financing, and, in certain cases, affiliatedtransactions.
 Although we believe that each utility subsidiary has obtained or sought renewal of the material permits, approvals and certificates necessary for itsexisting operations, we are un
able to predict the impact that future regulatory activities may have on our business.The current COVID-19 pandemic may limit or curtail significantly or entirely the ability of PU
Cs to approve or authorize applications and other requests wemay
 make with respect to our Regulated Businesses, including without limitation any or all types of approvals described above, as PUCs and their staffs seek toreduce,
 delay or streamline proceedings and other activities. PUCs and other governmental authorities have taken, and may continue to take, emergency or otheractions
 in light of the COVID-19 pandemic that may impact us, including prohibiting the termination of service for non-payment during the current COVID-19pandemic
 and  extending  or  delaying  procedural  schedules  in  our  regulatory  proceedings.  At  this  time,  we  are  unable  to  predict  the  range  of  impacts  that  theCOVID-19 pandemic and other relat
ed events may have on our ability to obtain these approvals as needed or requested by the Regulated Businesses in the ordinarycourse or at all, or the n
ature of any further emergency or other action that may be taken by the PUCs or other governmental authorities.In
 any of these cases, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected. Even if the rates approvedare
 sufficient, we face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on our invested capital to the extent permitted by state PUCs. This could occur if certainconditions
 exist, including, but not limited to, water usage less than the level anticipated in establishing rates, customers increase their conservation efforts, or weexperience negative 
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, or if our investments or expenses prove to be higher than the levels estimated in establishing rates.Our
 operations and the quality of water we supply are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent environmental, water quality and health and safety lawsand
 regulations,  including  with  respect  to  contaminants  of  emerging  concern,  compliance  with  which  could  impact  both  our  operating  costs  and  capitalexpenditures, and violations of which could subject us to substantial 
liabilities and costs, as well as damage to our reputation.Our
 regulated water and wastewater operations and the operations of our Market-Based Businesses are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws andregulations.
 These  requirements  include,  among  others,  CERCLA,  the  Clean  Water  Act,  the  Safe  Drinking  Water  Act,  the  LCR,  and  other  federal  and  staterequirements.
 For example, state PUCs and environmental regulators set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver. If we deliverwater or wastewater servi
ces to our customers25

Table of  Contentsthat
 do  not  comply  with  regulatory  standards,  or  otherwise  violate  environmental  laws,  regulations  or  permits,  or  other  health  and  safety  and  water  qualityregulations,
 we could incur substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions or costs, as well as damage to our reputation. In the most serious cases, regulators couldreduce
 requested rate increases or force us to discontinue operations and sell our operating assets to another utility or to a municipality. Given the nature of ourbusiness which,
 in part, involves providing water service for human consumption, any potential non-compliance with, or violation of, environmental, water qualityand
 health and safety laws or regulations would likely pose a more significant risk to us than to a company not similarly involved in the water and wastewaterindustry.
In
 addition,  CERCLA authorizes  the  EPA to  issue orders  and  bring  enforcement  actions  to compel  responsible  parties  to  investigate  and  take  remedialactions
 with respect to actual or threatened releases of hazardous substances, and can impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault, on responsibleparties for the costs th
ereof. We are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations.We
 incur  substantial  operating  and  capital  costs  on  an  ongoing  basis  to  comply  with  environmental,  water  quality  and  health  and  safety  laws  andregulations.
 These laws and regulations and their enforcement, have become more stringent over time, and new or stricter requirements could increase our costs.Although
 we may seek to recover ongoing compliance costs in our Regulated Businesses through customer rates, there can be no guarantee that the various statePUCs or
 similar regulatory bodies that govern our Regulated Businesses would approve rate increases that would enable us to recover such costs or that such costswill not materially 
and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.We
 may  also  incur  liabilities  if,  under  environmental  laws  and  regulations,  we  are  required  to  investigate  and  clean  up  environmental  contamination,including
 potential releases of hazardous chemicals, such as chlorine, which we use to treat water, or at off-site locations where we have disposed of waste orcaused
 an adverse environmental impact. The discovery of previously unknown conditions, or the imposition of cleanup obligations in the future, could result insignificant
 costs and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Such remediation costs may not be covered byinsurance and may make it
 difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future.Attention
 is being given to contaminants of emerging concern, including, without limitation, chemicals and other substances that currently do not have anyregulatory
 standard in drinking water or have been recently created or discovered (including by means of scientific achievements in the analysis and detection oftrace
 amounts of substances). Examples of sources of contaminants include, but are not limited to, newly created chemical compounds (including, for example,manufactured
 nanomaterials); human and veterinary products; perfluorinated and polyfluorinated compounds; bacteria, microbes, viruses (including the currentnovel
 coronavirus), amoebae and other pathogens; and residual by-products of disinfection. We rely upon governmental agencies to set appropriate regulatorystandards
 to protect the public from these and other contaminants, and our role is to provide service that meets these standards, if any. In some of our states, PUCsmay
 disapprove of cost recovery, in whole or in part, for implementation of treatment infrastructure for a contaminant in the absence of a regulatory standard.Furthermore,
 given  the  rapid  pace  at  which  these  contaminants  are  being  created  and/or  discovered,  we  may  not  be  able  to  detect  and/or  mitigate  all  suchsubstances in
 our drinking water system or supplies, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and reputation. Inaddition,
 we believe these contaminants may form the basis for additional or increased federal or state regulatory initiatives and requirements in the future, whichcould significantly inc
rease the cost of our operations.Limitations on availability of water supplies or restrictions on our use of
 water supplies as a result of government regulation or action may adversely affect ouraccess to sources of water, our ability to suppl
y water to customers or the demand for our water services.Our ability to meet the
 existing and future demand of our customers depends on the availability of an adequate supply of water. As a general rule, sources ofpublic
 water supply, including rivers, lakes, streams, groundwater aquifers and recycled water sources, are held in the public trust and are not generally owned byprivate
 interests.  As a result,  we typically  do not own the water  that  we use in our operations,  and the availability  of our water  supply is established  throughallocation
 rights  (determined  by  legislation  or  court  decisions)  and  passing-flow  requirements  set  by  governmental  entities  or  by  entering  into  water  purchaseagreements.
 These requirements, which can change from time to time, and vary by state or region, may adversely impact our water supply. Supply issues, such asdrought,
 overuse  of  sources  of  water,  the  protection  of  threatened  species  or  habitats,  contamination  or  other  factors  may  limit  the  availability  of  ground  andsurface
 water. If we are unable to secure available or alternative sources of water, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could beadversely affected.
For example,
 in our Monterey County, California operations, we are seeking to augment our sources of water supply, principally to comply with an October2009
 cease and desist order (the “2009 Order”), as amended by a July 2016 order (the “2016 Order”), of the SWRCB that requires our California subsidiary tosignificantly
 decrease its diversions from the Carmel River in accordance with a reduction schedule that terminates on December 31, 2021 (the “2021 Deadline”).See
 Item 3—Legal Proceedings—Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions, which includes additional information regarding this matter. Weare

Table of  Contentsalso
 required  to  augment  our  Monterey  County  sources  of  water  supply  to  comply  with  the  requirements  of  the  Endangered  Species  Act.  We  cannot  predictwhether
 our California subsidiary will be able to secure alternative sources of water, or if it will be able to meet the 2021 Deadline or the diversion reduction andother remaining
 requirements under the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order. Failure by our California subsidiary to comply with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order inwhole
 or in part, or the 2021 Deadline, may result in material additional costs or obligations, including fines and penalties, which could have a material adverseeffect upon us and our business, resu
lts of operations and cash flows.Service
 disruptions caused by severe weather conditions, climate variability patterns or natural or other disasters may disrupt our operations or reduce thedemand for our water services, which could adversely a
ffect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.Service
 interruptions due to severe weather, climate variability patterns and natural or other events are possible across all our businesses. These include,among
 other things, storms, freezing conditions, high wind conditions, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, landslides, drought, wildfires, coastal and intercoastalfloods or high water conditions, in
cluding those in or near designated flood plains, pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic) and epidemics, severe electricalstorms,
 sinkholes and solar flares. Weather and other natural events such as these may affect the condition or operability of our facilities, limiting or preventing usfrom
 delivering water or wastewater services to our customers, or requiring us to make substantial capital expenditures to repair any damage. Tariffs in place orcost recovery proceedings wi
th respect to our Regulated Businesses may not provide reimbursement to us, in whole or in part, for any of these impacts.Government
 restrictions on water use may also result in decreased use of water services, even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers,which
 may  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows.  Seasonal  drought  conditions  that  may  impact  our  water  services  arepossible
 across all of our service areas. Governmental restrictions imposed in response to a drought may apply to all systems within a region independent of thesupply
 adequacy of any individual system. Responses may range from voluntary to mandatory water use restrictions, rationing restrictions, water conservationregulations,
 and requirements to minimize water system leaks. While expenses incurred in implementing water conservation and rationing plans may generally berecoverable
 provided  the relevant  PUC determines  they were  reasonable  and  prudent,  we  cannot  assure  that  any  such expenses  incurred  will,  in fact,  be fullyrecovered.
 Moreover, reductions in water consumption, including those resulting from installation of equipment or changed consumer behavior, may persist evenafter
 drought restrictions are repealed and the drought has ended, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cashflows.
Climate
 variability may cause increased volatility in weather and may impact water usage and related revenue or require additional expenditures, all of whichmay not be fully recoverable 
in rates or otherwise.The
 issue of climate variability is receiving increasing attention nationally and worldwide. Some scientific experts are predicting a worsening of weathervolatility in the
 future associated with climate variability. Many climate variability predictions, if true, present several potential challenges to water and wastewaterutilities, including us, such 
as:•
increased frequency and du ration of droughts;•
increased precipit ation and flooding;•
increased frequency and s everity of storms and other weather events;•
challenges associated wit h changes in temperature or increases in ocean levels;•
potential degradation o f water quality;•
decreases in availab le water supply and changes in water usage patterns;•
increases in disruptions in s ervice;•
increased costs to repair damaged facilities; or•
increased  costs to reduce risks associated with the increasing frequency of natural events, including to improve the resiliency and reliability of ourwater and wastewater tre
atment and conveyance facilities and systems.Because
 of the uncertainty of weather volatility related to climate variability, we cannot predict its potential impact on our business, financial condition,results
 of  operations,  cash  flows  and  liquidity.  Furthermore,  laws  and  regulations  have  been  enacted  that  seek  to  reduce  or  limit  GHG  emissions  and  requireadditional
 reporting  and  monitoring,  and  these  regulations  may  become  more  pervasive  or  stringent  in  light  of  changing  governmental  agendas  and  priorities,although
 the exact nature and timing of these changes is uncertain. Although some or all potential expenditures and costs associated with the impact of climatevariability
 and  related  laws  and  regulations  on  our  Regulated  Businesses  could  be  recovered  through  rates,  infrastructure  replacement  surcharges  or  otherregulatory
 mechanisms, there can be no assurance that state PUCs would authorize rate increases to enable us to recover such expenditures and costs, in whole orin part.
27

Table of  ContentsThe
 current regulatory rate setting process may result in a significant delay, also known as “regulatory lag,” from the time that we invest in infrastructureimprovements,
 incur increased operating expenses or experience declining water usage, to the time at which we can seek to address these events in rate caseapplications; our inability to mi
tigate or minimize regulatory lag could adversely affect our business.There
 is typically a delay, known as “regulatory lag,” between the time one of our regulated subsidiaries makes a capital investment or incurs an operatingexpense
 increase and the time when those costs are reflected in rates. In addition, billings permitted by state PUCs typically are, to a considerable extent, based onthe
 volume of water usage in addition to a minimum base rate. Thus, we may experience regulatory lag between the time our revenues are affected by decliningusage
 and the time we are able to adjust the rate per gallon of usage to address declining usage. Our inability to mitigate or reduce regulatory lag could have anadverse effect on our f
inancial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.We
 endeavor to mitigate or reduce regulatory lag by pursuing constructive regulatory practices. For example, three of our states have approved revenuestability
 mechanisms  that  adjust  rates  periodically  to  ensure  that  a  utility’s  revenue  will  be  sufficient  to  cover  its  costs  regardless  of  sales  volume,  includingrecognition
 of declining sales resulting from reduced consumption, while providing an incentive for customers to use water more efficiently. In addition, 11 of ourstate
 PUCs permit rates to be adjusted outside of the general rate case application process through surcharges that address certain capital investments, such asreplacement
 of aging infrastructure. These surcharges are adjusted periodically based on factors such as project completion or future budgeted expenditures, andspecific
 surcharges are eliminated once the related capital investment is incorporated in new PUC approved rates. Furthermore, in setting rates, ten of our statePUCs
 allow us to use future test years, which extend beyond the date a rate request is filed to allow for current or projected revenues, expenses and investments tobe reflected in rates on a more timely basis. Other examples of such regulatory practices include expense mechani
sms that allow us to increase rates for certain costincreases
 that  are  beyond  our  control,  such  as  purchased  water  costs,  property  or  other  taxes,  or  power,  conservation,  chemical  or  other  expenditures.  Thesemechanisms
 enable us to adjust rates in less time after costs have been incurred than would be the case under a general rate case application process without themechanisms.
While these mechanisms have mitigated or reduced regulatory lag in several of our regulated states, we continue to seek expansi
on of regulatory practices tomitigate or reduce regulatory lag in those jurisdictions that have not approved them. Furtherm
ore, PUCs may fail to adopt new surcharges and existing mechanismsmay
 not  continue  in  their  current  form,  or  at  all,  or  we  may  be  unable  or  become  ineligible  to  continue  to  utilize  certain  of  these  mechanisms  in  the  future.Although
 we intend to continue our efforts to expand state PUC approval of surcharges to address issues of regulatory lag, our efforts may not be successful, oreven
 if  successful  they  may  not  completely  address  our  regulatory  lag,  in  which  case  our  business,  financial  condition,  results  of  operations,  cash  flows  andliquidity may be materially an
d adversely affected.Changes in laws and regulations can significantly and materially af
fect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.New
 legislation, regulations, government policies or court decisions, including, without limitation with respect to federal and state income and other taxlaws,
 can  materially  affect  our  operations,  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows.  Certain  of  the  individuals  who  serve  as  regulators  are  elected  or  politicalappointees.
 Therefore, elections which result in a change of political administration or new appointments may also result in changes of certain of the individualswho
 serve as regulators and the policies of the regulatory agencies that they serve. New laws or regulations, new interpretations of existing laws or regulations,changes in
 agency policy, including those made in response to shifts in public opinion, or conditions imposed during the regulatory hearing process could have thefollowing consequences, among othe
rs:•
making it more diffi cult for us to increase our rates and, as a consequence, to recover our costs or earn our expected rates of return;•
changing the determina tion of the costs, or the amount of costs, that would be considered recoverable in rate cases and other regulatory proceedings;•
restricting  our  ability  to  terminate  our  services  to  customers  who  owe  us  money  for  services  previously  provided  or  limiting  our  bill  collectionefforts;
•
requiring us to provide water o r wastewater services at reduced rates to certain customers;•
limiting or restricting our ability to acquire water or wastewater systems, purchase or dis pose of assets, or issue long-term debt or equity, or making itless cost-effectiv
e for us to do so;•
negatively impacting,  among other things: (i) tax rates or positions or the deductibility of expenses under federal or state tax laws, (ii) the availabilityor
 amount of, or our ability to comply with the terms and conditions of, tax credits or tax abatement benefit, (iii) the amount of taxes owed, (iv) thetiming of tax effec
ts on rates or (v) the ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards;•
changing regulations that affect the benefits we expected to receive when we began offering services in a particular area;28

increasing  the associated costs of, or difficulty complying with, environmental, health, safety, consumer privacy, water quality, and water qualityaccountability laws and r
egulations to which our operations are subject;•
changing or placing addition al limitations on change in control requirements relating to any concentration of ownership of our common stock;•
making  it easier for governmental entities to convert our assets to public ownership via condemnation, eminent domain or other similar process, orfor governmental agenc
ies or private plaintiffs to assess liability against us for damages under these or similar processes;•
placing  limitations, prohibitions or other requirements with respect to the sharing of information and participation in transactions by or between aregulated subsidiary and us or ou
r other affiliates, including Service Company and any of our other subsidiaries;•
restricting or prohibiting  our extraction of water from rivers, streams, reservoirs or aquifers; and•
revoking or altering the terms of a CPCN issued to us by a state PUC or other governmental authority.An
 example  of  an  area  in  which  laws  and  regulations  are  changing  and  increasing  rapidly  is  with  respect  to  data  and  consumer  privacy,  security  andprotection.
 We are becoming subject to an increasing number of data and consumer privacy, security and protection laws and regulations administered by variousfederal, state and local
 governments, including, for example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018. Federal and state governments have also adopted or areproposing
 other limitations on, or requirements regarding, the collection, distribution, use, security and storage of personally identifiable information. In addition,the
 Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards on the collection, use anddissemination
 of data. Moreover, we expect that current laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security inthe
 United States will continue to evolve and increase, and we cannot determine the impact that compliance with such future laws, regulations or standards willhave
 on us or on our business. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with current or future federal, state, or local data or consumer privacy or securitylaws,
 regulations, policies, guidance, industry standards, or legal obligations, or any incident resulting in unauthorized access to, or acquisition, release, or transferof
 personally identifiable information or other data relating to our customers, employees and others, may result in private or governmental enforcement actions,litigation,
 fines and penalties, or adverse perception or publicity about us and our businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation andbusiness
 and could result in us incurring substantial costs. These events could also result in significant diversions of resources, distract management and divert thefocus and attention of our
 security and technical personnel from other critical activities. Any of the foregoing consequences could have a material adverse effect onour business, financial condi
tion, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.Regulatory and environmental risks associated with the co
llection, treatment and disposal of wastewater may impose significant costs and liabilities.The
 wastewater collection, treatment and disposal operations of our subsidiaries are subject to substantial regulation and involve environmental risks. Ifcollection,
 treatment or disposal systems fail, overflow, or do not operate properly, untreated or inadequately treated wastewater or other contaminants could spillonto
 nearby properties or into nearby streams and rivers, causing damage to persons or property, injury to aquatic life and economic damages. This risk is mostacute
 during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding, which are the main causes of sewer overflow and system failure. Liabilities resulting from such damagecould
 adversely and materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Certain of our wastewater systems have commercialand
 industrial  customers  that  are  subject  to  specific  limitations  on  the  type,  character  and  strength  of  the  wastewater  they  are  permitted  to  discharge  into  oursystems.
 The failure by these commercial and industrial customers to comply with their respective discharge requirements could, in turn, negatively impact ouroperations,
 damage our facilities or cause us to exceed applicable discharge limitations and requirements. Liabilities resulting from such exceedance events couldadversely and materi
ally affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.A
 loss of one or more large industrial or commercial customers could have a material adverse impact upon the results of operations of one or more of ourRegulated Businesses.
Adverse
 economic conditions, the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors may cause our customers, particularly industrial and large commercial customers,to
 curtail operations. A curtailment of operations by such a customer typically results in reduced water usage by that customer. For example, during 2020, theCompany experienced a decrease in
 net customer demand related mainly to industrial and commercial customers, which the Company believes to be attributable tothe
 impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. In more severe circumstances, the decline in usage could be permanent. Any decrease in demand resulting from difficulteconomic
 conditions or the current COVID-19 pandemic affecting these customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Tariffsin place with respect to ou
r Regulated Businesses may not reimburse us, in whole or in part, for any of these impacts.29

Table of  ContentsOur
 Regulated  Businesses  require  significant  capital  expenditures  and  may  suffer  if  we  fail  to  secure  appropriate  funding  to  make  investments,  or  if  weexperience delays in comple
ting major capital expenditure projects.The
 water and wastewater utility business is capital intensive. We invest significant amounts of capital to add, replace and maintain property, plant andequipment,
 and to improve aging infrastructure. In 2020, we invested $1.8 billion in net Company-funded capital improvements. The level of capital expendituresnecessary
 to maintain the integrity  of our systems will continue into the future and may increase. We expect to fund capital improvement projects  using cashgenerated from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit
 facility and commercial paper programs and issuances of long-term debt and equity. We may notbe
 able to access our revolving credit facility or the commercial paper, long-term debt and equity capital markets, when necessary or desirable to fund capitalimprovements
 on  favorable  terms  or  at  all.  If  we  are  not  able  to  obtain  sufficient  financing,  we  may  be  unable  to  maintain  our  existing  property,  plant  andequipment,
 fund  our  capital  investment  strategies,  meet  our  growth  targets  and  expand  our  rate  base  to  enable  us  to  earn  satisfactory  future  returns  on  ourinvestments.
 Even with adequate financial resources to make required capital expenditures, we face the additional risk that we will not complete our major capitalprojects
 on time, as a result of construction delays, permitting delays, labor shortages or other disruptions, environmental restrictions, or other obstacles. Each ofthese outcomes could advers
ely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Aging infrastructure may lead to service d
isruptions, property damage and increased capital expenditures and O&M costs, all of which could negatively impactour financial results.
We
 have  risks  associated  with  aging  infrastructure,  including  water  and  sewer  mains,  pumping  stations  and  water  and  wastewater  treatment  facilities.Additionally,
 we  may  have  limited  information  regarding  buried  and  newly  acquired  assets,  which  could  challenge  our  ability  to  conduct  efficient  assetmanagement
 and  maintenance  practices.  Assets  that  have  aged  beyond  their  expected  useful  lives  may  experience  a  higher  rate  of  failure.  Failure  of  aginginfrastructure
 could result in increased capital expenditures and O&M costs, and negatively impact our future O&M efficiency ratio. In addition, failure of aginginfrastructure may
 result in property damage, and in safety, environmental and public health impacts. To the extent that any increased costs or expenditures are notfully recovered in ra
tes, our results of operations, liquidity and cash flows could be negatively impacted.Seasonality could adversely affe
ct the volume of water sold and our revenues.The
 volume of water we sell during the warmer months, typically in the summer, is generally greater than during other months, due primarily to increasedwater usage for irriga
tion systems, swimming pools, cooling systems and other applications. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer months,the
 volume of water sold tends to vary with temperature, rainfall levels and rainfall frequency. In the event that temperatures during the typically warmer monthsare cooler than norma
l, or if there is more rainfall than normal, the amount of water we sell may decrease and adversely affect our revenues.Three
 of our jurisdictions, California, Illinois and New York, have adopted revenue stability mechanisms that permit us to recover the revenues authorizedin
 a general rate case, regardless of sales volume. Revenue stability mechanisms are designed to recognize declining sales resulting from reduced consumption,while
 providing an incentive for customers to use water more efficiently. In those jurisdictions that have not adopted a revenue stability mechanism, our operatingresults could continue to be 
affected by seasonality.Contamination
 of  water  supplies  or  our  water  service  provided  to  our  customers  could  result  in  service  limitations  and  interruptions  and  exposure  tosubstances
 not typically found in potable water supplies, and could subject us and our subsidiaries to reductions in usage and other responsive obligations,government enforcement actions, damage 
to our reputation and private litigation.The
 water  supplies  that  flow  into  our  treatment  plants  or  are  delivered  through  our  distribution  system,  or  the  water  service  that  is  provided  to  ourcustomers, may be subject 
to contamination, including, among other items, contamination from naturally-occurring compounds, chemicals in groundwater systems,pollution
 resulting  from  man-made  sources  (such  as  perchlorate,  methyl  tertiary  butyl  ether,  1,4-dioxane,  lead  and  other  materials,  or  chemical  spills  or  otherincidents that
 result in contaminants entering the water source), and possible terrorist attacks or other similar incidents. In addition, new categories of contaminantscontinue
 to emerge in the water industry. If one of our water supplies or the water service provided to our customers is contaminated, depending on the nature ofthe
 contamination, we may have to take responsive actions that could include, among other things (1) limiting use of the water supply under a “Do Not Use”protective order that enables continuation of basic sanitation and essential fire protecti
on, or (2) interrupting the use of that water supply. If service is disrupted, ourfinancial condition, results of operations, cash flo
ws, liquidity and reputation may be adversely affected. In addition, we may incur significant costs in order to treatthe
 contaminated source through the expansion of our current treatment facilities or the development of new sources of supply or new treatment methods. We maybe
 unable to recover costs associated with treating or decontaminating water supplies through insurance, customer rates, tariffs or contract terms, and any recoveryof
 these costs that we are able to obtain through regulatory proceedings or otherwise may not occur in a timely manner. Moreover, we could be subject to claimsfor
 damages arising from government enforcement actions or toxic tort or other lawsuits arising out of an interruption of service or human exposure to hazardoussubstances
 in our drinking water and water supplies. See Item 3—Legal Proceedings for information on certain pending lawsuits related to interruptions of waterservice.
30

Table of  ContentsSince
 we are engaged in the business of providing water service to our customers, contamination of the water supply, or the water service provided to ourcustomers,
 could result in substantial injury or damage to our customers, employees or others and we could be exposed to substantial claims and litigation. Suchclaims
 could relate to, among other things, personal injury, loss of life, business interruption, property damage, pollution, and environmental damage and may bebrought by
 our customers or third parties. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur. Wemay not be protected from these
 claims or negative impacts of these claims in whole or in part by tariffs or other contract terms. Negative impacts to our reputationmay
 occur even if we are not liable for any contamination or other environmental damage or the consequences arising out of human exposure to contamination orhazardous
 substances in the water or water supplies. In addition, insurance coverage may not cover all or a portion of these losses, and are subject to deductiblesand
 other limitations. Pending or future claims against us could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cashflows.
We
 are subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks, which make us vulnerable to negative customer perception and could lead to increased regulatoryoversight or sanctions.
Our
 business and operations  have a large  direct  and indirect  customer  base and, as a result,  we are  exposed to public  criticism  regarding,  among otherthings,
 the reliability of water service, wastewater and related or ancillary services, the quality of water provided, and the amount, timeliness, accuracy and formatof
 bills  that  are  provided  for  such  services.  For  example,  our  New  York  subsidiary  experienced  increased  customer  and  regulatory  scrutiny  related  to  aninvestigation by the
 New York State Public Service Commission (the “NYSPSC”) of the unintentional provision by our New York subsidiary of incorrect data to ataxing
 authority  and  the  failure  of  a  few  employees  of  that  subsidiary  to  properly  disclose  these  issues  in  a  rate  case.  A  settlement  of  this  investigation  wasapproved
 by the Supreme Court of the State of New York in September 2018. Adverse publicity and negative consumer sentiment arising out of these and otherincidents
 may render legislatures and other governing bodies, state PUCs and other regulatory authorities, and government officials less likely to view us in afavorable
 light,  and  may  cause  us  to  be  susceptible  to  less  favorable  legislative,  regulatory  and  economic  outcomes,  as  well  as  increased  regulatory  or  otheroversight
 and more stringent regulatory or economic requirements. Unfavorable regulatory and economic outcomes may include the enactment of more stringentlaws
 and regulations governing our operations and less favorable economic terms in our agreements related to our Market-Based Businesses, as well as fines,penalties or other sanc
tions or requirements. The imposition of any of the foregoing could have a material negative impact on us and our financial condition, resultsof operations and cash flows.
The
 failure of, or the requirement to repair, upgrade or dismantle, any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cashflows and liquidity.
The properties
 of our Regulated Businesses segment include 75 dams, the majority of which are earthen dams. The failure of any of these dams could resultin
 personal injury and property damage, including without limitation downstream property damage, for which we may be liable. The failure of a dam would alsoadversely
 affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Any
 losses or liabilities incurred due to a failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates, and such losses maymake it difficult for us to
 secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future.We
 also are required from time to time to decommission, repair or upgrade the dams that we own. The cost of such repairs or upgrades can be and has beenmaterial.
 The federal and state agencies that regulate our operations may adopt rules and regulations requiring us to dismantle our dams, which also could entailmaterial
 costs. Although in most cases the PUC has permitted recovery of expenses and capital investment related to dam rehabilitation, we might not be able torecover
 costs of repairs, upgrades or dismantling through rates in the future. The inability to recover these costs or delayed recovery of the costs as a result ofregulatory lag can af
fect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.Any
 failure of our network of water and wastewater pipes and water reservoirs could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition andreputation.
Our
 operating subsidiaries distribute water and collect wastewater through an extensive network of pipes and storage systems located across the UnitedStates.
 A  failure  of  major  pipes  or  reservoirs  could  result  in  injuries,  property  and  other  damage  for  which  we  may  be  liable.  The  failure  of  major  pipes  andreservoirs
 may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our network in order to conduct repairs. Such failures and shutdowns may limit ourability
 to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water and wastewater delivery requirements prescribed by government regulators,including
 state PUCs with jurisdiction over our operations, and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and reputation.Any
 business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates, and such losses may make it difficult for us tosecure
 insurance at acceptable rates in the future. Moreover, to the extent such business interruptions or other losses are not covered by insurance, they may not berecovered through rate 
adjustments.31

Table of  ContentsAn
 important  part  of  our  growth  strategy  is  the  acquisition  of  water  and  wastewater  systems,  which  involves  risks,  including  competition  for  acquisitionopportunities from other regulated utili
ties, governmental entities and other buyers, which may hinder or limit our ability to grow our business.An important
 element of our growth strategy is the acquisition and optimization of water and wastewater systems in order to broaden our current, and moveinto
 new,  service  areas.  We  may  not  be  able  to  acquire  other  systems  or  businesses  if  we  cannot  identify  suitable  acquisition  opportunities  or  reach  mutuallyagreeable terms with 
acquisition candidates. Further, competition for acquisition opportunities from other regulated utilities, governmental entities and other buyersmay hinder our ability to 
expand our business.The
 negotiation  and  execution  of  potential  acquisitions  as  well  as  the  integration  of  acquired  systems  or  businesses  with  our  existing  operations  couldrequire us to incur signif
icant costs and cause diversion of our management’s time and resources. Future acquisitions by us could result in, among other things:•
incurrence  or  assumption  of  debt,  contingent  liabilities  and  environmental  liabilities  and  obligations,  including  liabilities  that  were  unknown  orundisclosed at the time o
f acquisition;•
failure to recover acquisition premiums;•
unanticipated capit al expenditures;•
failure to maintain effective internal c ontrol over financial reporting;•
the need to successfully in tegrate the acquired systems’ operations and water quality, cybersecurity and infrastructure protection measures;•
recording goodwill and other in tangible assets at values that ultimately may be subject to impairment charges;•
fluctuations in quarte rly results;•
unanticipated acquisi tion-related expenses;•
failure to reali ze anticipated benefits and synergies, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements; and•
difficulties in int egrating or assimilating personnel, benefits, services and systems.Some
 or all of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business. The systems and businesses we acquire in the future may not achieveanticipated
 revenue, return on equity or profitability, or other perceived synergies, and any difficulties we encounter in the integration process could interfere withour operations, reduce our ne
t income and profitability or adversely affect our internal control over financial reporting.We
 compete with governmental entities, other regulated utilities, and strategic and financial buyers for acquisition opportunities. If consolidation becomesmore
 prevalent in the water and wastewater industries and competition for acquisitions increases, the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase andlimit our ability to 
expand through acquisitions.Our
 Regulated  Businesses  are  subject  to  condemnation  and  other  proceedings  through  eminent  domain  or  other  similar  authorized  process,  which  couldmaterially and adversely af
fect their results of operations and financial condition.Municipalities
 and other government subdivisions have historically been involved in the provision of water and wastewater services in the United States,and
 organized efforts may arise from time to time in one or more of the service areas in which our Regulated Businesses operate to convert our assets to publicownership
 and operation through exercise of the governmental power of eminent domain, or another similar authorized process. A municipality, other governmentsubdivision
 or a citizen group may seek to acquire our assets through eminent domain or such other process, either directly or indirectly as a result of a citizenpetition.
For
 example, in November 2018, Monterey, California ballot Measure J, which was added by a citizens group, was certified as having been approved by apublic
 vote, requiring the MPWMD to conduct a study and submit a written plan concerning the feasibility of a potential purchase of the Monterey system assetswithout
 an additional public vote. The public vote led to the issuance by the MPWMD in November 2019 of a preliminary report finding, among other things, thatthe acquisition of the Monterey system assets by the MPWMD 
would be economically feasible. In November 2020, the MPWMD certified an FEIR with respect toa
 proposed acquisition and operation of this system by the MPWMD, and our California subsidiary has filed a petition in court challenging this certification. Also,five municipalities in the
 Chicago, Illinois area formed a water agency that filed an eminent domain lawsuit against our Illinois subsidiary in January 2013, seekingto
 condemn a water pipeline that serves those five municipalities. This lawsuit remains pending, and a valuation trial is scheduled for the second quarter of 2021.See Item 1—Business—Regulated Businesses—Conde
mnation and Eminent Domain, which includes additional information regarding these matters.32

Table of  ContentsFurthermore,
 the  law  in  certain  jurisdictions  in  which  our  Regulated  Businesses  operate  provides  for  eminent  domain  rights  allowing  private  propertyowners
 to file a lawsuit to seek just compensation against a public utility, if the public utility’s infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause ofdamage
 to that property. In these actions, the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently. In California, lawsuits have been filed inconnection
 with large-scale natural events such as wildfires. Some of these lawsuits have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities triggered thenatural event that resulted in damage to the property. In some cases, the P
UC has disallowed recovery in rates of losses incurred by these utilities as a result of suchlawsuits.
Contesting
 an exercise of condemnation, eminent domain or other similar process, or responding to a citizen petition, may result in costly legal proceedingsand
 may divert the attention of management. Moreover, our efforts to resist the condemnation, eminent domain or other process may not be successful, which mayrequire
 us to sell the operations at issue in a condemnation proceeding or to pay a private property owner compensation for the property damage suffered. If amunicipality
 or  other  government  subdivision  succeeds  in  acquiring  the  assets  of  one  or  more  of  our  Regulated  Businesses  through  eminent  domain  or  otherprocess,
 there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for the business, that we will not be able to keep the compensation, or that we will not beable
 to divest the business without incurring significant charges. Any of these outcomes may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,financial condition, c
ash flows and liquidity.We may be subject to physical and cyb
er attacks.As
 operators  of  critical  infrastructure,  we  may  face  a  heightened  risk  of  physical  and  cyber  attacks  from  internal  or  external  sources.  Our  water  andwastewater
 systems may be vulnerable to disability or failures as a result of physical or cyber attacks, acts of war or terrorism, vandalism or other causes. Ouroperational and technology sys
tems throughout our businesses may be vulnerable to unauthorized external or internal access, due to hacking, viruses, acts of war orterrorism,
 and  other  causes.  Unauthorized  access  to  confidential  information  located  or  stored  on  these  systems  could  negatively  and  materially  impact  ourcustomers,
 employees, suppliers and other third parties. Further, third parties, including vendors, suppliers and contractors, who perform certain services for us oradminister
 and maintain our sensitive information, could also be targets of cyber attacks and unauthorized access. While we have instituted safeguards to protectour
 operational and technology systems, those safeguards may not always be effective due to the evolving nature of cyber attacks and cyber vulnerabilities. Wecannot guarantee that su
ch protections will be completely successful in the event of a cyber attack.If,
 despite our security measures, a significant physical attack or cyber breach occurred, our operations could be disrupted, property damaged, and customerand other confidential
 information lost or stolen; we could experience substantial loss of revenues, response costs and other financial loss; we could suffer a loss ofmanagement
 time,  attention  and  resources  from  our  regular  business  operations;  and  we  may  be  subject  to  increased  regulation,  litigation  and  damage  to  ourreputation,
 any of which could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows. Experiencing a cyber security incident could alsocause
 us to be non-compliant with applicable laws and regulations or contracts that require us to securely maintain confidential data, causing us to incur costsrelated
 to legal claims or proceedings and regulatory fines or penalties. These types of events, either impacting our facilities or the industry in general, could alsocause us to incur additiona
l security and insurance related costs.In
 addition,  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business,  we  collect  and  retain  sensitive  information,  including  personally  identifiable  information,  about  ourcustomers
 and employees. In many cases, we outsource administration of certain functions to vendors that could be targets of cyber attacks. Any theft, loss orfraudulent
 use  of  customer,  employee  or  proprietary  data  as  a  result  of  a  cyber  attack  could  subject  us  to  significant  litigation,  liability  and  costs,  as  well  asadversely impact our r
eputation with customers and regulators, among others.We
 have obtained cyber insurance to provide coverage for a portion of the losses and damages that may result from a security breach, but such insurance issubject
 to a number of exclusions and may not cover the total loss or damage caused by a breach. The market for cybersecurity insurance is relatively new andcoverage
 available for cybersecurity events may evolve as the industry matures. In the future, adequate insurance may not be available at rates that we believe arereasonable, and the costs of 
responding to and recovering from a cyber incident may not be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates.We may sustain losses that exceed or are ex
cluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are self-insured.We
 maintain  insurance  coverage  as  part  of  our  overall  legal  and  risk  management  strategy  to  minimize  potential  liabilities  arising  from  our  utilityoperations,
 as  well  as  the  operations  of  our  Market-Based  Businesses.  Our  insurance  programs  have  varying  coverage  limits,  exclusions  and  maximums,  andinsurance
 companies  may  seek  to  deny  claims  we  might  make.  Generally,  our  insurance  policies  cover  property  damage,  worker’s  compensation,  employer’sliability,
 general liability, cybersecurity, terrorism risks and automobile liability. Each policy includes deductibles or self-insured retentions and policy limits forcovered claims. As a resul
t, we may sustain losses that exceed or that are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are self-insured.33

Table of  ContentsAlthough
 in the past we have been generally able to obtain insurance coverage related to our business, there can be no assurance that we can secure allnecessary
 or appropriate insurance in the future, or that such insurance can be economically secured. For example, catastrophic events can result in decreasedcoverage limits, more limited co
verage, increased premium costs or deductibles.We
 rely  on  technology  to  facilitate  the  management  of  our  business  as  well  as  our  customer  and  supplier  relationships,  and  a  failure  or  disruption  ofimplemented technology could ma
terially and adversely affect our business.Technology
 is  an  integral  part  of  our  business  and  operations,  and  any  failure  or  disruption  of  the  technology  or  related  systems  we  implement  couldsignificantly
 limit our ability to manage and operate our business effectively and efficiently, which, in turn, could cause our business and competitive position tosuffer
 and adversely affect our results of operations. We use technology systems to, among other things, bill customers, process orders, provide customer service,manage
 certain  plant  operations  and  construction  projects,  manage  our  financial  records,  track  assets,  remotely  monitor  our  plants  and  facilities,  and  managehuman
 resources, supply chain, inventory, and accounts receivable collections. As a specific example, we depend on water meters to record and communicate theamount
 of water our customers use, and in recent years, we have experienced greater than expected performance failures with certain water meters used in theRegulated
 Businesses. When these occur, we work with meter manufacturers to determine and address the cause of such failures. While these and other failuresthat
 we have experienced have not to date had a material adverse effect on our operations, there can be no assurance that efforts to address performance failures orother
 issues we may experience with water meters will be successful and that these or future failures of water meters or other issues will not have a materialadverse effect on us.
Although we
 do not believe that the technology we have implemented or may in the future implement is at a materially greater risk of failure than that usedby other similar organizations, our technology and operatio
ns that use or rely on technology remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among other things:failure or interruption of
 the technology or its related systems; loss or failure of power, internet, telecommunications or data network systems; and operator error orimproper operation by, the negligent or improper
 supervision of, or the intentional acts of, employees, contractors and other third parties. Any or all of these eventscould have a materia
l adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.An
 inability to successfully develop and implement new technologies poses substantial risks to our business and operational excellence strategies, which couldhave a material adverse eff
ect on our business and financial results.A
 significant part of our long-term strategic focus on safety, operational excellence, O&M expense efficiency, water quality, asset and capital managementand
 the customer experience includes implementing new technologies for, among other things: customer service and support; environmental compliance; watermetering;
 water quality and source monitoring; cybersecurity; business development and growth; data analysis; employee development and training; and otherinitiatives.
 For  example,  we  have  made  and  plan  to  continue  to  make  significant  investments  in  developing,  deploying  and  maintaining  customer-facingtechnologies, applications to support field service and customer service operatio
ns, water source sensor and evaluation technologies, and data analysis and artificialintelligence
 technologies. Where appropriate, we also seek to align these new technologies with existing technology infrastructure and systems. There can be noassurance that we will be suc
cessful in designing, developing, deploying, integrating or maintaining these new technologies. Because these efforts can be long-termin
 nature, these new technologies may be more costly or time-consuming than expected to design, develop, integrate and complete and may not ultimately deliverthe
 expected or desired benefits upon completion. While we have and will continue to seek to recover costs and earn a return on capital expenditures with respectto the
 costs and expenses of development and deployment of these new technologies in our Regulated Businesses, there can be no assurance that we will be able todo so in every instance or
 at all, and our inability to do so may adversely affect our ability to achieve intended O&M expense efficiencies or other key performanceresults and, ultimate
ly, could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our inability
 to efficiently upgrade and improve our operational and technology systems, or implement new systems, could result in higher than expected costsor otherwise adversely impact our internal 
controls environment, operations and profitability.Upgrades
 and improvements to computer systems and networks, or the implementation of new systems, may require substantial amounts of management’stime
 and financial resources to complete, and may also result in system or network defects or operational errors due to multiple factors, including employees’ability to effect
ively use the new or upgraded system. We continue to implement technology to improve our business processes and customer interactions, and haveinstalled new, and upgraded existing, technolo
gy systems. Any technical or other difficulties in upgrading and improving existing or implementing new technologysystems
 may increase costs beyond those anticipated and have an adverse or disruptive effect on our operations and reporting processes, including our internalcontrol
 over financial reporting. We may also experience difficulties integrating current systems with new or upgraded systems, which may impact our ability toserve
 our customers  effectively  or efficiently.  Although we make  efforts  to minimize  any adverse  impact  on our controls,  business and operations,  we cannotassure that all such imp
acts have been or will be mitigated, and any such impacts could harm our business (individually or collectively) and have a material adverseeffect on our results of op
erations, financial condition and cash flows.34

 business has inherently dangerous work sites. If we fail to maintain safe work sites, we may experience workforce or customer injuries or loss of life, andbe exposed to financial losses, including penalt
ies and other liabilities.Safety
 is a core value and a strategy at American Water. Our safety performance and progress to our ultimate desired goal of zero injuries is critical to ourreputation.
 We maintain health and safety standards to protect our employees, customers, contractors, vendors and the public. Eliminating all hazards all of thetime
 is extremely challenging, but through strict adherence to our health and safety standards and empowering employees to stop work if deemed “unsafe,” webelieve we can achieve 
an injury-free workplace.At
 our business sites, including construction and maintenance sites, our employees, contractors and others are often in close proximity to large mechanicaloperating equipment, moving
 vehicles, pressurized water, electric and gas utility lines, below grade trenches and vaults, electrical and pneumatic hazards, fall fromheight
 hazards,  suspended  loads,  hazardous  chemicals  and  other  regulated  materials.  On  many  sites,  we  are  responsible  for  safety  and,  accordingly,  mustimplement
 important safety procedures and practices above governmental regulatory requirements. As an essential business that must continue to provide waterand
 wastewater services during the current COVID-19 pandemic, we are focused on the care and safety of our employees, contractors, vendors, customers andothers
 who work at or visit our worksites. If the procedures we implement are ineffective or are not followed by our employees or others, or we fail to implementprocedures,
 our  employees,  contractors  and  others  may  experience  illness,  or  minor,  serious  or  fatal  injuries.  Unsafe  work  sites  have  the  potential  to  increaseemployee
 turnover, expose us to litigation and raise our operating costs. Any of the foregoing could result in financial losses, which could have a material adverseimpact on our business, financ
ial condition, results of operations and cash flows.In
 addition,  our  operations  can  involve  the  delivery,  handling  and  storage  of  hazardous  chemicals,  which,  if  improperly  delivered,  handled,  stored  ordisposed
 of, could result in serious injury, death, environmental damage or property damage, and could subject us to penalties or other liabilities. We are alsosubject
 to various environmental, transportation and occupational health and safety regulations. Although we maintain functional employee groups whose primarypurpose is to implement e
ffective health and safety work procedures and practices throughout our organization, including construction sites and operating facilities,the failure to comply wi
th these regulations or procedures could subject us to liability.Work stoppages and other labor relations matters could adv
ersely affect our results of operations and the ability to serve our customers.As
 of December 31, 2020, approximately 45% of our workforce was represented by unions, and we had 72 collective bargaining agreements in place with14
 different unions representing our unionized employees. These collective bargaining agreements, 17 of which will expire during 2021, are subject to periodicrenewal
 and  renegotiation.  We  may  not  be  able  to  successfully  renew  or  renegotiate  these  labor  contracts,  or  enter  into  new  agreements,  on  terms  that  areacceptable
 to us. Any negotiations or dispute resolution processes undertaken in connection with our labor contracts could be delayed or affected by labor actionsor
 work stoppages. Labor actions, work stoppages or the threat of work stoppages, and our failure to obtain favorable labor contract terms during renegotiations,may
 disrupt our operations, negatively impact the ability to serve our customers, and result in higher labor costs, which could adversely affect our reputation,financial
 condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. While we have developed contingency plans to be implemented as necessary if a work stoppageor strike does occur, a str
ike or work stoppage may have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Financial, Economic and Market-Related Risks
Our indebtedness could adversely
 affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business, and we may be unable to generatesufficient cash flows to satisfy our liquid
ity needs.As
 of December 31, 2020, our aggregate long-term and short-term debt balance (including preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements) was$10.9
 billion,  and  our  working  capital  (defined  as  current  assets  less  current  liabilities)  was  in  a  deficit  position.  Our  indebtedness  could  have  importantconsequences, including:
•
limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital requirements or capital expenditures;•
exposing us to interest rat e risk with respect to the portion of our indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates;•
limiting our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or make payments in connection with our other obligations;•
impairing our access to the capital markets for debt and equity;•
requiring  that an increasing portion of our cash flows from operations be dedicated to the payment of the principal and interest on our debt, therebyreducing funds available 
for future operations, dividends on our common stock or capital expenditures;35

Table of  Contents•
limiting  our ability to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and to react to changes in market orindustry conditions; and
•
placing us at a competi tive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that have less debt.In
 order to meet our capital expenditure needs, we may be required to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facility or issue a combination ofnew
 short-term and long-term debt securities and/or equity. We continue to assess our short- and long-term liquidity needs in light of the impact of the COVID-19pandemic on
 the financial and capital markets, especially with respect to the market for corporate commercial paper, which experienced volatility and shortages ofliquidity
 in March 2020. In response to these events, in March 2020, we entered into a $750 million 364-day term loan facility and immediately executed a $500million
 draw thereunder to support our short-term liquidity by retaining that amount in cash. No further borrowings may be made under the term loan facility.During
 2020, we utilized other existing sources of liquidity, such as our current cash balances, cash flows from operations and borrowings under the revolvingcredit
 facility as necessary or desirable to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. We believe that existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet ourcash
 requirements  for the foreseeable  future.  However, as the impacts  of the COVID-19 pandemic  on the economy, the financial  and capital  markets  and ouroperations
 evolve, we will continue to assess our liquidity needs. In the event of a sustained market deterioration, we may need to obtain additional sources ofliquidity, which would require us to 
evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate actions.Moreover, additional borrowings may be required to
 repay or refinance outstanding indebtedness. Other than debt with respect to the term loan facility, debtmaturities
 and sinking fund payments in 2021, 2022 and 2023 will be $329 million, $14 million and $356 million, respectively. We can provide no assurance thatwe
 will be able to access the debt or equity capital markets on favorable terms, if at all, to repay or refinance this debt. Moreover, as new debt is added to ourcurrent debt levels, th
e related risks we now face could intensify, limiting our ability to repay or refinance existing debt on favorable terms.We
 have in the past entered into, and in the future may enter into, financial derivative instruments, including without limitation, interest rate swaps, forwardstarting
 swaps, swaptions and U.S. Treasury lock agreements. See Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. However, these effortsmay
 not be effective to fully mitigate interest rate risk, and may expose us to other risks and uncertainties, including quarterly “mark to market” valuation riskassociated with these inst
ruments, that could negatively and materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our
 ability to pay our expenses and satisfy our debt service obligations depends in significant part on our future performance, which will be affected by thefinancial,
 business, economic, competitive, legislative (including tax initiatives and reforms, and other similar legislation or regulation), regulatory and other riskfactors described
 in this section, many of which are beyond our control. If we do not have sufficient cash flows to pay the principal and interest on our outstandingdebt,
 we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, reduce capital investments, sell assets, borrow additional funds or sell additional equity. Inaddition,
 if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or if we are unable to incur indebtedness sufficient to enable us to fund ourliquidity
 needs, we may be unable to plan for or respond to changes in our business, which could cause our financial condition, operating results and prospects tobe affected mate
rially and adversely.Our
 inability to access the debt or equity capital or financial markets or other events could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost andour ability to meet long-ter
m commitments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.In
 addition to cash from operations, during 2020, we generally relied primarily on a $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, a $2.10 billion commercial paperprogram,
 our  $750  million  364-day  term  loan  facility  and  the  capital  markets,  to  satisfy  our  liquidity  needs.  The  revolving  credit  facility  currently  expires  inaccordance with
 its terms in March 2025, and the 364-day term loan facility will expire in March 2021. Historically, we have regularly used our commercial paperprogram
 rather than the revolving credit facility as a principal source of short-term borrowing due to the generally more attractive rates we generally could obtainin
 the commercial paper market. As of December 31, 2020, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility, $786 million of commercialpaper outstanding, $76 million in outsta
nding letters of credit and $500 million outstanding under the 364-day term loan facility. There can be no assurance that wewill
 be  able  to  continue  to  access  this  commercial  paper  program  or  revolving  credit  facility,  when,  as  and  if  desired,  or  that  the  amount  of  capital  availablethereunder will be suffi
cient to meet all of our liquidity needs at a reasonable, or any, cost.Under
 the  terms  of  the  revolving  credit  facility  and  the  364-day  term  loan  facility,  our  consolidated  debt  cannot  exceed  70%  of  our  consolidatedcapitalization,
 as determined under the terms of the those facilities. If our equity were to decline or debt were to increase to a level that causes us to exceed thislimit, lenders under those facilities would be entitled to refuse any further extensio
n of credit under the revolving credit facility and to declare all of the outstandingdebt
 under  the  revolving  credit  facility  and/or  the  term  loan  facility  immediately  due  and  payable.  To  avoid  such  a  default,  a  waiver  or  renegotiation  of  thiscovenant
 would be required, which would likely increase funding costs and could result in additional covenants that would restrict our operational and financingflexibility. Our abili
ty to comply with this and other covenants contained in the revolving credit facility, the term loan facility and our36

Table of  Contentsother
 consolidated indebtedness is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including events beyond our control. For example, events that could cause a reductionin
 equity include, without limitation, a significant write-down of our goodwill. Even if we are able to comply with this or other covenants, the limitations on ouroperational
 and financial flexibility could harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to incur indebtedness or reduce equity in connection withfinancings or other corpor
ate opportunities that we may believe would be in our best interests or the interests of our shareholders to complete.Disruptions
 in the capital markets or changes in our credit ratings could also limit our ability to access capital on terms favorable to us or at all. While thelending
 banks  that  participate  in  the  revolving  credit  facility  have  to  date  honored  their  commitments  under  those  facilities,  disruptions  in  the  credit  markets,changes
 in our credit ratings, or deterioration of the banking industry’s financial condition could discourage or prevent lenders from meeting their existing lendingcommitments,
 extending the terms of such commitments, or agreeing to new commitments. In such a case, we may not be able to access the commercial paper ordebt
 or capital markets, or other sources of potential liquidity, in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all. Furthermore, our inability to maintain, renew orreplace
 commitments  under  our  revolving  credit  facility  could  materially  increase  our  cost  of  capital  and  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition,  results  ofoperations
 and  liquidity.  Short-  or  long-term  disruptions  in  the  capital  and  credit  markets  as  a  result  of  economic,  legislative,  political  or  other  uncertainty,including
 as a result of the current COVID-19 pandemic, changes in U.S. tax and other laws, reduced financing alternatives, or failures of significant financialinstitutions
 could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our business. Any significant disruption in the capital, debt or credit markets, or financialinstitution failures 
could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the market stabilizes or until alternative financing can be arranged. Such measures couldinclude
 delaying or deferring capital expenditures, reducing or suspending dividend payments, and reducing other discretionary expenditures. Finally, there is noassurance that we will be able to access the equity markets to obtain capital or financing when nece
ssary or desirable and on terms that are reasonable or acceptableto us.
Any
 of the foregoing events that impede our access to the debt or equity capital markets, or the failure of any of our lenders to meet their commitments thatresult
 from financial market disruptions, could expose us to increased interest expense, require us to institute cash conservation measures or otherwise adverselyand materially af
fect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.Parent
 company may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable topay upstream dividends or repay funds.
Parent
 company is a holding company and, as such, it has no substantive operations of its own. Substantially all of our consolidated assets are held bysubsidiaries. Parent company
’s ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the net income and cashflows
 of its subsidiaries and their ability to pay upstream dividends or repay indebtedness to parent company. Prior to paying dividends to parent company, ourregulated
 subsidiaries  must  comply  with  applicable  regulatory  restrictions  and  financial  obligations,  including,  for  example,  debt  service  and  preferred  andpreference
 stock dividends,  as well as applicable  corporate,  tax and other  laws and regulations  and agreements,  and our covenants  and other  agreements.  Oursubsidiaries
 are separate legal entities and have no obligation to pay or upstream dividends to parent company. A failure or inability of any of these subsidiaries topay
 such dividends or repay intercompany obligations could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and parent company’s ability to pay dividends on itscommon stock and meet its o
ther obligations.We may not be able to fully util
ize our U.S. and state net operating loss carryforwards.As
 of  December  31,  2020,  we  had  U.S.  federal  and  state  NOL  carryforwards  of  approximately  $366  million  and  $357  million,  respectively,  andmanagement
 believes it is more likely than not that these NOL carryforwards will be recovered in the future. With the enactment in December 2017 of the TCJA,we
 analyzed the impacts of the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% on our deferred tax assets and liabilities, including ourNOL carryforwards, and as a result, 
remeasured those NOL carryforwards as of the date of enactment of the TCJA based on this tax rate change.Our
 federal NOL carryforwards will begin to expire in 2029, and our state NOL carryforwards began to expire in 2020 and will continue to expire through2040.
 We expect to fully utilize our federal NOL balance before it expires, and our ability to do so is primarily dependent upon our ability to generate sufficienttaxable
 income. We have, in the past, been unable to utilize certain of our state NOL carryforwards, and the establishment or increase of a valuation allowance inthe future would reduce our de
ferred income tax assets and our net income.Our
 actual results may differ from those estimated by management in making its assessment as to our ability to use the NOL carryforwards. Moreover,adoption of Related Interpretations with respect to the TCJ
A and other changes in income tax laws, the economy and the general business environment could affectthe
 future utilization  of our NOL carryforwards. If we are unable to fully utilize our NOL carryforwards to offset taxable income generated in the future, ourfinancial position, resu
lts of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.37

Table of  ContentsWe have recorded a significant amount of goodwill, and we ma
y never realize the full value of our intangible assets, causing us to record impairments that maynegatively affect our results o
f operations.Our
 total assets include $1.5 billion of goodwill at December 31, 2020. The goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisition of American Water by anaffiliate
 of our previous owner in 2003, the acquisition of E’town Corporation by a predecessor to our previous owner in 2001 and our acquisition of Pivotal in2018.
 Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price the purchaser paid over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired. Goodwillis
 recorded at fair value on the date of an acquisition and is reviewed annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may notbe
 recoverable. As required by the applicable accounting rules, we have taken significant non-cash charges to operating results for goodwill impairments in thepast.
We
 may  be  required  to  recognize  an  impairment  of  goodwill  in  the  future  due  to  market  conditions  or  other  factors  related  to  our  performance  or  theperformance
 of an acquired business. These market conditions could include a decline over a period of time of our stock price, a decline over a period of time invaluation
 multiples of comparable water utilities, market price performance of our common stock that compares unfavorably to our peer companies, decreases incontrol
 premiums, or other circumstances. For example, in the third quarter of 2018, prior to our sale of our former Keystone Clearwater Solutions (“Keystone”)operations, we strategic
ally narrowed the scope of that business and, as a result, we recorded a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of $57 million.A
 decline in the results forecasted in our business plan due to events such as changes in rate case results, capital investment budgets or interest rates, couldalso
 result in an impairment charge. Recognition of impairments of goodwill would result in a charge to income in the period in which the impairment occurred,which
 may negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and total capitalization. The effects of any such impairment could be material and couldmake
 it more difficult to maintain our credit ratings, secure financing on attractive terms, maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet the expectations ofour regulators.
Market volatility
 and other conditions may impact the value of benefit plan assets and liabilities, as well as assumptions related to the benefit plans, which mayrequire us to provide significant additional 
funding.The
 performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy significant future obligations under our pension andpostretirement
 benefit  plans.  The  value  of  these  assets  is  subject  to  market  fluctuations  and  volatility,  which  may  cause  investment  returns  to  fall  below  ourprojected
 return rates. As the COVID-19 pandemic continued throughout 2020, the stock market would often experience significant day-to-day fluctuations inmarket prices. We a
re currently unable to predict the effect, if any, of the COVID-19 pandemic or other events on the valuation of our pension assets and liabilities.A
 decline in the market value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets as of the measurement date can increase the funding requirements under ourpension and postretirement benefit plans.
 Additionally, our pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Interest rateshave
 experienced volatility and are subject to potential further adjustments based on the actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve, and others. If interest rates are lowerat the measurement date, our liabilities would increase, potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirement
s. Further, changes in demographics, such asincreases
 in life expectancy assumptions and increasing trends in health care costs may also increase our funding requirements. Future increases in pension andother
 postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable in rates, in which case our results of operations and financial positioncould
 be  negatively  affected.  In  addition,  market  factors  can  affect  assumptions  we  use  in  determining  funding  requirements  with  respect  to  our  pension  andpostretirement
 plans.  For  example,  a  relatively  modest  change  in  our  assumptions  regarding  discount  rates  can  materially  affect  our  calculation  of  fundingrequirements.
 To the extent that market data compels us to reduce the discount rate used in our assumptions, our benefit obligations could be materially increased,which could adversely affe
ct our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Additional Risks Related to Our Market-Based Businesses
Parent company provides performance guarantees with resp
ect to certain of the obligations of our Market-Based Businesses, including financial guarantees ordeposits, which may adversely affe
ct parent company if the guarantees are successfully enforced.Under the terms
 of certain agreements under which our Market-Based Businesses, primarily MSG, provide water and wastewater services to municipalities,other
 governmental  entities  and  other  customers,  parent  company  provides  guarantees  of  specified  performance  obligations  of  our  Market-Based  Businesses,including
 financial guarantees or deposits. In the event our Market-Based Businesses fail to perform these obligations, the entity holding the guarantees may seekto
 enforce the performance commitments against parent company or proceed against the deposit. In that event, our financial condition, results of operations, cashflows
 and liquidity could be adversely affected. At December 31, 2020, we had remaining performance commitments as measured by remaining contract revenuetotaling approximately
 $6.2 billion related to MSG’s contracts, and this amount is likely to increase if the number of bases served by MSG increases. The presenceof these commitments may ad
versely affect our financial condition and make it more difficult for us to secure financing on attractive terms.38

Table of  ContentsMSG’s operations are subject to various risks associated wi
th doing business with the U.S. government.MSG
 enters  into  contracts  with  the  U.S.  government  for  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  water  and  wastewater  systems,  which  contracts  may  beterminated,
 in whole or in part, prior to the end of the 50-year term for convenience of the U.S. government or as a result of default or non-performance by thesubsidiary
 performing  the  contract.  In  addition,  the  contract  price  for  each  of  these  military  contracts  is  typically  subject  to  either  an  annual  economic  priceadjustment,
 or a redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter. Annual economic price adjustment is an inflationindex-based
 contract price increase mechanism. Price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflectchanges
 in  contract  obligations  and  anticipated  market  conditions.  Any  early  contract  termination  or  unfavorable  annual  economic  price  adjustment  or  priceredetermination cou
ld adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Moreover,
 entering into contracts with the U.S. government subjects us to a number of operational and compliance risks, including dependence on the levelof
 government  spending  and  compliance  with  and  changes  in  governmental  procurement  and  security  regulations.  We  are  subject  to  potential  governmentinvestigations
 of our business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations, which are complex, and compliance with theseregulations
 can  be  expensive  and  burdensome.  If  we  were  charged  with  wrongdoing  as  a  result  of  an  investigation,  we  could  be  suspended  or  debarred  frombidding
 on or receiving awards of new contracts with the U.S. government or our existing contracts could be terminated, which could have a material adverseeffect on our results of op
erations and cash flows.General Risk Factors
New
 accounting  standards  or  changes  to  existing  accounting  standards  could  materially  impact  how  we  report  our  results  of  operations,  cash  flow  andfinancial condition.
Our
 Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other authoritativebodies
 or  governmental  entities  may  issue  new  pronouncements  or  new  interpretations  of  existing  accounting  standards  that  may  require  us  to  change  ouraccounting
 policies. These changes are beyond our control, can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how we report our results of operations, cashflow
 and financial condition. We could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which could also adversely affect our previously reportedresults of operations, cash 
flow and financial condition.Undetected errors in internal controls and information repor
ting could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and noncompliant disclosure.Our
 internal controls, accounting policies and practices and internal information systems are designed to enable us to capture and process transactions andinformation
 in  a  timely  and  accurate  manner  in  compliance  with  GAAP,  taxation  requirements,  federal  securities  laws  and  regulations  and  other  laws  andregulations
 applicable  to  us. We have also implemented  corporate  governance,  internal  control  and  accounting  policies  and procedures  in  connection  with theSarbanes-Oxley
 Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) and relevant SEC rules, as well as other applicable regulations. Such internal controls and policies havebeen
 and continue to be closely monitored by our management and Board of Directors to ensure continued compliance with these laws, rules and regulations.Management
 is also responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting and is required to assess annually the effectiveness ofthese
 controls. While we believe these controls, policies, practices and systems are adequate to verify data integrity, unanticipated and unauthorized actions ofemployees
 or temporary lapses in internal controls due to shortfalls in oversight or resource constraints could lead to undetected errors that could result in thedisallowance
 of  cost  recovery  and  non-compliant  disclosure  and  reporting.  The  consequences  of  these  events  could  have  a  negative  impact  on  our  results  ofoperations
 and financial condition. The inability of management to certify as to the effectiveness of these controls due to the identification of one or more materialweaknesses in these controls cou
ld also harm our reputation, increase financing costs or adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets.Our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain and utiliz
e qualified personnel.The
 success  of  our  business  is  dependent  upon  our  ability  to  hire,  retain  and  utilize  qualified  personnel,  including  engineers,  licensed  operators,  waterquality
 and other operating and craft personnel, and management professionals who have the required experience and expertise. From time to time, it may bedifficult
 to  attract  and  retain  qualified  individuals  with  the  expertise  and  in  the  timeframe  demanded  for  our  business  needs.  In  certain  geographic  areas,  forexample, we may not be able 
to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel.In
 addition, as key personnel approach retirement age, we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans. Ifwe
 cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans, our business, financial condition, results of operations andcash flows may be materiall
y and adversely impacted.39

Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Dive
rsionsCompliance with SWRCB Orders to Reduce Carmel River Diversions
Under
 the 2009 Order, California-American Water Company, the Company’s California subsidiary (“Cal Am”) is required, among other things, to decreasesignificantly
 its yearly diversions of water from the Carmel River according to a set reduction schedule. See Item 1—Business—Regulated Businesses—WaterSupply
 and  Wastewater  Services  and  Item  1A—Risk  Factors.  The  2009  Order  responded  to  claims  that  Cal  Am  had  not  sufficiently  implemented  actions  toterminate its unpermitted diversions of water from the Carmel River as require
d by a 1995 order of the SWRCB. In July 2016, at the request of Cal Am and severalMonterey County government agenc
ies, the SWRCB issued the 2016 Order approving the 2021 Deadline.40

Table of ContentsThe
 2009 Order includes a condition prohibiting Cal Am from diverting water from the Carmel River for new service connections or for any increased useof water at existing service
 addresses resulting from a change in zoning or use. In 2011, the California Public Utilities Commission (the “CPUC”) issued a decisiondirecting
 modifications in Cal Am’s tariffs to recognize the moratorium mandated by the 2009 Order, and directing Cal Am to seek written guidance from theSWRCB
 with respect to any unresolved issues of interpretation or implementation of this condition. In 2012, the Deputy Director of the SWRCB sent a letter toCal
 Am providing an interpretation as to the calculation of a baseline to determine increases in use of water at existing service addresses. In March 2018, theMPWMD
 adopted a resolution directing Cal Am to interpret the baseline in a manner that conflicts with the SWRCB’s written interpretation. In May 2018, CalAm
 notified the MPWMD and the SWRCB that it intends to seek declaratory relief concerning the conflicting regulatory interpretations under the 2009 Order. Inan attempt to resolve
 these conflicting interpretations prior to seeking judicial intervention, Cal Am has met with the MPWMD and the SWRCB several times. TheSWRCB
 agreed to circulate revisions to its 2012 interpretive letter, which would be subject to a public comment period. Any failure to follow the MPWMD’sresolution
 or the SWRCB’s written interpretation, despite these conflicting interpretations, could potentially result in fines, penalties and other actions against CalAm.
The
 2016 Order provides that if the CPUC authorizes Cal Am to acquire more than 1,000 acre-feet per year of water from a source other than the WaterSupply
 Project,  proponents  of  the  alternative  water  source  could  submit  revised  milestones  to  the  SWRCB  for  consideration.  See  Monterey  Peninsula  WaterSupply
 Project below. In May 2018, certain parties to the Water Supply Project proceeding submitted a petition to the SWRCB to add parallel milestones to the2009
 Order for 2019, 2020, and 2021, based on the proposed expansion of the Pure Water Monterey project, another groundwater replenishment project underconstruction on the
 Monterey peninsula. Petitioners claim that compliance with the alternate milestones would still provide for cessation of Cal Am’s unauthorizeddiversions
 from  the  Carmel  River  by  2021.  A  preliminary  report  on  feasibility  concluded  that  the  expanded  Pure  Water  Monterey  project  could  provide  anadditional
 2,250  acre-feet  of  water  per  year.  Cal  Am  believes  that  (i)  the  petition  is  premature,  (ii)  the  expanded  Pure  Water  Monterey  project  is  not  yet  asufficiently
 certain  or  reliable  water  supply  and,  even  if  construction  is  successfully  completed,  would  provide  an  insufficient  quantity  of  water  to  allow  fullcompliance with the 2009 Order, and (iii) the imposition of parallel milestones wo
uld distract from completion of the Water Supply Project. In December 2019, theSWRCB dismissed the petition without pre
judice.The
 2016 Order imposes yearly milestones related to construction of the Water Supply Project’s desalination plant facilities. If any milestone is missed, theSWRCB
 may impose reductions of up to 1,000 acre-feet per year in the amount of water Cal Am is able to divert from the Carmel River. If a milestone is missedfor
 reasons that are beyond Cal Am’s control, the SWRCB may waive the diversion reduction. On October 21, 2020, Cal Am reported to the SWRCB that, due tocircumstances
 beyond  its  control,  it  will  be  unable  to  meet  the  2020  milestones  requiring  intake  well  drilling  and  plant  construction  due  to  (i)  delays  by  theCalifornia
 Coastal Commission (the “Coastal Commission”) in considering Cal Am’s application for a permit for the desalination facility’s intake wells, and (ii) astay
 issued  by  the  Monterey  Superior  Court  on  physical  construction  of  the  desalination  plant  in  pending  litigation  over  the  plant’s  construction  permit.Nevertheless,
 Cal Am reported that even with a 1,000 acre-foot reduction in Carmel River water supplies, it believed that customer demand could be met withoutadditional
 rationing in the 2020-2021 water year. On November 17, 2020, the SWRCB provided its view to Cal Am that the milestone reductions were imposed toensure
 a  staggered  approach  to  ending  unauthorized  diversions,  and  that  regardless  of  fault  a  1,000  acre-foot  reduction  was  an  appropriate  and  intendedconsequence of missing the m
ilestone.Cal Am
 continues to work constructively with all appropriate agencies to provide necessary information in connection with obtaining required approvals forthe
 Water  Supply  Project.  However,  based  on  the  matters  discussed  above  and  below  in  Item  3—Monterey  Peninsula  Water  Supply  Project,  there  can  be  noassurance that
 the Water Supply Project in its current configuration will be completed on a timely basis, if ever. Due to the delay in the approval schedule, Cal Amcurrently does not believ
e that it will be able to fully comply with the diversion reduction requirements and other remaining requirements under the 2009 Order andthe
 2016 Order, including the 2021 Deadline. While the Company cannot currently predict the likelihood or result of any adverse outcome associated with thesematters,
 further attempts to comply with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order, or the 2021 Deadline, may result in material additional costs and obligations to CalAm, including fines and penalt
ies against Cal Am in the event of noncompliance with the 2009 Order or the 2016 Order.Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project
CPUC Final Approval of Water Supply Project
Cal
 Am’s  ability  to  move  forward  on  the  Water  Supply  Project  is  and  has  been  subject  to  extensive  administrative  review  by  the  CPUC  and  othergovernment
 agencies, obtaining necessary permits, and intervention from other parties. In September 2016, the CPUC unanimously approved a final decision toauthorize
 Cal Am to enter into a water purchase agreement for the GWR Project and to construct a pipeline and pump station facilities and recover up to theincurred $50 million in asso
ciated costs plus AFUDC, subject to meeting certain criteria.41

Table of ContentsIn
 September 2018, the CPUC unanimously approved another final decision finding that (i) the Water Supply Project meets the CPUC’s requirements for aCPCN,
 (ii) the issuance of the final decision should not be delayed, and (iii) an additional procedural phase was not necessary to consider alternative projects. TheCPUC’s
 2018 decision concludes that the Water Supply Project is the best project to address estimated future water demands in Monterey, and, in addition to thecost
 recovery approved in its 2016 decision, adopts Cal Am’s cost estimates for the Water Supply Project, which amounted to an aggregate of $279 million plusAFUDC
 at a rate representative of Cal Am’s actual financing costs. The 2018 final decision specifies the procedures for recovery of all of Cal Am’s prudentlyincurred
 costs associated with the Water Supply Project upon its completion, subject to the frameworks included in the final decision related to cost caps, O&Mcosts,
 financing, ratemaking and contingency matters. The reasonableness of the Water Supply Project costs will be reviewed in the first general rate case filed byCal
 Am after it becomes operational. Cal Am is also required to implement mitigation measures to avoid, minimize or offset significant environmental impactsfrom
 the construction and operation of the Water Supply Project and comply with a mitigation monitoring and reporting program, a reimbursement agreement forCPUC costs
 associated with that program, and reporting requirements on plant operations following placement of the Water Supply Project in service. Cal Am hasincurred
 $154 million in aggregate costs as of December 31, 2020 related to the Water Supply Project, which includes $36 million in AFUDC. While Cal Ambelieves
 that its expenditures to date have been prudent and necessary to comply with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order, as well as the CPUC’s 2016 and 2018final
 decisions, Cal Am cannot currently predict its ability to recover all of its costs and expenses associated with the Water Supply Project and there can be noassurance that Cal
 Am will be able to recover all of such costs and expenses in excess of the $50 million in construction costs previously approved by the CPUC inits 2016 final decision. See Note 17—Com
mitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.On
 July 2, 2019, Cal Am notified the MPWMD and Monterey One Water (collectively, the “Agencies”) that an event of default occurred under the waterpurchase agreement
 for the GWR Project because the Agencies failed to deliver to Cal Am by July 1, 2019 advanced treated recycled water produced by the GWRProject.
 Under  the  water  purchase  agreement,  upon  the  occurrence  of  this  event  of  default,  Cal  Am  had  the  right  to  terminate  the  water  purchase  agreementimmediately.
 Cal Am has elected not to exercise its right to terminate the water purchase agreement at this time, but in its notification to the Agencies, Cal Amexpressly
 reserved its right to terminate the water purchase agreement until such time as the Agencies commence their required delivery of water from the GWRProject. On July 16, 2019, the MPWMD and Monterey One Water
 responded to Cal Am’s event of default notice and estimated that water delivery would begin bymid-October 2019. On Decem
ber 12, 2019, Cal Am sent a letter to the Agencies requesting a status update with respect to the event of default. On January 2, 2020,Cal
 Am notified the Agencies that a second event of default occurred under the water purchase agreement because the Agencies failed to achieve the PerformanceStart
 Date (the date upon which the MPWMD’s performance obligations under the water purchase agreement were to commence) by January 1, 2020. Under thewater
 purchase agreement, upon the occurrence of this event of default, Cal Am had the right to terminate the water purchase agreement immediately. Cal Am haselected not
 to exercise its right to terminate the water purchase agreement at this time, but in its notification to the Agencies, Cal Am expressly reserved its right toterminate
 the water purchase agreement until such time as the Performance Start Date has occurred. On July 30, 2020, the Agencies advised Cal Am that thePerformance Start Date
 under the water purchase agreement for the GWR Project is September 1, 2020. After June 30, 2021, Cal Am will determine the amount ofadvanced
 treated recycled water produced by the GWR Project and delivered to Cal Am during the first fiscal year of the water purchase agreement, to determinethe Agencies’ complianc
e with their performance obligations thereunder.On
 April  17,  2019,  Water  Ratepayers  Association  of  the  Monterey  Peninsula  (“WRAMP”),  a  citizens’  advocacy  group,  filed  an  amended  complaint  inMonterey
 County Superior Court asserting a “qui tam” claim under the California False Claims Act on behalf of itself and the State of California against Cal Amand
 certain environmental consultants who worked on the CPUC’s environmental analysis of the MPWSP. The State Attorney General declined to proceed withthis
 action  after  it  was originally  filed  in  2016. On July  10, 2019,  defendants  filed  a  joint  demurrer  challenging  the  legal  sufficiency  of  the  allegations  of  theamended complaint.
 At an August 27, 2019 hearing on the demurrer, the court dismissed the petition without leave to amend. On October 17, 2019, WRAMP filedmotions
 seeking clarification and a reconsideration of the court’s ruling. A hearing on these motions was set for December 3, 2019, but on November 26, 2019,WRAMP
 abandoned its motions and instead filed an appeal of the court’s dismissal. On November 17, 2020, WRAMP dismissed its appeal in exchange for awaiver of costs.

Table of ContentsCoastal Development Permit Application
In
 June 2018, Cal Am submitted a coastal development permit application to the City of Marina (the “City”) for those project components of the WaterSupply
 Project  located  within  the  City’s  coastal  zone.  Members  of  the  City’s  Planning  Commission,  as  well  as  City  councilpersons,  have  publicly  expressedopposition to
 the Water Supply Project. In May 2019, the City issued a notice of final local action based upon the denial by the Planning Commission of Cal Am’scoastal
 development  permit  application.  Thereafter,  Cal  Am  appealed  this  decision  to  the  Coastal  Commission,  as  permitted  under  the  City’s  code  and  theCalifornia
 Coastal  Act.  At  the  same  time,  Cal  Am  submitted  an  application  to  the  Coastal  Commission  for  a  coastal  development  permit  for  those  projectcomponents
 located within the Coastal Commission’s original jurisdiction.  In October 2019, staff of the Coastal Commission issued a report recommending  adenial of Cal Am’s application for a coastal development permit with respect to the Water Supply Pr
oject, largely based on a memorandum prepared by the generalmanager
 of the MPWMD that contradicted findings made by the CPUC in its final decision approving the Water Supply Project. In November 2019, discussionsbetween
 staffs of the Coastal Commission and the CPUC took place regarding the Coastal Commission staff recommendation, at which time the CPUC raisedquestions
 about  the  Coastal  Commission  staff’s  findings  on  water  supply  and  demand,  groundwater  impacts  and  the  viability  of  a  project  that  the  CoastalCommission staff believes 
may be a possible alternative to the Water Supply Project.On
 August 25, 2020, the staff of the Coastal Commission released a report again recommending denial of Cal Am’s application for a coastal developmentpermit.
 Although the report concluded that the Water Supply Project would have a negligible impact on groundwater resources, the report also concluded it wouldimpact
 other  coastal  resources,  such  as  environmentally  sensitive  habitat  areas  and  wetlands,  and  that  the  Coastal  Commission  staff  believes  that  a  feasiblealternative
 project exists that would avoid those impacts. The staff’s report also noted disproportionate impacts to communities of concern. On September 16,2020, Cal Am
 withdrew its original jurisdiction application to allow additional time to address the Coastal Commission staff’s environmental justice concerns. Thewithdrawal of the original jurisdiction application did not impact Cal Am’s ap
peal of the City’s denial, which remains pending before the Coastal Commission. CalAm
 refiled  the original jurisdiction  application on November 6, 2020. On December 3, 2020, the Coastal Commission sent to Cal Am a notice of incompleteapplication,
 identifying certain additional information needed to consider the application complete. Cal Am is preparing a response to the Coastal Commission’snotice.
Desalination Plant Development Permit
The
 proposed desalination plant for the Water Supply Project is to be located in an unincorporated portion of Monterey County, California on a site ownedby
 CEMEX, Inc. (“CEMEX”), and requires a combined development permit from the County of Monterey prior to commencement of construction. On April 24,2019,
 the  County’s  Planning  Commission  voted  to  approve  the  permit.  In  July  2019,  the  Board  of  Supervisors  heard  appeals  filed  by  MCWD  and  a  publicadvocacy
 group,  at  which  time  it  denied  the  appeals  and  approved  the  permit.  In  August  2019,  MCWD  filed  a  petition  in  Monterey  County  Superior  Courtchallenging
 Monterey County’s approval of Cal Am’s combined development permit application and seeking injunctive relief to enjoin Monterey County and CalAm
 from  commencing  construction  of  the  desalination  plant.  In  October  2019,  after  a  hearing,  the  court  denied,  without  prejudice,  MCWD’s  motion  for  apreliminary
 injunction, but issued a stay of the County’s approval of the combined development permit, precluding commencement of physical construction of thedesalination
 plant, but allowing Cal Am to continue to obtain permits needed for the desalination plant’s construction. On January 21, 2021, the court issued itsdecision
 granting  in  part  and  denying  in  part  MCWD’s  petition.  The  court  found  that  the  County  of  Monterey  did  not  completely  comply  with  all  of  therequirements
 necessary to approve the combined development permit and set aside its approval so that the County could come into compliance. The court deniedall of MCWD’s other claims. Th
e court also lifted its stay on physical construction at the plant site.Proposed Zoning Changes at CEMEX Site for Slant Wells
In
 August 2018, the City circulated a public review draft of proposed amendments to its local coastal program and zoning ordinance, and placed the matterfor
 consideration on the Planning Commission’s agenda for its September 2018 meeting. The proposed amendments would change zoning at the CEMEX site toopen
 space and restrict future uses, including with respect to Cal Am’s planned use of the site for the slant wells for the Water Supply Project. Any change to theCity's
 local  coastal  program  must  ultimately  be  approved  by  the  Coastal  Commission.  Cal  Am,  CEMEX  and  the  Coastal  Commission  each  submitted  lettersopposing
 the proposed amendments. At its November 2018 meeting, the Planning Commission adopted a resolution recommending that the Marina City Councilconsider approving the amend
ments.In
 December 2018, the Marina City Council considered the proposed amendments. Cal Am, CEMEX and the Coastal Commission again submitted lettersopposing
 the  proposed  changes,  but  the  City  Council  unanimously  adopted  a  resolution  amending  its  local  coastal  plan  and  a  draft  amendment  to  its  zoningordinance.
 Changes to the ordinance require a second reading before becoming final, which occurred at the City’s December 2018 meeting. The changes to thelocal coastal plan mus
t be submitted to the Coastal Commission for approval and are not effective until such approval is obtained.43

Table of ContentsTest Slant Well Permitting
A
 preliminary step to building the Water Supply Project desalination plant is the construction and operation of a test slant well to confirm the suitability ofthe
 property  on  which  intake  wells  will  be  located  to  draw  water  from  under  Monterey  Bay.  In  November  2014,  the  Coastal  Commission  approved  coastaldevelopment
 permits for the test slant well, enabling Cal Am to construct and operate the test slant well. Because Cal Am may use the test slant well as one of theslant
 wells for the Water Supply Project, Cal Am sought and obtained from the Coastal Commission permit amendments to allow the test slant well to remain inplace and be maintained until February 28, 2022. A required lease obtaine
d from the California State Lands Commission, as amended, will expire on December 16,2022.
 Effective  February  28,  2018,  test  slant  well  pumping  ceased,  except  for  minimal  maintenance  pumping  activities,  in  accordance  with  Cal  Am’s  coastaldevelopment permits.
Water Supply Project Land Acquisit
ion and Slant Well Site UseIn
 July 2017, the Coastal Commission adopted a consent agreement and cease and desist order requiring sand mining operations on the property owned byCEMEX
 on which intake wells for the Water Supply Project will be located, to cease by the end of 2020 and the property to be sold to either a non-profit orgovernmental
 entity. The consent agreement strictly limits future use of the property but preserves Cal Am’s existing property rights and allows uses consistentwith existing easements and other rights of record. A
 permanent easement granted by CEMEX to Cal Am was recorded in June 2018 to allow Cal Am access to theproperty
 and  to  construct,  operate  and  maintain  the  Water  Supply  Project  intake  wells.  On November  26,  2019,  the  City  notified  CEMEX that,  based  on  thispermanent
 easement and Cal Am’s proposed use of the site for the intake wells, CEMEX has breached or will soon breach a prior 1996 annexation agreement (towhich
 Cal Am was not a party). The City states that it intends to seek declaratory relief from CEMEX and Cal Am ordering that Cal Am’s extraction is limited to500 acre-feet per year of
 groundwater, that Cal Am cannot export extracted water out of the basin, and that the permanent easement granted by CEMEX to Cal Amis
 void. The City has requested a meeting with CEMEX as part of a mandatory dispute resolution process under the annexation agreement prior to filing a lawsuit.CEMEX
 has denied the City’s claims and requested indemnification from Cal Am under the terms of the permanent easement. Cal Am and CEMEX believe thatthere
 is no valid limitation under the annexation agreement on Cal Am’s right to pump brackish groundwater and seawater at the site for desalination and use byCal Am’s customers.
On
 May 8, 2020, the City filed a lawsuit, which it amended on June 29, 2020 and October 15, 2020, in Monterey County Superior Court, naming Cal Amand
 CEMEX as defendants, and MCWRA and MCWD as real parties in interest. The lawsuit alleges a claim for breach of contract against CEMEX and seeksdeclaratory
 relief to void the permanent easement and prohibiting extraction of water by Cal Am’s slant wells at the CEMEX site in excess of 500 acre-feet peryear
 and the export of such water outside the groundwater basin. On November 17, 2020, Cal Am, CEMEX and MCWRA filed demurrers, which were overruledby the court at a hearing h
eld on February 9, 2021.On
 August  4,  2020,  MCWD  filed  a  cross-complaint  in  the  May  8,  2020  lawsuit  against  Cal  Am,  CEMEX  and  MCWRA,  alleging  claims  for  specificperformance of
 certain provisions of the 1996 annexation agreement related to the property owned by CEMEX on which intake wells for the Water Supply Projectwill
 be  located,  water  rights,  nuisance,  unreasonable  water  use,  and  declaratory  relief.  On  September  9,  2020,  Cal  Am  filed  a  demurrer  and  motion  to  strikechallenging the clai
ms asserted by MCWD. On October 14, 2020, the court sustained, with leave to amend, the demurrers as to the claims for specific performance,enjoinment
 of invasion of water rights, nuisance and unreasonable water use, and the court overruled the demurrers as to the claim for declaratory relief. MCWDfiled
 a  first  amended  complaint  on  November  13,  2020.  On  December  7,  2020,  Cal  Am,  CEMEX  and  MCWRA  filed  demurrers  to  the  amended  claims.  OnFebruary 23, 2021, the court sustained, wi
thout leave to amend, the demurrer to MCWD’s nuisance claim and overruled the remainder of the demurrers.Under
 California’s  Sustainable  Groundwater  Management  Act  (“SGMA”)  enacted  in  2015,  groundwater  basins  designated  by  the  state  as  criticallyoverdrafted
 must be managed by a groundwater sustainability agency (“GSA”) by 2020 in accordance with an approved groundwater sustainability plan (“GSP”)designed
 to  achieve  sustainability  by  2040.  Under  the  SGMA,  GSAs  have  broad  powers  to  achieve  sustainability  including,  but  not  limited  to,  regulatinggroundwater
 extraction by imposing fees on groundwater extractions and controlling groundwater extractions by regulating, limiting or suspending extractionsfrom
 wells.  The  400-acre  CEMEX  site  overlies  a  small  portion  of  the  180/400  Subbasin  of  the  Salinas  Valley  Groundwater  Basin;  the  84,000-acre  180/400Subbasin has been designated by the st
ate as critically overdrafted, mainly due to seawater intrusion into the subbasin.44

Table of ContentsIn
 late 2016, the Salinas Valley Basin Groundwater Sustainability Agency (the “SVBGSA”) was formed as a joint powers authority to become the GSA forthe
 Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin and prepare a GSP. In April 2018, the City filed a notice to become the GSA for the CEMEX site, creating an overlap withthe
 SVBGSA’s filing for the 180/400 Subbasin. In 2016, the SVBGSA commenced preparation  of a GSP covering the entire  180/400 subbasin, including theCEMEX
 site, but in August 2019 the City filed a notice that it intends to prepare its own GSP for the CEMEX site with the intent to severely limit or prohibitgroundwater
 pumping at that site. The State Department of Water Resources (“SDWR”) has taken the position that until the overlap is resolved, it will not acceptthe
 GSP from either agency, placing the subbasin at risk of being placed in a probationary status and subject to state management. In December 2019, the Countyof
 Monterey  filed  its  own  notice  to  become  the  exclusive  GSA  at  the  CEMEX  site  in  order  to  resolve  the  overlap,  which  is  permitted  under  SGMA.  SDWRaccepted the County’s fil
ing on December 18, 2019, and now lists the County as the exclusive GSA for the site.On
 December 30, 2019, the City filed a lawsuit in Monterey County Superior Court challenging the County’s filing, and SDWR’s acceptance of the filing,as
 the  exclusive  GSA  for  the  CEMEX  site.  The  City  has  named  the  County  and  its  Board  of  Supervisors,  the  County  GSA,  and  SDWR  and  its  director  asdefendants,
 and the SVBGSA and its Board of Directors as real parties. The City seeks to invalidate the County’s filing, as well as injunctive relief to preserve theCity’s
 status as a GSA for the site. To protect its interest in the matter, Cal Am filed an application to intervene in this lawsuit, which was granted. A hearing hasbeen scheduled for May 17, 2021.
On
 September 14, 2020, Cal Am filed a separate but related complaint in Monterey County Superior Court challenging the validity of actions taken by theCity
 and its GSA in adopting a groundwater sustainability plan for the CEMEX site, and the validity of the provisions of such plan. Due to the overlap of issues inthe
 City’s lawsuit with those in the validation action, the parties stipulated to a stay of the validation action pending determination of the claims in the City’saction. On December 21, 2020, the cour
t stayed the validation action.Challenge of Certification — Proposed Monter
ey System Acquisition Final Environmental Impact ReportIn
 November 2018, voters in Monterey, California passed “Measure J,” which decided that the MPWMD should conduct a feasibility study concerning thepotential
 purchase of Cal Am’s Monterey system assets, and, if feasible, to proceed with a purchase of those assets without an additional public vote. This serviceterritory
 represents approximately 40,000 customers. See Item 1—Business—Regulated Businesses—Condemnation and Eminent Domain for more informationon
 this matter. In August 2019, the MPWMD’s General Manager issued a report that recommends that the MPWMD board, among other things, (1) evaluatewhether
 the acquisition of the Monterey system assets by the MPWMD is in the public interest and sufficiently satisfies the criterion of “feasible” as provided inMeasure
 J, (2) ensure there is significant potential for cost savings before agreeing to commence an acquisition, and (3) develop more fully alternate operatingplans before deciding whethe
r to consider a Resolution of Necessity.On
 October 7, 2020, the MPWMD issued a FEIR for the potential acquisition of the Monterey system assets, and on November 4, 2020, the MPWMDcertified
 the FEIR, which purports to analyze the environmental impacts of the MPWMD’s project to (1) acquire the Monterey system assets through the power ofeminent domain,
 if necessary, and (2) expand its geographic boundaries to include all parts of this system. On November 25, 2020, Cal Am filed a petition for writof
 mandate  in  Monterey  County  Superior  Court  challenging  certification  of  the  FEIR,  alleging  that  the  MPWMD’s  analysis  of  environmental  impacts  wasinadequate and that certification
 was improper. This petition remains pending.West Virginia Elk River Freedom Industries Chemical Spill

Dunbar, West Virginia Water Main Break Class Action Litigation
On
 the evening of June 23, 2015, a 36-inch pre-stressed concrete transmission water main, installed in the early 1970s, failed. The water main is part of theWest
 Relay pumping station located in the City of Dunbar, West Virginia and owned by West Virginia-American Water Company, the Company’s West Virginiasubsidiary (“WVAWC”). The failure of the
 main caused water outages and low pressure for up to approximately 25,000 WVAWC customers. In the early morninghours of June 25, 2015, crews completed a repair, but that same
 day, the repair developed a leak. On June 26, 2015, a second repair was completed and service wasrestored
 that day to approximately 80% of the impacted customers, and to the remaining approximately 20% by the next morning. The second repair showed signsof
 leaking but the water main was usable until June 29, 2015 to allow tanks to refill. The system was reconfigured to maintain service to all but approximately3,000
 customers while a final repair was completed safely on June 30, 2015. Water service was fully restored on July 1, 2015 to all customers affected by thisevent.

 June 2, 2017, a complaint captioned Jeffries,  et al. v. West Virginia-American Water Company was  filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in KanawhaCounty
 on behalf of an alleged class of residents and business owners who lost water service or pressure as a result of the Dunbar main break. The complaintalleges breach of contract by WVAWC for failure to supply water, violation of West Virginia law regardi
ng the sufficiency of WVAWC’s facilities and negligenceby
 WVAWC in the design, maintenance and operation of the water system. The Jeffries  plaintiffs  seek unspecified alleged damages on behalf of the class for lostprofits,
 annoyance and inconvenience, and loss of use, as well as punitive damages for willful, reckless and wanton behavior in not addressing the risk of pipefailure and a large outage.
On February 4, 2020, the 
Jeffries  plaintiffs  filed a motion seeking class certification on the issues of breach of contract and negligence, and to determine theapplicability
 of  punitive  damages  and  a  multiplier  for  those  damages  if  imposed.  On  July  14,  2020,  the  Circuit  Court  entered  an  order  granting  the Jeffries plaintiffs’
 motion for certification of a class regarding certain liability issues but denying certification of a class to determine a punitive damages multiplier. OnAugust
 31, 2020, WVAWC filed a Petition for Writ of Prohibition in the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia seeking to vacate or remand the CircuitCourt’s
 order  certifying  the  issues  class.  At  the  request  of  the  parties,  on  September  10,  2020,  the  Circuit  Court  ordered  the  stay  of  all  matters  in  the  classproceeding
 pending  consideration  of  this  petition.  On  December  3,  2020,  the  Supreme  Court  of  Appeals  issued  an  order  to  show  cause  stating  that  there  aresufficient
 grounds for oral argument to consider prohibiting the class certification order. On January 28, 2021, the Supreme Court of Appeals granted a motion bythe 
Jeffries plaintiffs to remand the case  back to the Circuit Court for further consideration in light of a recent Supreme Court of Appeals decision issued in anothercase relating to the class certificati
on issues raised.The
 Company and WVAWC believe that WVAWC has meritorious defenses to the claims raised in this class action complaint and WVAWC will continueto vigorously defend itself 
against these allegations.Chattanooga, Tennessee Class Action Litigation
On
 September 12, 2019, Tennessee-American Water Company, the Company’s Tennessee subsidiary (“TAWC”), experienced a leak in a 36-inch watertransmission
 main, which caused service fluctuations or interruptions to TAWC customers and the issuance of a boil water notice. TAWC repaired the main byearly morning
 on September 14, 2019, and restored full water service by the afternoon of September 15, 2019, with the boil water notice lifted for all customers onSeptember 16, 2019.
On
 September 17, 2019, a complaint captioned Bruce,  et al. v. American Water Works Company, Inc., et al. was  filed in the Circuit Court of HamiltonCounty, Tennessee against TAWC, the Company and
 Service Company (collectively, the “Tennessee-American Water Defendants”), on behalf of a proposed classof
 individuals or entities who lost water service or suffered monetary losses as a result of the Chattanooga incident (the “Tennessee Plaintiffs”). The complaintalleged
 breach of contract and negligence against the Tennessee-American Water Defendants, as well as an equitable remedy of piercing the corporate veil. In thecomplaint
 as filed, the Tennessee Plaintiffs were seeking an award of unspecified alleged damages for wage losses, business and economic losses, out-of-pocketexpenses,
 loss  of  use  and  enjoyment  of  property  and  annoyance  and  inconvenience,  as  well  as  punitive  damages,  attorneys’  fees  and  pre-  and  post-judgmentinterest.
On
 November 22, 2019, the Tennessee-American Water Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which reliefmay

 18, 2020, the court (i) granted the motion to dismiss the Tennessee Plaintiffs’ negligence claim against all Tennessee-American Water Defendants, (ii)denied
 the motion to dismiss the breach of contract claim against TAWC, (iii) held in abeyance the motion to dismiss the breach of contract claims against theCompany
 and  Service  Company  pending  a  further  hearing  and  (iv)  held  in  abeyance  the  Company’s  motion  to  dismiss  the  complaint  for  lack  of  personaljurisdiction.
 On September 24, 2020, at the request of the Tennessee Plaintiffs, the court dismissed without prejudice all claims in the Bruce  complaint  against theCompany
 and Service Company. The collective impact of the September 2020 court orders was that all of the Tennessee Plaintiffs’ claims in this complaint weredismissed,
 other than the breach of contract claims against TAWC. On October 16, 2020, TAWC answered the complaint, and the parties are commencing withdiscovery.

Overview
American
 Water is the largest and most geographically diverse, publicly-traded water and wastewater utility company in the United States, as measured byboth
 operating  revenues  and  population  served.  The  Company  employs  approximately  7,000  professionals  who  provide  drinking  water,  wastewater  and  otherrelated
 services to over 15 million people in 46 states. The Company’s primary business involves the ownership of utilities that provide water and wastewaterservices to residenti
al, commercial, industrial, public authority, fire service and sale for resale customers, collectively presented as the “Regulated Businesses.” TheCompany’s
 utilities operate in over 1,700 communities in 16 states in the United States, with 3.5 million active customers with services provided by its water andwastewater
 networks. Services provided by the Company’s utilities are subject to regulation by PUCs. The Company also operates market-based businesses thatprovide
 water,  wastewater  and  other  services  to  residential  and  smaller  commercial  customers,  the  U.S.  government  on  military  installations,  as  well  asmunicipalities
 and  utility  customers,  collectively  presented  as  the  “Market-Based  Businesses.”  These  Market-Based  Businesses  are  not  subject  to  economicregulation by state PUCs. See Item 1—Busin
ess for additional information.Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic Update
American
 Water  has been monitoring  the global  impact  of COVID-19 pandemic  and has taken  steps to mitigate  adverse  impacts  to the Company. TheCompany
 has three main areas of focus as part of its response to COVID-19: the care and safety of its employees; the safety of its customers and the communitiesit
 serves; and the execution of its business continuity plan. American Water continues to work with its vendors to prevent disruptions in its supply chain, and, atthis
 time, has not experienced, and does not anticipate, any material negative impacts. The Company has also been monitoring the impacts of the pandemic on itsaccess
 to the capital markets, and to the extent such access is adversely affected, American Water may need to consider alternative sources of funding for itsoperations and for working capi
tal, any of which could increase its cost of capital.This
 pandemic continues to evolve, and American Water continues to monitor developments affecting its employees, customers, contractors and vendorsand
 will take additional actions as warranted. To date, the Company has experienced COVID-19 financial impacts, including an increase in uncollectible accountsexpense, additional debt costs, and
 certain incremental operation and maintenance (“O&M”) expenses. The Company has also experienced decreased revenues as aresult
 of the suspension of late fees and foregone reconnect fees. These impacts are collectively referred to as “financial impacts.” See Note 3—Impact of NovelCoronavirus
 (COVID-19) Pandemic in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The extent to which COVID-19 may furtherimpact
 American  Water,  including  without  limitation,  its  liquidity,  financial  condition,  and  results  of  operations,  will  depend  on  future  developments,  whichpresently cannot be predi
cted.49

 with these regulatory orders, the Company has recorded $30 million in regulatory assets and $4 million of regulatory liabilities for the financialimpacts
 related  to the COVID-19 pandemic  on the Consolidated  Balance  Sheets as of December  31, 2020. On December  30, 2020, the Company’s Kentuckysubsidiary received an ord
er denying its request to defer to a regulatory asset the financial impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic.As
 of  February  24,  2021,  six  states  have  ordered  active  moratoria  on  the  suspension  of  service  disconnections  due  to  non-payment. The moratoria ondisconnects
 have  expired  in  eight  states.  The  Company  continues  to  monitor  the  evolving  COVID-19  pandemic  and  will  continue  to  comply  with  the  currentordered moratoria and any
 future moratoria implemented.Financing Activities
To
 ensure adequate liquidity given the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on debt and capital markets, on March 20, 2020, parent company and AmericanWater Capital
 Corp. (“AWCC”), parent company’s wholly owned finance subsidiary, entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement that provides for a 364-day termloan
 facility of up to $750 million (the “Term Loan Facility”). On March 20, 2020, AWCC borrowed $500 million under the Term Loan Facility, the proceeds ofwhich
 were used for general corporate purposes of AWCC and American Water, and to provide additional liquidity. The Term Loan Facility allowed for a singleadditional
 borrowing  of  up  to  $250  million,  which  expired  unused  on  June  19,  2020.  See  Note  13—Short-Term  Debt  in  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  FinancialStatements for addition
al information.On
 April 14, 2020, AWCC completed a $1.0 billion debt offering which included the sale of $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.80% seniornotes
 due 2030 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.45% senior notes due 2050. Net proceeds of this offering were used to lend funds to parentcompany
 and its regulated subsidiaries, repay various senior notes and regulated subsidiary debt obligations at maturity, repay commercial paper obligations andshort-term
 indebtedness under AWCC’s unsecured revolving credit facility, and for general corporate purposes. See Note 12—Long-Term Debt in the Notes toConsolidated Financial State
ments for additional information.The
 Company sought to take advantage of lower interest rates available in the capital markets in 2020 by refinancing long-term debt, where possible. In2020,
 AWCC and the Company’s regulated subsidiaries issued in the aggregate $311 million of private activity bonds and government funded debt in multipletransactions
 with annual interest rates ranging from 0.60% to 1.20%, maturing in 2023 to 2027. The Company used these proceeds to retire an aggregate of $311million of long-term d
ebt issues at maturity with annual interest rates ranging from 4.45% to 5.60%.50

Table of ContentsFinancial Results
For
 the  years  ended  December  31,  2020,  2019  and  2018,  diluted  earnings  per  share  (GAAP)  were  $3.91,  $3.43  and  $3.15,  respectively.  In  2020,  ascompared
 to  2019,  diluted  earnings  per  share  increased  $0.48.  This  increase  was  primarily  driven  by  continued  growth  in  the  Regulated  Businesses  frominfrastructure
 investment, acquisitions and organic growth, as well as the benefit from depreciation expense related to the assets of the Company’s New Yorksubsidiary,
 as required by assets held for sale accounting. Revenues increased as a result of warmer and drier than normal weather during the third quarter of 2020across
 several  of the  Company’s  subsidiaries,  contributing  a benefit  of  $0.07  per  diluted  share  for  2020.  Revenues  from  the Company’s  residential  customersincreased
 from many states experiencing work from home activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which were largely offset by decreased revenues from theCompany’s
 commercial  and  industrial  customers  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Partially  offsetting  these  increases  were  estimated  impacts  from  theCOVID-19 pandemic on HOS from increased cla
ims that likely have resulted from more work from home activity. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Companyrecognized
 a loss of $0.19 per diluted share, relating to the sale of its Keystone operations. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2019, the Company recorded abenefit of $0.01 per
 diluted share from the reduction of the liability related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill settlement in West Virginia.Growth—through
 capital  investment  in  infrastructure  and  regulated  acquisitions,  as  well  as  strategic  growth  opportunities  in  the  Market-BasedBusinesses
The
 Company expects to continue to grow its businesses, with the majority of its growth to be achieved in the Regulated Businesses through (i) continuedcapital
 investment in the Company’s infrastructure to provide safe, clean, reliable and affordable water and wastewater services to its customers, and (ii) regulatedacquisitions to expand the Company
’s services to new customers. The Company also expects to continue to grow the Market-Based Businesses, which leverages itscore water and wastewater 
competencies. In 2020, the Company invested $1.9 billion, primarily in the Regulated Businesses, as discussed below:Regulated Businesses Growth and Optimization
•
$1.8 billion capital inves tment in the Regulated Businesses, the majority for infrastructure improvements and replacements; and•
$135  million to fund acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses, which added approximately 37,800 water and wastewater customers during 2020, inaddition to approximate
ly 14,500 customers added through organic growth during 2020.During
 2021,  the  Company  closed  on  the  acquisition  of  two  regulated  water  and  wastewater  systems  adding  approximately  600  customers,  for  a  totalaggregate purchase price of $3
 million. As of February 24, 2021, the Company has entered into agreements for pending acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses toadd approximately 30,000 addit
ional customers.Sale of New York American Water Company, Inc.

estimated revenues of approximately $771 million over a 50-year period, subject to an annual economic price adjustment.Future Growth
Looking
 forward, the Company expects to invest between $10.3 billion to $10.5 billion from 2021 to 2025, and between $22 billion to $25 billion from2021 to 2030, including $1.9 billion in 2021. The Company
’s expected future investments include:•
capital  investment for infrastructure improvements in the Regulated Businesses of $8.9 billion over the next five years, and between $19 billion and$21 billion over the next 10 yea
rs, including $1.6 billion expected in 2021; and51

growth  from acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses to expand the Company’s water and wastewater customer base of between $1.4 billion to $1.6billion over the next fiv
e years, and between $3 billion to $4 billion over the next 10 years, including $300 million expected in 2021.Presented

ars, by purpose:
Operational Excellence
The Company’s adjusted
 regulated O&M efficiency ratio, which is used as a measure of the operating performance of the Regulated Businesses, was 34.3%for
 the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 34.5% and for the year ended December 31, 2019. The improvement in this ratio reflects the continued focuson operating costs, as well as an 
increase in operating revenues for the Regulated Businesses.The
 Company’s  adjusted  regulated  O&M  efficiency  ratio  is  a  non-GAAP  measure,  and  is  defined  by  the  Company  as  its  operation  and  maintenanceexpenses
 from the Regulated Businesses, divided by the operating revenues from the Regulated Businesses, where both operation and maintenance expenses andoperating revenues
 were adjusted to eliminate purchased water expense. Also  excluded from operation and maintenance expenses are the allocable portion of non-operation and maintenance support services costs, mainly depreciation an
d general taxes, which are reflected in the Regulated Businesses segment as operation andmaintenance
 expenses, but for consolidated financial reporting purposes, are categorized within other line items in the accompanying Consolidated Statements ofOperations.
 Additionally, the  Company excluded the impact of certain Freedom Industries chemical spill settlement activities recognized in 2018 and 2019 fromoperation
 and  maintenance  expenses  (see  Note  17—Commitments  and  Contingencies  in  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  additionalinformation).
 The items discussed above were excluded from the calculation as they are not reflective of management’s ability to increase the efficiency of theRegulated Businesses.
The
 Company evaluates its operating performance using this ratio, and believes it is useful to investors because it directly measures improvement in theoperating
 performance and efficiency of the Regulated Businesses. This information is derived from the Company’s consolidated financial information but is notpresented
 in its financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. This information supplements and should be read in conjunction with the Company’sGAAP
 disclosures, and should be considered as an addition to, and not a substitute for, any GAAP measure. The Company’s adjusted regulated O&M efficiencyratio (i)
 is not an accounting measure that is based on GAAP; (ii) is not based on a standard, objective industry definition or method of calculation; (iii) may not becomparable to other co
mpanies’ operating measures; and (iv) should not be used in place of the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this Form 10-K.52

The  $39  million  base  rate  increase  was  effective  on  November  1,  2020,  which  is  net  of  excess  accumulated  deferred  income  taxes  (“EADIT”)  of  $15  million  being  returned  tocustomers.
 The unprotected EADIT balance of $133 million is being returned to customers over 15 years. The $39 million rate increase was further reduced by a bill credit, for a 10-month
 period beginning November 1, 2020 for both the protected and unprotected catch up period EADIT of $32.5 million. The catch up period of January 1, 2018 through October 31,2020
 covers the period from when the lower federal tax rate went into effect until new base rates went into effect. The $40 million rate increase was effective on June 15, 2018. As partof
 the resolution of the general rate case in 2018, the Company’s New Jersey subsidiary’s customers received refunds for the amount of provisional rates implemented as of June 15,2018 that exceeded the final rate increase plus interest.
(b)
The  Company’s Indiana subsidiary received an order approving a joint settlement agreement with all major parties with respect to its general rate case filing, authorizing annualizedincremental revenues of $4 million in the first rate year, effective July 1, 2019, and $13 mill

CARES Act
In
 March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was signed into law. The CARES Act includes certain taxrelief
 provisions applicable to the Company including: (i) the immediate refund of the corporate alternative minimum tax credit; (ii) the ability to carryback netoperating
 losses for five years for tax years 2018 through 2020; and (iii) delayed payment of employer payroll taxes. The CARES Act did not have a materialimpact on the Company’s Consolidat

 in  the  federal  corporate  income  tax  rate  from  35%  to  21%  as  of  January  1,  2018.  The  enactment  of  the  TCJA  required  a  re-measurement  of  theCompany’s
 deferred income taxes. The portion of this re-measurement related to the Regulated Businesses was substantially offset by a regulatory liability asEADIT
 will  be  used  to  benefit  the  Company’s  regulated  customers  in  future  rates.  Nine  of  the  Company’s  regulated  subsidiaries  are  amortizing  EADIT  andcrediting
 customers, including one which is using the EADIT to offset future infrastructure investments. The Company expects the timing of the amortization ofEADIT
 credits by the five remaining regulated subsidiaries to be addressed in pending or future rate cases or other proceedings. When crediting EADIT to thecustomer, the Company records bo
th a reduction to revenue and a reduction to income tax expense, having no material impact on net income.Federal Net Operating Loss
The
 Company had a federal NOL carryover balance of $366 million as of December 31, 2020 that is expected to be fully utilized during 2021, after whichtime the Company expects th

Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital Resources
The
 Company  regularly  evaluates  and  monitors  its  cash  requirements  for  capital  investments,  acquisitions,  operations,  commitments,  debt  maturities,interest
 and dividends. The Company’s business is capital intensive, with a majority of this capital funded by cash flows from operations. When necessary, theCompany
 also obtains funds from external sources, primarily in the debt markets and through short-term commercial paper borrowings. The Company may alsoaccess
 the equity capital markets to support its capital funding requirements, as needed. The Company’s access to external financing on reasonable terms dependson
 its credit ratings and current business conditions, including that of the utility and water utility industry in general, as well as conditions in the debt or equitycapital
 markets, and the national and international economic and geopolitical arenas. Disruptions in the credit markets may discourage lenders from extending theterms
 of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments. Market disruptions may also limit the Company’s ability to issue debt and equity securities in thecapital markets.
If
 these  business,  market,  financial  and  other  conditions  deteriorate  to  the  extent  that  the  Company  is  no  longer  able  to  access  the  capital  markets  onreasonable
 terms, AWCC has access to an unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in March 2025 with aggregate bank commitments of $2.25 billion. Thefacility
 is used principally to fulfill the Company’s short-term liquidity needs by supporting AWCC’s $2.10 billion commercial paper program and to provide asublimit
 of  up  to  $150  million  for  letters  of  credit.  Subject  to  satisfying  certain  conditions,  the  credit  agreement  permits  AWCC  to  increase  the  maximumcommitment under the 
facility by up to $500 million.In
 order to meet short-term liquidity needs, AWCC issues commercial paper that is supported by its revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2020,AWCC
 had no outstanding borrowings and $76 million of outstanding letters of credit under its revolving credit facility, with $1.39 billion available to fulfill itsshort-term
 liquidity needs and to issue letters of credit. The Company believes that its ability to access the debt and equity capital markets, the revolving creditfacility
 and  cash  flows  from  operations  will  generate  sufficient  cash  to  fund  the  Company’s  short-term  requirements.  The  Company  believes  it  has  sufficientliquidity and
 the ability to manage its expenditures, should there be a disruption of the capital and credit markets. However, there can no assurance that the lenderswill be able to meet existing commitments to AWCC under the revolvin
g credit facility, or that AWCC will be able to access the commercial paper or loan marketsin the future on accept
able terms or at all. See Credit Facilities and Short-Term Debt below for additional information.To
 ensure adequate liquidity given the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on debt and capital markets, on March 20, 2020, AWCC entered into a TermLoan
 Credit Agreement, by and among parent company, AWCC and the lenders party thereto, which provided for the Term Loan Facility of up to $750 million.On
 March 20, 2020, AWCC borrowed $500 million under the Term Loan Facility, the proceeds of which were used for general corporate purposes of AWCC andAmerican
 Water,  and to  provide  additional  liquidity.  The  Term  Loan  Facility  allowed  for a  single  additional  borrowing of  up to  $250 million,  which expiredunused
 on  June  19,  2020.  The  Term  Loan  Facility  commitments  terminate  on  March  19,  2021.  As  of  December  31,  2020,  $500  million  of  principal  wasoutstanding under the Term Loan Fa
cility.The
 Company uses its capital resources, including cash, primarily to (i) fund operating and capital requirements, (ii) pay interest and meet debt maturities,(iii)
 pay dividends, (iv) fund acquisitions, (v) fund pension and postretirement benefit obligations, and (vi) the Company estimates, during 2021, to begin to payfederal
 income taxes. The Company invests a significant amount of cash on regulated capital projects where it expects to earn a long-term return on investment.Additionally,
 the Company operates in rate regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited, and where such recoverygenerally
 takes place over an extended period of time, and certain capital recovery is also subject to regulatory lag. See Item 1—Business—Regulated Businesses—Regulation
 and Rate Making for additional information. The Company expects to fund future maturities of long-term debt through a combination of externaldebt
 and, to the extent available, cash flows from operations. Since the Company expects its capital investments over the next few years to be greater than its cashflows
 from operating activities, the Company currently plans to fund the excess of its capital investments over its cash flows from operating activities for the nextfive
 years through a combination of long-term debt and equity. If necessary, the Company may delay certain capital investments or other funding requirements, orpursue
 financing from other sources to preserve liquidity. In this event, the Company believes it can rely upon cash flows from operations to meet its obligationsand fund its minimum requi
red capital investments for an extended period of time.Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities

 flows  provided  by  operating  activities  primarily  result  from  the  sale  of  water  and  wastewater  services  and,  due  to  the  seasonality  of  demand,  aregenerally
 greater  during  the  warmer  months.  The  Company’s  future  cash  flows  provided  by  operating  activities  will  be  affected  by,  among  other  things:  theCompany’s
 customers’  ability  to  pay  for  service  in  a  timely  manner,  economic  utility  regulation  inflation;  compliance  with  environmental,  health  and  safetystandards;
 production costs; maintenance costs; customer growth; declining customer usage of water; employee-related costs, including pension funding; weatherand seasonality; taxes; 
and overall economic conditions.63

Table of ContentsCash
 flows provided by operating activities have been a reliable, steady source of funding, sufficient to meet operating requirements and fund the majorityof
 the Company’s capital investments. The Company expects to seek access to debt and equity capital markets to meet the balance of its capital investment, if any,and
 fund its dividend payments, as needed. Operating cash flows can be negatively affected by changes in the Company’s rate regulated environments, changes inthe
 Market-Based Businesses, changes in the economy, interest rates, the timing of tax payments, and the Company’s customers’ ability to pay for service in atimely
 manner,  among  other  items.  The  Company  can  provide  no  assurance  that  its  customers’  historical  payment  pattern  will  continue  in  the  future.  TheCompany’s
 current  liabilities  may  exceed  current  assets  mainly  from  debt  maturities  due  within  one  year  and  the  use  of  short-term  debt  as  a  funding  source,primarily to meet scheduled
 maturities of long-term debt, fund acquisitions and construction projects, as well as cash needs which can fluctuate significantly due tothe seasonality of the busin
ess. The Company addresses cash timing differences through the aforementioned liquidity funding mechanisms.Presented in the table be

Changes in  working capital include changes to receivables and unbilled revenues, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and other current assets and liabilities, net, less the settlementof cash flow hedges.
In
 2020, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $43 million, primarily due to an increase in net income and the decrease in cash paid for thesettlement
 of cash flow hedges in 2020 compared to the prior year in connection with AWCC’s 2020 and 2019 debt offerings. The main factors contributing to theincrease in net income are described in “Consolidated Results of Operations” and “
Segment Results of Operations” above. Partially offsetting these increases was achange in working capital, pr
imarily resulting from the following: (i) an increase in accounts receivable, net due to increased revenues compared to the same periodin
 the prior year and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020; (ii) an increase in unbilled revenues as a result of MSG achieving significant capital projectmilestones
 during 2020; (iii) a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to the timing of both capital projects and invoices; and (iv) a partial offsetdue to the change in other cu
rrent assets.The
 Company expects to make pension contributions to the plan trusts of $37 million in 2021. In addition, the Company estimates that contributions willamount
 to $37 million, $35 million, $33 million and $30 million in 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively. Actual amounts contributed could change materiallyfrom these estimat
es as a result of changes in assumptions and actual investment returns, among other factors.64

 2020, cash flows used in investing activities increased $116 million primarily due to continued investment across all infrastructure categories, mainlyreplacement
 and renewal of transmission and distribution and treatment and pumping infrastructure in the Company’s Regulated Businesses, as discussed below.Additionally,
 proceeds from the sale of assets were higher in 2019 compared to 2020, due to the sale of Keystone for $31 million, in the fourth quarter of 2019.Partially offsetting 
these increases was a decrease in acquisitions in 2020 compared to 2019.The
 Company’s infrastructure investment plan consists of both infrastructure renewal programs, where the Company replaces infrastructure, as needed, andmajor
 capital investment projects, where the Company constructs new water and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities to meet new customer growth andwater
 quality regulations. The Company’s projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes ineconomic conditions and othe

 2020,  the  Company’s  capital  expenditures  increased  $168  million  primarily  due  to  investment  in  transmission  and  distribution  and  treatment  andpumping infrastructure.
The
 Company  also  grows  its  business  primarily  through  acquisitions  of  water  and  wastewater  systems,  as  well  as  other  water-related  services.  Theseacquisitions are
 generally located in geographic proximity to the Company’s existing Regulated Businesses and support continued geographical diversification andgrowth of its operations. Generally, acquisiti
ons are funded initially with short-term debt, and later refinanced with long-term financing, once reflected in rate base.During
 2020,  the  Company  paid  $135  million  for  the  acquisition  of  23  water  and  wastewater  systems,  representing  in  the  aggregate  approximately  37,800customers.
As
 previously  noted,  the  Company  expects  to  invest  between  $10.3  billion  to  $10.5  billion  from  2021  to  2025,  with  $8.9  billion  of  this  range  forinfrastructure
 improvements in the Regulated Businesses, and between $22 billion to $25 billion from 2021 to 2030. In 2021, the Company expects to invest $1.9billion, with $1.6 billion for in
frastructure improvements and $300 million for acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses.65

In
 2020, cash flows provided by financing activities  increased $626 million, primarily due to the $500 million  borrowed under the Term Loan Facilityduring
 the first quarter of 2020, lower net repayments of commercial paper borrowings and no anti-dilutive stock repurchases in 2020, partially offset by higherdividends paid in 2020.
The
 Company’s  financing  activities,  primarily  focused  on  funding  regulated  infrastructure  expenditures,  regulated  and  market-based  acquisitions  andpayment
 of dividends. These activities included the issuance of long-term and short-term debt, primarily through AWCC and in 2018, an equity issuance to fundapproximately
 50% of the purchase price of the Pivotal acquisition. Based on the needs of the Regulated Businesses and the Company, AWCC may borrow fundsor
 issue its debt in the capital markets and then, through intercompany loans, provide those borrowings to the Regulated Businesses and parent company. TheRegulated
 Businesses and parent company are obligated to pay their portion of the respective principal and interest to AWCC, in the amount necessary to enableAWCC to meet its debt service ob
ligations. Parent company’s borrowings are not a source of capital for the Regulated Businesses, therefore, parent company is notable
 to recover the interest charges on its debt through regulated water and wastewater rates. As of December 31, 2020, AWCC has made long-term fixed rateloans and commercial p
aper loans to the Regulated Businesses amounting to $5.4 billion and $718 million, respectively, in addition to the $500 million outstandingon
 the Term Loan Facility. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, AWCC has made long-term fixed rate loans and commercial paper loans to parent companyamounting
 $2.8  billion  and  $68  million,  respectively.  As  of  December  31,  2020,  parent  company  has  made  long-term  fixed  rate  loans  to  the  Market-BasedBusinesses amounting to $183 million 
related to the acquisition of Pivotal on June 4, 2018.On
 April 14, 2020, AWCC completed a $1.0 billion debt offering which included the sale of $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.80% SeniorNotes
 due 2030 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.45% Senior Notes due 2050. At the closing of the offering, AWCC received, after deductionof
 underwriting  discounts  and  before  deduction  of  offering  expenses,  net  proceeds  of  $989  million.  AWCC  used  the  net  proceeds  to:  (i)  lend  funds  to  parentcompany
 and its regulated subsidiaries; (ii) fund sinking fund payments for, and to repay at maturity, $28 million in aggregate principal amount of outstandinglong-term
 debt of AWCC and certain of the Company’s regulated subsidiaries; (iii) repay AWCC’s commercial paper obligations and short-term indebtednessunder AWCC’s $2.25 billion unsecured revolv
ing credit facility; and (iv) for general corporate purposes.One
 of the principal market risks to which the Company is exposed is changes in interest rates. In order to manage the exposure, the Company follows riskmanagement
 policies  and  procedures,  including  the  use  of  derivative  contracts  such  as  swaps.  The  Company  reduces  exposure  to  interest  rates  by  managingcommercial
 paper and debt maturities. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments. Thederivative
 contracts  entered  into  are  for  periods  consistent  with  the  related  underlying  exposures.  The  Company  is  exposed  to  the  risk  that  counterparties  toderivative
 contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. The Company minimizes the counterparty credit risk on these transactions by only dealing withleading, credit-worthy f
inancial institutions, having long-term credit ratings of “A” or better.66

Table of ContentsOn
 April 8, 2020, the Company terminated four  treasury lock agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $400 million, realizing a net loss of $6million, to be
 amortized through interest, net over a ten-year period, in accordance with the terms of the new debt issued on April 14, 2020. No ineffectiveness wasrecognized on hedging instrum
ents for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.The
 Company sought to take advantage of lower interest rates available in the capital markets in 2020 by refinancing long-term debt, where possible. In2020,
 AWCC and the Company’s regulated subsidiaries issued in the aggregate $311 million of private activity bonds and government funded debt in multipletransactions
 with annual interest rates ranging from 0.60% to 1.20%, maturing in 2023 to 2027. The Company used these proceeds to retire an aggregate of $311million of long-term d
ebt issues at maturity with annual interest rates ranging from 4.45% to 5.60%.In
 May 2018, parent company and AWCC filed with the SEC a universal shelf registration statement that enables the Company to meet its capital needsthrough
 the  offer  and  sale  to  the  public  from  time  to  time  of  an  unlimited  amount  of  various  types  of  securities,  including  American  Water  common  stock,preferred
 stock, and other equity and hybrid securities, and AWCC debt securities, all subject to market conditions and demand, general economic conditions, andas
 applicable, rating status. The shelf registration statement will expire in May 2021. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, $1.00 billion, $1.10 billion, and $1.33 billion,respectively,
 of debt securities were issued under this registration statement. Additionally, during 2018 under this registration statement, the Company issued 2.32million shares of its co
mmon stock for aggregate net proceeds of $183 million.Presented in the table be

Table of ContentsIssuer and Guarantor of Senior Notes
The
 outstanding senior notes issued by AWCC, the wholly owned finance subsidiary of parent company, have been issued under two indentures, each byand
 between AWCC and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, providing for the rights and obligations of the parties thereto and the holders of thenotes
 issued thereunder. The senior notes also have been issued with the benefit of a support agreement, as amended, between parent company and AWCC, whichserves
 as the functional equivalent of a full and unconditional guarantee by parent company of AWCC’s payment obligations under the senior notes. No othersubsidiary of
 parent company provides guarantees for any of the outstanding senior notes. If AWCC is unable to make timely payment of any interest, principal orpremium,
 if any, on such senior notes, parent company will provide to AWCC, at its request or the request of any holder of such senior notes, funds to make suchpayment in
 full. If AWCC fails or refuses to take timely action to enforce certain rights under the support agreement or if AWCC defaults in the timely payment ofany
 amounts owed to any holder of such senior notes, when due, the support agreement provides that the holder may proceed directly against parent company toenforce such rights or to obt
ain payment of the defaulted amounts owed to that holder.As
 a wholly owned finance subsidiary of parent company, AWCC has no significant assets other than obligations of parent company and certain of itssubsidiaries
 in its Regulated Businesses segment to repay certain intercompany loans made to them by AWCC. AWCC’s ability to make payments of amountsowed
 to holders of the senior notes will be dependent upon AWCC’s receipt of sufficient payments of amounts owed pursuant to the terms of such intercompanyloans
 and from its ability to issue indebtedness or otherwise obtain loans in the future, the proceeds of which would be used to fund the repayment of the seniornotes.
Because
 parent  company  is  a  holding  company  and  substantially  all  of  its  operations  are  conducted  through  its  subsidiaries  other  than  AWCC,  parentcompany’s
 ability to fulfill its obligations under the support agreement will be dependent upon its receipt of sufficient cash dividends or distributions from itsoperating
 subsidiaries. See Note 10—Shareholders’ Equity—Dividends and Distributions, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary ofthe
 limitations on parent company and its subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions. Furthermore, parent company’s operating subsidiaries are separateand
 distinct legal entities and, other than AWCC, have no obligation to make any payments on the senior notes or to make available or provide any funds for suchpayment,
 other than through their repayment obligations under intercompany loans, if any, with AWCC. Based on the foregoing, parent company’s obligationsunder
 the support agreement will be effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, lease commitments and moneysborrowed or other indebtedness in
curred or issued by parent company’s subsidiaries other than AWCC.Credit Facilities and Short-Term Debt
AWCC
 has an unsecured revolving credit facility of $2.25 billion that expires in March 2025. In April 2020, AWCC and its lenders agreed to extend thetermination
 date  of  the  credit  agreement  with  respect  to  AWCC’s  revolving  credit  facility  pursuant  to  its  terms  from  March  2024  to  March  2025.  Subject  tosatisfying
 certain conditions, the credit agreement also permits AWCC to increase the maximum commitment under the facility by up to an aggregate of $500million.
Interest
 rates  on  advances  under  the  facility  are  based  on  a  credit  spread  to  the  LIBOR  rate  (or  applicable  market  replacement  rate)  or  base  rate  inaccordance
 with  Moody  Investors  Service’s  and  Standard  &  Poor’s  Financial  Services’  then  applicable  credit  rating  on  AWCC’s  senior  unsecured,  non-creditenhanced
 debt. The facility is used principally to support AWCC’s commercial paper program and to provide up to $150 million in letters of credit. Indebtednessunder
 the facility is considered “debt” for purposes of a support agreement between parent company and AWCC, which serves as a functional equivalent of aguarantee by parent comp
any of AWCC’s payment obligations under the credit facility.Presented

 changes in the capital structure between periods were mainly attributable to an increase in long-term debt, and the $500 million borrowed under theTerm Loan Facility during 2020, which 
is scheduled to terminate on March 19, 2021.Debt Covenants
The
 Company’s debt agreements contain financial and non-financial covenants. To the extent that the Company is not in compliance with these covenants,an
 event of default may occur under one or more debt agreements and the Company or its subsidiaries may be restricted in its ability to pay dividends, issue newdebt or
 access the revolving credit facility. The long-term debt indentures contain a number of covenants that, among other things, prohibit or restrict the Companyfrom
 issuing  debt  secured  by  the  Company’s  assets,  subject  to  certain  exceptions.  Failure  to  comply  with  any  of  these  covenants  could  accelerate  repaymentobligations.
Covenants
 in certain long-term notes, the Term Loan Facility and the revolving credit facility require the Company to maintain a ratio of consolidated debtto
 consolidated capitalization (as defined in the relevant documents) of not more than 0.70 to 1.00. On December 31, 2020, the Company’s ratio was 0.63 to 1.00and therefore the Company was in 
compliance with the covenants.69

 security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning ratingagency,
 and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Security ratings are highly dependent upon the ability to generate cash flows in anamount sufficient to se
rvice debt and meet investment plans. The Company can provide no assurances that its ability to generate cash flows is sufficient to maintainits
 existing ratings. None of the Company’s borrowings are subject to default or prepayment as a result of the downgrading of these security ratings, although sucha downgrading could increase f
ees and interest charges under its credit facility.As
 part  of  its  normal  course  of  business,  the  Company  routinely  enters  into  contracts  for  the  purchase  and  sale  of  water,  energy,  chemicals  and  otherservices.
 These  contracts  either  contain  express  provisions  or  otherwise  permit  the  Company  and  its  counterparties  to  demand  adequate  assurance  of  futureperformance
 when there are reasonable grounds for doing so. In accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law, if the Company is downgraded by acredit rating agency, 
especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgradeas a basis for making a dem
and for adequate assurance of future performance, which could include a demand that the Company must provide collateral to secure itsobligations.
 The Company does not expect to post any collateral  which will have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, financialposition or cash flows.
Access
 to the capital  markets, including the commercial  paper market,  and respective financing  costs in those markets,  may be directly affected  by theCompany’s
 securities ratings. The Company primarily accesses the debt capital markets, including the commercial paper market, through AWCC. However, theCompany has
 also issued debt through its regulated subsidiaries, primarily in the form of tax exempt securities or borrowings under state revolving funds, to lowerthe overall cost of debt.
Dividends and Regulatory Restrictions
For
 discussion of the Company’s dividends, dividend restrictions and dividend policy, see Note 10—Shareholders’ Equity in the Notes to ConsolidatedFinancial Statements for a
dditional information.Insurance Coverage
The Company
 carries various property, casualty, cyber and financial insurance policies with limits, deductibles and exclusions that it believes are consistentwith
 industry  standards.  However,  insurance  coverage  may  not  be  adequate  or  available  to  cover  unanticipated  losses  or  claims.  Additionally,  annual  policyrenewals
 can be impacted by claims experience which in turn can impact coverage terms and conditions on a going-forward basis. The Company is self-insured tothe
 extent  that  losses are  within the policy  deductible  or exceed  the amount  of insurance  maintained.  Such losses  could have a material  adverse  effect  on theCompany’s short-term and long-
term financial condition and its results of operations and cash flows.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies an
d make estimates, assumptions andjudgments
 that could affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Actual results could differ from these estimates, assumptionsand
 judgments. Management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimatesand
 assumptions  in  matters  that  are  inherently  uncertain  and  that  may  change  in  subsequent  periods.  Accordingly,  changes  in  the  estimates,  assumptions  andjudgments
 applied to these accounting policies  could have a significant  impact on the Company’s financial  condition, results of operations  and cash flows, asreflected
 in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Management has reviewed the critical accounting polices described below with the Company’sAudit,
 Finance and Risk Committee, including the estimates, assumptions and judgments used in their application. Additional discussion regarding these criticalaccounting policies and th
eir application can be found in Note 2—Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.70

Table of ContentsRegulation and Regulatory Accounting
The
 Company’s regulated utilities are subject to regulation by PUCs and, as such, the Company follows the authoritative accounting principles required forrate
 regulated  utilities,  which  requires  the  Company  to  reflect  the  effects  of  rate  regulation  in  its  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  Use  of  this  authoritativeguidance is applicable
 to utility operations that meet the following criteria: (i) third-party regulation of rates; (ii) cost-based rates; and (iii) a reasonable assumptionthat
 rates will be set to recover the estimated costs of providing service, plus a return on net investment, or rate base. As of December 31, 2020, the Companyconcluded that the opera
tions of its utilities met the criteria.Application of
 this authoritative guidance has a further effect on the Company’s financial statements as it pertains to allowable costs used in the ratemakingprocess.
 The Company makes significant assumptions and estimates to quantify amounts recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities. Such judgments include, butare
 not limited to, assets and liabilities related to regulated acquisitions, pension and postretirement benefits, depreciation rates and taxes. Due to timing and otherdifferences
 in the collection of revenues, these authoritative accounting principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by a non-regulatedentity,
 to be deferred as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates. Conversely, the principles require the creation of aregulatory
 liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future, or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and arerefundable to customers.
For
 each regulatory jurisdiction where the Company conducts business, the Company assesses, at the end of each reporting period, whether the regulatoryassets
 continue  to  meet  the  criteria  for  probable  future  recovery  and  regulatory  liabilities  continue  to  meet  the  criteria  for  probable  future  settlement.  Thisassessment
 includes consideration of factors such as changes in regulatory environments, recent rate orders (including recent rate orders on recovery of a specificor
 similar incurred cost to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction) and the status of any pending or potential legislation. If subsequent events indicate thatthe regulatory
 assets or liabilities no longer meet the criteria for probable future recovery or probable future settlement, the Company’s Consolidated Statements ofOperations
 and financial position could be materially affected. In addition, if the Company concludes in a future period that a separable portion of the business nolonger
 meets the criteria, the Company is required to eliminate the financial statement effects of regulation for that part of the business, which would include theelimination
 of  any  or  all  regulatory  assets  and  liabilities  that  had  been  recorded  in  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  Failure  to  meet  the  criteria  of  thisauthoritative guidanc
e could materially impact the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.As
 of December  31, 2020 and 2019, the Company’s regulatory  asset  balance  was $1.1 billion  and $1.1 billion,  respectively,  and its regulatory  liabilitybalance
 was $1.8 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. See Note 4—Regulatory Matters in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further informationregarding the Company’s signif
icant regulatory assets and liabilities..Accounting for Income Taxes
Significant
 management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken,as well as deferred tax 
assets and liabilities, valuation allowances and the utilization of NOL carryforwards.In
 accordance with applicable authoritative guidance, the Company accounts for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with atwo-step
 approach, including a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greaterthan
 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not more-likely-than-not that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technicalmerits,
 no  benefit  is  recorded.  Uncertain  tax  positions  that  relate  only  to  timing  of  when  an  item  is  included  on  a  tax  return  are  considered  to  have  met  therecognition
 threshold. Management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position, assuming the positionwill
 be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognitionthreshold has been met and, i
f so, the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefit to be recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements.The Company evaluates the probab
ility of realizing deferred tax assets quarterly by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and its intent and ability toimplement
 tax planning strategies, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. The Company also assesses its ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in theform
 of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. The Company records valuation allowances for deferred taxassets when it concludes that 
it is more-likely-than-not such benefit will not be realized in future periods.71

Table of ContentsUnder
 GAAP,  specifically  Accounting  Standards  Codification  Topic  740, Income  Taxes (“ASC  740”),  the  tax  effects  of  changes  in  tax  laws  must  berecognized
 in the period in which the law is enacted. ASC 740 also requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected toapply
 when temporary differences are to be realized or settled. Thus, at the date of enactment of the TCJA, the Company’s deferred taxes were re-measured basedupon
 the new tax rate. For the Company’s regulated entities, the change in deferred taxes are recorded as either an offset to a regulatory asset or liability and maybe
 subject to refund to customers. For the Company’s unregulated operations, the change in deferred taxes are recorded as a non-cash re-measurement adjustmentto earnings.
Actual
 income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, the Company’sforecasted
 financial  condition  and results  of operations,  failure  to successfully  implement  tax planning  strategies  and recovery  of taxes  through the regulatoryprocess
 for  the  Regulated  Businesses,  as  well  as  results  of  audits  and  examinations  of  filed  tax  returns  by  taxing  authorities.  The  resulting  tax  balances  as  ofDecember
 31,  2020  and  2019  are  appropriately  accounted  for  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  authoritative  guidance;  however,  the  ultimate  outcome  of  taxmatters
 could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the Consolidated Financial Statements and such adjustments could be material. See Note 15—Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolid
ated Financial Statements for additional information regarding income taxes.Accounting for Pension and Postretirement Benefits
The
 Company maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of its regulated utility and shared service operations.See
 Note 16—Employee Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the description of and accounting for thedefined benefit pension pl
ans and postretirement benefit plans.The Company’s
 pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions providedby
 the Company to its actuaries, including the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Material changes in the Company’s pension andpostretirement
 benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets. The assumptions are selected torepresent
 the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overalleconomy.
 These differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the Company recognizes. The primary assumptionsare:
•
Discount Rate—The  discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which are based on projections of benefit payments to be madein
 the future. The objective in selecting the discount rate is to measure the single amount that, if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio ofhigh-quality debt instrum
ents, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due.•
Expected  Return  on  Plan  Assets  (“EROA”)—Management  projects  the  future  return  on  plan  assets  considering  prior  performance,  but  primarilybased
 upon the plans’ mix of assets and expectations for the long-term returns on those asset classes. These projected returns reduce the net benefitcosts the Company records curr
ently.•
Rate  of  Compensation  Increase—Management  projects  employees’  pay  increases,  which  are  used  to  project  employees’  pension  benefits  atretirement.
•
Health Care Cost Trend Rate—Manage ment projects the expected increases in the cost of health care.•
Mortality—  Management adopted the Society of Actuaries Pri-2012 mortality base table, the most recent table developed from private pension planexperience, which provides rates of mortality in 2012 and adopted the new MP-202
0 mortality improvement scale to gradually adjust future mortalityrates downward due to increased 
longevity in each year after 2012.The discount rate
 assumption, which is determined for the pension and postretirement benefit plans independently, is subject to change each year, consistentwith
 changes  in  applicable  high-quality,  long-term  corporate  bond  indices.  The  Company  uses  an  approach  that  approximates  the  process  of  settlement  ofobligations
 tailored to the plans’ expected cash flows by matching the plans’ cash flows to the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selectedbonds.
 For each plan, the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would yield the same present value as using spot rates aligned with theprojected
 benefit payments. The discount rate for determining pension benefit obligations was 2.74%, 3.44% and 4.38% at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018,respectively.
 The  discount  rate  for  determining  other  postretirement  benefit  obligations  was  2.56%,  3.36%  and  4.32%  at  December  31,  2020,  2019  and  2018,respectively.
In
 selecting an EROA, the Company considered tax implications, past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans.The
 long-term  EROA  assumption  used  in  calculating  pension  cost  was  6.50%  for  2020,  6.20%  for  2019,  and  5.95%  for  2018.  The  weighted  average  EROAassumption used in calcula
ting other postretirement benefit costs was 3.68% for 2020, 3.56% for 2019 and 4.77% for 2018.72

ing Plan ChangesOn
 July  31,  2018,  a  five-year  national  benefits  agreement  was  ratified,  covering,  as  of  July  31,  2018,  approximately  3,200  of  the  Company’s  union-represented
 employees. Most of the benefits under this new agreement became effective on January 1, 2019, and include, among other things, union-representedemployees’
 participation in the Company’s cash-based annual performance plan, additional medical plan options and changes to certain retiree medical benefits,which required the Company to re
measure its other postretirement benefit plan obligation during the third quarter of 2018.For
 those eligible union retirees and dependents over age 65, the current supplemental retiree medical plan will be replaced with a Health ReimbursementArrangement
 (“HRA”) similar to the cap currently in place for non-union retirees. The Company is providing a subsidy allowing the post-65 retirees to purchase aMedicare
 supplemental plan on a private exchange network. The pre-65 coverage plan was also amended to provide a cap on future employer costs designed tolimit
 the employer costs to 2018 levels. For pre-65 union members retiring early in 2019-2021 a supplemental benefit will be provided to alleviate the effect of thecap.
On
 August  31,  2018,  the  Postretirement  Medical  Benefit  Plan  was  remeasured  to  reflect  this  plan  change.  The  plan  change  resulted  in  a  $175  millionreduction
 in future benefits payable to plan participants,  and, in combination with other experience reflected as of the remeasurement  date, resulted in a $227million
 reduction to the net accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining amortization period of the impact of the planamendment
 is 7.9 years. As a result of the remeasurement and change in funded status, the Company decreased the investment risk in the plan and reduced itsexposure to
 changes in interest rates by matching the assets of the plan to the projected cash flows for future benefit payments of the liability. Plan assets in excessof those securities desi
gned to match the long-term liabilities are invested in shorter duration fixed income securities and equities.Presented in the table be

The
 investments  of  the  pension  and  postretirement  welfare  plan  trusts  include  debt  and  equity  securities  held  either  directly  or  through  mutual  funds,commingled funds and limited
 partnerships. The trustee for the Company’s defined benefit pension and postretirement welfare plans uses an independent valuationfirm to calculate the fair value of
 plan assets.In
 selecting  a  rate  of  compensation  increase,  the  Company  considers  past  experience  in  light  of  movements  in  inflation  rates.  The  Company’s  rate  ofcompensation increase was 3.51
% for 2020, 2.97% for 2019 and 3.00% for 2018.In
 selecting health care cost trend rates, the Company considers past performance and forecasts of increases in health care costs. As of January 1, 2020,  the Company’s health
 care cost trend rate assumption used to calculate the periodic cost was 6.50% in 2020 gradually declining to 5.00% in 2026 and thereafter. As ofDecember 31, 2020, the Company projec
ts that medical inflation will be 6.25% in 2021 gradually declining to 5.00% in 2026 and thereafter.73

Table of ContentsThe
 Company will use a discount rate and EROA of 2.74% and 6.50%, respectively, for estimating its 2021 pension costs. Additionally, the Company willuse
 a discount rate and expected blended return based on weighted assets of 2.56% and 3.68%, respectively, for estimating its 2021 other postretirement benefitcosts.
 A decrease in the discount rate or the EROA would increase the Company’s pension expense. The Company’s 2020 pension and postretirement benefitcredit
 was $14 million and the 2019 pension and postretirement benefit cost was $17 million. The Company expects to make pension contributions to the plantrusts
 of $37 million in 2021, and $37 million, $35 million, $33 million and $30 million in 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively. Actual amounts contributedcould
 change significantly from these estimates. The assumptions are reviewed annually and at any interim re-measurement of the plan obligations. The impact ofassumption
 changes is reflected in the recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts as they occur, or over a period of time if allowed under applicableaccounting standards.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue
 from the Company’s Regulated Businesses is generated  primarily  from water and wastewater  services  delivered  to customers.  These contractscontain
 a single performance obligation, the delivery of water or wastewater services, as the promise to transfer the individual good or service is not separatelyidentifiable
 from  other  promises  within  the  contracts  and,  therefore,  is  not  distinct.  Revenues  are  recognized  over  time,  as  services  are  provided.  There  aregenerally
 no significant financing components or variable consideration. Revenues include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis, and unbilled amountscalculated
 based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill, to the end of the accounting period. The amountsthat
 the Company has a right to invoice are determined by each customer’s actual usage, an indicator that the invoice amount corresponds directly to the valuetransferred to the customer.
Increases
 or decreases  in the volumes  delivered  to  customers  and rate  mix due  to changes  in usage patterns  in customer  classes  in the  period  could besignificant to the ca
lculation of unbilled revenue. In addition, changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled foreach
 meter reading date would also have an effect on the unbilled revenue calculation. Unbilled revenue for the Company’s regulated utilities as of December 31,2020 and 2019 was $150 million and $142 million, 
respectively.The
 Company also recognizes  revenue when it is probable  that  future recovery  of previously incurred  costs or future  refunds  that are  to be credited  tocustomers will occur through 
the ratemaking process.Revenue
 from  the  Company’s  Homeowner  Services  Group  is  generated  through  various  protection  programs  in  which  the  Company  provides  fixed  feeservices
 to domestic homeowners and smaller commercial customers for interior and exterior water and sewer lines, interior electric and gas lines, heating andcooling
 systems,  water  heaters,  power  surge  protection  and  other  related  services.  Most  of  the  contracts  have  a  one-year  term  and  each  service  is  a  separateperformance
 obligation, satisfied over time, as the customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided from the service. Customers are obligatedto
 pay for the protection programs ratably over 12 months or via a one-time, annual fee, with revenues recognized ratably over time for these services. Advancesfrom customers are deferred u
ntil the performance obligation is satisfied.The
 Company also has long-term, fixed fee contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems for the U.S. government on various militaryinstallations and facilities owned by municipal customers
. Billing and revenue recognition for the fixed fee revenues occurs ratably over the term of the contract, ascustomers
 simultaneously  receive  and  consume  the  benefits  provided  by  the  Company.  Additionally,  these  contracts  allow  the  Company  to  make  capitalimprovements
 to underlying infrastructure, which are initiated through separate modifications or amendments to the original contract, whereby stand-alone, fixedpricing
 is  separately  stated  for  each  improvement.  The  Company  has  determined  that  these  capital  improvements  are  separate  performance  obligations,  withrevenue
 recognized over time based on performance completed at the end of each reporting period. Losses on contracts are recognized during the period in whichthe
 losses first become probable and estimable. Revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded as unbilledrevenues, with
 billings in excess of revenues recorded as other current liabilities until the recognition criteria are met. Changes in contract performance and relatedestimated
 contract profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues, and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined. Unbilled revenuefor the Market-Based Businesses 
as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $56 million and $30 million, respectively.74

Table of ContentsAccounting for Contingencies
The
 Company records loss contingencies when management determines that the outcome of future events is probable of occurring and when the amount ofthe
 loss or a range of losses can be reasonably estimated. The determination of a loss contingency is based on management’s judgment and estimates about thelikely
 outcome of the matter, which may include an analysis of different scenarios. Liabilities are recorded or adjusted when events or circumstances cause thesejudgments or estimates 
to change. In assessing whether a loss is reasonably possible, management considers many factors, which include, but are not limited to: thenature
 of the litigation, claim  or assessment, review of applicable law, opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisors, and the experience  gained fromsimilar cases or situ
ations. The Company provides disclosures for material contingencies when management deems there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or anadditional
 loss may be incurred. The Company provides estimates of reasonably possible losses when such estimates may be reasonably determined, either as asingle amount or within a re
asonable range.Actual
 amounts realized upon settlement or other resolution of loss contingencies may be different than amounts recorded and disclosed and could have asignificant
 impact on the liabilities, revenue and expenses recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 17—Commitments and Contingencies inthe Notes to Consolidated Financia
l Statements for additional information regarding contingencies.New Accounting Standards
See Note 2—Significant Accounting Poli
cies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recent accounting standards.ITEM 7A.    QUANT
ITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThe
 Company is exposed to market risk associated with changes in commodity prices, equity prices and interest rates. The Company is exposed to risksfrom
 changes in interest rates as a result of its issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper. The Company manages its interest rate exposure bylimiting
 its  variable  rate  exposure  and  by  monitoring  the  effects  of  market  changes  in  interest  rates.  The  Company  also  has  the  ability  to  enter  into  financialderivative
 instruments, which could include instruments such as, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, forward starting swaps, swaptions and U.S. Treasury lockagreements
 to  manage  and  mitigate  interest  rate  risk  exposure.  As  of  December  31,  2020,  a  hypothetical  increase  of  interest  rates  by  1%  associated  with  theCompany’s short-term borrowings would r
esult in a $6 million increase in short-term interest expense.The
 Company’s risks associated with price increases for chemicals, electricity and other commodities are reduced through contractual arrangements and theexpected
 ability to recover price increases through rates, in the next general rate case proceeding or other regulatory mechanism, as authorized by each regulatoryjurisdiction.
 Non-performance by these commodity suppliers could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position andcash flows.
The
 market price of the Company’s common stock may experience fluctuations, which may be unrelated to its operating performance. In particular, theCompany’s
 stock price may be affected by general market movements as well as developments specifically related to the water and wastewater industry. Thesecould
 include,  among  other  things,  interest  rate  movements,  quarterly  variations  or  changes  in  financial  estimates  by  securities  analysts  and  governmental  orregulatory
 actions. This volatility may make it difficult for the Company to access the capital markets in the future through additional offerings of its commonstock or other equity securities, regardless
 of its financial performance, and such difficulty may preclude the Company from being able to take advantage of certainbusiness opportunities or mee
t business obligations.The
 Company is exposed to credit risk through its water, wastewater and other water-related services provided by the Regulated Businesses and Market-Based Businesses. The Company’s Regulated Businesses serve
 residential, commercial, industrial and other customers, while the Market-Based Businesses engagein
 business activities with developers, government entities and other customers. The Company’s primary credit risk is exposure to customer default on contractualobligations
 and the associated loss that may be incurred due to the non-payment of customer accounts receivable balances. The Company’s credit risk is managedthrough
 established credit and collection policies which are in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and involve monitoring of customer exposureand
 the  use  of  credit  risk  mitigation  measures  such  as  letters  of  credit  or  prepayment  arrangements.  The  Company’s  credit  portfolio  is  diversified  with  nosignificant
 customer  or  industry  concentrations.  In  addition,  the  Regulated  Businesses  are  generally  able  to  recover  all  prudently  incurred  costs  includinguncollectible custom
er accounts receivable expenses and collection costs through rates.75

Table of ContentsThe Company’s retirement
 trust assets are exposed to the market prices of debt and equity securities. Changes to the retirement trust asset values can impactthe
 Company’s  pension  and  other  benefits  expense,  funded  status  and  future  minimum  funding  requirements.  Changes  in  interest  rates  can  impact  retirementliabilities.
 The Company aims to reduce risk through asset diversification and by investing in long duration fixed-income securities that have a duration similar tothat
 of  its  pension  liabilities,  seeking  to  hedge  some  of  the  interest  rate  sensitivity  of  its  liabilities.  That  way,  if  interest  rates  fall  and  liabilities  increase,  theCompany expects
 that the fixed-income assets in its retirement trust will also increase in value. The Company also expects its risk to be reduced through its abilityto recover pension and other b
enefit costs through rates.The
 Company is also exposed to a potential national economic recession or deterioration in local economic conditions in the markets in which it operates.The
 credit quality of the Company’s customer accounts receivable is dependent on the economy and the ability of its customers to manage through unfavorableeconomic
 cycles  and  other  market  changes.  In  addition,  there  can  be  no  assurances  that  regulators  will  grant  sufficient  rate  authorizations.  Therefore,  theCompany’s
 ability  to  fully  recover  operating  expense,  recover  its  investment  and  provide  an  appropriate  return  on  invested  capital  made  in  the  RegulatedBusinesses may be adversely imp
acted.76

Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareho
lders ofAmerican Water Works Comp
any, Inc.Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We
 have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of  American  Water  Works  Company,  Inc.  and  its  subsidiaries (the  “Company”)  as  ofDecember
 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity and cash flows foreach
 of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). Wealso
 have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal  Control - IntegratedFramework
 (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).In
 our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as ofDecember
 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformitywith
 accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effectiveinternal
 control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal  Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by theCOSO.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note
 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019.Basis for Opinions
The
 Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,and
 for  its  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  Management's  Report  on  Internal  Control  over  FinancialReporting
 appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internalcontrol
 over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (UnitedStates)
 (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules andregulations of the Securi
ties and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We
 conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonableassurance
 about  whether  the consolidated financial  statements  are  free  of  material  misstatement,  whether  due  to  error  or  fraud,  and  whether  effective  internalcontrol over financial reporti
ng was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated
 financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financialstatements,
 whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidenceregarding
 the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significantestimates
 made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financialreporting
 included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists,  and  testing  andevaluating
 the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as weconsidered necessary in th
e circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Repor
tingA
 company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reportingand
 the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control overfinancial
 reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions
 and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation offinancial
 statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made  only  inaccordance
 with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, us
e, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.78

Table of ContentsBecause
 of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness
 to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate.Critical Audit Matters
The
 critical  audit  matter  communicated  below  is  a  matter  arising  from  the  current  period  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  that  wascommunicated
 or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financialstatements
 and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any wayour
 opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separateopinion on the critical 
audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Accounting for the Effects o
f Rate RegulationAs
 described in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated regulatory assets and liabilities balances were $1,127million
 and $1,770  million,  respectively,  as  of  December  31,  2020.  The  Company’s  regulated  utilities  are  subject  to  regulation  by  multiple  state  utilitycommissions
 and the Company follows authoritative accounting principles required for rate regulated utilities, which requires the effects of rate regulation to bereflected in the Company
’s consolidated financial statements. As disclosed by management, for each regulatory jurisdiction where the Company conducts business,management
 assesses, at the end of each reporting period, whether the regulatory assets continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery and regulatoryliabilities
 continue  to  meet  the  criteria  for  probable  future  settlement.  This  assessment  includes  consideration  of  factors  such  as  changes  in  regulatoryenvironments,
 recent rate orders (including  recent rate orders on recovery of a specific or similar incurred cost to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction)and the status of any pending or pot
ential legislation.The
 principal  considerations  for  our  determination  that  performing  procedures  relating  to  accounting  for  the effects  of  rate  regulation  is a  critical  auditmatter
 are the significant judgment by management in accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities relative to whether regulatory assets continue to meet thecriteria
 for  probable  future  recovery  and  regulatory  liabilities  continue  to  meet  the  criteria  for  probable  future  settlement  as  a  result  of  changes  in  regulatoryenvironments, recent rate orders, and the status of any pendin
g or potential legislation. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effortin performing audit proce
dures and evaluating audit evidence obtained relating to management’s judgments.Addressing
 the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidatedfinancial
 statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company’s regulatory accounting process, including controlsover
 management’s assessment and consideration of factors related to the probability of future recovery or settlement. These procedures also included, amongothers,
 evaluating the reasonableness of management’s judgments regarding the probability of recovery and settlement based on the Company’s correspondencewith
 regulators, status of regulatory proceedings, past practices, and other relevant information; evaluating the related accounting and disclosure implications; andevaluating
 regulatory  assets  and  liabilities  balances  based  on  provisions  and  formulas  outlined  in  rate  orders  and  other  correspondence  with  the  Company’sregulators.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unless otherwise noted, in mil
lions, except per share data)Note 1: Organization and Operation
American
 Water  Works  Company,  Inc.  (the  “Company”  or  “American  Water”)  is  a  holding  company  for  regulated  and  market-based  subsidiariesthroughout
 the United States. References to “parent company” mean American Water Works Company, Inc., without its subsidiaries. The Company’s primarybusiness
 involves the ownership of regulated utilities that provide water and wastewater services in 16 states in the United States, collectively referred to as the“Regulated
 Businesses.”  The  Company  also  operates  market-based  businesses  that  provide  water  and  wastewater  services  within  non-reportable  operatingsegments,
 collectively referred to as the “Market-Based Businesses.” The Company’s primary Market-Based Businesses include the Homeowner Services Group(“HOS”), which provides various warranty p
rotection programs and other home services to residential customers; and the Military Services Group (“MSG”), whichenters into long-term 
contracts with the U.S. government to provide water and wastewater services on various military installations.Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies
Regulation
The
 Company’s regulated utilities are subject to regulation by multiple state utility commissions or other entities engaged in utility regulation, collectivelyreferred
 to as Public Utility Commissions (“PUCs”). As such, the Company follows authoritative accounting principles required for rate regulated utilities, whichrequires
 the effects of rate regulation to be reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. PUCs generally authorize revenue at levels intended torecover
 the estimated costs of providing service, plus a return on net investments, or rate base. Regulators may also approve accounting treatments, long-termfinancing
 programs  and  cost  of  capital,  operation  and  maintenance  (“O&M”)  expenses,  capital  expenditures,  taxes,  affiliated  transactions  and  relationships,reorganizations, mergers,
 acquisitions and dispositions, along with imposing certain penalties or granting certain incentives. Due to timing and other differences inthe
 collection of a regulated utility’s revenues, these authoritative accounting principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by a non-regulated
 entity, to be deferred as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates. Conversely, these principles also require thecreation
 of  a  regulatory  liability  for  amounts  collected  in  rates  to  recover  costs  expected  to  be  incurred  in  the  future,  or  amounts  collected  in  excess  of  costsincurred and are refund
able to customers. See Note 4—Regulatory Matters for additional information.Use of Estimates
The
 preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  (“GAAP”)  requires  thatmanagement
 make estimates, assumptions and judgments that could affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Actual resultscould
 differ from these estimates, assumptions and judgments. The Company considers its critical accounting estimates to include (i) the application of regulatoryaccounting
 principles  and  the  related  determination  and  estimation  of  regulatory  assets  and  liabilities,  (ii)  revenue  recognition  and  the  estimates  used  in  thecalculation
 of  unbilled  revenue,  (iii)  accounting  for  income  taxes,  (iv)  benefit  plan  assumptions  and  (v)  the  estimates  and  judgments  used  in  determining  losscontingencies. The Company’s critical
 accounting estimates that are particularly sensitive to change in the near term are amounts reported for regulatory assets andliabilities, incom
e taxes, benefit plan assumptions and contingency-related obligations.Principles of Consolidation
The
 accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of American Water and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest ismaintained after the elimination of
 intercompany balances and transactions.Property, Plant and Equipment
Property,
 plant and equipment consists primarily of utility plant utilized by the Company’s regulated utilities. Additions to utility plant and replacement ofretirement
 units of utility plant are capitalized and include costs such as materials, direct labor, payroll taxes and benefits, indirect items such as engineering andsupervision, transportation
 and an allowance for funds used during construction (“AFUDC”). Costs for repair, maintenance and minor replacements are charged toO&M expense as incurred.
The cost of utility plant is depreciated using the straight-line average remaining life, group method. The Company’
s regulated utilities record depreciation inconformity
 with amounts approved by PUCs, after regulatory review of the information the Company submits to support its estimates of the assets’ remaininguseful lives.
86

Table of ContentsNonutility
 property consists primarily of buildings and equipment utilized by the Company’s Market-Based Businesses and for internal operations. Thisproperty is stated at cos
t, net of accumulated depreciation, which is calculated using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets.When
 units of property, plant and equipment are replaced, retired or abandoned, the carrying value is credited against the asset and charged to accumulateddepreciation.
 To the extent the Company recovers cost of removal or other retirement costs through rates after the retirement costs are incurred, a regulatory assetis
 recorded. In some cases, the Company recovers retirement costs through rates during the life of the associated asset and before the costs are incurred. Theseamounts
 result in a regulatory liability being reported based on the amounts previously recovered through customer rates, until the costs to retire those assets areincurred.
The
 costs incurred to acquire and internally develop computer software for internal use are capitalized as a unit of property. The carrying value of thesecosts amounted to $360 million 
and $345 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.Cash and Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Funds
Substantially
 all cash is invested in interest-bearing accounts. All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased areconsidered to be cash equiva
lents.Restricted
 funds consist primarily of proceeds from financings for the construction and capital improvement of facilities, and deposits for future servicesunder O&M
 projects. Proceeds are held in escrow or interest-bearing accounts until the designated expenditures are incurred. Restricted funds are classified on theConsolidated Balance Sheets as e
ither current or long-term based upon the intended use of the funds.Presented
 in the table below is a reconciliation of the cash and cash equivalents and restricted funds amounts as presented on the Consolidated BalanceSheets to the sum of such amounts pr
esented on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31: 
2020 2019 Cash and cash equivalents
$ 547 $ 60 Restricted funds
29 31 Cash and cash equivalents and res
tricted funds as presented on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows$ 576 $ 91 Accounts Receivable and Unbilled Revenues
Accounts receivable
 include regulated utility customer accounts receivable, which represent amounts billed to water and wastewater customers generally ona
 monthly basis. Credit is extended based on the guidelines of the applicable PUCs and collateral is generally not required. Also included are market-based tradeaccounts
 receivable and nonutility customer receivables of the regulated subsidiaries. Unbilled revenues are accrued when service has been provided but has notbeen billed to customers 
and when costs exceed billings on market-based construction contracts.Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts
Allowances
 for  uncollectible  accounts  are  maintained  for  estimated  probable  losses  resulting  from  the  Company’s  inability  to  collect  receivables  fromcustomers.
 Accounts that are outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due. A number of factors are considered in determining the allowancefor uncollectible
 accounts, including the length of time receivables are past due, previous loss history, current economic and societal conditions and reasonable andsupportable
 forecasts that affect the collectability of receivables from customers. The Company generally writes off accounts when they become uncollectible orare
 over  a  certain  number  of  days  outstanding.  An  increase  in  the  allowance  for  uncollectible  accounts  for  the  period  ending  December  31,  2020  reflects  theimpacts
 from the current novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, including an increase in uncollectible accounts expense and a reduction in amounts writtenoff due to shutoff morator
ia in place across the Company’s subsidiaries. See Note 8—Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts for additional information.Materials and Supplies
Materials and supplies a
re stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the average cost method.87

Table of ContentsLeases
On
 January  1,  2019,  the  Company  adopted  Accounting  Standards  Update 2016-02, Leases  (Topic  842),  and all  related  amendments  (collectively,  the“Standard”).
 The Company implemented the guidance in the Standard using the modified retrospective approach and applied the optional transition method, whichallowed
 entities to apply the new Standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in theperiod of adoption. Under this approac
h, prior periods have not been restated and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.The
 Standard includes practical expedients, which relate to the identification and classification of leases that commenced before the adoption date, initial directcosts
 for leases that commenced before the adoption date, the ability to use hindsight in evaluating lessee options to extend or terminate a lease or to purchase theunderlying asset and the abi
lity to carry forward accounting treatment for existing land easements.Adoption
 of the Standard resulted in the recognition of operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities as of January 1, 2019 ofapproximately $117 million and $115
 million, respectively. The difference between the ROU assets and operating lease liabilities was recorded as an adjustment toretained earnings. The Stand
ard did not materially impact the Company’s consolidated results of operations and had no impact on cash flows.The Company has operating and finan
ce leases involving real property, including facilities, utility assets, vehicles, and equipment. The Company determinesif
 an arrangement  is a lease at inception.  Operating leases are included in operating  lease ROU assets, accrued liabilities  and operating lease liabilities  on theConsolidated
 Balance Sheets. Finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the ConsolidatedBalance Sheets. The Company has made 
an accounting policy election not to include operating leases with a lease term of twelve months or less.ROU
 assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and the lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arisingfrom
 the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are generally recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of discounted lease payments overthe
 lease  term.  As  most  of  the  Company’s  leases  do  not  provide  an  implicit  rate,  the  Company  uses  its  incremental  borrowing  rate  based  on  the  informationavailable
 at the commencement date in determining the present value of discounted lease payments. The implicit rate is used when readily determinable. ROUassets
 also include any upfront lease payments and excludes lease incentives. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the leasewhen it is reasonably cert
ain that the option will be exercised. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.The
 Company  has  lease  agreements  with  lease  components  (e.g.,  fixed  payments  including  rent,  real  estate  taxes  and  insurance  costs)  and  non-leasecomponents
 (e.g., common-area maintenance costs), which are generally accounted for separately; however, the Company accounts for the lease and non-leasecomponents
 as  a  single  lease  component  for  certain  leases.  Certain  lease  agreements  include  variable  rental  payments  adjusted  periodically  for  inflation.Additionally,
 the Company applies a portfolio approach to effectively account for the ROU assets and lease liabilities. The Company’s lease agreements do notcontain any material residual 
value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.Goodwill
Goodwill
 represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of abusiness.
 Goodwill is not amortized and must be allocated at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below, and tested forimpairment
 at least annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reportingunit below its carrying valu
e.The
 Company’s goodwill is primarily associated with (i) the acquisition of American Water by an affiliate of the Company’s previous owner in 2003, (ii)the
 acquisition  of  E’town  Corporation  by  a  predecessor  to  the  Company’s  previous  owner  in  2001,  and  (iii)  the  acquisition  of  Pivotal  in  2018;  and  has  beenallocated
 to reporting units based on the fair values at the date of the acquisitions. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, the reporting units in theRegulated Businesses segment ar
e aggregated into a single reporting unit. The Market-Based Businesses is comprised of the HOS and MSG reporting units.The
 Company’s annual impairment testing is performed as of November 30 of each year, in conjunction with the completion of the Company’s annualbusiness
 plan. The Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether quantitative testing is necessary. If it is determined, based upon qualitative factors,that
 the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not, greater than its carrying value, no further testing is required. If the Company bypasses thequalitative
 assessment, or performs the qualitative assessment and determines that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not, less than itscarrying
 value, a quantitative, fair value-based test is performed. This quantitative testing compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its respectivenet
 carrying value, including goodwill, on the measurement date. An impairment loss will be recognized in the amount equal to the excess of the reporting unit’scarrying value compared to
 its estimated fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.88

Table of ContentsApplication
 of goodwill impairment testing requires management judgment, including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value ofreporting
 units. Management estimates fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis. Significant assumptions used in these fair value estimations include, butare not limited to, fo
recasts of future operating results, discount and growth rates.The
 Company believes the assumptions and other considerations used to value goodwill to be appropriate, however, if actual experience differs from theassumptions and
 considerations used in its analysis, the resulting change could have a material adverse impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note9—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets fo
r additional information.Intangible Assets
Intangible
 assets consist primarily of finite-lived customer relationships associated with the acquisition of Pivotal. Finite-lived intangible assets are initiallymeasured
 at their estimated fair values, and are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangibleassets are consumed or othe
rwise used. See Note 9—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for additional information.Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived
 assets include property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets and long-term investments. The Company evaluates long-lived assetsfor
 impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. When such indicators arise, the Company estimates the fairvalue of
 the long-lived asset from future cash flows expected to result from its use and, if applicable, the eventual disposition of the asset, comparing the estimatedfair
 value to the carrying value of the asset. An impairment loss will be recognized in the amount equal to the excess of the long-lived asset’s carrying valuecompared to its estim
ated fair value.The
 long-lived assets of the Company’s regulated utilities are grouped on a separate entity basis for impairment testing, as they are integrated state-wideoperations that
 do not have the option to curtail service and generally have uniform tariffs. A regulatory asset is charged to earnings if and when future recovery inrates of that asset is no 
longer probable.The Company believes the assumpt
ions and other considerations used to value long-lived assets to be appropriate, however, if actual experience differs fromthe assumptions and considera
tions used in its estimates, the resulting change could have a material adverse impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.Advances for Construction and Contributions in Aid of Construction
Regulated
 utility subsidiaries may receive advances for construction and contributions in aid of construction from customers, home builders and real estatedevelopers to fund construct
ion necessary to extend service to new areas.Advances
 are refundable for limited periods of time as new customers begin to receive service or other contractual obligations are fulfilled. Included inother
 current liabilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are estimated refunds of $23 million and $25 million, respectively.Those amounts represent expe
cted refunds during the next 12-month period.Advances
 that are no longer refundable are reclassified to contributions. Contributions are permanent collections of plant assets or cash for a particularconstruction
 project. For ratemaking purposes, the amount of such contributions generally serves as a rate base reduction since the contributions represent non-investor supplied funds.
Generally,
 the Company depreciates utility plant funded by contributions and amortizes its contributions balance as a reduction to depreciation expense,producing
 a result which is functionally equivalent to reducing the original cost of the utility plant for the contributions. In accordance with applicable regulatoryguidelines,
 some of  the Company’s utility  subsidiaries  do  not amortize  contributions,  and any  contribution  received  remains  on the  balance  sheet  indefinitely.Amortization
 of  contributions  in  aid  of  construction  was  $32  million,  $29  million  and  $28  million  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2020,  2019  and  2018,respectively.
Revenue Recognition
On
 January  1,  2018,  the  Company  adopted  Accounting  Standards  Codification  Topic  606, Revenue  From  Contracts  With  Customers, and  all  relatedamendments (collec
tively, “ASC 606”), using the modified retrospective approach, applied to contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018.89

Table of ContentsUnder ASC
 606, a performance obligation is a promise within a contract to transfer a distinct good or service, or a series of distinct goods and services, to acustomer.
 Revenue  is  recognized  when  performance  obligations  are  satisfied  and  the  customer  obtains  control  of  promised  goods  or  services.  The  amount  ofrevenue
 recognized  reflects  the  consideration  to  which  the  Company  expects  to  be  entitled  to  receive  in  exchange  for  goods  or  services.  Under  ASC  606,  acontract’s
 transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that the Company determinesare
 within  the  scope  of  ASC  606,  the  Company  performs  the  following  five  steps:  (i)  identifies  the  contracts  with  a  customer;  (ii)  identifies  the  performanceobligations
 within  the  contract,  including  whether  any  performance  obligations  are  distinct  and  capable  of  being  distinct  in  the  context  of  the  contract;  (iii)determines
 the transaction price; (iv) allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognizes revenue when, or as, theCompany satisfies each per
formance obligation.The
 Company’s revenues from contracts with customers are discussed below. Customer payments for contracts are generally due within 30 days of billingand
 none of the contracts with customers have payment terms that exceed one year; therefore, the Company elected to apply the significant financing componentpractical expedien
t and no amount of consideration has been allocated as a financing component.Regulated Businesses Revenue
Revenue
 from the Company’s Regulated Businesses is generated  primarily  from water and wastewater  services  delivered  to customers.  These contractscontain a
 single performance obligation, the delivery of water and/or wastewater services, as the promise to transfer the individual good or service is not separatelyidentifiable
 from  other  promises  within  the  contracts  and,  therefore,  is  not  distinct.  Revenues  are  recognized  over  time,  as  services  are  provided.  There  aregenerally
 no significant financing components or variable consideration. Revenues include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis and unbilled amountscalculated
 based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill, to the end of the accounting period. The amountsthat
 the Company has a right to invoice are determined by each customer’s actual usage, an indicator that the invoice amount corresponds directly to the valuetransferred to the customer. The
 Company also recognizes revenue when it is probable that future recovery of previously incurred costs or future refunds that are tobe credited to custome
rs will occur through the ratemaking process.Market-Based Businesses Revenue
Through
 various warranty protection programs and other home services, the Company provides fixed fee services to residential customers for interior andexterior
 water  and  sewer  lines,  interior  electric  and  gas  lines,  heating  and  cooling  systems,  water  heaters  and  other  home  appliances,  as  well  as  power  surgeprotection
 and other related services. Most of the contracts have a one-year term and each service is a separate performance obligation, satisfied over time, as thecustomers
 simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided from the service. Customers are obligated to pay for the protection programs ratably over 12months
 or via a one-time, annual fee, with revenues recognized ratably over time for these services. Advances from customers are deferred until the performanceobligation is satisfied.
The
 Company also has long-term, fixed fee contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems for the U.S. government on various militaryinstallations and facilities owned by municipal customers
. Billing and revenue recognition for the fixed fee revenues occurs ratably over the term of the contract, ascustomers
 simultaneously  receive  and  consume  the  benefits  provided  by  the  Company.  Additionally,  these  contracts  allow  the  Company  to  make  capitalimprovements
 to underlying infrastructure, which are initiated through separate modifications or amendments to the original contract, whereby stand-alone, fixedpricing
 is  separately  stated  for  each  improvement.  The  Company  has  determined  that  these  capital  improvements  are  separate  performance  obligations,  withrevenue
 recognized over time based on performance completed at the end of each reporting period. Losses on contracts are recognized during the period in whichthe
 losses first become probable and estimable. Revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded as unbilledrevenues, with
 billings in excess of revenues recorded as other current liabilities until the recognition criteria are met. Changes in contract performance and relatedestimated
 contract profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues, and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined. See Note 5—Revenue Recognition for addition
al information.Income Taxes
The
 Company and its subsidiaries participate in a consolidated federal income tax return for U.S. tax purposes. Members of the consolidated group arecharged with the amou
nt of federal income tax expense determined as if they filed separate returns.90

Table of ContentsCertain
 income and expense items are accounted for in different time periods for financial reporting than for income tax reporting purposes. The Companyprovides
 deferred  income  taxes  on  the  difference  between  the  tax  basis  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  the  amounts  at  which  they  are  carried  in  the  financialstatements.
 These deferred income taxes are based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these temporary differences are projected to reverse. Inaddition,
 the  regulated  utility  subsidiaries  recognize  regulatory  assets  and  liabilities  for  the  effect  on  revenues  expected  to  be  realized  as  the  tax  effects  oftemporary differen
ces, previously flowed through to customers, reverse.Investment tax
 credits have been deferred by the regulated utility subsidiaries and are being amortized to income over the average estimated service lives ofthe related assets.
The
 Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions as a component of income tax expense and accounts for sales tax collectedfrom customers and rem
itted to taxing authorities on a net basis. See Note 15—Income Taxes for additional information.Allowance for Funds Used During Construction
AFUDC
 is a non-cash credit to income with a corresponding charge to utility plant that represents the cost of borrowed funds or a return on equity fundsdevoted
 to plant under construction. The regulated utility subsidiaries record AFUDC to the extent permitted by the PUCs. The portion of AFUDC attributable toborrowed
 funds is shown as a reduction of interest, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Any portion of AFUDC attributable to equity funds wouldbe included in other, net on th
e Consolidated Statements of Operations. Presented in the table below is AFUDC for the years ended December 31: 
2020 2019 2018 Allowance for other funds used during 
construction$ 30 $ 28 $ 24 Allowance for borrowed funds used during cons
truction13 13 13 Environmental Costs
The
 Company’s water and wastewater operations and the operations of its Market-Based Businesses are subject to U.S. federal, state, local and foreignrequirements
 relating  to  environmental  protection,  and  as  such,  the  Company  periodically  becomes  subject  to  environmental  claims  in  the  normal  course  ofbusiness. Environmental expenditures that
 relate to current operations or provide a future benefit are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Remediation costs thatrelate
 to an existing condition caused by past operations are accrued, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that these costs will be incurred and can bereasonably
 estimated. A conservation agreement entered into by a subsidiary of the Company with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in 2010and
 amended in 2017 required the subsidiary to, among other provisions, implement certain measures to protect the steelhead trout and its habitat in the CarmelRiver
 watershed in the State of California. The subsidiary agreed to pay $1 million annually commencing in 2010 with the final payment being made in 2021.Remediation costs accru
ed amounted to $1 million and $2 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company uses derivative financial instruments for purpose
s of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates. These derivative contracts are enteredinto
 for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The Company does not enter intoderivative contrac
ts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments.All
 derivatives  are  recognized  on  the  balance  sheet  at  fair  value.  On  the  date  the  derivative  contract  is  entered  into,  the  Company  may  designate  thederivative as a hedge of the fair
 value of a recognized asset or liability (fair-value hedge) or a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows tobe received or paid related t
o a recognized asset or liability (cash-flow hedge).Changes in the fair value of
 a fair-value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the underlying hedged item, are recorded in current-period earnings. The gainsand
 losses on the effective portion of cash-flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows.Any ineffective portion of d
esignated cash-flow hedges is recognized in current-period earnings.Cash flows from derivative contracts are included in net cash provided by operating activitie
s on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. See Note 12—Long-Term Debt for additiona
l information.91

Measurement of Credit
Losses on Financial
Instruments 
Updated the accounting guidance on reporting credit losses forfinancial assets held at amortized cost basis and available-for-
sale debt securities. Under this guidance, expected credit losses
are required to be measured based on historical experience,
current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts
that affect the collectability of the reported amount of financial
assets. Also, this guidance requires that credit losses on
available-for-sale debt securities be presented as an allowance
rather than as a direct write-down.

the timing of transfers between levels, and the valuation
processes for Level 3 measurements. Disclosure of transfers
into and out of Level 3 measurements will be required. The
guidance adds disclosure requirements for the change in
unrealized gains and losses in other comprehensive income for
recurring Level 3 measurements, as well as the range and
weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to
develop Level 3 measurements.

The
 Company’s deferred pension expense includes a portion of the underfunded status that is probable of recovery through rates in future periods of $366million and
 $375 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The remaining portion is the pension expense in excess of the amount contributed to thepension plans which is deferred by 
certain subsidiaries and will be recovered in future service rates as contributions are made to the pension plan.Removal costs recoverabl

Table of ContentsIncome taxes recovered through rates relate
 to deferred taxes that will likely be refunded to the Company’s customers. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cutsand Jobs Act
 of 2017 (the “TCJA”) was signed into law, which, among other things, enacted significant and complex changes to the Code, including a reduction inthe
 federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as of January 1, 2018. The enactment of the TCJA required a re-measurement of the Company’s deferredincome
 taxes.  The portion  of  this  re-measurement  related  to  the  Regulated  Businesses  was  substantially  offset  by  a  regulatory  liability  as  excess  accumulateddeferred
 income taxes (“EADIT”) will be used to benefit its regulated customers in future rates. Nine of the Company’s regulated subsidiaries  are amortizingEADIT
 and  crediting  customers,  including  one  which  is  using  the  EADIT  to  offset  future  infrastructure  investments.  The  Company  expects  the  timing  of  theamortization of EADIT cred
its by the five remaining regulated subsidiaries to be addressed in pending or future rate cases or other proceedings.Removal
 costs recovered through rates are estimated costs to retire assets at the end of their expected useful lives that are recovered through customer ratesover the lives of the assoc
iated assets.On
 August 31, 2018, the Postretirement Medical Benefit Plan was remeasured to reflect an announced plan amendment which changed benefits for certainunion
 and non-union plan participants. As a result of the remeasurement, the Company recorded a $227 million reduction to the net accumulated postretirementbenefit obligation, with a 
corresponding regulatory liability.Other
 regulatory liabilities include the financial impacts relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, TCJA reserve on revenue, pension and other postretirementbenefit balancing ac
counts, legal settlement proceeds, deferred gains and various regulatory balancing accounts.Note 5: Revenue Recognition

Table of ContentsContract Balances
Contract
 assets and contract liabilities are the result of timing differences between revenue recognition, billings and cash collections. In the Company’sMarket-Based
 Businesses, certain contracts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals or uponachievement
 of  contractual  milestones.  Contract  assets  are  recorded  when  billing  occurs  subsequent  to  revenue  recognition  and  are  reclassified  to  accountsreceivable
 when  billed  and  the  right  to  consideration  becomes  unconditional.  Contract  liabilities  are  recorded  when  the  Company  receives  advances  fromcustomers
 prior to satisfying contractual performance obligations, particularly for construction contracts and home warranty protection program contracts, and arerecognized as revenue 
when the associated performance obligations are satisfied.Contract assets
 of $39 million, $13 million and $14 million are included in unbilled revenues on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020,2019
 and  2018,  respectively.  There  were  $60  million  of  contract  assets  added  during  2020,  and  $34  million  of  contract  assets  were  transferred  to  accountsreceivable
 during 2020. There were $27 million of contract assets added during 2019, and $28 million of contract assets were transferred to accounts receivableduring 2019.
Contract
 liabilities  of  $35  million,  $27  million  and  $20  million  are  included  in  other  current  liabilities  on  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets  as  ofDecember
 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. There were $120 million of contract liabilities added during 2020, and $112 million of contract liabilities wererecognized
 as revenue during 2020. There were $62 million of contract liabilities added during 2019, and $55 million of contract liabilities were recognized asrevenue during 2019.
Remaining Performance Obligations
Remaining
 performance obligations (“RPOs”) represent revenues the Company expects to recognize in the future from contracts that are in progress. TheCompany
 enters into agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the U.S. military, municipalities and other customers. As ofDecember 31,
 2020, the Company’s O&M and capital improvement contracts in the Market-Based Businesses have RPOs. Contracts with the U.S. government forwork on
 various military installations expire between 2051 and 2071 and have RPOs of $6.3 billion as of December 31, 2020, as measured by estimated remainingcontract
 revenue.  Such  contracts  are  subject  to  customary  termination  provisions  held  by  the  U.S.  government,  prior  to  the  agreed-upon  contract  expiration.Contracts
 with municipalities and commercial customers expire between 2021 and 2038 and have RPOs of $478 million as of December 31, 2020, as measured byestimated
 remaining contract revenue. Some of the Company’s long-term contracts to operate and maintain the federal government’s, a municipality’s or otherparty’s
 water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities include responsibility for certain maintenance for some of those facilities, in exchange for an annualfee. Unless specifically re
quired to perform certain maintenance activities, the maintenance costs are recognized when the maintenance is performed.Note 6: Acquisitions and Divestitures

Table of ContentsThe
 amortization  of  the  gain  (loss)  on  cash  flow  hedges  is  reclassified  to  net  income  during  the  period  incurred  and  is  included  in  interest,  net  in  theaccompanying Consolidated Stat
ements of Operations.Dividends and Distributions
The
 Company’s Board of Directors authorizes the payment of dividends. The Company’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock is subject to havingaccess
 to sufficient sources of liquidity, net income and cash flows of the Company’s subsidiaries, the receipt of dividends and direct and indirect distributionsfrom,
 and  repayments  of  indebtedness  of,  the  Company’s  subsidiaries,  compliance  with  Delaware  corporate  and  other  laws,  compliance  with  the  contractualprovisions of debt and other agr
eements and other factors.The
 Company’s dividend rate on its common stock is determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and takes into consideration, among otherfactors,
 current and possible future developments that may affect the Company’s income and cash flows. When dividends on common stock are declared, they aretypically
 paid  in  March,  June,  September  and  December.  Historically,  dividends  have  been  paid  quarterly  to  holders  of  record  less  than  30  days  prior  to  thedistribution date. Since th
e dividends on the Company’s common stock are not cumulative, only declared dividends are paid.During 2020, 2019 and 20
18, the Company paid $389 million, $353 million and $319 million in cash dividends, respectively. Presented in the table below isthe per share cash dividends p

f February 8, 2021.Under
 applicable law, the Company’s subsidiaries may pay dividends on their capital stock or other equity only from retained, undistributed or currentearnings.
 A significant loss recorded at a subsidiary may limit the amount of the dividend that the subsidiary can pay. The ability of the Company’s subsidiaries topay upstream
 dividends, make other upstream distributions or repay indebtedness to parent company or American Water Capital Corp. (“AWCC”), the Company’swholly
 owned financing subsidiary, as applicable, is subject to compliance with applicable corporate, tax and other laws, regulatory restrictions and financial andother
 contractual  obligations,  including,  for  example,  (i)  regulatory  capital,  surplus  or  net  worth  requirements,  (ii)  outstanding  debt  service  obligations,  (iii)requirements
 to make preferred and preference stock dividend payments, and (iv) other contractual agreements, covenants or obligations made or entered into bythe Company and its subsidiaries.
Regulatory Restrictions on Indebtedness
The
 issuance of long-term debt or equity securities by the Company or long-term debt by AWCC does not require authorization of any state PUC if noguarantee
 or pledge of the regulated subsidiaries is utilized. Based on the needs of the Regulated Businesses and parent company, AWCC may borrow funds orissue
 its  debt  in  the  capital  markets  and  then,  through  intercompany  loans,  provide  these  borrowings  to  the  Regulated  Businesses  or  parent  company.  PUCauthorization
 is generally required for the regulated subsidiaries to incur long-term debt. The Company’s regulated subsidiaries normally obtain these requiredPUC
 authorizations on a periodic basis to cover their anticipated financing needs for a period of time, or, as necessary, in connection with a specific financing orrefinancing of debt.
Note 11: Stock Based Compensation
The
 Company has granted stock options, stock units and dividend equivalents to non-employee directors, officers and other key employees of the Companypursuant
 to the terms of its 2007 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the “2007 Plan”). Stock units under the 2007 Plan generally vest based on (i) continuedemployment
 with the Company (“RSUs”), or (ii) continued employment with the Company where distribution of the shares is subject to the satisfaction in wholeor
 in part of stated performance-based goals (“PSUs”). The 2007 Plan has been replaced by the 2017 Omnibus Plan, as defined below, and no additional awardsmay
 be granted under the 2007 Plan. However, shares may still be issued under the 2007 Plan pursuant to the terms of awards previously issued under that planprior to May 12, 2017.

 May  2017,  the  Company’s  shareholders  approved  the  American  Water  Works  Company,  Inc.  2017  Omnibus  Equity  Compensation  Plan  (the  “2017Omnibus
 Plan”). The Company has granted stock units, including RSUs and PSUs, stock awards and dividend equivalents to non-employee directors, officers andemployees
 under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. A total of 7.2 million shares of common stock may be issued under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. As of December 31, 2020,6.7
 million shares were available for grant under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. The 2017 Omnibus Plan provides that grants of awards may be in any of the followingforms:
 incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock units, stock awards, other stock-based awards and dividend equivalents.Dividend equivalents may be gr
anted only on stock units or other stock-based awards. The 2017 Omnibus Plan expires in 2027.The
 cost of services received from employees in exchange for the issuance of stock options and restricted stock awards is measured based on the grant datefair
 value of the awards issued. The value of stock options and stock unit awards at the date of the grant is amortized through expense over the requisite serviceperiod.
 All awards granted in 2020, 2019 and 2018 are classified as equity. The Company recognizes compensation expense for stock awards over the vestingperiod of
 the award. The Company stratified its grant populations and used historic employee turnover rates to estimate employee forfeitures. The estimated rate iscompared
 to the actual forfeitures at the end of the reporting period and adjusted as necessary. There have been no significant adjustments to the forfeiture ratesduring 2020, 2019 and
 2018. There were no grants of stock options to employees after 2016, and the remaining stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2020were
 not material. Presented in the table below is the stock-based compensation expense recorded in O&M expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statementsof Operations for the years 
ended December 31:

 to limitations on deductibility imposed by the Federal income tax code, the Company receives a tax deduction based on the intrinsic value of theaward
 at the exercise date for stock options and the distribution date for stock units. For each award, throughout the requisite service period, the Company recordsthe
 tax impacts related to compensation costs as deferred income tax assets. The tax deductions in excess of the deferred benefits recorded throughout the requisiteservice period are r
ecorded to the Consolidated Statements of Operations and are presented in the financing section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.Stock Units
During
 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company granted RSUs to certain employees under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. RSUs generally vest based on continuedemployment with the Company over p
eriods ranging from one  to three years.During 2020,
 2019 and 2018, the Company granted stock units to non-employee directors under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. The stock units were vested in fullon
 the date of grant; however, distribution of the shares will be made within 30 days of the earlier of (i) 15 months after the date of the last annual meeting ofshareholders, subject to
 any deferral election by the director, or (ii) the participant’s separation from service. Because these stock units vested on the grant date, thetotal grant date fa
ir value was recorded in operation and maintenance expense on the grant date.The
 RSUs are valued at the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant and the majority vest ratably over a three -year service period. These RSUs are amortized 
through expense over the requisite service period using the straight-line method.105

Table of ContentsEmployee Stock Purchase Plan
The
 Company maintains a nonqualified employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) that expires in 2027 through which employee participants (other thanthe
 Company’s executive officers) may use payroll deductions to acquire Company common stock at a purchase price of 85% of the fair market value of thecommon
 stock at the end of a three-month purchase period. A total of 2.0 million shares may be issued under the ESPP, and as of December 31, 2020, there were1.7
 million shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP. The ESPP is considered compensatory. During the years ended December 31, 2020,2019 and 2018, the Company issued 86 thousand, 88 thousand and 95 thous

 April 14, 2020, AWCC completed a $1.0 billion debt offering which included the sale of $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.80% seniornotes due 2030
 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.45% senior notes due 2050. At the closing of the offering, AWCC received, after deduction ofunderwriting
 discounts and before deduction of offering expenses, net proceeds of $989 million. AWCC used the net proceeds of this offering: to (i) lend funds toparent
 company  and  its  regulated  subsidiaries;  (ii)  to  fund  sinking  fund  payments  for,  and  to  repay  at  maturity,  $28  million  in  aggregate  principal  amount  ofoutstanding
 long-term debt of AWCC and certain of the Company’s regulated subsidiaries; (iii) to repay AWCC’s commercial paper obligations and short-termindebtedness under AWCC’s $2.25 billion unsecu
red revolving credit facility; and (iv) for general corporate purposes.One
 of the principal market risks to which the Company is exposed is changes in interest rates. In order to manage the exposure, the Company follows riskmanagement
 policies  and  procedures,  including  the  use  of  derivative  contracts  such  as  swaps.  The  Company  reduces  exposure  to  interest  rates  by  managingcommercial
 paper and debt maturities. The Company also does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments.The
 derivative contracts entered into are for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures. The Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties toderivative
 contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations and minimizes this risk by dealing only with leading, credit-worthy financial institutions havinglong-term credit r
atings of “A” or better.During
 March 2020, the  Company entered into four 10-year treasury lock agreements, each with a notional  amount of $100 million, to  reduce interest rateexposure on
 debt, which was subsequently issued on April 14, 2020. These treasury lock agreements had an average fixed rate of 0.94%. The Company designatedthese treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges, with their fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss. 
On April 8, 2020 the Company terminated
 these four treasury lock agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $400 million, realizing a net loss of $6 million, to be amortized throughinterest,
 net over a 10 year period, in accordance with the terms of the $1.0 billion new debt issued on April 14, 2020. No ineffectiveness was recognized onhedging instruments for the y
ears ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.108

Table of ContentsNote 13: Short-Term Debt
To
 ensure adequate liquidity given the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on debt and capital markets, on March 20, 2020, AWCC entered into a TermLoan
 Credit Agreement, by and among parent company, AWCC and the lenders party thereto, which provided for a term loan facility of up to $750 million (the“Term
 Loan Facility”). On March 20, 2020, AWCC borrowed $500 million under the Term Loan Facility, the proceeds of which were used for general corporatepurposes
 of AWCC and parent company, and to provide additional liquidity. The Term Loan Facility allowed for a single additional borrowing of up to $250million,
 which expired unused on June 19, 2020. The Term Loan Facility commitments terminate  on March 19, 2021. AWCC may prepay all or a portion ofamounts
 due under the Term Loan Facility without any premium or penalty. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at a variable annual rate basedon LIBOR, plus a margin of 0.80%. The
 credit agreement for the Term Loan Facility contains the same affirmative and negative covenants and events of default asunder AWCC’s $2.25 billion revolving cred
it facility. As of December 31, 2020, $500 million of principal was outstanding under the Term Loan Facility.Short-term debt consists of 
commercial paper and credit facility borrowings totaling $786 million for both periods ending December 31, 2020 and 2019. Theweighted
 average  interest  rate  on  AWCC  short-term  borrowings  was  approximately  1.16%  and  2.54%  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2020  and  2019,respectively. As of Decembe
r 31, 2020 there were no borrowings outstanding with maturities greater than three months.Liquidity
 needs for capital investment, working capital and other financial commitments are funded through cash flows from operations, public and privatedebt
 offerings, commercial paper markets and, if and to the extent necessary, borrowings under the AWCC revolving credit facility and, in the future, issuances ofequity.
 The revolving credit facility provides $2.25 billion in aggregate total commitments from a diversified group of financial institutions. On April 1, 2020, thetermination date
 of the credit agreement with respect to AWCC’s revolving credit facility was extended, pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement, from March21,
 2024 to March 21, 2025. The facility is used principally to support AWCC’s commercial paper program and to provide a sub-limit of up to $150 million forletters
 of credit. Letters of credit are non-debt instruments maintained to provide credit support for certain transactions as requested by third parties. Subject  tosatisfying
 certain conditions, the credit agreement also permits AWCC to increase the maximum commitment under the facility by up to an aggregate of $500million.
 As  of December 31, 2020, AWCC had no outstanding borrowings and $76 million of outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility, with$1.39
 billion available to fulfill the Company’s short-term liquidity needs and to issue letters of credit. During 2020, the Company borrowed and subsequentlyrepaid
 $650 million under the revolving credit facility. The Company regularly evaluates the capital markets and closely monitors the financial condition of thefinancial
 institutions with contractual commitments in its revolving credit facility. Interest rates on advances under the facility are based on a credit spread to theLIBOR
 rate (or applicable market replacement rate) or base rate in accordance with Moody Investors Service’s and Standard & Poor’s Financial Services’ thenapplicable credit 
rating on AWCC’s senior unsecured, non-credit enhanced debt.Presented

 of  December  31,  2020  and  2019,  the  Company  recognized  federal  net  operating  loss  (“NOL”)  carryforwards  of  $366  million  and  $673  million,respectively.
 The Company’s federal NOL carryforwards begin to expire in 2029, however, the Company expects to fully utilize its federal NOL carryforwards in2021, and therefore, no valuat
ion allowance is required.As
 of  December  31,  2020  and  2019,  the  Company  had  state  NOLs  of  $357  million  and  $453  million,  respectively,  a  portion  of  which  are  offset  by  avaluation
 allowance because the Company does not believe these NOLs are more likely than not to be realized. The state NOL carryforwards began to expire in2020 and will continue through 2040.
The
 Company  files  income  tax  returns  in  the  United  States  federal  jurisdiction  and  various  state  and  foreign  jurisdictions.  With  few  exceptions,  theCompany is
 no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years on or before 2012. The Company hasstate income tax exa
minations in progress and does not expect material adjustments to result.111

 or after January 1, 2001 and non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2006 are provided with a 5.25% of base pay defined contribution plan. TheCompany
 does not participate in a multi-employer plan. The Company also has unfunded noncontributory supplemental nonqualified pension plans that provideadditional retirement benefits to
 certain employees.The Company’s
 pension funding practice is to contribute at least the greater of the minimum amount required by the Employee Retirement Income SecurityAct
 of 1974 or the normal cost. Further, the Company will consider additional cash contributions and/or available prefunding balances if needed to avoid “at risk”status and benefit restrictions under the Pension Protectio
n Act of 2006 (“PPA”). The Company may also consider increased contributions, based on other financialrequirements and
 the plans’ funded position. Pension expense in excess of the amount contributed to the pension plans is deferred by certain regulated subsidiariespending
 future recovery in rates charged for utility services as contributions are made to the plans. See Note 4—Regulatory Matters for additional information.Pension
 plan  assets  are  invested  in  a  number  of  actively  managed,  commingled  funds,  and  limited  partnerships  including  equities,  fixed  income  securities,guaranteed annuity contr
acts with insurance companies, real estate funds and real estate investment trusts (“REITs”).112

Table of ContentsThe
 Company maintains other postretirement benefit plans providing varying levels of medical and life insurance to eligible retirees. The retiree welfareplans are closed for union employees hired on or after January 1, 20
06. The plans had previously closed for non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2002.The
 Company’s policy is to fund other postretirement benefit costs up to the amount recoverable through rates. Assets of the plans are invested in a number ofactively managed funds in 
the form of separate accounts, commingled funds and limited partnerships, including equities and fixed income securities.The
 investment policy guideline of the pension plan is focused on diversification, improving returns and reducing the volatility of the funded status over along-term
 horizon. The investment policy guidelines of the postretirement plans focus on the appropriate strategy given the funded status of the plans. None of theCompany’s securities are 
included in pension or other postretirement benefit plan assets.The
 Company  uses  fair  value  for  all  classes  of  assets  in  the  calculation  of  market-related  value  of  plan  assets.  As  of  2018,  the  fair  values  and  assetallocations of
 the pension plan assets include the American Water Pension Plan, the New York Water Service Corporation Pension Plan, and the Shorelands WaterCompany, Inc. Pension Plan.
Upon
 completion of the pending transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement among the Company, the Company’s New York subsidiaryand
 Liberty, there will be a transfer of assets from two pension plans and two other postretirement benefit plans from the Company to Liberty. The Company doesnot expect the assets to be 
transferred to be a significant percentage of the Company’s overall pension and other postretirement benefit plans.Presented
 in the tables below are the fair values and asset allocations of the pension plan assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, by assetcategory:

 Company’s postretirement benefit plans have different levels of funded status and the assets are held under various trusts. The investments and riskmitigation
 strategies  for  the  plans  are  tailored  specifically  for  each  trust.  In  setting  new  strategic  asset  mixes,  consideration  is  given  to  the  likelihood  that  theselected
 asset allocation will effectively fund the projected plan liabilities and meet the risk tolerance criteria of the Company. The Company periodically updatesthe
 long-term,  strategic  asset  allocations  for  these  plans  through  asset  liability  studies  and  uses  various  analytics  to  determine  the  optimal  asset  allocation.Considerations include plan l
iability characteristics, liquidity needs, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns.In
 2018, the Company announced plan design changes to the medical bargaining benefit plan, which resulted in a cap on future benefits and an over fundedpostretirement
 medical benefits bargaining plan. As a result of the change in funded status, the Company decreased the investment risk in the plan and reduced itsexposure to changes in inter
est rates by matching the assets of the plan to the projected cash flows for future benefit payments of the liability.114

Table of ContentsThe
 Company engages third-party investment managers for all invested assets. Managers are not permitted to invest outside of the asset class (e.g. fixedincome,
 equity,  alternatives)  or  strategy  for  which  they  have  been  appointed.  Investment  management  agreements  and  recurring  performance  and  attributionanalysis
 are used as tools to ensure investment managers invest solely within the investment strategy they have been provided. Futures and options may be used toadjust portfolio duration 
to align with a plan’s targeted investment policy.In order
 to minimize asset volatility relative to the liabilities, a portion of plan assets is allocated to long duration fixed income investments that are exposedto interest rate
 risk. Increases in interest rates generally will result in a decline in the value of fixed income assets while reducing the present value of the liabilities.Conversely,
 rate  decreases  will  increase  fixed  income  assets,  partially  offsetting  the  related  increase  in  the  liabilities.  Within  equities,  risk  is  mitigated  byconstructing a
 portfolio that is broadly diversified by geography, market capitalization, manager mandate size, investment style and process. For the postretirementmedical bargaining pl
an, its asset structure is designed to meet the cash flows of the liabilities. This design reduces the plan’s exposure to changes in interest rates.Actual allocations to each
 asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy updates, market value fluctuations, the length of time ittakes
 to fully implement investment allocations, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. The asset allocation is rebalanced on a quarterly basis, ifnecessary.
 Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association (“VEBA”) Trust assets include the American Water Postretirement Medical Benefits Bargaining Plan,the
 New York Water Service Corporation Postretirement Medical Benefits Bargaining Plan, the American Water Postretirement Medical Benefits Non-BargainingPlan, and the American Wat
er Life Insurance Trust.Presented

Cash—Cash
 and investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased, including certain short-term fixed-income securities, are consideredcash and are included in th
e recurring fair value measurements hierarchy as Level 1.Equity
 securities—For  equity  securities,  the  trustees  obtain  prices  from  pricing  services,  whose  prices  are  obtained  from  direct  feeds  from  marketexchanges, that
 the Company is able to independently corroborate. Certain equity securities are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and categorized asLevel
 1. Other equities, such as international securities held in the pension plan, are invested in commingled funds and/or limited partnerships. These funds arevalued
 to reflect the plan fund’s interest in the fund based on the reported year-end net asset value. Since net asset value is not directly observable or not availableon
 a  nationally  recognized  securities  exchange  for  the  commingled  funds,  they  are  categorized  as  Level  2.  For  limited  partnerships,  the  assets  as  a  whole  arecategorized as Level 3 due to
 the fact that the partnership provides the pricing and the pricing inputs are less readily observable. In addition, the limited partnershipvehicle cannot be read
ily traded.Fixed-income
 securities—The majority of U.S. Treasury securities and government bonds have been categorized as Level 1 because they trade in highly-liquid
 and transparent markets and their prices can be corroborated. The fair values of corporate bonds, mortgage backed securities, and certain government bondsare
 based on prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information of similar securities. They are categorized as Level 2 because thevaluations are calculated using models which utilize actively traded market data that the Company can corroborate. Exchange-tra
ded options and futures, for whichmarket
 quotations are readily available, are valued at the last reported sale price or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which they aretraded and are classi
fied as Level 1.Real estate fund—Real estate fund is categorized as Level 3 as the fund uses significant un
observable inputs for fair value measurement and the vehicle is inthe form of a limit
ed partnership.116

Table of ContentsREITs—REITs
 are invested in commingled funds. Commingled funds are valued to reflect the plan fund’s interest in the fund based on the reported year-end net asset value. Since th
e net asset value is not directly observable for the commingled funds, they are categorized as Level 2.Guaranteed annuity contracts—Guaranteed annuity contracts are
 categorized as Level 3 because the investments are not publicly quoted. Since these marketvalues
 are  determined  by  the provider,  they are  not highly  observable  and  have been  categorized  as  Level  3.  Exchange-traded  future  and option  positions  arereported in accordance wit

In
 2006, the PPA replaced the funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans by requiring that defined benefit plans contribute to 100% of thecurrent
 liability funding target over seven years. Defined benefit plans with a funding status of less than 80% of the current liability are defined as being “at risk”and
 additional funding requirements and benefit restrictions may apply. The PPA was effective for the 2008 plan year with short-term phase-in provisions for boththe
 funding  target  and  at-risk  determination.  The  Company’s  qualified  defined  benefit  plan  is  currently  funded  above  the  at-risk  threshold,  and  therefore  theCompany
 expects that the plans will not be subject to the “at risk” funding requirements of the PPA. The Company is proactively monitoring the plan’s fundedstatus and projected cont
ributions under the law to appropriately manage the potential impact on cash requirements.Minimum
 funding  requirements  for  the  qualified  defined  benefit  pension  plan  are  determined  by  government  regulations  and  not  by  accountingpronouncements.
 The Company plans to contribute amounts at least equal to or greater than the minimum required contributions or the normal cost in 2021 to thequalified pension plans. Contribu
tions may be in the form of cash contributions as well as available prefunding balances.Presented in the table be

e net benefits, plan participants’ contributions have been excluded from the expected benefits.Accounting
 for pensions and other postretirement benefits requires an extensive use of assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets,the rate of future compensation increases received by the Company’s employees, mortality, turno
ver and medical costs. Each assumption is reviewed annually. Theassumptions
 are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capitalmarkets and the overal
l economy. These differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the Company recognizes.Presented in the table be

The
 discount  rate  assumption  was  determined  for  the  pension  and  postretirement  benefit  plans  independently.  The  Company  uses  an  approach  thatapproximates
 the process of settlement of obligations tailored to the plans’ expected cash flows by matching the plans’ cash flows to the coupons and expectedmaturity values
 of individually selected bonds. Historically, for each plan, the discount rate was developed at the level equivalent rate that would produce the samepresent value as that using spo
t rates aligned with the projected benefit payments.119

Table of ContentsThe
 expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return, prior to administrative and investment managementfees,
 for current and planned asset classes in the plans’ investment portfolios. Assumed projected rates of return for each of the plans’ projected asset classes wereselected
 after analyzing historical experience and future expectations of the returns and volatility of the various asset classes. Based on the target asset allocationfor
 each  asset  class,  the  overall  expected  rate  of  return  for  the  portfolio  was  developed,  adjusted  for  historical  and  expected  experience  of  active  portfoliomanagement results
 compared to the benchmark returns. The Company’s pension expense increases as the expected return on assets decreases. The Company usedan
 expected  return  on  plan  assets  of  6.50%  to  estimate  its  2020  pension  benefit  costs,  and  an  expected  blended  return  based  on  weighted  assets  of  3.68%  toestimate its 2020 other 
postretirement benefit costs.The
 Company  had  previously  adopted  a  mortality  table  based  on  the  Society  of  Actuaries  RP  2014  mortality  table  including  a  generational  MP-2018projection
 scale.  In  2020,  the  Company  adopted  the  Pri-2012  base  mortality  table  and  the  new  MP-2020  mortality  improvement  scale  to  replace  the  previousassumption.

Due to the amount  of lump sum payment distributions from the Company’s New York Water Service Corporation Pension Plan, settlement charges of less than $1 million were recordedfor
 the year ended December 31, 2020. There were no settlement charges recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019. In accordance with existing regulatory accounting treatment,the
 Company has maintained the settlement charges in regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount is being amortized in accordance with existing regulatorypractice.
The
 Company’s policy is to recognize curtailments when the total expected future service of plan participants is reduced by greater than 10% due to anevent that results in terminati
ons and/or retirements.Cumulative
 gains and losses that are in excess of 10% of the greater of either the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortizedover the expected average remai
ning future service of the current active membership for the plans.120

Table of ContentsSavings Plans for Employees
The
 Company maintains 401(k) savings plans that allow employees to save for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. Employees can make contributions thatare
 invested at their direction in one or more funds. The Company makes matching contributions based on a percentage of an employee’s contribution, subject tocertain
 limitations. Due to the Company’s discontinuing new entrants into the defined benefit pension plan, on January 1, 2006, the Company began providing anadditional
 5.25%  of  base  pay  defined  contribution  benefit  for  union  employees  hired  on  or  after  January  1,  2001  and  non-union  employees  hired  on  or  afterJanuary

ction LitigationOn
 the evening of June 23, 2015, a 36-inch pre-stressed concrete transmission water main, installed in the early 1970s, failed. The water main is part of theWest
 Relay pumping station located in the City of Dunbar, West Virginia and owned by WVAWC. The failure of the main caused water outages and low pressurefor
 up  to  approximately  25,000  WVAWC  customers.  In  the  early  morning  hours  of  June  25,  2015,  crews  completed  a  repair,  but  that  same  day,  the  repairdeveloped
 a leak. On June 26, 2015, a second repair was completed and service was restored that day to approximately 80% of the impacted customers, and to theremaining approximately 20%
 by the next morning. The second repair showed signs of leaking but the water main was usable until June 29, 2015 to allow tanks torefill. The system was reconfigured to maintain service to all but approximately 3,0
00 customers while a final repair was completed safely on June 30, 2015. Waterservice was fully restor
ed by July 1, 2015 to all customers affected by this event.On
 June 2, 2017, a complaint captioned Jeffries,  et al. v. West Virginia-American Water Company was  filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in KanawhaCounty
 on behalf of an alleged class of residents and business owners who lost water service or pressure as a result of the Dunbar main break. The complaintalleges breach of contract by WVAWC for failure to supply water, violation of West Virginia law regardi
ng the sufficiency of WVAWC’s facilities and negligenceby
 WVAWC in the design, maintenance and operation of the water system. The Jeffries  plaintiffs  seek unspecified alleged damages on behalf of the class for lostprofits,
 annoyance and inconvenience, and loss of use, as well as punitive damages for willful, reckless and wanton behavior in not addressing the risk of pipefailure and a large outage.
On February 4, 2020, the 
Jeffries  plaintiffs  filed a motion seeking class certification on the issues of breach of contract and negligence, and to determine theapplicability
 of  punitive  damages  and  a  multiplier  for  those  damages  if  imposed.  On  July  14,  2020,  the  Circuit  Court  entered  an  order  granting  the Jeffries plaintiffs’
 motion for certification of a class regarding certain liability issues but denying certification of a class to determine a punitive damages multiplier. OnAugust
 31, 2020, WVAWC filed a Petition for Writ of Prohibition in the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia seeking to vacate or remand the CircuitCourt’s
 order  certifying  the  issues  class.  At  the  request  of  the  parties,  on  September  10,  2020,  the  Circuit  Court  ordered  the  stay  of  all  matters  in  the  classproceeding
 pending  consideration  of  this  petition.  On  December  3,  2020,  the  Supreme  Court  of  Appeals  issued  an  order  to  show  cause  stating  that  there  aresufficient
 grounds for oral argument to consider prohibiting the class certification order. On January 28, 2021, the Supreme Court of Appeals granted a motion bythe 
Jeffries plaintiffs to remand the case  back to the Circuit Court for further consideration in light of a recent Supreme Court of Appeals decision issued in anothercase relating to the class certificati
on issues raised.The
 Company  and  WVAWC  believe  that  WVAWC  has  valid,  meritorious  defenses  to  the  claims  raised  in  this  class  action  complaint.  WVAWC  isvigorously defending itself against these allegati

tion LitigationOn
 September 12, 2019, the Company’s Tennessee subsidiary (“TAWC”), experienced a leak in a 36-inch water transmission main, which caused servicefluctuations
 or interruptions to TAWC customers and the issuance of a boil water notice. TAWC repaired the main by early morning on September 14, 2019, andrestored full water se
rvice by the afternoon of September 15, 2019, with the boil water notice lifted for all customers on September 16, 2019.On
 September 17, 2019, a complaint captioned Bruce,  et al. v. American Water Works Company, Inc., et al. was  filed in the Circuit Court of HamiltonCounty,
 Tennessee against TAWC, the Company and American  Water Works Service Company, Inc. (“Service Company,” and together with TAWC and theCompany,
 collectively, the “Tennessee-American Water Defendants”), on behalf of a proposed class of individuals or entities who lost water service or sufferedmonetary
 losses  as  a  result  of  the  Chattanooga  incident  (the  “Tennessee  Plaintiffs”).  The  complaint  alleged  breach  of  contract  and  negligence  against  theTennessee-American
 Water Defendants, as well as an equitable remedy of piercing the corporate veil. In the complaint as filed, the Tennessee Plaintiffs wereseeking
 an award of unspecified alleged damages for wage losses, business and economic losses, out-of-pocket expenses, loss of use and enjoyment of propertyand annoyance and inconvenienc
e, as well as punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and pre- and post-judgment interest.122

Table of ContentsOn
 November 22, 2019, the Tennessee-American Water Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which reliefmay
 be granted, and, with respect to the Company, for lack of personal jurisdiction. Oral argument on the motion to dismiss took place on September 9, 2020. OnSeptember
 18, 2020, the court (i) granted the motion to dismiss the Tennessee Plaintiffs’ negligence claim against all Tennessee-American Water Defendants, (ii)denied
 the motion to dismiss the breach of contract claim against TAWC, (iii) held in abeyance the motion to dismiss the breach of contract claims against theCompany
 and  Service  Company  pending  a  further  hearing  and  (iv)  held  in  abeyance  the  Company’s  motion  to  dismiss  the  complaint  for  lack  of  personaljurisdiction.
 On September 24, 2020, at the request of the Tennessee Plaintiffs, the court dismissed without prejudice all claims in the Bruce complaint against theCompany
 and Service Company. The impact of the September 2020 court orders was that all of the Tennessee Plaintiffs’ claims in this complaint were dismissed,other than the breach of 
contract claims against TAWC. On October 16, 2020, TAWC answered the complaint, and the parties are commencing with discovery.TAWC
 and  the  Company  believe  that  TAWC  has  meritorious  defenses  to  the  claims  raised  in  this  class  action  complaint,  and  TAWC  is  vigorouslydefending itself

in Lieu of Carmel River DiversionsCompliance with Orders to Reduce Car
mel River Diversions—Monterey Peninsula Water Supply ProjectUnder
 a 2009 order (the “2009 Order”) of the State Water Resources Control Board (the “SWRCB”), the Company’s California subsidiary (“Cal Am”) isrequired
 to decrease significantly its yearly diversions of water from the Carmel River according to a set reduction schedule. In 2016, the SWRCB issued an order(the “2016 Order”) approving a d
eadline of December 31, 2021 for Cal Am’s compliance with these prior orders (the “2021 Deadline”).Cal
 Am is currently involved in developing the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project (the “Water Supply Project”), which includes the construction ofa
 desalination plant, to be owned by Cal Am, and the construction of wells that would supply water to the desalination plant. In addition, the Water Supply Projectalso
 includes  Cal  Am’s  purchase  of  water  from  a  groundwater  replenishment  project  (the  “GWR  Project”)  between  Monterey  One  Water  and  the  MontereyPeninsula Water
 Management District (the “MPWMD”). The Water Supply Project is intended, among other things, to fulfill Cal Am’s obligations under the 2009Order and the 2016 Order.
Cal
 Am’s  ability  to  move  forward  on  the  Water  Supply  Project  is  subject  to  administrative  review  by  the  California  Public  Utilities  Commission  (the“CPUC”) and other government agencies
, obtaining necessary permits, and intervention from other parties. In September 2016, the CPUC unanimously approved afinal decision to authorize Cal Am to enter into a water purchase agreement for the GWR Project an
d to construct a pipeline and pump station facilities and recoverup to the incurred $50 mill
ion in associated costs plus AFUDC, subject to meeting certain criteria.In
 September 2018, the CPUC unanimously approved another final decision finding that (i) the Water Supply Project meets the CPUC’s requirements for acertificate
 of  public  convenience  and  necessity,  (ii)  the  issuance  of  the  final  decision  should  not  be  delayed,  and  (iii)  an  additional  procedural  phase  was  notnecessary
 to consider alternative projects. The CPUC’s 2018 decision concludes that the Water Supply Project is the best project to address estimated future waterdemands
 in Monterey, and, in addition to the cost recovery approved in its 2016 decision, adopts Cal Am’s cost estimates for the Water Supply Project, whichamounted to an aggregate o
f $279 million plus AFUDC at a rate representative of Cal Am’s actual financing costs. The 2018 final decision specifies the proceduresfor
 recovery of all of Cal Am’s prudently incurred costs associated with the Water Supply Project upon its completion, subject to the frameworks included in thefinal
 decision  related  to  cost  caps,  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  financing,  ratemaking  and  contingency  matters.  The  reasonableness  of  the  Water  SupplyProject costs
 will be reviewed in the first general rate case filed by Cal Am after it becomes operational. Cal Am has incurred $154 million in aggregate costs as ofDecember
 31, 2020 related to the Water Supply Project, which includes $36 million in AFUDC. While Cal Am believes that its expenditures to date have beenprudent
 and necessary to comply with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order, as well as the CPUC’s 2016 and 2018 final decisions, Cal Am cannot currently predictits
 ability to recover all of its costs and expenses associated with the Water Supply Project and there can be no assurance that Cal Am will be able to recover all ofsuch costs and expenses in excess of 
the $50 million in construction costs previously approved by the CPUC in its 2016 final decision.123

Table of ContentsCoastal Development Permit Appl
icationIn
 June 2018, Cal Am submitted a coastal development permit application to the City of Marina (the “City”) for those project components of the WaterSupply
 Project  located  within  the  City’s  coastal  zone.  Members  of  the  City’s  Planning  Commission,  as  well  as  City  councilpersons,  have  publicly  expressedopposition to
 the Water Supply Project. In May 2019, the City issued a notice of final local action based upon the denial by the Planning Commission of Cal Am’scoastal development pe
rmit application. Thereafter, Cal Am appealed this decision to the California Coastal Commission (the “Coastal Commission”), as permittedunder
 the City’s code and the California Coastal Act. At the same time, Cal Am submitted an application to the Coastal Commission for a coastal developmentpermit
 for those project components located within the Coastal Commission’s original jurisdiction. In October 2019, staff of the Coastal Commission issued areport recommending a denial of
 Cal Am’s application for a coastal development permit with respect to the Water Supply Project, largely based on a memorandumprepared
 by  the  general  manager  of  the  MPWMD  that  contradicted  findings  made  by  the  CPUC  in  its  final  decision  approving  the  Water  Supply  Project.  InNovember
 2019, discussions between staffs of the Coastal Commission and the CPUC took place regarding the Coastal Commission staff recommendation, atwhich
 time the CPUC raised questions about the Coastal Commission staff’s findings on water supply and demand, groundwater impacts and the viability of aproject that the Coasta
l Commission staff believes may be a possible alternative to the Water Supply Project.On
 August 25, 2020, the staff of the Coastal Commission released a report again recommending denial of Cal Am’s application for a coastal developmentpermit.
 Although the report concluded that the Water Supply Project would have a negligible impact on groundwater resources, the report also concluded it wouldimpact
 other  coastal  resources,  such  as  environmentally  sensitive  habitat  areas  and  wetlands,  and  that  the  Coastal  Commission  staff  believes  that  a  feasiblealternative
 project exists that would avoid those impacts. The staff’s report also noted disproportionate impacts to communities of concern. On September 16,2020, Cal Am
 withdrew its original jurisdiction application to allow additional time to address the Coastal Commission staff’s environmental justice concerns. Thewithdrawal of the original jurisdiction application did not impact Cal Am’s ap
peal of the City’s denial, which remains pending before the Coastal Commission. CalAm
 refiled  the original jurisdiction  application on November 6, 2020. On December 3, 2020, the Coastal Commission sent to Cal Am a notice of incompleteapplication,
 identifying certain additional information needed to consider the application complete. Cal Am is preparing a response to the Coastal Commission’snotice.
Cal Am
 continues to work constructively with all appropriate agencies to provide necessary information in connection with obtaining required approvals forthe
 Water Supply Project. However, based on the foregoing, there can be no assurance that the Water Supply Project in its current configuration will be completedon
 a timely basis, if ever. Due to the delay in the approval schedule, Cal Am currently does not believe that it will be able to fully comply with the diversionreduction
 requirements and other remaining requirements under the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order, including the 2021 Deadline. While the Company cannotcurrently predict the likelihood or result
 of any adverse outcome associated with these matters, further attempts to comply with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order,or
 the  2021  Deadline,  may  result  in  material  additional  costs  and  obligations  to  Cal  Am,  including  fines  and  penalties  against  Cal  Am  in  the  event  ofnoncompliance with the 2009 Order 
and the 2016 Order.Note 18: Earnings per Common Share

Table of ContentsNote 19: Fair Value of Financial Information
The following methods and assumptions we
re used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments:Current assets
 and current liabilities—The carrying amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for current assets and current liabilities, includingrevolving credit debt, 
due to the short-term maturities and variable interest rates, approximate their fair values.Preferred
 stock with mandatory redemption requirements and long-term debt—The fair values of preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirementsand
 long-term debt are categorized within the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs that are used to value each instrument. The fair value of long-term debtclassified as Level
 1 is calculated using quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 instruments are valued using observable inputs and Level 3 instruments are valuedusing observable and unobservable 
inputs..Presented
 in the tables below are the carrying amounts, including fair value adjustments previously recognized in acquisition purchase accounting, and thefair values of the Company’s

To
 increase  consistency  and  comparability  in  fair  value  measurements,  GAAP  establishes  a  fair  value  hierarchy  that  prioritizes  the  inputs  to  valuationtechniques used to measure 
fair value into three levels as follows:Level
 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access as of the reporting date.Financial
 assets  and  liabilities  utilizing  Level  1  inputs  include  active  exchange-traded  equity  securities,  exchange-based  derivatives,  mutual  funds  and  moneymarket funds.
Level
 2—Inputs  other  than  quoted  prices  included  within  Level  1  that  are  directly  observable  for  the  asset  or  liability  or  indirectly  observable  throughcorroboration with observable market
 data. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs include fixed income securities, non-exchange-based derivatives,commingled investment 
funds not subject to purchase and sale restrictions and fair-value hedges.Level
 3—Unobservable  inputs,  such  as  internally-developed  pricing  models  for  the  asset  or  liability  due  to  little  or  no  market  activity  for  the  asset  orliability.
 Financial  assets  and  liabilities  utilizing  Level  3  inputs  include  infrequently-traded  non-exchange-based  derivatives  and  commingled  investment  fundssubject to purchase and sal

 accounts. The Company includes such plans in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The value of the Company’s deferredcompensation
 obligations is based on the market value of the participants’  notional investment  accounts. The notional investments are comprised primarily  ofmutual funds, which are based on obse
rvable market prices.126

Table of ContentsMark-to-market derivative assets
 and liabilities— The Company employs derivative financial instruments in the form of variable-to-fixed interest rate swapsand
 treasury lock agreements, classified as economic hedges and cash flow hedges, respectively, in order to fix the interest cost on existing or forecasted debt. TheCompany may use fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps
, typically designated as fair-value hedges, to achieve a targeted level of variable-rate debt as a percentage oftotal
 debt.  The  Company  uses  a  calculation  of  future  cash  inflows  and  estimated  future  outflows,  which  are  discounted,  to  determine  the  current  fair  value.Additional
 inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, counterparty credit risk, interest rates and market volatility. The Company had nosignificant mark-to

The
 Company has operating and finance leases involving real property, including facilities, utility assets, vehicles, and equipment. Certain operating leaseshave
 renewal options ranging from one  to 60 years. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company’s sole discretion. Renewal options that the Companywas
 reasonably certain to exercise are included in the Company’s ROU assets. Certain operating leases contain the option to purchase the leased property. Theoperating leases for r
eal property, vehicles and equipment will expire over the next 39 years, six years, and five years, respectively.The
 Company participates in a number of arrangements with various public entities (“Partners”) in West Virginia. Under these arrangements, the Companytransferred
 a portion of its utility plant to the Partners in exchange for an equal principal amount of Industrial Development Bonds (“IDBs”) issued by the Partnersunder
 the Industrial Development and Commercial Development Bond Act. The Company leased back the utility plant under agreements for a period of 30 to 40years.
 The Company has recorded these agreements as finance leases in property, plant and equipment, as ownership of the assets will revert back to the Companyat the
 end of the lease term. The carrying value of the finance lease assets was $147 million and $147 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. TheCompany
 determined  that  the  finance  lease  obligations  and  the  investments  in  IDBs  meet  the  conditions  for  offsetting,  and  as  such,  are  reported  net  on  theConsolidated Balance Sheets and ex
cluded from the finance lease disclosure presented below.The
 Company also enters into O&M agreements with the Partners. The Company pays an annual fee for use of the Partners’ assets in performing under theO&M
 agreements.  The  O&M  agreements  are  recorded  as  operating  leases,  and  future  annual  use  fees  of  $4  million  in  2021  through  2025,  and  $52  millionthereafter, are 
included in operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Rental
 expenses under operating and finance leases presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $14 million and $16 million for the years endedDecember
 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Rental expenses under operating leases which included variable and short-term lease costs were $35 million for theyear ended December 31, 2018.
For
 the year ended December 31, 2020, cash paid for amounts in lease liabilities, which includes operating and financing cash flows from operating andfinance leases, was $14 mil
lion. For the year ended December 31, 2020, ROU assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities was $2 million.As
 of December 31, 2020, the weighted-average remaining lease term of the finance lease and operating leases were five years and 19 years, respectively,and the weighted-average d
iscount rate of the finance lease and operating leases were 12% and 4%, respectively.The
 future maturities of lease liabilities at December 31, 2020 are $13 million in 2021, $12 million in 2022, $8 million in 2023, $7 million in 2024, $7million in 2025 and $94 million 
thereafter. At December 31, 2020 imputed interest was $49 million.Note 21: Segment Information
The
 Company’s  operating  segments  are  comprised  of  the  revenue-generating  components  of  its  businesses  for  which  separate  financial  information  isinternally
 produced  and  regularly  used  by  management  to  make  operating  decisions,  assess  performance  and  allocate  resources.  The  Company  operates  itsbusinesses
 primarily through one reportable segment, the Regulated Businesses segment. The Company also operates market-based businesses that, individually,do not meet the crite
ria of a reportable segment in accordance with GAAP, and are collectively presented as the Market-Based Businesses.The
 Regulated  Businesses  segment  is  the  largest  component  of  the  Company’s  business  and  includes  subsidiaries  that  provide  water  and  wastewaterservices to customers in 16 s
tates.127

Table of ContentsThe
 Company’s  primary  Market-Based  Businesses  include  HOS,  which  provides  various  warranty  protection  programs  and  other  home  services  toresidential
 customers, and MSG, which enters into long-term contracts with the U.S. government to provide water and wastewater services on various militaryinstallations.
The
 accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2—Significant Accounting Policies. The Regulated Businesses segmentand
 Market-Based Businesses include intercompany costs that are allocated by Service Company and intercompany interest that is charged by AWCC, both ofwhich
 are eliminated to reconcile to the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Inter-segment revenues include the sale of water from a regulated subsidiary tomarket-based
 subsidiaries, leased office space, and furniture and equipment provided by the market-based subsidiaries to regulated subsidiaries. “Other” includescorporate
 costs  that  are  not  allocated  to  the  Company’s  operating  segments,  eliminations  of  inter-segment  transactions,  fair  value  adjustments,  and  associatedincome
 and deductions related to the acquisitions that have not been allocated to the operating segments for evaluation of performance and allocation of resourcepurposes. The adj

 an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under th
e Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report.Based on
 that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, the Company’s disclosurecontrols
 and procedures were effective at a reasonable level of assurance. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonableassurance
 that  the  information  required  to  be  disclosed  by  the  Company  in  the  reports  it  files  or  submits  under  the  Exchange  Act  is  recorded,  processed,summarized
 and  reported  within  the  time  periods  specified  in  the  SEC’s  rules  and  forms,  and  that  such  information  is  accumulated  and  communicated  tomanagement, including th
e Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Report
ingThe
 Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined inRule
 13a-15(f)  of  the  Exchange  Act.  The  Company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  a  process  designed  by  or  under  the  supervision  of  the  ChiefExecutive
 Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financialstatements
 for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that(i)
 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect its transactions and dispositions of its assets, (ii) provide reasonableassurance
 that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receiptsand
 expenditures  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  its  management  and its  directors,  and  (iii)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regardingprevention or timely detectio
n of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of its assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because
 of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness
 to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate.The
 Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of its internal control overfinancial
 reporting,  as  of  December  31,  2020,  using  the  criteria  described  in Internal  Control—Integrated  Framework  (2013) issued  by  the  Committee  ofSponsoring Organizations of the Tre
adway Commission (COSO).Based

l reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.The effectiveness of the
 Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, anindependent
 registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Reporton Form 10-K.

y likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.ITEM 9B.    OTHER INFORMATION

 by  the  DGCL,  the  Board  is  authorized  to  fix  for  any  series  of  preferred  stock  the  number  of  shares  of  such  series  and  the  voting  powers  (if  any),designation,
 preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such series. The Board is alsoauthorized
 to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series, but not below the number of shares of that series then outstanding, without any further voteor action by the Company’s shareho
lders.The Board
 may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that affect adversely the voting power or other rights of holders ofCommon
 Stock. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could have theeffect of delaying,
-1-

deferring or preventing a change in control, causing the market price of a share of Common Stock to decline, or impairing the voting and other rights of the holdersof Common Stock.
Certain Anti-Takeover Provisions of the Certif
icate of Incorporation and Bylaws, and the DGCLThe
 following provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws could deter, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring the Company, even ifdoing so would benefit the Company’s shar
eholders.Undesignated Preferred Stock
The
 ability to authorize undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for the Board to authorize the issuance of preferred stock with super voting, specialapproval,
 dividend or other rights or preferences on a discriminatory basis that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire the Company. These and otherprovisions may have the eff
ect of deferring, delaying or discouraging hostile takeovers, or changes in control or management of the Company.Requirements for Advance Notification of Shareholder Me
etings, Nominations and ProposalsThe Bylaws
 provide that special meetings of shareholders may be called only upon the request of the majority of the members of the Board, upon request ofthe
 Chairman of the Board, or by the Secretary of the Company upon request of shareholders holding at least 15% of the outstanding Common Stock. The Bylawsprohibit the conduct of any busin
ess at a special meeting other than as specified in the notice for such meeting.The
 Bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to shareholder proposals for annual meetings and the nomination of candidates for election asdirectors,
 other than nominations made by or at the direction of the Board or a committee thereof. A shareholder who wishes to bring a matter before a meetingmust
 comply with the Company’s advance notice requirements  and provide the Company with certain information. Additionally, vacancies and newly createddirectorships
 may be filled only by a vote of a majority of the members of the Board then in office, even though less than a quorum, or by shareholders. Theseprovisions
 may defer, delay or discourage a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror’s own slate of directors or otherwiseattempting to obtain con
trol of the Company.Shareholder Action by Written Consent
As
 permitted  by  Section  228  of  the  DGCL,  the  Certificate  of  Incorporation  states  that  any  action  required  or  permitted  to  be  taken  by  the  Company’sshareholders must be eff
ected at a duly called annual or special meeting and may not be effected by consent in writing by such shareholders.Certain Anti-Takeover Matters
A
 significant number of the Company’s regulated subsidiaries are subject to economic regulation by state public utility commissions. Some of these stateshave
 enacted laws that require regulatory approval for the acquisition of “control” of any regulated utility. In those states, obtaining “control” of the parent or anyother
 company that controls a regulated utility also requires prior regulatory approval. The threshold for a change in control is a fact-specific inquiry that varies bystate.
 For example, in some states, a presumption of control will arise when an acquiring party acquires more than 9.9% of the voting securities of the regulatedutility
 or the controlling entity. In addition to ownership, other states may analyze the degree of influence or control an acquiror may exert over the company. Anyperson
 acquiring Common Stock in an offering or in any other purchase of Common Stock in an amount sufficient to trigger a change in control under state lawwould need the prior approval of 
the applicable state public utility commission.Certain Other Provisions of the Certi
ficate of Incorporation and Bylaws and the DGCLBoard of Directors
The Certificate of Incorporation provides that the
 number of directors is fixed in the manner provided in the Bylaws. The Bylaws provide that the number ofdirectors will be fixed 
from time to time by the Board.Business Combinations under Delaware Law
The Company is subject to Section 203 of 
the DGCL, which prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a “business combination” withan “interested stockholder”
 for a period of three years after the time-2-

the shareholder became an “interested stockholder,” subject to certain exceptions, including if, prior to such time, the board of directors approved the businesscombination
 or the transaction which resulted in the shareholder becoming an “interested stockholder.” “Business combinations” include mergers, asset sales andother
 transactions  resulting  in  a  financial  benefit  to  the  “interested  stockholder.”  Subject  to  various  exceptions,  an  “interested  stockholder”  is  a  person  who,together
 with his or her affiliates and associates, owns, or within the prior three years did own, 15% or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock. Theserestrictions generally
 prohibit or delay the accomplishment of mergers or other takeover or change-in-control attempts that are not approved by a company’s boardof directors.
Limitations of Liability and Indemni
fication of Directors and OfficersThe
 DGCL authorizes corporations to limit or eliminate the personal liability of directors to corporations and their shareholders for monetary damages forbreaches of directors’ fiduciary
 duties. The Certificate of Incorporation includes a provision that eliminates the personal liability of directors for monetary damagesfor actions taken as a di
rector to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL. The DGCL does not permit exculpation for liability:•
for breach of the duty of loyalty;•
for acts or omissions not in good faith or involving intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law;•
under Section 174 of the DGCL (relating to unlawful dividends or stock repurchases); or•
for transactions from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.The
 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that the Company will indemnify its directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by law. TheBylaws also
 expressly authorize the Company to carry directors’ and officers’ insurance providing indemnification for its directors, officers and certain employeesand agents for certain 
liabilities.The
 limitation  of  liability  and  indemnification  provisions  in  the  Certificate  of  Incorporation  and  Bylaws  may  discourage  shareholders  from  bringing  alawsuit
 against  the Company’s  directors  for  breach  of  their  fiduciary  duty. These  provisions  may  also have  the effect  of reducing  the likelihood  of derivativelitigation
 against the Company’s directors and officers, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit the Company and its shareholders. Inaddition,
 an  investment  in  the  Common  Stock  may  be  adversely  affected  to  the  extent  the  Company  pays  the  costs  of  settlement  and  damage  awards  againstdirectors and office
rs in accordance with these indemnification provisions.Proxy Access
The
 Bylaws  permit  an  eligible  shareholder  or group  of shareholders  to include  up to  a specified  number  of  director  nominees  in the  Company’s proxymaterials
 for an annual meeting of shareholders. To qualify, the shareholders (or group of up to 20 shareholders) must have continuously owned for at least threeyears 3% or more
 of the Company’s outstanding common stock. The maximum number of shareholder nominees permitted under this proxy access provision is thegreater
 of (i) two or (ii) 20% of the total number of directors on the Company’s board of directors as of the last day on which a proxy access notice may besubmitted, rounded down to the near
est whole number.Transfer Agent and Registrar
