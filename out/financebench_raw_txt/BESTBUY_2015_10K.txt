PART I  
 
Item 1.  Business.  
 
Unless the context otherwise requires, the use of t he terms "we," "us" and "our" in this Annual Report  on Form 10-K refers to Best Buy Co., Inc. 
and, as applicable, its consolidated subsidiaries. Any references to our website addresses do not cons titute incorporation by reference of the 
information contained on the websites.  
 
Description of Business  
 
We were incorporated in the state of Minnesota in 1 966 as Sound of Music, Inc. Today, we are a leading  provider of technology products, 
services and solutions. We offer expert service at unbeatable price more than 1.5 billion times a year  to the consumers, small business owners 
and educators who visit our stores, engage with Gee k Squad agents or use our websites or mobile applic ations. We have retail and online 
operations in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.  
 
Information About Our Segments and Geographic Areas   
 
We have two reportable segments: Domestic and Inter national. The Domestic segment is comprised of the operations in all states, districts and 
territories of the U.S., operating e-commerce, reta il store and call center operations under various b rand names including, but not limited to, 
Best Buy (bestbuy.com), Best Buy Mobile, Geek Squad , Magnolia Audio Video and Pacific Sales. We operat e Best Buy Mobile stores-within-a-
store and offer Geek Squad services in all of our U .S. Best Buy stores. In addition, we operate Magnol ia Home Theater, Magnolia Design Center 
and Pacific Kitchen and Home store-within-a-store e xperiences in select U.S. Best Buy stores, which we  believe further enhance the range of 
product offerings and quality of expert customer se rvice.  
 
On February 1, 2014, we sold mindSHIFT Technologies , Inc. ("mindSHIFT"). We had previously acquired mi ndSHIFT, a managed service 
provider for small and mid-sized businesses, in fis cal 2012.  
 
The International segment is comprised of: (i) all Canada operations, operating e-commerce and retail store operations under the brand names 
Best Buy (bestbuy.ca), Best Buy Mobile, Cell Shop, Future Shop (futureshop.ca) and Geek Squad; and (ii ) all Mexico operations, operating 
under the brand names Best Buy (bestbuy.com.mx), Be st Buy Express and Geek Squad. We operate Best Buy Mobile store-within-a-store 
concepts in all Best Buy branded stores in Canada.  
 
In March 2015, we made a decision to consolidate Fu ture Shop and Best Buy stores and websites in Canad a under the Best Buy brand. This 
resulted in permanently closing 66 Future Shop stor es and converting 65 Future Shop stores to the Best  Buy brand.  
 
Additional information on these changes is included  in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial C ondition and Results of 
Operations , and Note 13, Subsequent Events , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements , included in Item 8, Financial Statements and 
Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
 
In fiscal 2007, we acquired a 75% interest in Jiang su Five Star Appliance Co., Ltd. (“Five Star”), one  of China’s largest appliance and consumer 
electronics retailers. In fiscal 2009, we acquired the remaining 25% interest in Five Star. On Decembe r 3, 2014, we entered into an agreement to 
sell Five Star, and we completed the sale on Februa ry 13, 2015. In fiscal 2009, we acquired a 50% cont rolling interest in Best Buy Europe 
Distributions Limited (“Best Buy Europe”), a ventur e with Carphone Warehouse Group plc (“CPW”). On Jun e 26, 2013, we sold our 50% 
ownership interest in Best Buy Europe to CPW.  
 
Financial information about our segments and geogra phic areas is included in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations , and Note 11, Segment and Geographic Information , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements , 
included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
 
Operations  
 
Our Domestic and International segments are managed  by leadership teams responsible for all areas of t he business. Both segments operate a 
multi-channel platform that provides customers the ability to shop when and where they want, including  online and in our retail stores.

Domestic Segment  
 
Merchandise selection, pricing and promotions, proc urement and supply chain, marketing and advertising , and labor deployment across all 
channels are centrally managed at our corporate hea dquarters. In addition, support capabilities (e.g.,  human resources, finance and real estate 
management) are generally performed at our corporat e headquarters. We also have field operations that support retail teams. Our retail stores 
have procedures for inventory management, asset pro tection, transaction processing, customer relations , store administration, product sales and 
services, staff training and merchandise display th at are largely standardized within each store brand . All stores within each store brand generally 
operate under standard procedures with a degree of flexibility for store management to address certain  local market characteristics.  
 
International Segment  
 
Our Canada store operations are similar to those in  our Domestic segment, with centrally controlled ad vertising, merchandise purchasing and 
pricing, and inventory policies. In addition, corpo rate management performs support capabilities. Simi lar to our U.S. Best Buy stores, all Canada 
stores use a standardized operating system that inc ludes procedures for inventory management, transact ion processing, customer relations, store 
administration, staff training and merchandise disp lay. The retail operations include two principal st ore brands. Future Shop stores have 
predominantly commissioned sales associates, wherea s employees in Best Buy branded stores in Canada, l ike employees in U.S. Best Buy 
stores, are noncommissioned.  
 
In March 2015, we made a decision to consolidate Fu ture Shop and Best Buy stores and websites in Canad a under the Best Buy brand. This 
resulted in permanently closing 66 Future Shop stor es and converting 65 Future Shop stores to the Best  Buy brand.  
 
Our stores in Mexico employ an operating model simi lar to that used in our U.S. Best Buy stores.  
 
Merchandise and Services  
 
Our Domestic and International segments have offeri ngs in six revenue categories: Consumer Electronics , Computing and Mobile Phones, 
Entertainment, Appliances, Services and Other. Cons umer Electronics consists primarily of television a nd home theater, digital cameras and 
camcorders, DVD and Blu-ray players; portable elect ronics such as MP3 devices, headphones and speakers , car stereo, navigation and satellite 
radio, and all related accessories. The Computing a nd Mobile Phones revenue category includes notebook  and desktop computers, mobile 
phones and related subscription service commissions , tablets and all related accessories. The Entertai nment revenue category includes video 
gaming hardware and software, DVDs, Blu-rays, CDs, digital downloads and computer software. The Applia nces revenue category includes 
both large and small appliances and kitchen and bat h fixtures. The Services revenue category consists primarily of extended warranty service 
contracts, technical support, product repair, deliv ery and installation. The Other revenue category in cludes non- core offerings such as snacks and 
beverages.  
      
The merchandise and service offerings vary across o ur stand-alone store portfolio, with U.S. Best Buy Mobile, Magnolia Audio Video and 
Pacific Sales stores offering a more focused assort ment.  
 
Distribution  
 
Domestic Segment  
 
U.S. Best Buy online merchandise sales generally ar e either picked up at U.S. Best Buy stores or deliv ered directly to customers from a 
distribution center or retail store. The ship-from- store capability allows us to improve product avail ability and delivery times for customers. 
Most merchandise for our U.S. Best Buy, U.S. Best B uy Mobile, Magnolia Audio Video and Pacific Sales s tores is shipped directly from 
manufacturers to our distribution centers or wareho uses located throughout the U.S. In order to meet r elease dates for certain products, 
merchandise may be shipped directly to our stores f rom suppliers.  
 
International Segment  
 
Canada’s online merchandise sales are picked up at our stores, delivered directly to customers from a distribution center or retail store, or 
delivered directly to the customer from the vendor.  Our Canada stores' merchandise is shipped directly  from our suppliers to our Canadian 
distribution centers. In order to meet release date s for certain products, merchandise may also be shi pped directly to our stores from suppliers.  
 
Our stores in Mexico have distribution methods simi lar to that of our U.S. Best Buy stores.

Suppliers and Inventory  
 
Our Domestic and International segments purchase me rchandise from a variety of suppliers. In fiscal 20 15, our 20 largest suppliers accounted 
for approximately 73% of the merchandise we purchas ed, with 5 suppliers – Apple, Samsung, Hewlett-Pack ard, Sony and LG Electronics – 
representing approximately 47% of total merchandise  purchased. We generally do not have long-term cont racts with our major suppliers that 
require them to continue supplying us with merchand ise.  
 
We carefully monitor and manage our inventory level s to match quantities on hand with consumer demand as closely as possible. Key elements 
to our inventory management process include the fol lowing: continuous monitoring of historical and pro jected consumer demand, continuous 
monitoring and adjustment of inventory receipt leve ls, agreements with vendors relating to reimburseme nt for the cost of markdowns or sales 
incentives and agreements with vendors relating to return privileges for certain products.  
 
We also have a global sourcing operation to design,  develop, test and contract-manufacture our own lin e of exclusive brand products.  
 
Store Development  
 
We had over 1,700 large and small-format stores at the end of fiscal 2015 throughout our Domestic and International segments. We believe this 
store footprint represents an advantage that we can  leverage as we continue to transform our business.  In the U.S., we have the ability to ship 
from all of our Best Buy stores, and we have opened  a number of vendor store-within-a-store concepts t o better leverage our square footage. In 
fiscal 2016 and beyond, we will continue to look fo r opportunities to optimize our store space, renego tiating leases and selectively opening or 
closing locations to support our ongoing transforma tion.  
 
In March 2015, we made a decision to consolidate Fu ture Shop and Best Buy stores and websites in Canad a under the Best Buy brand. This 
resulted in permanently closing 66 Future Shop stor es and converting 65 Future Shop stores to the Best  Buy brand.  
 
Refer to Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial C ondition and Results of Operations, for tables reconciling our Domestic 
and International segment stores open at the end of  each of the last three fiscal years.  
 
Intellectual Property  
 
We own or have the right to use valuable intellectu al property such as trademarks, service marks and t radenames, including, but not limited to, 
Best Buy, Best Buy Mobile, Dynex, Future Shop, Geek  Squad, Init, Insignia, Magnolia, Modal, My Best Bu y, Pacific Sales, Rocketfish , and our 
Yellow Tag logo.  
 
We have secured domestic and international trademar k and service mark registrations for many of our br ands. We have also secured patents for 
many of our inventions. We believe our intellectual  property has significant value and is an important  factor in the marketing of our company, 
our stores, our products and our websites.  
 
Seasonality  
 
Our business, like that of many retailers, is seaso nal. A higher proportion of our revenue and earning s is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, 
which includes the majority of the holiday shopping  season in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.  
 
Working Capital  
 
We fund our business operations through a combinati on of available cash and cash equivalents, short-te rm investments and cash flows generated 
from operations. In addition, our revolving credit facilities are available for additional working cap ital needs, for general corporate purposes and 
investment opportunities. Our working capital needs  typically increase in the months leading up to the  holiday shopping season as we purchase 
inventory in advance of expected sales.  
 
Competition  
 
Our competitors are primarily traditional store-bas ed retailers, multi-channel retailers, internet- based businesses and vendors and mobile network 
carriers who offer their products directly to the c onsumer.  
 
 
6  
Table of Contents  
 
Some of our competitors have low cost operating str uctures and seek to compete for sales primarily on price. In addition, in the U.S., online- only 
operators are exempt from collecting sales taxes in  certain states. We believe this advantage will con tinue to be eroded as sales tax rules are re-
evaluated at both the state and federal levels. We carefully monitor pricing offered by other retailer s, and maintaining price competitiveness is 
one of our ongoing priorities. In addition, we have  a price-matching policy in the U.S. that allows cu stomers to request that we match a price 
offered by certain retail store and online operator s. In order to allow this, we are focused on mainta ining efficient operations and leveraging the 
economies of scale available to us through our glob al vendor partnerships.  
 
In addition to price, we believe our ability to del iver a high quality customer experience offers us a  key competitive advantage. We believe our 
dedicated and knowledgeable people, integrated onli ne and store channels, broad product assortment, ra nge of focused service and support 
offerings, distinct store formats, brand marketing strategies and supply chain are important ways in w hich we maintain this advantage.  
 
Environmental Matters  
 
Best Buy is committed to creating a thriving busine ss while lessening our environmental impact. In the  U.S., consumers recycle more electronics 
through Best Buy than any other retailer. In fiscal  2015, we collected more than 126 million pounds of  consumer electronics and 110 million 
pounds of appliances, helping us meet our goal of c ollecting one billion pounds (set in 2009). The rec ycling program remains an important 
offering in supporting our customers, communities a nd the environment.  
 
We offer a large selection of energy-efficient prod ucts, which help our customers save money by using less energy. Best Buy’s U.S. customers 
purchased more than 25 million ENERGY STAR® certifi ed products in fiscal 2015 and realized utility bil l savings of more than $71 million. 
These energy savings equate to over 900 million pou nds of CO 2 avoidance, or the equivalent of removing more than 86,000 cars from U.S. 
roads.  
 
We are continuously working to make our locations m ore sustainable and to increase efficiency within o ur supply chain. In calendar 2010, we 
set a goal of reducing our absolute carbon emission s in North America by 20% by the year 2020 (over a 2009 baseline).To date, these energy 
efficiency measures reduced more than 200,000 metri c tons of CO 2 emissions and helped us to exceed our goal of 20%.  
 
We are not aware of any federal, state or local pro visions that have been enacted or adopted regulatin g the discharge of materials into the 
environment, or otherwise relating to the protectio n of the environment, that have materially affected , or are reasonably expected to materially 
affect, our net earnings or competitive position, o r have resulted, or are reasonably expected to resu lt in, material capital expenditures. See 
Item 1A, Risk Factors , for additional discussion.  
 
Number of Employees  
 
At the end of fiscal 2015, we employed approximatel y 125,000 full-time, part-time and seasonal employe es in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and our 
sourcing office in China. We consider our employee relations to be good. We offer our employees a wide  array of company-paid benefits that 
vary within our company due to customary local prac tices and statutory requirements, which we believe are competitive in the aggregate relative 
to others in our industry.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.  
 
Described below are certain risks that we believe a pply to our business and the industry in which we o perate. You should carefully consider each 
of the following risk factors in conjunction with o ther information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public 
disclosures. The risks described below highlight po tential events, trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business, financial 
condition, results of operations, cash flows, liqui dity or access to sources of financing, and consequ ently, the market value of our common stock 
and debt instruments. These risks could cause our f uture results to differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide 
regarding our expectations of future financial perf ormance. The risks described below are not an exhau stive list of all the risks we face. There 
may be others that we have not identified or that w e have deemed to be immaterial. All forward-looking  statements made by us or on our behalf 
are qualified by the risks described below.  
 
We face strong competition from traditional store-b ased retailers, multi-channel retailers, internet-b ased businesses, our vendors and 
other forms of retail commerce, which directly affe cts our sales and margins.  
 
The retail business is highly competitive. Price is  of primary importance to customers and price trans parency and comparability continues to 
increase, particularly as a result of digital techn ology. The ability of consumers to compare prices o n a real-time basis puts additional pressure on 
us to maintain competitive prices to attract custom ers. We compete with many other local, regional, na tional and international retailers, as well 
as certain of our vendors who offer their products directly to consumers. Some of our competitors have  greater market presence and financial 
resources than we do. The retail industry continues  to experience a trend toward an increase in sales initiated online and using mobile 
applications, and some online-only businesses are n ot required to collect and remit sales taxes in all  U.S. states, which can negatively impact the 
ability of multi-channel retailers to be price comp etitive. Online and multi-channel retailers are als o increasing their focus on delivery services, 
with customers increasingly seeking faster, guarant eed delivery times and low-price or free shipping. Our ability to be competitive on delivery 
times and delivery cost depends on many factors, an d our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options 
could negatively impact the demand for our products . In addition, because our business strategy is bas ed on offering superior levels of customer 
service utilizing a multi-channel platform, our cos t structure is higher than some of our competitors.  Changes in the levels of these various 
competitive factors may have a significant impact o n consumer demand for our products and services and  the margins we can generate from 
them.  
 
Failure to anticipate and respond to changing consu mer preferences in a timely manner could result in a decline in our sales.  
 
Our success depends on our vendors' and our ability  to successfully introduce new products, services a nd technologies to consumers, including, 
among other factors, the frequency of product and s ervice innovations, how accurately we predict consu mer preferences, the level of consumer 
demand, the availability of merchandise, the relate d impact on the demand for existing products and th e competitive environment. Consumers 
continue to have a wide variety of choices in terms  of how and where they purchase the products and se rvices we sell. Failure to accurately 
predict and adapt to constantly changing technology  and consumer preferences, spending patterns and ot her lifestyle decisions, could have a 
material adverse effect on our revenues and results  of operations.  
 
Macroeconomic pressures in the U.S. and key interna tional markets could adversely affect consumer spen ding and our financial results. 
 
Some of our products and services are viewed by som e consumers to be discretionary items rather than n ecessities. As a result, our results of 
operations are sensitive to changes in macroeconomi c conditions that impact consumer spending. Consume r confidence, employment levels, oil 
prices, interest rates, tax rates, availability of consumer financing, housing market conditions, and costs for items such as fuel and food, can 
adversely affect consumers' demand for the products  and services that we offer. Our future results cou ld be significantly adversely impacted by 
these factors.

Our performance is highly dependent on attracting a nd retaining qualified employees, including our sen ior management team and other key 
employees. Our strategy of offering high quality se rvices and assistance for our customers requires a highly trained and engaged workforce. The 
turnover rate in the retail industry is relatively high, and there is an ongoing need to recruit and t rain new employees. Factors that affect our 
ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified  employees include employee morale, our reputation,  unemployment rates, competition from 
other employers and our ability to offer appropriat e compensation packages. Our inability to recruit a  sufficient number of qualified individuals 
or failure to retain key employees in the future ma y impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our a bility to pursue growth opportunities. In 
addition, a significant amount of turnover of senio r management employees with specific knowledge rela ting to us, our operations and our 
industry may negatively impact our operations.  
 
Consumer demand for the products and services we se ll could decline if we fail to maintain positive br and perception and recognition.  
 
We operate a portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation. We believe that  recognition and the reputation of our 
brands are key to our success. The proliferation of  web-based social media means that consumer feedbac k and other information about our 
company are shared with a broad audience in a manne r that is easily accessible and rapidly disseminate d. Damage to the perception or reputation 
of our brands could result in declines in customer loyalty, lower employee retention and productivity,  vendor relationship issues, and other 
factors, all of which could materially affect our p rofitability.  
 
Our success is dependent on the design and executio n of appropriate business strategies.  
 
We operate in a highly-competitive and ever- changing commercial environment. Our success is dep endent on our ability to identify, develop and 
execute appropriate strategies within this environm ent. Our current strategy includes transformational  change to many areas of our business, 
including our online and in- store customer experience, our distribution system,  employee training and engagement, partnership with  our vendors, 
retail execution, services and cost control. We may  experience challenges in achieving the goals we ha ve set, and it is possible that our strategies 
may prove to be ineffective and that we may need to  make substantial changes to them in future periods . It is also possible that we will be 
unsuccessful in executing our strategies, that the strategies we will implement expose us to additiona l risks or that strategies that have been 
successful in the past will fail to produce the des ired results. Our results could be materially adver sely affected if we fail to design and execute 
appropriate strategies. The market value of our com mon stock and debt instruments could be materially adversely affected if investors are 
uncertain about the appropriateness of our strategi es or our ability to execute them.  
 
Refer to Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial C ondition and Results of Operations , for further information regarding our 
strategies.  
 
Failure to effectively manage our property portfoli o may negatively impact our operating results.  
 
Effective management of our large property portfoli o is critical to our success. We primarily secure p roperties through operating leases with 
third-party landlords. If we fail to negotiate appropriat e terms for new leases we enter into, we may incur lease costs that are excessive and cause 
operating margins to be below acceptable levels. We  may also make term commitments that are too long o r too short, without the option to exit 
early or extend. The availability of suitable new p roperty locations may also hinder our ability to ma intain or grow our operations. Factors such 
as the condition of local property markets, availab ility of lease financing, taxes, zoning and environ mental issues, and competitive actions may 
impact the availability for suitable property.  
 
We have closed stores, and we may close additional stores or other facilities in the future. For lease d property, the financial impact of exiting a 
property can vary greatly depending on, among other  factors, the terms of the lease, the condition of the local property market, demand for the 
specific property, our relationship with the landlo rd and the availability of potential sub-lease tena nts. It is difficult for us to influence some of 
these factors. If these factors are unfavorable to us, then the costs of exiting a property can be sig nificant. When we enter into a contract with a 
tenant to sub-lease property, we remain at risk of default by the tenant and the impact of such defaul ts on our future results could be significant.

Failure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.  
 
Certain elements of our cost structure are largely fixed in nature. Demand for our products and servic es is difficult to predict, which makes it 
more challenging for us to maintain or increase our  operating income. The competitiveness in our indus try and increasing price transparency 
mean that the focus on achieving efficient operatio ns is greater than ever. As a result, we must conti nuously focus on managing our cost 
structure. Failure to manage our labor and benefit rates, advertising and marketing expenses, operatin g leases, other store expenses or indirect 
spending could severely impair our ability to maint ain our price competitiveness while achieving accep table levels of profitability.  
 
Our liquidity may be materially adversely affected by constraints in the capital markets or our vendor  credit terms.  
 
We need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our  working capital requirements, service our outstand ing indebtedness and finance investment 
opportunities. Without sufficient liquidity, we cou ld be forced to curtail our operations or we may no t be able to pursue business opportunities. 
The principal sources of our liquidity are funds ge nerated from operating activities, available cash a nd liquid investments, credit facilities, other 
debt arrangements and trade payables. Our liquidity  could be materially adversely impacted if our vend ors reduce payment terms and/or impose 
tighter credit limits. If our sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements, we may need to see k additional financing. The future availability 
of financing will depend on a variety of factors, s uch as economic and market conditions, the regulato ry environment for banks and other 
financial institutions, the availability of credit and our credit ratings, and our reputation with pot ential lenders. These factors could materially 
adversely affect our costs of borrowing and our abi lity to pursue growth opportunities, and threaten o ur ability to meet our obligations as they 
become due.  
 
Changes in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase our borrowing co sts.  
 
In fiscal 2015, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. mai ntained its long-term credit rating at Baa2 and rev ised its outlook from Negative to Stable. 
Fitch Ratings Ltd. upgraded its long-term credit ra ting from BB- to BB, maintaining its outlook as Sta ble. Standard & Poor's Ratings Services 
maintained their long-term credit rating at BB with  a Stable outlook.  
 
Future downgrades to our credit ratings and outlook  could negatively impact our access to capital mark ets, the borrowing cost for future 
financings and the perception of our credit risk by  lenders and other third parties. Our credit rating s are based upon information furnished by us 
or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources  and are subject to revision, suspension or withdra wal by one or more rating agencies at any 
time. Rating agencies may change the ratings assign ed to us due to developments that are beyond our co ntrol, including the introduction of new 
rating practices and methodologies.  
 
Any downgrade may result in higher interest costs f or certain of our credit facilities and could resul t in higher interest costs on future financings. 
In addition, downgrades may impact our ability to o btain adequate financing, including via trade payab les with our vendors. Customers' 
inclination to shop with us or purchase gift cards or extended warranties may also be affected by the publicity associated with deterioration of 
our credit ratings.  
 
Failure to effectively manage strategic ventures or  acquisitions could have a negative impact on our b usiness.  
 
From time to time, our strategy has involved, and m ay in the future involve, entering into new busines s ventures and strategic alliances, as well 
as making acquisitions. Assessing a potential oppor tunity can be based on assumptions that might not u ltimately prove to be correct. In addition, 
the amount of information we can obtain about a pot ential opportunity may be limited, and we can give no assurance that new business ventures, 
strategic alliances and acquisitions will positivel y affect our financial performance or will perform as planned. The success of these opportunities 
is also largely dependent on the current and future  participation, working relationship and strategic vision of the business venture or strategic 
alliance partners, which can change following a tra nsaction. Integrating new businesses, stores and co ncepts can be a difficult task. Cultural 
differences in some markets into which we may expan d or into which we may introduce new retail concept s may not be as well received by 
customers as originally anticipated. These types of  transactions may divert our capital and our manage ment's attention from other business issues 
and opportunities and may also negatively impact ou r return on invested capital. Further, implementing  new partnerships, strategic alliances or 
business ventures may also impair our relationships  with our vendors or other strategic partners. We m ay not be able to successfully assimilate or 
integrate companies that we acquire, including thei r personnel, financial systems, distribution, opera tions and general operating procedures. We 
may also encounter challenges in achieving appropri ate internal control over financial reporting and d eficiencies in information technology 
systems in connection with the integration of an ac quired company. If we fail to assimilate or integra te acquired companies successfully, our 
business, reputation and operating results could su ffer materially. Likewise, our failure to integrate  and manage acquired companies successfully 
may lead to impairment of the associated goodwill a nd intangible asset balances.

Failure to protect the integrity, security and conf identiality of our employee and customer data could  expose us to litigation costs and 
materially damage our standing with our customers.  
 
The use and handling of personally identifiable dat a by our business, our business associates and thir d parties is regulated at the state, federal and 
international levels. We are also contractually obl igated to comply with certain industry standards re garding payment card information. 
Increasing costs associated with information securi ty, such as increased investment in technology and qualified staff, the costs of compliance and 
costs resulting from fraud could cause our business  and results of operations to suffer materially. Ad ditionally, the success of our online 
operations depends upon the secure transmission of customer and other confidential information over pu blic networks, including the use of 
cashless payments. While we take significant steps to protect this information, lapses in our controls  or the intentional or negligent actions of 
employees, business associates or third parties may  undermine our security measures. As a result, unau thorized parties may obtain access to our 
data systems and misappropriate employee, customer and other confidential data. There can be no assura nce that advances in computer 
capabilities, new discoveries in the field of crypt ography or other developments will prevent the comp romise of our customer transaction 
processing capabilities and customer personal data.  Furthermore, because the methods used to obtain un authorized access change frequently and 
may not be immediately detected, we may be unable t o anticipate these methods or promptly implement pr eventative measures. Any such 
compromise of our security or the security of infor mation residing with our business associates or thi rd parties could have a material adverse 
effect on our reputation, which may in turn have a negative impact on our sales, and may expose us to material costs, penalties and compensation 
claims. In addition, any compromise of our data sec urity may materially increase the costs we incur to  protect against such breaches and could 
subject us to additional legal risk.  
 
Our reliance on key vendors and mobile network carr iers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties  which could affect our operating 
results.  
 
We source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. In fiscal 20 15, our 20 largest suppliers accounted for 
approximately 73% of the merchandise we purchased, with 5 suppliers – Apple, Samsung, Hewlett-Packard,  Sony and LG Electronics – 
representing approximately 47% of total merchandise  purchased. We generally do not have long-term writ ten contracts with our vendors that 
would require them to continue supplying us with me rchandise. We depend on our vendors for, among othe r things, appropriate allocation of 
merchandise, development of compelling assortments of products, operation of vendor-focused shopping e xperiences within our stores, 
acceptance of product returns, approval and payment  for factory warranty claims and funding for variou s forms of promotional programs. To 
varying degrees, our vendors may be able to leverag e their financial strength, customer popularity or alternative channels (including, in some 
instances, our vendors’ own retail locations or web sites) to influence these factors and other factors  to our commercial disadvantage. Such 
changes could have a material adverse impact on our  revenues and profitability.  
 
We are also dependent on mobile network carriers to  allow us to offer mobile devices with carrier conn ections. The competitive strategies 
utilized by mobile network carriers can have a mate rial impact on our revenues and margins. For exampl e, if carriers change customer upgrade 
terms, monthly fee plans, cancellation fees or serv ice levels, the volume of upgrades and new contract s we sign with customers may be reduced, 
adversely affecting our revenues and profitability.  In addition, many of our carriers also serve custo mers through their own stores, websites, 
mobile applications and call centers. If customers choose to upgrade or make new connections through c arriers directly, rather than through us, 
our revenues and profitability could be adversely a ffected. We could also experience declines in reven ue and profitability if our carriers decided 
not to allow us to market their products or service s.  
 
We have internal standards that we require all of o ur vendors to meet. Our ability to find qualified v endors who meet our standards and supply 
products in a timely and efficient manner is a sign ificant challenge, especially with respect to goods  sourced from outside the U.S. Political or 
financial instability, merchandise quality issues, product safety concerns, trade restrictions, work s toppages, port delays, tariffs, foreign currency 
exchange rates, transportation capacity and costs, inflation, civil unrest, natural disasters, outbrea ks of pandemics and other factors relating to 
foreign trade are beyond our control. These and oth er issues affecting our vendors could materially ad versely affect our financial results.  
 
Changes in the demand for our service offerings cou ld have a material adverse impact on our operating results.  
 
Our customer promises include provision of a full r ange of services to complement our product offering s, including extended warranties, 
delivery, installation, technical support, network set-up and repair services. Many of these service o fferings are through our Geek Squad brand, 
which provides an opportunity to deliver superior c ustomer service and drives incremental revenue and income – often through attachment of 
these services at the point of sale. As customers i ncreasingly migrate to websites and mobile applicat ions to initiate transactions, there is a risk 
that we are unsuccessful in effectively promoting t he benefits of these complementary service offering s through those channels. If we fail to 
design and market these services  
 
11 
Table of Contents  
 
effectively to our customers or fail to meet our cu stomers’ expectations in the execution of these ser vices, our revenues and income could be 
adversely affected.  
 
Natural disasters, changes in climate and geo-polit ical events could adversely affect our operating re sults.  
 
The threat or occurrence of one or more natural dis asters or other extreme weather events, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, the 
threat or outbreak of terrorism, civil unrest or ot her hostilities or conflicts, could materially adve rsely affect our financial performance. These 
events may result in damage to or destruction or cl osure of, our stores, distribution centers and othe r properties. Such events can also adversely 
affect our work force and prevent employees and cus tomers from reaching our stores and other propertie s, can modify consumer purchasing 
patterns and decrease disposable income, and can di srupt or disable portions of our supply chain and d istribution network.  
 
Our exclusive brands products are subject to severa l additional product, supply chain and legal risks that could affect our operating 
results.  
 
Sales of our exclusive brands products, which prima rily include Insignia, Modal, Dynex, Init, Platinum  and Rocketfish branded products, 
represent an important component of our revenue. Mo st of these products are manufactured by contracted  manufacturers based in southeastern 
Asia. This arrangement exposes us to the following additional potential risks, which could materially adversely affect our reputation, financial 
condition and operating results:  
 
 
Maintaining consistent quality, availability and co mpetitive pricing of our exclusive brands products helps us build and maintain customer 
loyalty, generate sales and achieve acceptable marg ins. Failure to maintain these factors could have a  significant adverse impact on the demand 
for exclusive brand products and the margins we are  able to generate from them.  
 
We are subject to certain statutory, regulatory and  legal developments which could have a material adv erse impact on our business.  
 
Our statutory, regulatory and legal environments ex pose us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could materially adversely affect our 
operations and financial results. The most signific ant compliance and litigation risks we face are:  
 
 
12  •  We have greater exposure and responsibility to c onsumers for warranty replacements and repairs as a  result of exclusive brand product 
defects, and our recourse to contracted manufacture rs for such warranty liabilities may be limited in foreign jurisdictions;  
•  We may be subject to regulatory compliance and/or p roduct liability claims relating to personal injury , death or property damage caused 
by exclusive brand products, some of which may requ ire us to take significant actions such as product recalls;  
•  We may experience disruptions in manufacturing o r logistics due to inconsistent and unanticipated o rder patterns, our inability to 
develop long-term relationships with key factories or unforeseen natural disasters;  
•  We may not be able to locate manufacturers that mee t our internal standards, whether for new exclusive  brand products or for migration 
of the manufacturing of products from an existing m anufacturer;  
•  We are subject to developing and often-changing labor and environmental laws for the manufacture of  products in foreign countries, 
and we may be unable to conform to new rules or int erpretations in a timely manner;  
•  We may be subject to claims by technology or other intellectual property owners if we inadvertently in fringe upon their patents or other 
intellectual property rights, or if we fail to pay royalties owed on our exclusive brand products;  
•  We may be unable to obtain or adequately protect  patents and other intellectual property rights on our exclusive brand products or 
manufacturing processes; and  
•  Regulations regarding disclosure of efforts to i dentify the country of origin of “conflict minerals ” in certain portions of our supply chain 
could increase the cost of doing business and, depe nding on the findings of our country of origin inqu iry, could have an adverse effect 
on our reputation.  
•  The difficulty of complying with sometimes conflict ing statutes and regulations in local, national or international jurisdictions; 
•  The potential for unexpected costs related to ne w or compliance with existing environmental legisla tion or international agreements 
affecting energy, carbon emissions, electronics rec ycling and water or product materials;  
•  The impact of new regulations governing data pri vacy and security, whether imposed as a result of i ncreased cyber-security risks or 
otherwise;  
•  The impact of other new or changing statutes and  regulations including, but not limited to, financi al reform, National Labor Relations 
Board rule changes, health care reform, corporate g overnance matters and/or other as yet unknown legis lation, that could affect how we 
operate and execute our strategies as well as alter  our expense structure;  
Table of Contents  
 
 
Regulatory activity focused on the retail industry has grown in recent years, increasing the risk of f ines and additional operating costs associated 
with compliance. Additionally, defending against la wsuits and other proceedings may involve significan t expense and divert management's 
attention and resources from other matters.  
 
Changes to the National Labor Relations Act or othe r labor-related statutes or regulations could have an adverse impact on our costs 
and impair the viability of our operating model.  
 
The National Labor Relations Board continually cons iders changes to labor regulations, many of which c ould significantly impact the nature of 
labor relations in the U.S. and how union organizin g and union elections are conducted. The U.S. Depar tment of Labor is considering new 
regulations requiring companies to publicly report the use and associated expense of external resource s providing labor relations guidance and 
advice. As of January 31, 2015, none of our U.S. op erations had employees represented by labor unions or working under collective bargaining 
agreements. Changes in labor-related statutes or re gulations could increase the percentage of election s won by unions. If any segment of Best 
Buy’s operations became unionized, it could increas e our costs of doing business and adversely affect our operations.  
 
Economic, regulatory and other developments could a dversely affect the profitability of our promotiona l financing and credit card 
arrangements and our promotional financing offering s and therefore our operating results.  
   
We offer promotional financing and credit cards iss ued by a third-party bank that manages and directly  extends credit to our customers. The 
cardholders can receive low- or no-interest promoti onal financing on qualifying purchases. Total reven ues from these programs accounted for 
approximately 20% of our revenue in fiscal 2015. We  view these arrangements as a way to generate incre mental sales of products and services 
from customers who prefer the financing terms to ot her available forms of payment. In addition, we ear n profit-share income from our banking 
partners based on the performance of the credit car d portfolio, and the amount of income we earn in th is regard is subject to numerous factors 
such as the volume of credit card or financing tran sactions, bad debt rates, interest rates, the regul atory environment and expenses of operating 
the program. Adverse changes to any of these factor s could impair our ability to offer these programs to customers and reduce our ability to earn 
income from sharing in the profits of the program.  
   
We rely heavily on our information technology syste ms for our key business processes. Any failure or i nterruption in these systems 
could have a material adverse impact on our busines s.  
   
The effective and efficient operation of our busine ss is dependent on our management information syste ms. We rely heavily on our management 
information systems to manage all key aspects of ou r business, including demand forecasting, purchasin g, supply chain management, point-of-
sale processing, staff planning and deployment, web site offerings, financial management and forecastin g and safeguarding critical and sensitive 
information. The failure of our management informat ion systems to perform as we anticipate, or to meet  the continuously evolving needs of our 
business, could significantly disrupt our business and cause, for example, higher costs and lost reven ues and could threaten our ability to remain 
in operation.  
 
In addition, we utilize complex information technol ogy platforms to operate our websites and mobile ap plications. Disruptions to these services, 
such as those caused by unforeseen traffic levels o r other technical difficulties, could cause us to f orego material revenues and adversely affect 
our reputation with consumers.  
   
We utilize third-party vendors for certain aspects of our business operations.  
   
We engage key third-party business partners to supp ort various functions of our business, including bu t not limited to, information technology, 
human resource operations, customer loyalty program s, promotional financing and customer loyalty credi t cards, customer warranty and 
insurance programs. Any material disruption in our relationship with key third-party business partners  or any disruption in the services or 
systems provided or managed by third parties could impact our revenues and cost structure and hinder o ur ability to continue operations, 
particularly if a disruption occurs during peak rev enue periods.  
   
 
13 •  The impact of changes in tax laws (or interpretatio ns thereof by courts and taxing authorities) and ac counting standards; and 
•  The impact of litigation trends, including class  action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholde rs, and labor and employment 
matters.

We are highly dependent on the cash flows and net e arnings we generate during our fourth fiscal quarte r, which includes the majority 
of the holiday shopping season.  
   
Approximately one-third of our revenue and more tha n one-half of our net earnings have historically be en generated in our fourth fiscal quarter, 
which includes the majority of the holiday shopping  season in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Unexpected events or developments such as natural 
or man-made disasters, product sourcing issues, fai lure or interruption of management information syst ems, disruptions in services or systems 
provided or managed by third-party vendors or adver se economic conditions in our fourth fiscal quarter  could have a material adverse effect on 
our annual results of operations.  
 
Our revenues and margins are highly sensitive to de velopments in products and services.  
   
The consumer electronics industry involves constant  innovation and evolution of products and services offered to consumers. The following 
examples demonstrate the impact this can have on ou r business:  
   
 
Many of the factors described above are not control lable by us. The factors can have a material advers e impact on our relevance to the consumer 
and the demand for products and services we have tr aditionally offered. It is possible that these and similar changes could materially affect our 
revenues and profitability.  
 
Our international activities are subject to many of  the same risks as described above, as well as to r isks associated with the legislative, 
judicial, regulatory, political and economic factor s specific to the countries or regions in which we operate.  
   
We operate international retail locations in Canada  and Mexico. In addition, we have a presence in var ious other foreign countries, including 
Bermuda, China, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Luxembou rg, the Republic of Mauritius, the Netherlands, Tai wan, Turks and Caicos, and the 
U.K. During fiscal 2015, our International segment' s operations generated 11% of our revenue. Our futu re operating results in these countries 
and in other countries or regions throughout the wo rld where we may operate in the future could be mat erially adversely affected by a variety of 
factors, many of which are beyond our control, incl uding political conditions, economic conditions, le gal and regulatory constraints, foreign 
trade rules and monetary and fiscal policies (both of the U.S. and of other countries). In addition, f oreign currency exchange rates and 
fluctuations may have an impact on our future reven ues, earnings and cash flows from International ope rations and could materially adversely 
affect our reported financial performance.  
   
Our International segment's operations face other r isks as well, including the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, greater 
difficulty in enforcing intellectual property right s in countries other than the U.S., and potential a dverse tax consequences. The various risks 
inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally al so exist when doing business outside of the U.S. an d may be exaggerated by differences in 
culture, laws and regulations. There is a heightene d risk that we misjudge the response of consumers i n foreign markets to our product and 
service assortments, marketing and promotional stra tegy and store and website designs, among other fac tors, and this could adversely impact the 
results of these operations and the viability of th ese ventures.  
 
 
14  •  Following the introduction of tablets, their sal es grew rapidly and changed the market for mobile c omputing devices; however, the 
market has declined rapidly in fiscal 2015 as deman d levels have fallen due to market saturation and m inimal product innovation;  
•  Product convergence has significantly impacted t he demand for some products; for example, the growt h of increasingly sophisticated 
smartphones has reduced the demand for separate cam eras, gaming systems, music players and GPS devices ;  
•  The timing of new product introductions and upda tes can have a dramatic impact on the timing of rev enues; for example, the 
introduction of new gaming systems can produce high  demand levels for hardware and the accompanying so ftware, which may be 
followed by several years of decline in demand;  
•  Delivery models for some products are affected b y technological advances and new product innovation s; for example, media such as 
music, video and gaming is increasingly transferrin g to digital delivery methods that may reduce the n eed for physical CD, DVD, Blu-
ray and gaming products; and  
•  Disruptions in the availability of content (such  as sporting events or other broadcast programming)  may influence the demand for 
hardware that our customers purchase to access such  content, as well as the commission we receive from  service providers.

Our business, like that of many retailers, is seaso nal. Historically, we have realized more of our rev enue and earnings in the fiscal fourth quarter, 
which includes the majority of the holiday shopping  season in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. While consu mers view some of the products and 
services we offer as essential, others are viewed a s discretionary purchases. Consequently, our financ ial results are susceptible to changes in 
consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors , including unemployment, consumer credit availabil ity and the condition of the housing 
market. Additionally, there are other factors that directly impact our performance, such as product li fe-cycles (including the introduction and 
pace of adoption of new technology) and the competi tive retail environment. As a result of these facto rs, predicting our future revenue and net 
earnings is difficult.  
 
Throughout this MD&A, we refer to comparable sales.  Our comparable sales calculation compares revenue from stores, websites and call 
centers operating for at least 14 full months, as w ell as revenue related to certain other comparable sales channels for a particular period to the 
corresponding period in the prior year. Relocated s tores, as well as remodeled, expanded and downsized  stores closed more than 14 days, are 
excluded from the comparable sales calculation unti l at least 14 full months after reopening. Acquisit ions are included in the comparable sales 
calculation beginning with the first full quarter f ollowing the first anniversary of the date of the a cquisition. The portion of the calculation of 
comparable sales attributable to our International segment excludes the effect of fluctuations in fore ign currency exchange rates. The calculation 
of comparable sales excludes the impact of revenue from discontinued operations. Comparable online sal es are included in our comparable sales 
calculation. The method of calculating comparable s ales varies across the retail industry. As a result , our method of calculating comparable sales 
may not be the same as other retailers' methods.  
 
In our discussions of the operating results of our consolidated business and our International segment , we sometimes refer to the impact of 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the i mpact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation s, which are references to the differences 
between the foreign currency exchange rates we use to convert the International segment’s operating re sults from local currencies into U.S. 
dollars for reporting purposes. The impact of forei gn currency exchange rate fluctuations is typically  calculated as the difference between current 
period activity translated using the current period ’s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior -year period’ s currency exchange rates. We 
use this method to calculate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for all countrie s where the functional currency is not the 
U.S. dollar.  
 
In our discussions of the operating results below, we sometimes refer to the impact of net new stores on our results of operations. The key factors 
that dictate the impact that the net new stores hav e on our operating results include: (i) store openi ng and closing decisions; (ii) the size and 
format of new stores, as we operate stores ranging from approximately 1,000 square feet to approximate ly 50,000 square feet; (iii) the length of 
time the stores were open during the period; and (i v) the overall success of new store launches.  
 
This MD&A includes financial information prepared i n accordance with accounting principles generally a ccepted in the United States 
("GAAP"), as well as certain adjusted or non-GAAP f inancial measures such as non-GAAP operating income , non-GAAP net earnings from 
continuing operations, non-GAAP diluted earnings pe r share from continuing operations and adjusted deb t to earnings before goodwill 
impairment, interest, income taxes, depreciation, a mortization and rent ("EBITDAR") ratio. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a 
numerical measure of financial performance, financi al position or cash flows that excludes (or include s) amounts that are included in (or 
excluded from) the most directly comparable measure  calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures 
should be viewed as a supplement to, and not a subs titute for, financial measures presented in accorda nce with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures as 
presented herein may not be comparable to similarly  titled measures used by other companies.  
 
We believe that the non-GAAP measures described abo ve provide meaningful supplemental information to a ssist shareholders in understanding 
our financial results and assessing our prospects f or future performance. Management believes adjusted  operating income, adjusted net earnings 
from continuing operations and adjusted diluted ear nings per share from continuing operations are impo rtant indicators of our operations because 
they exclude items that may not be indicative of, o r are unrelated to, our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our 
underlying businesses. Management makes standard ad justments for items such as restructuring charges, goodwill impairments, non-
restructuring asset impairments and gains or losses  on investments, as well as adjustments for other i tems that may arise during the period and 
have a meaningful impact on comparability. To measu re adjusted operating income, we removed the impact  of the second quarter of fiscal 2014 
LCD-related legal settlements, non-restructuring as set impairments, restructuring charges and goodwill  impairments from our calculation of 
operating income. Adjusted net earnings from contin uing operations was calculated by removing the afte r-tax impact of operating income 
adjustments and the gains on investments, as well a s the income tax impacts of reorganizing certain Eu ropean legal entities and the Best Buy 
Europe sale from our calculation of net earnings fr om continuing operations. To measure adjusted dilut ed earnings per share from continuing 
operations, we excluded the per share impact of net  earnings adjustments from our calculation of dilut ed earnings per share. Management 
believes our adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio is an i mportant indicator of our creditworthiness. Because  non-GAAP financial measures are not 
standardized, it may not be possible

to compare these financial measures with other comp anies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These non-GAAP 
financial measures are an additional way of viewing  aspects of our operations that, when viewed with o ur GAAP results and the reconciliations 
to corresponding GAAP financial measures within our  discussion of consolidated performance below, prov ide a more complete understanding of 
our business. We strongly encourage investors and s hareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and 
not to rely on any single financial measure.  
 
Business Strategy  
 
In the fall of 2012, we laid out for investors the state of our business and summarized the challenges  we faced by articulating two fundamental 
problems: (1) declining comparable sales and (2) de clining margins. To address these problems and achi eve our goal of becoming the leading 
authority and destination for technology products a nd services, we unveiled our Renew Blue transformat ion effort, incorporating the following 
five pillars:  
 
 
Fiscal 2015 was the second full fiscal year in our Renew Blue transformation, and we continued to make  progress against the two main problems 
we had to solve that we outlined in November of 201 2 – declining comparable sales and declining operat ing margins. In fiscal 2015, we 
stabilized comparable sales on a full year basis an d delivered incremental non- GAAP SG&A reductions of approximately $420 million,  resulting 
in non-GAAP operating income rate expansion of 0.8%  of revenue and a 26% increase in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to $2.60. We 
also ended the year with $3.9 billion in cash, cash  equivalents and short-term investments versus $2.6  billion last year.  
 
These results reflect the cumulative progress since  2012 that we have made against our Renew Blue tran sformation initiatives. To date, we have: 
(1) improved our Net Promoter Score (NPS) by 450 ba sis points; (2) rolled out 71 Pacific Kitchen and H ome and 34 Magnolia Design Center 
stores-within-a-store in addition to our enhanced v endor experiences; (3) implemented ship-from-store across the whole chain, driving 
significant growth for our business; (4) increased our Domestic online penetration from 7.0% to 9.8%; (5) gained share across multiple 
categories; (6) delivered $1.02 billion in cost red uctions, exceeding our $1 billion target; (7) dives ted our under-performing European and 
Chinese businesses; and (8) intensively managed our  capital resources and significantly strengthened o ur balance sheet.  
 
In light of this progress, we announced a plan on M arch 2, 2015, to return excess capital to sharehold ers. This plan allows us to continue to 
invest in the growth of our business and preserve a  strong balance sheet and includes: (1) a special, one-time dividend of $0.51 per share, or 
approximately $180 million, related to the net, aft er-tax proceeds from LCD-related legal settlements received in the last three fiscal years; (2) a 
21% increase in our regular quarterly dividend to $ 0.23 per share; and (3) the resumption of share rep urchases, with the intent to repurchase $1 
billion worth of shares over the next three years.  
 
As we look forward to fiscal 2016 and beyond, it is  imperative that we continue to focus on driving co mparable sales and improving operating 
margins, while funding investments in our future. W e are pursuing a strategy that is focused on delive ring Advice, Service and Convenience at 
competitive prices to our customers. Within this st rategy, we are focused on driving a number of growt h initiatives around key product 
categories, life events and services. To drive thes e initiatives, we are pursuing and investing in the  transformation of our key functions and 
processes. The initiatives we intend to pursue in f iscal 2016 reflect our continued execution against the 24-month road map that we outlined a 
year ago.  
 
The first initiative is Merchandising. Our goal is to create a compelling assortment onlin e and in the stores with a superior end-to-end cust omer 
experience that yields enhanced financial returns. In pursuit of that goal, we plan to: (1) capitalize  on the ultra -high definition television cycle 
through best-in-class merchandising, assortment and  customer experience, including opening approximate ly 20 additional Magnolia Design 
Center stores-within-a-store to end fiscal 2016 wit h 78; (2) accelerate our expansion in growing categ ories with structural barriers to entry – like 
large appliances and mobile – including opening app roximately 60 additional Pacific Kitchen & Home sto res-within-a-store to end fiscal 2016 
with 177 and extending our installment billing sell ing capability to online; (3) grow our Connected Ho me and health and wearables businesses 
through an optimized assortment and an improved mul ti-channel customer experience; (4) increase our ex clusive brand and private label 
assortments; (5) expand our secondary market growth  strategy to offer consumers better access to these  types of products and improve our 
margin recovery on returned, replaced and damaged p roducts; and (6) apply more science behind our prom otional and pricing strategies.

We will also expand our programs to capture custome rs at the time of key life events and build long-te rm relationships with them, including our 
new mover program and our wedding gift registry, wh ich we launched in February 2015.  
 
The second initiative is Marketing , which provides crucial support for our merchandis ing growth opportunities. In marketing, we will (1)  
accelerate our targeted marketing programs by lever aging our customer database to expand personalizati on beyond email campaigns; (2) extend 
the personalization of our targeted email campaigns  by dynamically serving relevant landing pages when  customers click through to our website; 
(3) continue the evolution of our marketing spend f rom analog and mass to digital and personalized med iums such as search, mobile devices and 
re-targeting; and (4) continue to increase the numb er of addressable emails in our customer database.  
 
The next initiative on our road map is Online. Our goal is to serve our customers based on how, wh en, and where they want to be served and 
capture online share. In pursuit of that goal, we w ill continue to develop true omni- channel experiences, including improving the online  visibility 
of returned, opened box inventory; (2) extending ou r installment billing selling capability online; (3 ) enhancing the online experience for 
appliance purchases; (4) expanding capabilities for  life events like the wedding registry and wish lis t; and (5) providing an integrated Geek 
Squad customer experience across channels and devic es and driving increased attach rates. We will also  be continuing the transformation of our 
e-commerce technology platform and accelerating the  transformation of our mobile customer experience w hich we will support through our new 
technology development center in Seattle. Similar t o general industry trends, our traffic from mobile phones is growing much faster than 
traditional desktop traffic and we are increasing o ur mobile investment accordingly. We believe it is imperative that we engage mobile customers 
with improved and streamlined access to essential, rich product information during the discovery, rese arch and checkout processes.  
 
The next initiative is Retail Stores. In our retail stores we are building on the momentu m from our success in fiscal 2015 and will be drivi ng 
increased sales effectiveness and payroll leverage through focus on the individual sales productivity of our associates, enhancing our in-store 
customer experience from both an expert service and  physical environment perspective, including expand ing product training for associates and 
driving growth by implementing market plans that ar e tailored to specific geographies.  
 
Services is the next initiative on our road map . In fiscal 2015, we significantly reduced our legacy  cost structure and improved our services-
related NPS. We also launched a loss and theft mobi le phone insurance program and more complete techno logy support bundles. Despite these 
accomplishments; however, revenue has been declinin g largely due to lower attach rates of traditional extended warranties and lower mobile 
revenue due to our success in decreasing claim seve rity and frequency, which is an operational positiv e. In fiscal 2016, we will be focused on (1) 
continuing to transform our traditional service off erings to better address customer needs; (2) contin uing to improve our delivery and installation 
experience; (3) increasing the investment in market ing and selling our services offerings; and (4) int egrating the Geek Squad experience into 
bestbuy.com to provide an enhanced service experien ce to our customers and to increase online attach r ates.  
 
The next initiative on our road map is Supply Chain. Our goal is to leverage our network and improve our  customer experience with increased 
inventory availability, improved speed to customer,  and improved home delivery and installation capabi lities for our large cube assortments. In 
pursuit of these goals, over the next 12 months we will unlock additional inventory for ship-from-stor e, continue to pursue cost efficiencies 
through technology enhancements (including replacem ent of our warehouse technology systems), drive gro wth in large appliances and large 
televisions by leveraging new regional inventory ca pabilities and invest in improving our home deliver y and installation services NPS.  
 
The last initiative on our road map is our Cost Structure. Through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we elimi nated a total of $1.02 billion in 
annualized costs, which exceeded our target of $1 b illion. In fiscal 2016, we are launching phase two of our cost reduction and gross profit 
optimization program with a target of approximately  $400 million in annualized savings over three year s, including the remaining benefit of 
approximately $250 million from our previously disc ussed returns, replacements and damages opportunity . These savings, because they are 
structural in nature, are not expected to begin unt il the second half of fiscal 2016 and will be drive n by streamlined processes and operational 
efficiencies that will be primarily enabled through  investments in systems.  
 
We expect, however, that these incremental savings will be significantly offset by the investments we need to make to fund our growth 
initiatives. In fiscal 2016, we expect these increm ental investments to total approximately $100 milli on to $120 million, or $0.17 to $0.21 in 
diluted EPS and fall into three main buckets: (1) t he customer experience online and in our retail sto res; (2) information technology; and (3) 
marketing. We also expect to increase our fiscal 20 16 capital expenditures to approximately $650 to $7 00 million, from $550 million in fiscal 
2015.

Fiscal 2016 Trends  
 
The strategy outlined above is the foundation of ou r fiscal 2016 operating plan, and we are confident in our ability to execute against it as we 
have demonstrated this past year. However, we will also be facing industry and economic pressures, whi ch we expect to impact our business, 
including (1) more rapidly declining average sellin g prices in key product categories; (2) weak indust ry demand in certain product categories; (3) 
declining demand and increasing pricing pressures f or our extended warranties; and (4) increasingly co mpetitive and costly customer service 
expectations like free and faster shipping.  
 
To win against this backdrop, investing now is impe rative. While these investments will put pressure o n our fiscal 2016 operating income rate, 
we believe they leverage our executional momentum a nd will allow us to build a differentiated customer  experience and a foundation for long-
term success. In fiscal 2016, we expect the financi al impact of the aforementioned investments and eco nomic pressures in the first quarter and 
continue throughout the year.  
 
From a revenue perspective, fiscal 2016 first and s econd quarter Enterprise revenue and comparable sal es growth, excluding the estimated 
impact of installment billing, is expected to be in  the range of flat to negative low-single digits. T his change in trend versus the fourth quarter of 
fiscal 2015 is primarily driven by ongoing material  declines in the tablet category, in addition to ty pical holiday momentum around high-profile, 
giftable products not continuing post-holiday. We w ill also be anniversarying approximately 80 basis p oints of Enterprise growth in the first half 
of fiscal 2015 driven by the chain-wide rollout of ship-from-store.  
 
From a non-GAAP operating income rate perspective, we expect fiscal 2016 first and second quarter to b e down approximately 0.3% of revenue 
to 0.5% of revenue, including lapping fiscal 2015 f irst quarter 15-basis point benefit associated with  our credit card agreement. This decline 
reflects the economic and growth pressures outlined  above, the investments we are making to drive our fiscal 2016 growth initiatives and our 
anticipated SG&A inflation. Additionally, we expect  the fiscal 2016 first and second quarter non-GAAP continuing operations effective income 
tax rate to be in the range of 39% to 40%.  
 
Canada  
 
In March 2015, we made a decision to consolidate Fu ture Shop and Best Buy stores and websites in Canad a under the Best Buy brand in order to 
strengthen our position as Canada’s leading provide r of consumer electronics products, services and so lutions. As a result of this decision, we 
also reviewed our real estate footprint in Canada t o address the fact that a significant number of Fut ure Shop and Best Buy stores are located in 
close proximity to each other. The result of this r eview is the permanent closure of 66 Future Shop lo cations and the conversion of 65 Future 
Shop stores to the Best Buy brand. Following this c onsolidation, we will continue to have a strong sto re presence in all major markets in Canada. 
 
Looking ahead, investments up to $160 million will be made in Best Buy stores and bestbuy.ca to build a leading multi-channel customer 
experience. This multi-faceted strategy will includ e: (1) launching major home appliances in all store s; (2) working with our vendor partners to 
bring their products to life in a more compelling w ay; (3) increasing our staffing levels to better se rve our customers; (4) investing in the online 
shopping experience, for example by expanding in-st ore pick-up areas for online customers and launchin g a ship-from-store program, making in-
store inventory available to online customers acros s the country.  
 
As a result of these changes, we expect to increase  our capital spending by up to $160 million over th e next 12 to 24 months. In addition, we 
expect to record restructuring charges and non-rest ructuring impairments in the range of $200 million to $280 million, or a GAAP diluted 
earnings per share impact of $0.41 to $0.58. We exp ect that the majority of these charges will be reco rded in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The 
total charges includes approximately $140 million t o $180 million of cash charges – primarily related to future rent obligations and severance – 
that will be paid over the next 5 years.  
 
We also expect our fiscal 2016 GAAP and non-GAAP di luted earnings per share to be negatively impacted in the range of $0.10 to $0.20 due 
primarily to a temporary increase in operational ex penses associated with consolidation activities and  store disruptions resulting from our 
investments to support the Best Buy multi-channel c ustomer experience. Due to the transitional nature of the majority of these costs, we do not 
expect this negative earnings per share impact to c ontinue into future years.  
 
See Note 13, Subsequent Events , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements , included in Item 8, Financial Statements and 
Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further in formation about the restructuring charges related t o this action.

Results of Operations  
 
In order to align our fiscal reporting periods and comply with statutory filing requirements in certai n foreign jurisdictions, we consolidate the 
financial results of our Mexico operations, as well  as our discontinued China and Europe operations, o n a lag. Consistent with such 
consolidation, the financial and non-financial info rmation presented in our MD&A relative to these ope rations is also presented on a lag. Our 
policy is to accelerate the recording of events occ urring in the lag period that significantly affect our consolidated financial statements. There 
were no significant intervening events which would have materially affected our financial condition, r esults of operations, liquidity or other 
factors had they been recorded during fiscal 2015.  
 
On November 2, 2011, our Board approved a change in  our fiscal year- end from the Saturday nearest the end of February t o the Saturday nearest 
the end of January, effective beginning with our fi scal year 2013. As a result of this change, our fis cal year 2013 transition period was 11 months 
and ended on February 2, 2013. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further in formation.  
 
In this MD&A, when financial results for fiscal 201 4 are compared to financial results for fiscal 2013 , the results for the 12-month fiscal 2014 
are compared to the results for the 11-month transi tion period from fiscal 2013. Fiscal 2014 (12-month ) included 52 weeks and fiscal 2013 (11-
month) included 48 weeks. The following tables show  the fiscal months included within the various comp arison periods in our MD&A:  
 
Discontinued Operations Presentation  
 
The results of mindSHIFT in our Domestic segment an d Best Buy Europe and Five Star in our Internationa l segment are presented as 
discontinued operations in our Consolidated Stateme nts of Earnings. Unless otherwise stated, financial  results discussed herein refer to 
continuing operations.  
 
Domestic Segment Installment Billing Plans  
 
In April 2014, we began to sell installment billing  plans offered by mobile carriers to our customers to complement the more traditional two- year 
plans. While the two types of contracts have broadl y similar overall economics, installment billing pl ans typically generate higher revenues due 
to higher proceeds for devices and higher cost of s ales due to lower device subsidies. As we increase our mix of installment billing plans, there is 
an associated increase in revenue and cost of goods  sold and a decrease in gross profit rate, with gro ss profit dollars relatively unaffected. We 
estimate that our fiscal 2015 Enterprise and Domest ic comparable sales of 0.5% and 1.0%, respectively,  both include a 0.5% of revenue impact 
from this classification difference. The impact on our consolidated gross profit rate was immaterial.

Fiscal 2015 Results Compared With Fiscal 2014  
 
The components of the 0.7% revenue decrease in fisc al 2015 were as follows:  
 
 
30  •  Revenue was $40.3 billion in fiscal 2015. The sl ight decrease from fiscal 2014 was primarily driven  by the negative impact of foreign 
currency exchange fluctuations, partially offset by  a comparable sales gain of 0.5%. Excluding the 0.5 % of revenue estimated benefit 
associated with the classification of the new mobil e carrier installment billing plans, comparable sal es were flat.  
•  Our gross profit rate decreased by 0.7% of reven ue to 22.4% of revenue in fiscal 2015. The decrease  was primarily due to LCD- related legal 
settlements received in fiscal 2014.  
•  We generated $1.9 billion in operating cash flow  in fiscal 2015, compared to $1.1 billion in fiscal  2014, and we ended fiscal 2015 with 
$3.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-te rm investments, compared to $2.9 billion at the end  of fiscal 2014. Capital expenditures 
remained relatively consistent with the prior year,  as we continued to follow a more disciplined capit al allocation process.  
•  During fiscal 2015, we made four dividend payments totaling $0.72 per share, or $251 million in the ag gregate.

Fiscal 2015 Results Compared With Fiscal 2014  
 
Domestic segment revenue increased in fiscal 2015, primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 1.0% . Excluding the 0.5% of revenue 
estimated benefit associated with the classificatio n of the new mobile carrier installment billing pla ns, comparable sales increased 0.5%. Online 
revenue was $3.5 billion, and we experienced compar able online sales growth of 16.7% due to: (1) impro ved inventory availability made 
possible by the chain-wide rollout of our ship-from -store capability that was completed in January 201 4; (2) higher average order value; and (3) 
increased traffic driven by greater investment in o nline digital marketing.  
 
Fiscal 2015 was also the first full year under the credit card agreement, the term of which started in  September 2013. At the beginning of the 
year we estimated that we would generate $150 milli on to $200 million less credit card revenue in fisc al 2015. However, revenue earned 
decreased by only $7 million compared to fiscal 201 4, as we experienced significantly better performan ce than expected, particularly in the 
fourth quarter. The impact of our credit card agree ment on our revenue is substantially the same as th e impact on our gross profit and operating 
income.

The components of the 0.6% revenue increase in the Domestic segment in fiscal 2015 (12-month) were as follows:  
 
The net store changes did not have a material impac t on our revenue in fiscal 2015, as the majority of  closures occurred in the fourth quarter and 
related to our small-format Best Buy Mobile stand-a lone stores. The closing of small-format Best Buy M obile stores have a significantly smaller 
impact given their smaller size and limited categor y focus compared to our large-format stores.

fiscal 2015 and 2014:  
 
The following is a description of the notable compa rable sales changes in our Domestic segment by reve nue category:  
 
   
Our Domestic segment experienced a decrease in gros s profit of $194 million , or 2.3% , in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014. The most 
significant driver of the decrease was $264 million  of LCD-related legal settlements that we received in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 and, to 
a lesser extent, $50 million of LCD settlements rec eived in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. Excludin g these LCD settlements, we experienced an 
increase in gross profit of $120 million, and the g ross profit rate increased 0.2% of revenue. The pri mary drivers of the gross profit rate increase 
were: (1) the benefit from the realization of our R enew Blue cost reductions and other supply chain co st containment initiatives (including 
initiatives related to returns, replacements and da mages); (2) a more structured and analytical approa ch to pricing, notably in the fourth quarter; 
and (3) increased revenue in higher-margin large-sc reen televisions. These increases were offset by a mix shift into lower-margin gaming and 
computing categories and a highly competitive promo tional environment in tablets.

•  Consumer Electronics: The 3.7% comparable sales increase was primarily du e to growth in televisions, with strong growth in u ltra 
HD television. This was partially offset by decline s in DVD/Blu-ray players, as online streaming conti nues to increase, and cameras, as 
device convergence with smartphones and tablets con tinued.  
•  Computing and Mobile Phones: The 0.6% comparable sales decline primarily resulte d from a significant decrease in tablets due to 
industry declines. This decline was partially offse t by an increase in sales of computers, as well as an increase in sales of mobile phones 
driven by the introduction of mobile carrier instal lment billing plans and higher year over year selli ng prices. Excluding the impact of 
installment billing, mobile phone comparable sales declined.  
•  Entertainment: The 4.5% comparable sales increase was driven prima rily by gaming sales from the new platforms launche d in the 
fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, partially offset by the continuing declines in movies and music as cons umers continue to shift from 
physical media to online streaming and downloads.  
•  Appliances: The 7.5% comparable sales gain was a result of stro ng performance throughout fiscal 2015 due to effect ive promotions, 
the addition of appliance specialists in select sto res and the positive impact of Pacific Kitchen & Ho me store-within-a-store concepts.  
•  Services: The 11.1% comparable sales decline was primarily du e to lower mobile repair revenue and lower sales of  extended warranty 
plans driven by lower attach rates.

Our Domestic segment's SG&A decreased $367 million , or 5.2% , in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. In additi on, the SG&A rate decreased 
by 1.2% of revenue compared to the prior year. The decreases in SG&A and SG&A rate were primarily driv en by the realization of Renew Blue 
cost reduction initiatives and the benefit from tig hter expense management throughout the company. The se declines were partially offset by 
Renew Blue investments in online growth and our in- store experience, as well as higher incentive compe nsation.  
   
Our Domestic segment recorded $4 million of restruc turing charges in fiscal 2015 and incurred $123 mil lion of restructuring charges in fiscal 
2014. The restructuring charges had an immaterial i mpact on our operating income rate in fiscal 2015 a nd resulted in a decrease in our operating 
income rate in fiscal 2014 of 0.3% of revenue. Refe r to Note 4, Restructuring Charges , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements , 
included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further in formation about our 
restructuring activities.  
   
Our Domestic segment’s operating income increased $ 292 million , or 0.8% of revenue, in fiscal 2015 co mpared to fiscal 2014. The increase 
was driven by lower SG&A, a comparable sales gain a nd lower restructuring charges, partially offset by  the decrease in gross profit from the 
prior-year LCD settlements described above.  
   
Fiscal 2014 (12-month) Results Compared With Fiscal  2013 (11-month)  
   
For purposes of this section, fiscal 2014 (12-month ) represents the 12-month period ended February 1, 2014 and fiscal 2013 (11-month) 
represents the 11-month transition period ended Feb ruary 2, 2013.  
 
During fiscal 2014 (12-month), we made substantial progress against our Renew Blue priorities. First, we exceeded our original Renew Blue 
annualized cost reduction target. Second, we made p rogress stabilizing our comparable store sales and operating income rate. In our Domestic 
segment, comparable stores were nearly flat for fis cal 2014 (12-month). Domestic operating income incr eased in fiscal 2014 (12-month); 
however, this was driven by LCD-related legal settl ements and lower restructuring charges. Excluding t hese items, our operating income rate 
decreased primarily due to a lower gross profit rat e, which was only partially offset by cost reductio n initiatives and tighter expense 
management.  
 
The components of the 7.9% revenue increase in the Domestic segment in fiscal 2014 (12-month) were as follows:  
 
The decrease in revenue from net store changes was primarily due to the closure of 47 large-format Bes t Buy branded stores in the second and 
third quarter of fiscal 2013 (11-month). The openin g and closing of small-format Best Buy Mobile store s had a significantly smaller impact 
given their smaller size and limited category focus  compared to our large-format stores.

The following is a description of the notable compa rable sales changes in our Domestic segment by reve nue category:  
 
   
Our Domestic segment experienced an increase in gro ss profit of $485 million, or 6.2%, in fiscal 2014 (12-month) compared to fiscal 2013 (11-
month), driven by the extra month of activity. Excl uding the extra month, gross profit declined due to  a decline in the gross profit rate and lower 
revenue. The 0.3% of revenue decrease in the gross profit rate resulted primarily from a greater inves tment in price competitiveness and 
increased product warranty-related costs associated  with higher claims frequency in mobile phones. The se items were partially offset by LCD-
related legal settlements, the realization of Renew  Blue cost reductions and other supply chain cost c ontainment initiatives and the accelerated 
recognition of previously deferred revenue associat ed with our prior credit card agreement.  
   
Our Domestic segment's SG&A increased $278 million,  or 4.1%, in fiscal 2014 (12-month) compared to fis cal 2013 (11-month). Excluding the 
extra month of activity, SG&A decreased primarily f rom the realization of our Renew Blue cost reductio n initiatives, tighter expense 
management throughout the company and, to a lesser extent, the impact of store closures in fiscal 2013  (11-month). These decreases were 
partially offset by Renew Blue investments, includi ng optimization of our retail floor space and the r e-platforming of and functionality 
enhancements to bestbuy.com. These factors also con tributed to the 0.7% of revenue decline in the SG&A  rate.  
   
Our Domestic segment recorded $123 million of restr ucturing charges in fiscal 2014 (12-month), primari ly related to employee termination 
benefits as a result of Renew Blue cost reduction i nitiatives. These restructuring charges resulted in  a decrease in our operating income in fiscal 
2014 (12-month) of 0.3% of revenue. In fiscal 2013 (11-month) our Domestic segment recorded restructur ing charges of $328 million, which 
included $1 million of inventory write-downs includ ed in cost of goods sold. The restructuring charges  related to our Renew Blue and first 
quarter fiscal 2013 U.S. restructuring activities a nd consisted primarily of facility closure costs, e mployee termination benefits and asset 
impairments. These restructuring charges resulted i n a decrease in our operating income in fiscal 2013  (11-month) of 1.0% of revenue. Refer to 
Note 4, Restructuring Charges , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements , included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary 
Data , of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further in formation about our restructuring activities.  
   
Our Domestic segment’s operating income increased $ 414 million, or 1.0% of revenue, in fiscal 2014 (12 -month) compared to fiscal 2013 (11-
month). Excluding the extra month of activity, oper ating income increased primarily due to lower SG&A expenses and a decrease in 
restructuring, partially offset by lower gross prof it as described above.  
 
 
35 (1)  In fiscal 2014, e-Readers were moved from the "Consumer Electronics" revenue category to "Computi ng and Mobile Phones" to reflect the continued conv ergence of their 
features with tablets and other computing devices.  
•  Consumer Electronics: The 5.6% comparable sales decline was primarily due  to industry declines driven by device convergence with 
smartphones and tablets, which has negatively impac ted sales of digital imaging products, particularly  compact cameras and 
camcorders, MP3 devices and accessories, and GPS na vigation products.  
•  Computing and Mobile Phones: The 4.7% comparable sales gain primarily resulted f rom growth in mobile phones in the first three 
quarters of fiscal 2014 (12-month), which was parti ally due to successful promotions and an increased sales mix into higher-priced 
smartphones. In addition, we experienced a comparab le store sales gain in computing driven by growth i n the second half of fiscal 2014 
(12-month) as a result of improved inventory availa bility.  
•  Entertainment: The 16.3% comparable sales decline was driven prima rily by weak gaming sales in the first three quarte rs as 
consumers awaited the launch of new platforms in th e fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 (12- month), as well as declines in movies and music 
as consumers continue to shift from physical media to digital consumption.  
•  Appliances: The 16.7% comparable sales gain was a result of str ong performance throughout fiscal 2014 (12-month) d ue to effective 
promotions, the addition of appliance specialists i n select stores, the expansion of the small applian ces category and the positive impact 
of Pacific Kitchen & Home store-within-a-store conc epts.  
•  Services: The 0.2% comparable sales gain was primarily due to  growth in mobile phone repair services, offset by a decline in warranty 
services due to the prior-year benefit from a perio dic profit sharing payment that was earned based on  the long- term performance of our 
externally managed extended service plan portfolio that did not recur in fiscal 2014 (12-month).

The net closure of large- format stores in Canada over the past 12 months con tributed to the decrease in revenue associated with  net store changes 
in our International segment in fiscal 2015. The ad dition of large and small-format stores in Mexico p artially offset this decrease.  
 
The following table presents the International segm ent's revenue mix percentages and comparable store sales percentage changes by revenue 
category in fiscal 2015 and 2014:  
 
The following is a description of the notable compa rable sales changes in our International segment by  revenue category:  
 
 
Our International segment experienced a gross profi t decline of $158 million , or 14.0% , in fiscal 20 15 compared to fiscal 2014. Excluding the 
impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuatio ns, the decrease in gross profit was $88 million. T he gross profit rate decline of 0.9% of 
revenue was driven by Canada due to increased promo tional activity and, to a lesser extent, higher rev enue in the lower- margin gaming category. 
 
Our International segment's SG&A decreased $147 mil lion , or 13.4% , in fiscal 2015 compared to the pr ior year. Excluding the impact of 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the de crease in SG&A was $81 million. In addition, the SG &A rate decreased by 0.8% of revenue 
in fiscal 2015. The decrease in SG&A and SG&A rate was primarily driven by Renew Blue cost reductions and store closures in Canada.  
 
Our International segment recorded $1 million of re structuring charges in fiscal 2015 and incurred $26  million of restructuring charges in fiscal 
2014. The restructuring charges had an immaterial i mpact on our operating income rate in fiscal 2015 a nd resulted in a decrease in our operating 
income rate in fiscal 2014 of 0.5% of revenue. Refe r to Note 4, Restructuring Charges , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements , 
included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further in formation about our 
restructuring activities.  
 
Our International segment operating income of $13 m illion in fiscal 2015 compared to a loss of $1 mill ion in the prior-year period. The 
improvement in operating income was driven primaril y by a decrease in SG&A, partially offset by a decr ease in gross profit as described above.

•  Consumer Electronics: The 5.1% comparable sales decline was driven primar ily by a decrease in sales of digital imaging produ cts, 
televisions and MP3 devices. The declines in digita l imaging products and MP3 devices were a result of  device convergence and 
industry declines. The decrease in sales of televis ions was due to overall market softness across the segment and competitive pressures 
in Canada.  
•  Computing and Mobile Phones: The 2.8% comparable sales decline was caused primar ily by a decrease in sales of tablets due to 
industry declines, partially offset by increased mo bile phone sales.  
•  Entertainment: The 5.2% comparable sales decline was driven by a d ecrease in sales of movies and music as customers c ontinue to 
shift from physical media to digital consumption, p artially offset by gaming sales in Canada due to th e release of new gaming platforms 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.  
•  Appliances: The 0.5% comparable sales decline was driven by Mex ico due to a decrease in sales of kitchen appliance s, partially offset 
by appliance sales increases in Canada from expansi on of offerings and assortment.  
•  Services: The 4.7% comparable sales decline was due to a decr ease in sales of warranties in Canada driven by the  overall comparable 
store sales decline in applicable hardware, particu larly tablets and televisions.

Fiscal 2014 (12-month) Results Compared With Fiscal  2013 (11-month)  
 
For purposes of this section, fiscal 2014 (12-month ) represents the 12-month period ended February 1, 2014 and fiscal 2013 (11-month) 
represents the 11-month transition period ended Feb ruary 2, 2013.  
 
In fiscal 2014 (12-month), we experienced a compara ble sales decline in Canada, as sales were negative ly impacted by lower industry demand 
for consumer electronics. We also started to implem ent our Renew Blue initiatives in our International  segment in fiscal 2014 (12- month). While 
our International segment continues to experience r evenue and gross profit challenges, we have made pr ogress in stabilizing comparable sales 
and reducing SG&A expenses. Increased promotional a ctivity and a higher mix of lower-margin products i n Canada contributed to a decline in 
our gross profit rate. The SG&A rate decline was pr imarily driven by Renew Blue cost reductions and ti ghter expense management in Canada 
and the elimination of expenses associated with pre viously closed stores in Canada.  
 
The components of the International segment's 5.0% revenue decrease in fiscal 2014 (12-month) were as follows:  
 
The closure of large-format stores in Canada at the  end of fiscal 2013 (11-month) contributed to the m ajority of the decrease in revenue 
associated with net store changes in our Internatio nal segment in fiscal 2014 (12-month). The addition  of large-format stores in Mexico and 
small-format Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores in Canada partially offset this decrease.

device convergence, similar to trends seen in the D omestic segment.

Our International segment experienced a gross profi t decline of $109 million, or 8.8%, in fiscal 2014 (12-month), driven primarily by a revenue 
decline in Canada and a decrease in the gross profi t rate, which were partially offset by an extra mon th of activity. The 1.0% of revenue decrease 
in the gross profit rate was driven by increased pr omotional activity and an increased mix of lower-ma rgin products, primarily in Canada.  
 
Our International segment's SG&A decreased $77 mill ion, or 6.5%, in fiscal 2014 (12-month) due to savi ngs from previous store closures in 
Canada and China and Renew Blue cost reduction init iatives, partially offset by an extra month of acti vity. The SG&A rate also decreased by 
0.4% of revenue as a result of the aforementioned f actors.  
 
Our International segment recorded $26 million and $87 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2014  (12-month) and 2013 (11-month), 
respectively. The fiscal 2014 (12-month) restructur ing charges primarily related to employee terminati on benefits as a result of Renew Blue cost 
reduction initiatives. The restructuring charges in  fiscal 2013 (11-month) also related to our Renew B lue initiatives and consisted of facility 
closure costs, property and equipment impairments a nd employee termination benefits. These restructuri ng charges resulted in a decrease in our 
operating income in fiscal 2014 (12-month) and fisc al 2013 (11-month) of 0.5% of revenue and 1.7% of r evenue, respectively. Refer to Note 4, 
Restructuring Charges , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements , included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , 
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further info rmation about our restructuring activities.  
 
During fiscal 2014 (12-month), we recorded no goodw ill impairment charges compared to $611 million in fiscal 2013 (11- month). Refer to Note 
1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements , included in Item 8, Financial Statements and 
Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further in formation about the fiscal 2013 (11-month) goodwill  impairment.  
 
The decrease in the International segment's operati ng loss in fiscal 2014 (12- month) was primarily due to the decreased goodwill impairment and 
restructuring charges, partially offset by a decrea se in gross profit.  
 
Additional Consolidated Results  
 
Other Income (Expense)  
 
In fiscal 2015, we recognized a gain of $13 million  due to the sale of available-for-sale and cost-bas ed investments. In fiscal 2014, we 
recognized a gain of $20 million in connection with  the sale of cost-based investments.  
 
In fiscal 2015, our investment income and other was  $14 million, compared to $19 million in the prior year. The decrease in fiscal 2015 was due 
to lower returns on our deferred compensation asset s, partially offset by an increase in interest inco me driven by higher average cash and cash 
equivalents and short-term investment balances. In fiscal 2014 (12-month), our investment income and o ther was $19 million, compared to $13 
million in fiscal 2013 (11-month). The increase in fiscal 2014 (12-month) was primarily due to higher average cash and cash equivalents and 
short-term investments balances.  
 
Interest expense was $90 million in fiscal 2015, co mpared to $100 million in fiscal 2014. The decrease  in interest expense was primarily due to 
replacing our previous 2013 Notes that bore interes t at 6.75% with 2018 Notes that bear interest at 5. 00% in the middle of fiscal 2014. Interest 
expense was $100 million in fiscal 2014 (12-month),  compared to $99 million in fiscal 2013 (11-month).  The relatively flat interest expense was 
the result of an extra month of expense in fiscal 2 014 (12-month), offset by a decrease in interest ex pense as a result of replacing our previous 
2013 Notes with 2018 Notes.  
 
Income Tax Expense  
 
Income tax expense decreased to $141 million in fis cal 2015, compared to a tax expense of $388 million  in the prior year, primarily due to a 
$353 million discrete benefit related to reorganizi ng certain European legal entities, partially offse t by an increase in pre-tax earnings in the 
current-year period. Our effective income tax rate ("ETR") for fiscal 2015 was 10.1%, compared to a ra te of 35.8% in fiscal 2014. Excluding the 
impact of reorganizing certain European legal entit ies, the ETR  
 
39 •  Entertainment: The 9.3% comparable sales decline, principally in C anada, reflected a decrease in sales of movies due to a lack of new 
releases and weak gaming sales in the first three q uarters, as consumers awaited the launch of new pla tforms in the fourth quarter of 
fiscal 2014 (12-month).  
•  Appliances: The 1.5% comparable sales decline was primarily due to a dec line in sales of kitchen and laundry appliances in Canada. 
•  Services: The 6.3% comparable sales decline was primarily due  to a decrease in sales of extended warranties in C anada driven by the 
overall comparable store sales decline and a change  in product mix, particularly in televisions.

would have been 35.6% in fiscal 2015. Refer to Note  10, Income Taxes , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements , included in Item 8, 
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional  information.  
 
Income tax expense increased to $388 million in fis cal 2014 (12-month), compared to a tax expense of $ 263 million in the prior- year period. Our 
ETR was 35.8% in fiscal 2014 (12-month), compared t o 7,152.3% in fiscal 2013 (11-month). Excluding the  impact of the goodwill impairments 
(which are not tax deductible), the ETR would have been 42.6% in fiscal 2013 (11-month). The ETR in fi scal 2014 (12-month) was lower than 
in fiscal 2013 (11-month), excluding the goodwill i mpairments, as fiscal 2013 (11-month) was higher th an normal as a result of decreased tax 
benefits from foreign operations, which were due pr imarily to a decrease in foreign earnings and a val uation allowance on U.S. federal foreign 
tax credits.  
 
Our consolidated effective tax rate is impacted by the statutory income tax rates applicable to each o f the jurisdictions in which we operate. As 
our foreign earnings are generally taxed at lower s tatutory rates than the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate, changes in the proportion of our 
consolidated taxable earnings originating in foreig n jurisdictions impact our consolidated effective r ate. Our foreign earnings have been 
indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. and are no t subject to current U.S. income tax.  
 
Discontinued Operations  
 
Discontinued operations consists primarily of Best Buy Europe and Five Star in our International segme nt, as well as mindSHIFT in our 
Domestic segment.  
 
The loss from discontinued operations was $11 milli on in fiscal 2015 compared to a loss of $172 millio n in fiscal 2014. The decrease in the loss 
year -over-year was primarily due to the impairment of o ur investment in Best Buy Europe, as well as the lo ss on the sale of mindSHIFT in fiscal 
2014. The loss from discontinued operations of $172  million in fiscal 2014 (12-month) compared to a lo ss of $161 million in fiscal 2013 (11-
month). The loss in fiscal 2013 (11-month) was prim arily due to the write-off of goodwill related to o ur Five Star reporting unit.  
 
Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices  
 
Highly competitive market conditions and the genera l economic environment minimized inflation's impact  on the selling prices of our products 
and services and on our expenses. In addition, pric e deflation and the continued commoditization of ce rtain technology products limited our 
ability to increase our gross profit rate.  
Non-GAAP Financial Measures  
 
The periods used for analysis of non-GAAP financial  performance represent the periods that management used internally to assess performance. 
As a result of the change in our fiscal year in fis cal 2013, some of the periods included in this sect ion of our MD&A differ from the audited 
periods included in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings, and as such, these periods are also diffe rent than those analyzed within the Results 
of Operations section of the MD&A.

Non -GAAP operating income increased $334 million in 20 15 compared to 2014, and non-GAAP operating income as a percent of revenue 
increased to 3.7%. The increase in non-GAAP operati ng income was driven by SG&A cost reductions in bot h segments primarily due to the 
realization of our Renew Blue cost reduction initia tives and tighter expense management, partially off set by a decline in revenue in our 
International segment. The increase in non-GAAP ope rating income resulted in a

year -over-year increase in non-GAAP net earnings from c ontinuing operations and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing 
operations in 2015 compared to the prior-year perio d.  
 
In 2014, non-GAAP operating income decreased $311 m illion compared to 2013. The decrease in non-GAAP o perating income was primarily 
driven by the extra week of operations in 2013 and a decrease in the gross profit rate (adjusted to ex clude LCD-related legal settlements in the 
second quarter of 2014). This decrease was partiall y offset by lower SG&A spending due to the realizat ion of Renew Blue cost reduction 
initiatives and tighter expense management in both the Domestic and International segments. These same  factors contributed to the year-over-
year decreases in non -GAAP net earnings from continuing operations and n on-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 
2014 compared to the prior-year period.

We closely manage our liquidity and capital resourc es. Our liquidity requirements depend on key variab les, including the level of investment 
required to support our business strategies, the pe rformance of our business, capital expenditures, cr edit facilities and short-term borrowing 
arrangements and working capital management. Capita l expenditures are a component of our cash flow and  capital management strategy which, 
to a large extent, we can adjust in response to eco nomic and other changes in our business environment . We have a disciplined approach to 
capital allocation, which focuses on investing in k ey priorities that support our Renew Blue transform ation.  
 
The following table summarizes our cash and cash eq uivalents and short-term investments at January 31,  2015 and February 1, 2014 ($ in 
millions):  
 
The increase in cash and cash equivalents from Febr uary 1, 2014, was primarily due to cash generated f rom operating activities, partially offset 
by capital expenditures and dividend payments.  
 
Working capital, the excess of current assets over current liabilities, was $4.0 billion at January 31 , 2015, an increase from $3.0 billion at 
February 1, 2014.  
 
Cash Flows  
 
The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for e ach of the past three fiscal years ($ in 
millions):  
 
Operating Activities  
 
The increase in cash provided by operating activiti es in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was prima rily due to improved management of 
working capital in fiscal 2015. Additionally, in fi scal 2014 there were larger cash outflows from acco unts payable, following unusually high 
balances at the end of fiscal 2013 due to timing of  inventory receipts and payments.

The decrease in cash provided by operating activiti es in fiscal 2014 (12-month) compared to fiscal 201 3 (11-month) was primarily due to 
increased cash outflows for accounts payable, parti ally offset by improved inventory management and in creased cash inflow from receivables.  
 
Investing Activities  
 
The increase in cash used in investing activities i n fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily  due to increased purchases of short-term 
investments in fiscal 2015.  
 
The decrease in cash used in investing activities i n fiscal 2014 (12-month) compared to fiscal 2013 (1 1-month) was primarily due to lower 
capital expenditures and proceeds from the disposit ion of mindSHIFT, partially offset by purchases of short-term investments in fiscal 2014 (12-
month).  
 
Financing Activities  
 
The decrease in cash provided by financing activiti es in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was prima rily due to decreased borrowing and 
decreased proceeds from the issuance of common stoc k, primarily from the exercise of employee stock op tions.  
 
The increase in cash provided by financing activiti es in fiscal 2014 (12-month) compared to fiscal 201 3 (11-month) was primarily due to 
increased borrowing, increased proceeds from the is suance of common stock, primarily from the exercise  of employee stock options, and the 
lack of share repurchases in fiscal 2014 (12-month) .  
 
Sources of Liquidity  
 
Funds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments a nd our credit facilities are our most 
significant sources of liquidity. We believe our so urces of liquidity will be sufficient to sustain op erations and to finance anticipated capital 
investments and strategic initiatives. However, in the event our liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to limit our spending. There can be 
no assurance that we will continue to generate cash  flows at or above current levels or that we will b e able to maintain our ability to borrow 
under our existing credit facilities or obtain addi tional financing, if necessary, on favorable terms.   
 
On June 30, 2014, we entered into a new $1.25 billi on five-year senior unsecured revolving credit faci lity (the "Five-Year Facility Agreement") 
with a syndicate of banks that expires in June 2019 . The Five-Year Facility Agreement replaced the pre vious $1.5 billion unsecured revolving 
credit facility, which was originally scheduled to expire in October 2016, but was terminated on June 30, 2014. At January 31, 2015, we had no 
borrowings outstanding under the Five-Year Facility  Agreement. Refer to Note 5, Debt , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements , 
included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further in formation about our credit 
facilities.  
 
Our ability to access our revolving credit facility  under the Five-Year Facility Agreement is subject to our compliance with the terms and 
conditions of the facility, including financial cov enants. The financial covenants require us to maint ain certain financial ratios. At January 31, 
2015, we were in compliance with all such financial  covenants. If an event of default were to occur wi th respect to any of our other debt, it 
would likely constitute an event of default under o ur facilities as well.  
 
An interest coverage ratio represents the ratio of pre-tax earnings before fixed charges (interest exp ense and the interest portion of rent expense) 
to fixed charges. Our interest coverage ratio, calc ulated as reported in Exhibit No. 12.1 of this Annu al Report on Form 10-K, was 5.08 and 4.06 
in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively.  
   
Our credit ratings and outlooks at March 23, 2015 ,  are summarized below. On September 3, 2014, Fitch Ratings Limited ("Fitch") upgraded its 
long-term credit rating from BB- to BB with a Stabl e outlook. On July 2, 2014, Moody's Investors Servi ce, Inc. ("Moody's") reaffirmed its Baa2 
long-term credit rating and changed its outlook fro m Negative to Stable. The rating and outlook from S tandard & Poor's Rating Services 
("Standard & Poor's") remain consistent with those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the  fiscal year ended February 1, 2014.

Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodi cally and, therefore, the credit rating assigned to  us by each agency may be subject to revision 
at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predic t whether our current credit ratings will remain as  disclosed above. Factors that can affect our 
credit ratings include changes in our operating per formance, the economic environment, conditions in t he retail and consumer electronics 
industries, our financial position and changes in o ur business strategy. If further changes in our cre dit ratings were to occur, they could impact, 
among other things, interest costs for certain of o ur credit facilities, our future borrowing costs, a ccess to capital markets, vendor financing terms 
and future new-store leasing costs.  
   
Restricted Cash  
   
Our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash b alances that are pledged as collateral or restricte d to use for general liability insurance and 
workers' compensation insurance. Restricted cash an d cash equivalents related to our continuing operat ions, which are included in other current 
assets, remained flat at $184 million and $182 mill ion at January 31, 2015 , and February 1, 2014 , re spectively.  
   
Capital Expenditures  
   
Our capital expenditures typically include investme nts in our stores, distribution capabilities and in formation technology enhancements 
(including e-commerce). During fiscal 2015, we inve sted $551 million (excluding Five Star) in property  and equipment, primarily related to 
upgrading our information technology systems and ca pabilities, and store-related projects.  
   
The following table presents our capital expenditur es for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in mi llions):  
 
In fiscal 2016 we estimate capital expenditures of approximately $650 million to $700 million, with th e focus on retail store, e-commerce and 
information technology projects.  
 
Debt and Capital  
 
We have $350 million principal amount of notes due March 15, 2016 (the “2016 Notes”), $500 million pri ncipal amount of notes due August 1, 
2018 (the “2018 Notes”) and $650 million principal amount of notes due March 15, 2021 (the “2021 Notes ”). Refer to Note 5, Debt , of the 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, include d in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form 
10-K for further information about our 2016 Notes, 2018 Notes and 2021 Notes.  
 
Other  
 
At January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014, we had $6 9 million and $95 million , respectively, outstandi ng under financing lease obligations.  
 
Share Repurchases and Dividends  
 
From time to time, we repurchase our common stock i n the open market pursuant to programs approved by our Board. We may repurchase our 
common stock for a variety of reasons, such as acqu iring shares to offset dilution related to equity-b ased

incentives, including stock options and our employe e stock purchase plan, and optimizing our capital s tructure. We consider several factors in 
determining whether to make share repurchases inclu ding, among other things, our cash needs, the avail ability of funding, our future business 
plans and the market price of our stock. If we deci de to make future share repurchases, we expect that  cash provided by future operating 
activities, as well as available cash and cash equi valents, will be the sources of funding for our sha re repurchase program.  
 
In fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, we did not repurcha se or retire any shares. In fiscal 2013 (11-month),  we repurchased and retired 6.3 million 
shares at a cost of $122 million . At the end of fi scal 2015 (12-month), $4.0 billion of the $5.0 bill ion share repurchase program authorized by 
our Board in June 2011 was available for future sha re repurchases. Repurchased shares have been retire d and constitute authorized but unissued 
shares.  
 
In fiscal 2004, our Board initiated the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend on our common sto ck. A quarterly cash dividend has been 
paid in each subsequent quarter. The payment of cas h dividends is subject to customary legal and contr actual restrictions. During fiscal 2015, we 
made four cash dividend payments totaling $0.72 per  share, or $251 million in the aggregate.  
 
On March 3, 2015, we announced a plan to return cap ital to shareholders. The plan includes a special, one-time dividend of $0.51 per share, or 
approximately $180 million, and a 21% increase in o ur regular quarterly dividend to $0.23 per share. W e plan to resume share repurchases under 
the June 2011 program, with the intent to repurchas e $1.0 billion in shares over the next three years.   
 
Other Financial Measures  
 
Our debt to earnings ratio was 1.3 as of January 31 , 2015, compared to 2.4 as of February 1, 2014, due primarily to an increas e in net earnings in 
the 12 months ended January 31, 2015 compared to th e prior year. Our adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio, w hich includes capitalized operating 
lease obligations in its calculation, was 2.8 and 3 .2 as of January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014, res pectively. The decrease in the ratio was due 
to a decrease in capitalized operating lease obliga tions and an increase in EBITDAR.  
 
Our adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered  in addition to, rather than as a 
substitute for, the most directly comparable ratio determined in accordance with GAAP. We have include d this information in our MD&A as we 
view the adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio as an impor tant indicator of our creditworthiness. Furthermore , we believe that our adjusted debt to 
EBITDAR ratio is important for understanding our fi nancial position and provides meaningful additional  information about our ability to service 
our long-term debt and other fixed obligations and to fund our future growth. We also believe our adju sted debt to EBITDAR ratio is relevant 
because it enables investors to compare our indebte dness to that of retailers who own, rather than lea se, their stores. Our decision to own or lease 
real estate is based on an assessment of our financ ial liquidity, our capital structure, our desire to  own or to lease the location, the owner’s desire 
to own or to lease the location, and the alternativ e that results in the highest return to our shareho lders.  
   
Our adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio is calculated as  follows:  
   
   
The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure  to our adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio is our debt to net earnings ratio, which excludes 
capitalized operating lease obligations from debt i n the numerator of the calculation and does not adj ust net earnings in the denominator of the 
calculation.

Critical Accounting Estimates  
 
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our fin ancial statements requires us to make 
assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of  assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and 
the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, e stimates and judgments on historical experience, cu rrent trends and other factors that 
management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review the accounting 
policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to e nsure that our financial statements are presented f airly and in accordance with GAAP. 
However, because future events and their effects ca nnot be determined with certainty, actual results c ould differ from our assumptions and 
estimates, and such differences could be material.  
 
Our significant accounting policies are discussed i n Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe th at the 
following accounting estimates are the most critica l to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require 
our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments , resulting from the need to make estimates about t he effect of matters that are inherently 
uncertain. We have reviewed these critical accounti ng estimates and related disclosures with the Audit  Committee of our Board.  
 
Except where noted, we have not made any material c hanges to the accounting methodologies for the area s described below.  
 
Inventory  
 
We value our inventory at the lower of cost or mark et through the establishment of markdown and invent ory loss adjustments. Markdown 
adjustments reflect the excess of the cost over the  amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale  or other disposal of inventory and establish 
a new cost basis. Subsequent changes in facts or ci rcumstances do not result in the reversal of previo usly recorded markdowns or an increase in 
that newly established cost basis. Markdown adjustm ents involve uncertainty because the calculations r equire management to make assumptions 
and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging, fo recast consumer demand, the promotional environment  and technological obsolescence.  
 
We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate 
our markdowns. However, if estimates regarding cons umer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology  affect demand for certain products 
in an unforeseen manner, we may be exposed to losse s or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our markdown adjustment at January 
31, 2015, would have affected net earnings by appro ximately $8 million in fiscal 2015.  
 
Inventory loss adjustments reflect anticipated phys ical inventory losses (e.g., due to theft) that hav e occurred since the last physical inventory. 
Inventory loss adjustments involve uncertainty beca use the calculations require management to make ass umptions and to apply judgment 
regarding a number of factors, including historical  results and current inventory loss trends. Our inv entory loss estimate is verified by ongoing 
physical inventory counts. Historically, our annual  physical inventory count results have shown our es timates to be reliable.  
 
We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate 
our inventory loss adjustment. However, if our esti mates regarding physical inventory losses are inacc urate, we  
 
47 (2)  Operating lease obligations do not include pay ments to landlords covering real estate taxes and c ommon area maintenance. These charges, if included,  would increase total 
operating lease obligations by $1.2 billion at Janu ary 31, 2015 .  
(3)  Purchase obligations include agreements to pur chase goods or services that are enforceable, are l egally binding and specify all significant terms, i ncluding fixed or minimum 
quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or varia ble price provisions; and the approximate timing of  the transaction. Purchase obligations do not inclu de agreements that are 
cancelable without penalty. Additionally, although they are not legally binding agreements, we include d open purchase orders in the table above. Substant ially all open 
purchase orders are fulfilled within 30 days.  
(4)  Unrecognized tax benefits relate to uncertain tax positions. As we are not able to reasonably est imate the timing of the payments or the amount by w hich the liability will 
increase or decrease over time, the related balance s have not been reflected in the "Payments Due by P eriod" section of the table.  
(5)  Included in Long-term liabilities on our Conso lidated Balance Sheet at January 31, 2015 , was a $ 44 million obligation for deferred compensation. As  the specific payment 
dates for the deferred compensation are unknown, th e related balances have not been reflected in the " Payments Due by Period" section of the table.  
Table of Contents  
 
may be exposed to losses or gains that could be mat erial. A 10% change in our physical inventory loss estimate at January 31, 2015, would have 
affected net earnings by approximately $6 million i n fiscal 2015.  
 
Vendor Allowances  
 
We receive allowances from certain vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements. We treat su ch allowances as an offset to the cost 
of the product or services provided. Receipt-based funds represent one form of our vendor allowances. Receipt-based funds are generally 
determined at an agreed percentage of purchases and  are initially deferred and recorded as a reduction  of merchandise inventories. The deferred 
amounts are then included as a reduction of cost of  goods sold when the related product is sold. We es timate the amount of vendor funding to be 
deferred and recorded as a reduction of inventory a t the end of each period based on detailed analysis  of inventory turns and applicable vendor 
funding rates.  
 
We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate 
our vendor funding deferral. However, if actual res ults are not consistent with the assumptions and es timates used, we may be exposed to 
additional adjustments that could materially, eithe r positively or negatively, impact our gross profit  rate and inventory. A 10% difference in our 
vendor funding deferral at January 31, 2015, would have affected net earnings by approximately $20 mil lion in fiscal 2015.  
 
We also receive vendor allowances for attaining cer tain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are a ccrued as earned over the incentive 
period, based on estimates of purchases. Amounts ac crued throughout the program year could require adj ustment if actual purchase volumes 
differ from projected purchase volumes, especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes 
are met. We believe that our estimate of vendor all owances earned based on expected volume of purchase s over the incentive period is an 
accurate reflection of the ultimate allowances to b e received from our vendors. Since most volume-base d programs apply to a calendar year or 
our fiscal year, the amount of judgment required as  of any fiscal year end is minimal.  
 
Long -Lived Assets  
 
Long-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinit e-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairm ent whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  
 
When evaluating long-lived assets for potential imp airment, we first compare the carrying value of the  asset to the asset's estimated future cash 
flows (undiscounted and without interest charges). If the sum of the estimated future cash flows is le ss than the carrying value of the asset, we 
calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss c alculation compares the carrying value of the asset  to the asset's estimated fair value, which 
is typically based on estimated discounted future c ash flows. We recognize an impairment loss if the a mount of the asset's carrying value 
exceeds the asset's estimated fair value. If we rec ognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying am ount of the asset becomes its new cost 
basis. For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis is depreciated over the remaining useful  life of that asset.  
 
When reviewing long-lived assets for impairment, we  group long-lived assets with other assets and liab ilities at the lowest level for which 
identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For  long-lived assets deployed at store locations, 
we review for impairment at the individual store le vel. These reviews involve comparing the carrying v alue of all land, buildings, leasehold 
improvements, fixtures and equipment located at eac h store to the net cash flow projections for each s tore. In addition, we conduct separate 
impairment reviews at other levels as appropriate. For example, a shared asset such as a distribution center would be evaluated by reference to 
the aggregate assets, liabilities and projected cas h flows of all areas of the businesses utilizing th ose shared assets.  
 
Our impairment loss calculations involve uncertaint y because they require management to make assumptio ns and to apply judgment to estimate 
future cash flows and asset fair values, including estimating useful lives of the assets and selecting  the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent 
in future cash flows. If actual results are not con sistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair 
values, we may be exposed to losses that could be m aterial. We do not believe there is a reasonable li kelihood that there will be a material 
change in the estimates or assumptions we use to ca lculate long-lived asset impairment losses.

Goodwill  
 
Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impa irment annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or whe never events or changes in circumstances 
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.   
 
We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting un it level, which is one level below the operating se gment level. Our detailed impairment 
testing involves comparing the fair value of each r eporting unit to its carrying value, including good will. Fair value reflects the price a market 
participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale of the reporting unit and is based on discount ed cash flows or relative market-based 
approaches. If the fair value exceeds carrying valu e, then it is concluded that no goodwill impairment  has occurred. If the carrying value of the 
reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a second ste p is required to measure possible goodwill impairme nt loss. The second step includes 
hypothetically valuing the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a 
business combination. Then, the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is compared to the  carrying value of that goodwill. If the 
carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exc eeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, we rec ognize an impairment loss in an amount 
equal to the excess, not to exceed the carrying val ue.  
 
The carrying value of goodwill at January 31, 2015,  was $425 million, which related entirely to our U. S. reporting unit. In fiscal 2015, we 
determined that the excess of fair value over carry ing value was substantial. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be 
a material change in the future estimates or assump tions we use to test for impairment losses on goodw ill. However, if actual results are not 
consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we ma y be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material.  
 
Tax Contingencies  
 
Our income tax returns, like those of most companie s, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign  tax authorities. These audits include 
questions regarding our tax filing positions, inclu ding the timing and amount of income and deductions  and the allocation of income among 
various tax jurisdictions. At any time, many tax ye ars are subject to audit by various tax authorities . In evaluating the exposures associated with 
our various tax filing positions, we may record a l iability for such exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which 
we have established a liability, is audited and ful ly resolved or clarified. We adjust our liability f or unrecognized tax benefits and income tax 
provisions in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of lim itations expires for the relevant taxing authority 
to examine the tax position or when more informatio n becomes available.  
 
Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contain s uncertainties because management is required to m ake assumptions and apply judgment to 
estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions.  
 
Our effective income tax rate is also affected by c hanges in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stor es or business ventures, the level of earnings 
and the results of tax audits.  
 
Although we believe that the judgments and estimate s discussed herein are reasonable, actual results c ould differ, and we may be exposed to 
losses or gains that could be material.  
 
To the extent we prevail in matters for which a lia bility has been established, or are required to pay  amounts in excess of our established liability, 
our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An u nfavorable tax settlement generally would 
require use of our cash and may result in an increa se in our effective income tax rate in the period o f resolution. A favorable tax settlement may 
reduce our effective income tax rate and would be r ecognized in the period of resolution.  
 
Revenue Recognition  
 
The following accounting estimates relating to reve nue recognition contain uncertainty because they re quire management to make assumptions 
and to apply judgment regarding the effects of futu re events.  
 
Returns – We recognize revenue, net of estimated returns, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandi se or receives services. We 
estimate the liability for sales returns with a cor responding reduction to revenue and cost of sales b ased on historical return data. We believe that 
our estimate for sales returns is a reasonable refl ection of future returns. However, if our estimates  are significantly below or above the actual 
return amounts, our reported revenue and cost of sa les could be impacted.

Table of Contents  
 
Gift Cards – We sell gift cards to customers in our retail store s, through our websites and through selected third parties. A liability is initially 
established for the value of the gift card. We reco gnize revenue from gift cards when: (i) the card is  redeemed by the customer, or (ii) the 
likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the c ustomer is remote (“gift card breakage”). We determ ine our gift card breakage rate based on 
historical redemption patterns, which show that aft er 24 months, we can determine the portion of the l iability for which redemption is remote. 
Our estimate of the amount and timing of redemption s of gift cards is based primarily on historical da ta.  
 
Customer Loyalty Programs – We have customer loyalty programs which allow membe rs to earn points for each purchase completed or wh en 
using our co-branded credit cards. Points earned en able members to receive a certificate that may be r edeemed on future purchases. The value of 
points earned by our loyalty program members is inc luded in accrued liabilities and recorded as a redu ction in revenue at the time the points are 
earned, based on the value of points that are proje cted to be redeemed. Our estimate of the amount and  timing of redemptions of certificates is 
based primarily on historical data.  
 
Service Contracts – We also sell service contracts for technical suppor t, maintenance and other programs. Revenue on servi ce contracts is 
deferred at the time of purchase and recognized eit her (i) ratably over the term of the contract, or ( ii) under a utilization model based on the 
consumption of services during the contract term co mpared with the total estimated services to be prov ided over the entire contract. Our estimate 
of the services consumed under service contracts is  based on historical data.  
 
We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions of our revenue 
recognition critical accounting estimates. However,  if actual results are not consistent with our esti mates or assumptions, we may be exposed to 
losses or gains that could be material.  
 
The following table presents the effect on net earn ings from a 10% change in each of the estimates des cribed above, as of January 31, 2015 ($ in 
millions):  
 
Costs Associated with Vacant Leased Property  
 
From time-to-time we vacate leased stores and other  leased properties prior to the expiration of the r elated lease. For vacated locations with 
remaining lease commitments, we record a reserve fo r the difference between the present value of our f uture lease payments and related costs 
(e.g., real estate taxes and common area maintenanc e) less expected future sublease rental income, fro m the date we cease to use of the property 
through the end of the lease term.  
 
Our estimate of future cash flows is based on histo rical experience; our analysis of the specific real  estate market, including input from 
independent real estate firms; and economic conditi ons. Cash flows are discounted using a risk-free in terest rate that coincides with the 
remaining lease term.  
 
The liability recorded for vacant locations involve s uncertainty because management is required to mak e assumptions and to apply judgment to 
estimate the duration of future vacancy periods, th e amount and timing of future settlement payments a nd the amount and timing of potential 
sublease rental income.  
 
We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimat es or assumptions we use to calculate our 
vacant location liability. However, if actual resul ts are not consistent with our estimates or assumpt ions, we may be exposed to losses or gains 
that could be material. A 10% change in our vacant space reserve at January 31, 2015, would have affec ted net earnings by approximately 
$4 million in fiscal 2015.  
 
Stock-Based Compensation  
 
We have a stock-based compensation plan, which incl udes non-qualified stock options and nonvested shar e awards. We determine the fair value 
of our non-qualified stock option awards using opti on-pricing models. We determine the fair value of n onvested share awards with market 
conditions using Monte-Carlo simulation. We determi ne the fair value of nonvested share awards that ve st based upon performance or time 
conditions at the closing market price of our stock , reduced by the present value of expected dividend s during the vesting period where the 
recipient has no dividend rights. Compensation expe nse is recognized over the requisite service period  for awards expected to vest. 
Management's key assumptions are developed with inp ut from independent third-party valuation advisors.

Table of Contents  
 
Valuation techniques used require management to mak e assumptions and to apply judgment to determine th e fair value of our awards. These 
assumptions and judgments include estimating the fu ture volatility of our stock price, expected divide nd yield, future employee turnover rates 
and future employee stock option exercise behaviors  and correlations between our returns and peer comp any returns. Changes in these 
assumptions could materially affect the fair value estimate.  
 
Estimation of awards that will ultimately vest requ ires judgment of the amounts that will be forfeited  due to failure to fulfill service conditions. 
To the extent actual results or updated estimates d iffer from our current estimates, such amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the 
period estimates are revised. Changes in estimates can materially affect compensation expense within i ndividual periods.  
 
Estimates and assumptions are based upon informatio n currently available, including historical experie nce and current business and economic 
conditions. However, if actual results are not cons istent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be  exposed to changes in stock-based 
compensation expense that could be material. A 10% change in our stock-based compensation expense for the year ended January 31, 2015, 
would have affected net earnings by approximately $ 5 million in fiscal 2015.  
 
Self-Insured Liabilities  
 
We are self-insured for certain losses related to h ealth, workers' compensation and general liability claims, as well as customer warranty 
programs, although we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain of these claims. When estimating our self-insured 
liabilities, we consider a number of factors, inclu ding historical claims experience, demographic fact ors, severity factors and valuations provided 
by independent third-party actuaries. Our self- insured liabilities involve uncertainty because man agement is required to make assumptions and to 
apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to set tle reported claims and claims incurred, but not re ported at the balance sheet date.  
 
We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimat es or assumptions we use to calculate our 
self-insured liabilities. However, if actual result s are not consistent with our estimates or assumpti ons, we may be exposed to losses or gains that 
could be material. A 10% change in our self-insured  liabilities at January 31, 2015, would have affect ed net earnings by approximately 
$7 million in fiscal 2015.  
 
New Accounting Pronouncements  
 
In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards B oard (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU ) 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued 
Operations and Disclosures of Components of an Enti ty . The new guidance amends the definition of a disco ntinued operation and requires new 
disclosures of both discontinued operations and cer tain other disposals that do not meet the definitio n of a discontinued operation. The new 
guidance is effective prospectively beginning in th e first quarter of fiscal 2016. We do not expect ad option of the new guidance to have a 
material impact on our consolidated financial state ments.  
 
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , as a new Topic, Accounting Standards Codification  
(ASC) Topic 606. The new guidance provides a compre hensive framework for the analysis of revenue trans actions and will apply to all of our 
revenue streams. Based on the current effective dat es, the new guidance would first apply in the first  quarter of fiscal 2018. While we are still in 
the process of evaluating the effect of adoption on  our financial statements, we do not currently expe ct a material impact on our results of 
operations, cash flows or financial position.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures A bout Market Risk.  
 
In addition to the risks inherent in our operations , we are exposed to certain market risks.  
 
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk  
 
We have market risk arising from changes in foreign  currency exchange rates related to our Internation al segment operations. On a limited basis, 
we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to ma nage foreign currency exposure to certain forecast inventory purchases, recognized 
receivable and payable balances and our investment in our Canadian operations. Our primary objective i n holding derivatives is to reduce the 
volatility of net earnings and cash flows, as well as of the net asset value associated with changes i n foreign currency exchange rates. Our foreign 
currency risk management strategy includes both hed ging instruments and derivatives that are not desig nated as hedging instruments, which 
generally have terms of up to 12 months. The aggreg ate notional amount related to our foreign exchange  forward contracts outstanding at 
January 31, 2015 , and February 1, 2014 , was $409 million and $157 million , respectively. The fair v alue recorded on our Consolidated 
Balance Sheets related to our foreign exchange forw ard contracts outstanding at January 31, 2015 , and  February 1, 2014 , $30 million and $(3) 
million , respectively. The amount recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings related to all contracts settled and outstanding was a 
gain of $12 million in fiscal 2015 and a gain of $5  million in fiscal 2014 .  
 
The strength of the U.S. dollar compared to the Can adian dollar and Mexican peso since the end of fisc al 2014 had a negative overall impact on 
our revenue as these currencies translated into few er U.S. dollars. We estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had a net 
unfavorable impact on our revenue in fiscal 2015 of  approximately $308 million  and a net unfavorable impact on earnings of $4 million . In 
fiscal 2014, the impact of foreign currency exchang e rate fluctuations had an unfavorable impact on ou r revenue of approximately $203 million 
 and an unfavorable impact on earnings of $6 millio n .

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financ ial Reporting  
 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financia l reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) 
under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed under the supervisi on of our principal executive officer and

of financial reporting and the preparation of finan cial statements for external purposes in accordance  with GAAP, and includes those policies and 
procedures that:  
 
 
 
 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal contr ol over financial reporting may not prevent or dete ct misstatements. Therefore, even those 
systems determined to be effective can provide only  reasonable assurance with respect to financial sta tement preparation and presentation.  
 
Under the supervision and with the participation of  our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we 
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2015 , u sing the criteria set forth by the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission  (COSO) in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment, 
we have concluded that our internal control over fi nancial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2 015 . During our assessment, we did not 
identify any material weaknesses in our internal co ntrol over financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche L LP, the independent registered public 
accounting firm that audited our consolidated finan cial statements for the year ended January 31, 2015  , included in Item 8, Financial Statements

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  
 
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of  
Best Buy Co., Inc.:  
Richfield, Minnesota  
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balan ce sheets of Best Buy Co., Inc. and subsidiaries (t he “Company”) as of January 31, 2015 
and February 1, 2014 and the related consolidated s tatements of earnings, comprehensive income, cash f lows, and changes in shareholders’ 
equity for the 12 months ended January 31, 2015, th e 12 months ended February 1, 2014 and the 11 month s ended February 2, 2013. Our audits 
also included the financial statement schedule list ed in the Index at Item 15(a). These financial stat ements and financial statement schedule are 
the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our  responsibility is to express an opinion on these f inancial statements and financial 
statement schedule based on our audits.  
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the stan dards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Bo ard (United States). Those standards 
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtai n reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material 
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a tes t basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclo sures in the financial statements. An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles u sed and significant estimates made by management, a s well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  
 
In our opinion, such consolidated financial stateme nts present fairly, in all material respects, the f inancial position of Best Buy Co., Inc. and 
subsidiaries as of January 31, 2015 and February 1,  2014, and the results of their operations and thei r cash flows for the 12 months ended 
January 31, 2015, the 12 months ended February 1, 2 014, and the 11 months ended February 2, 2013, in c onformity with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also, in our opinion, such financial statement sch edule, when considered in relation to the 
basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, t he information set forth therein.  
 
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financia l statements, effective for fiscal year 2013, the C ompany changed its fiscal year end from the 
Saturday nearest the end of February to the Saturda y nearest the end of January. As a result of this c hange, fiscal year 2013 was an 11-month 
transition period beginning March 4, 2012 through F ebruary 2, 2013.  
 
We have also audited, in accordance with the standa rds of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Boar d (United States), the Company’s 
internal control over financial reporting as of Jan uary 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in  Internal Control - Integrated Framework 
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations  of the Treadway Commission and our report dated Ma rch 31, 2015, expressed an 
unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal contr ol over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  
 
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of  
Best Buy Co., Inc.:  
Richfield, Minnesota  
 
We have audited the internal control over financial  reporting of Best Buy Co., Inc. and subsidiaries ( the “Company”), as of January 31, 2015, 
based on criteria established in Internal Control -Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations  of the 
Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is re sponsible for maintaining effective internal contro l over financial reporting and for its 
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control  over financial reporting, included in the accompan ying Management’s Report on Internal 
Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibilit y is to express an opinion on the Company’s interna l control over financial reporting based 
on our audit.  
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the stand ards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Boa rd (United States). Those standards 
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtai n reasonable assurance about whether effective inte rnal control over financial reporting was 
maintained in all material respects. Our audit incl uded obtaining an understanding of internal control  over financial reporting, assessing the risk 
that a material weakness exists, testing and evalua ting the design and operating effectiveness of inte rnal control based on the assessed risk, and 
performing such other procedures as we considered n ecessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our 
opinion.  
 
A company’s internal control over financial reporti ng is a process designed by, or under the supervisi on of, the company’s principal executive 
and principal financial officers, or persons perfor ming similar functions, and effected by the company ’s board of directors, management, and 
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance reg arding the reliability of financial reporting and t he preparation of financial statements for 
external purposes in accordance with generally acce pted accounting principles. A company’s internal co ntrol over financial reporting includes 
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to t he maintenance of records that, in reasonable detai l, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions 
and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of financial statements in accordance with generall y accepted accounting principles, and that receipts  and expenditures of the company are being 
made only in accordance with authorizations of mana gement and directors of the company; and (3) provid e reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acqu isition, use, or disposition of the company’s asset s that could have a material effect on the 
financial statements.  
 
Because of the inherent limitations of internal con trol over financial reporting, including the possib ility of collusion or improper management 
override of controls, material misstatements due to  error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on  a timely basis. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal con trol over financial reporting to future periods are  subject to the risk that the controls may 
become inadequate because of changes in conditions,  or that the degree of compliance with the policies  or procedures may deteriorate.  
 
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all mate rial respects, effective internal control over fina ncial reporting as of January 31, 2015, based 
on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations  of the 
Treadway Commission.  
 
We have also audited, in accordance with the standa rds of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Boar d (United States), the consolidated 
financial statements and financial statement schedu le as of and for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, of the Company and our report dated 
March 31, 2015, expressed an unqualified opinion on  those financial statements and financial statement  schedule and includes an explanatory 
paragraph concerning the Company’s change in fiscal  year end from the Saturday nearest the end of Febr uary to the Saturday nearest the end of 
January, effective for fiscal year 2013.

Fiscal Year  
 
On November 2, 2011, our Board of Directors approve d a change in our fiscal year-end from the Saturday  nearest the end of February to the 
Saturday nearest the end of January, effective begi nning with our fiscal year 2013. As a result of thi s change, our fiscal year 2013 was an 11 -
month transition period beginning March 4, 2012, th rough February 2, 2013. Concurrent with the change,  we began consolidating the results of 
our Europe, China and Mexico operations on a one -m onth lag, compared to a two -month lag in prior yea rs, to continue aligning the fiscal 
reporting periods of our international operations w ith statutory filing requirements. In these consoli dated statements, including the notes thereto, 
financial results for fiscal 2013 are for an 11 -mo nth period. Corresponding results for fiscal 2015 a nd fiscal 2014 are both for 12 -month 
periods.  
 
As a result of the 11-month transition period for f iscal 2013, the month of January 2012 was not captu red in our consolidated fiscal 2013 (11-
month) results for those entities reported on a one -month lag. As a result, the Consolidated Statement s of Cash Flows includes a net reconciling 
adjustment for the cash flows as a result of the ex clusion of January 2012 in fiscal 2013 (11-month). The total adjustment was $74 million , 
primarily due to $50 million of cash used in financ ing activities and $18 million of cash used in inve sting activities.  
 
Basis of Presentation  
 
The consolidated financial statements include the a ccounts of Best Buy Co., Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. All intercompany balances 
and transactions are eliminated upon consolidation.   
 
In order to align our fiscal reporting periods and comply with statutory filing requirements, we conso lidate the financial results of our Mexico 
operations, as well as our discontinued Europe and China operations, on a one -month lag. Our policy i s to accelerate recording the effect of 
events occurring in the lag period that significant ly affect our consolidated financial statements. No  significant intervening event occurred in 
these operations that would have materially affecte d our financial condition, results of operations, l iquidity or other factors had it been recorded 
during fiscal 2015, 2014 or 2013 (11-month).  
 
In preparing the accompanying consolidated financia l statements, we evaluated the period from February  1, 2015, through the date the financial 
statements were issued for material subsequent even ts requiring recognition or disclosure. Other than as  
 
61 
Table of Contents  
 
described in Note 12, Contingencies and Commitments , and Note 13, Subsequent Event , no such events were identified for this period.  
 
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial St atements  
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformi ty with accounting principles generally accepted in  the U.S. ("GAAP") requires us to make 
estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assu mptions affect the reported amounts in the consolid ated financial statements, as well as the 
disclosure of contingent liabilities. Future result s could be materially affected if actual results we re to differ from these estimates and 
assumptions.  
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents  
 
Cash primarily consists of cash on hand and bank de posits. Cash equivalents consist of money market fu nds, treasury bills, commercial paper, 
corporate bonds and deposits with an original matur ity of 3 months or less when purchased. The amounts  of cash equivalents at January 31, 
2015 , and February 1, 2014 , were $1,660 million a nd $1,705 million , respectively, and the weighted- average interest rates were 0.4% and 
0.5% , respectively.  
 
Outstanding checks in excess of funds on deposit (b ook overdrafts) totaled $0 million and $62 million at January 31, 2015 , and February 1, 
2014 , respectively, and are reflected within accou nts payable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
 
Receivables  
 
Receivables consist principally of amounts due from  mobile phone network operators for commissions ear ned; banks for customer credit card, 
debit card and electronic benefits transfer (EBT) t ransactions; and vendors for various vendor funding  programs.  
 
We establish allowances for uncollectible receivabl es based on historical collection trends and write- off history. Our allowances for uncollectible 
receivables were $59 million and $104 million at Ja nuary 31, 2015 , and February 1, 2014 , respectivel y.  
 
Merchandise Inventories  
 
Merchandise inventories are recorded at the lower o f cost, using the average cost, or market. In-bound  freight-related costs from our vendors are 
included as part of the net cost of merchandise inv entories. Also included in the cost of inventory ar e certain vendor allowances that are not a 
reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifi able costs to promote a vendor's products. Other co sts associated with acquiring, storing and 
transporting merchandise inventories to our retail stores are expensed as incurred and included in cos t of goods sold.  
 
Our inventory valuation reflects adjustments for an ticipated physical inventory losses (e.g., theft) t hat have occurred since the last physical 
inventory. Physical inventory counts are taken on a  regular basis to ensure that the inventory reporte d in our consolidated financial statements is 
properly stated.  
 
Our inventory valuation also reflects markdowns for  the excess of the cost over the amount we expect t o realize from the ultimate sale or other 
disposal of the inventory. Markdowns establish a ne w cost basis for our inventory. Subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in 
the reversal of previously recorded markdowns or an  increase in the newly established cost basis.  
 
Restricted Assets  
 
Restricted cash totaled $292 million at January 31,  2015, of which $184 million is related to continui ng operations and included in other current 
assets and $108 million is included in current asse ts held for sale in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.  Restricted cash totaled $310 million at 
February 1, 2014 and is included in other current a ssets or other assets in our Consolidated Balance S heet. Such balances are pledged as 
collateral or restricted to use for vendor payables , general liability insurance and workers' compensa tion insurance.  
 
Property and Equipment  
 
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. We com pute depreciation using the straight-line method ov er the estimated useful lives of the 
assets. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over  the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the  period from  
 
62  
Table of Contents  
 
the date the assets are placed in service to the en d of the lease term, which includes optional renewa l periods if they are reasonably assured. 
Accelerated depreciation methods are generally used  for income tax purposes.  
 
When property is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed f rom our Consolidated Balance Sheets and 
any resulting gain or loss is reflected in our Cons olidated Statements of Earnings.  
 
Repairs and maintenance costs are charged directly to expense as incurred. Major renewals or replaceme nts that substantially extend the useful 
life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated.  
 
Costs associated with the acquisition or developmen t of software for internal use are capitalized and amortized over the expected useful life of 
the software, from three to seven years. A subseque nt addition, modification or upgrade to internal- use software is capitalized to the extent that it 
enhances the software's functionality or extends it s useful life. Capitalized software is included in fixtures and equipment. Software maintenance 
and training costs are expensed in the period incur red.  
 
Property under capital lease is comprised of buildi ngs and equipment used in our operations. The relat ed depreciation for capital lease assets is 
included in depreciation expense. The carrying valu e of property under capital lease was $44 million a nd $58 million at January 31, 2015 , and 
February 1, 2014 , respectively, net of accumulated  depreciation of $75 million and $62 million , resp ectively.  
 
Estimated useful lives by major asset category are as follows:  
 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Costs Associate d With Exit Activities  
 
Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment when ever events or changes in circumstances indicate th e carrying value of an asset may not be 
recoverable. Factors considered important that coul d result in an impairment review include, but are n ot limited to, significant under-
performance relative to historical or planned opera ting results, significant changes in the manner of use or expected life of the assets, or 
significant changes in our business strategies. An impairment loss is recognized when the estimated un discounted cash flows expected to result 
from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expecte d from the disposition of the asset (if any) are le ss than the carrying value of the asset. When 
an impairment loss is recognized, the carrying amou nt of the asset is reduced to its estimated fair va lue based on quoted market prices or other 
valuation techniques (e.g., discounted cash flow an alysis).  
 
When reviewing long-lived assets for impairment, we  group long-lived assets with other assets and liab ilities at the lowest level for which 
identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For  example, long-lived assets deployed at store 
locations are reviewed for impairment at the indivi dual store level, which involves comparing the carr ying value of all land, buildings, leasehold 
improvements, fixtures and equipment located at eac h store to the net cash flow projections for each s tore. In addition, we conduct separate 
impairment reviews at other levels as appropriate, for example, to evaluate potential impairment of as sets shared by several areas of operations, 
such as information technology systems.  
 
The present value of costs associated with vacated properties, primarily future lease costs (net of ex pected sublease income), are charged to 
earnings when we cease using the property. We accel erate depreciation on property and equipment we exp ect to retire when a decision is made 
to abandon a property.  
 
At January 31, 2015 , and February 1, 2014 , the ob ligation associated with vacant properties included  in accrued liabilities in our Consolidated 
Balance Sheets was $26 million and $33 million , re spectively, and the obligation associated with vaca nt properties included in long-term 
liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets was $43 million and $86 million , respectively. The obl igation associated with vacant properties at 
January 31, 2015 , and February 1, 2014 , included amounts associated with our restructuring activitie s as further described in Note 4, 
Restructuring Charges .

Leases  
 
We conduct the majority of our retail and distribut ion operations from leased locations. The leases re quire payment of real estate taxes, insurance 
and common area maintenance, in addition to rent. T he terms of our new lease agreements for large-form at stores are generally less than 10 
years, although we have existing leases with terms up to 20 years. Small-format stores generally have lease terms that are half the length of 
large-format stores. Most of the leases contain ren ewal options and escalation clauses, and certain st ore leases require contingent rents based on 
factors such as specified percentages of revenue or  the consumer price index.  
 
For leases that contain predetermined fixed escalat ions of the minimum rent, we recognize the related rent expense on a straight-line basis from 
the date we take possession of the property to the end of the initial lease term. We record any differ ence between the straight-line rent amounts 
and amounts payable under the leases as part of def erred rent, in accrued liabilities or long-term lia bilities, as appropriate.  
 
Cash or lease incentives received upon entering int o certain store leases ("tenant allowances") are re cognized on a straight-line basis as a 
reduction to rent from the date we take possession of the property through the end of the initial leas e term. We record the unamortized portion of 
tenant allowances as a part of deferred rent, in ac crued liabilities or long-term liabilities, as appr opriate.  
 
At January 31, 2015 , and February 1, 2014 , deferr ed rent included in accrued liabilities in our Cons olidated Balance Sheets was $31 million 
and $36 million , respectively, and deferred rent i ncluded in long-term liabilities in our Consolidate d Balance Sheets was $195 million and $232 
million , respectively.  
 
We also lease certain equipment under noncancelable  operating and capital leases. In addition, we have  financing leases for which the gross cost 
of constructing the asset is included in property a nd equipment, and amounts reimbursed from the landl ord are recorded as financing obligations. 
Assets acquired under capital and financing leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life  of the asset or the lease term, including 
renewal periods, if reasonably assured.  
 
Goodwill and Intangible Assets  
 
Goodwill  
 
Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over t he fair value of identifiable net assets acquired i n business combinations. We test goodwill for 
impairment annually, as of the first day of the fis cal fourth quarter, or when indications of potentia l impairment exist. We monitor the existence 
of potential impairment indicators throughout the f iscal year. We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level and our reporting units 
are the components of operating segments which cons titute businesses for which discrete financial info rmation is available and is regularly 
reviewed by segment management. No components were aggregated in arriving at our reporting units. Our only reporting unit with a goodwill 
balance at the beginning of fiscal 2015 was Best Bu y Domestic.  
 
Our detailed impairment testing involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carryi ng value, including goodwill. Fair value 
reflects the price a market participant would be wi lling to pay in a potential sale of the reporting u nit and is based on discounted cash flows or 
relative market-based approaches. If the fair value  exceeds carrying value, then it is concluded that no goodwill impairment has occurred. If the 
carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fa ir value, a second step is required to measure poss ible goodwill impairment loss. The second 
step includes hypothetically valuing the tangible a nd intangible assets and liabilities of the reporti ng unit as if the reporting unit had been 
acquired in a business combination. Then, the impli ed fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is c ompared to the carrying value of that 
goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting un it's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the  goodwill, we recognize an impairment loss in 
an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the ca rrying value. In fiscal 2015, we determined that th e fair value of the Best Buy Domestic 
reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, and as a result, no goodwill impairment was recorded in fi scal 2015.  
 
In fiscal 2013 (11-month), initial goodwill impairm ent assessments as of November 4, 2012, based on fo recasts in place at that time, indicated 
that fair value exceeded carrying value for each re porting unit. However, operating performance in our  Best Buy Canada and Five Star reporting 
units fell significantly below expectations in the later part of the fiscal fourth quarter. Therefore,  we updated our forecasts for Best Buy Canada 
and Five Star and tested for goodwill impairment as  of the end of fiscal 2013 (11-month). The updated forecasts, which were used as the basis 
for our discounted cash flow ("DCF") valuations for  goodwill testing purposes, reflected significantly  lower cash flows than previously forecast. 
Our analysis for step one of detailed impairment te sting indicated that carrying values exceeded fair values for both Best Buy Canada and Five 
Star. Step two  
 
64  
Table of Contents  
 
entailed allocating the fair values determined from  step one to the fair value of all recognized and a ppropriately unrecognized assets and 
liabilities to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. In both cases, this analysis led to the c onclusion that the goodwill had no value, and 
therefore we recorded full impairment of the goodwi ll associated with Best Buy Canada ( $611 million )  and Five Star ( $208 million ). The 
Canada goodwill impairment is included in continuin g operations in our International segment, and the Five Star goodwill impairment is 
included in discontinued operations.  
 
Tradenames and Customer Relationships  
 
We include our tradenames and customer relationship s within intangibles, net in our Consolidated Balan ce Sheets. We have an indefinite-lived 
tradename related to Pacific Sales included within our Domestic segment. We also have an indefinite-li ved tradename related to Future Shop 
included within our International segment.  
 
Our valuation of identifiable intangible assets acq uired is based on information and assumptions avail able to us at the time of acquisition, using 
income and market approaches to determine fair valu e. We do not amortize our indefinite-lived tradenam es, but test for impairment annually, or 
when indications of potential impairment exist. We utilize the relief from royalty method to determine  the fair value of each of our indefinite-
lived tradenames. If the carrying value exceeds the  fair value, we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess. No material 
impairments were identified during fiscal 2015.  
 
The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill and indefinite-lived tradenames by segment were as foll ows in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 (11-
month) ($ in millions):

Insurance  
   
We are self-insured for certain losses related to h ealth, workers' compensation and general liability claims; however, we obtain third-party 
insurance coverage to limit our exposure to these c laims. A portion of these self-insured losses are m anaged through a wholly-owned insurance 
captive. We estimate our self-insured liabilities u sing a number of factors, including historical clai ms experience, an estimate of incurred but not 
reported claims, demographic and severity factors, and valuations provided by independent third-party actuaries. Our self-insured liabilities 
included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were as  follows ($ in millions):  
 
Income Taxes  
 
We account for income taxes using the asset and lia bility method. Under this method, deferred tax asse ts and liabilities are recognized for the 
estimated future tax consequences attributable to d ifferences between the financial statement carrying  amounts of existing assets and liabilities 
and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. We record a valuatio n allowance to reduce the carrying amounts 
of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than no t that such assets will not be realized.  
 
In determining our provision for income taxes, we u se an annual effective income tax rate based on ann ual income, permanent differences 
between book and tax income, and statutory income t ax rates. The effective income tax rate also reflec ts our assessment of the ultimate outcome 
of tax audits. We adjust our annual effective incom e tax rate as additional information on outcomes or  events becomes available. Discrete events, 
such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws, a re recognized in the period in which they occur.  
 
Our income tax returns are periodically audited by U.S. federal, state and local and foreign tax autho rities. At any one time, multiple tax years 
are subject to audit by the various tax authorities . In evaluating the tax benefits associated with ou r various tax filing positions, we record a tax 
benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highe st cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. A number of years may 
elapse before a particular matter, for which we hav e established a liability, is audited and effective ly settled. We adjust our liability for 
unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which we  determine the issue is effectively settled with th e tax authorities, the statute of limitations 
expires for the relevant taxing authority to examin e the tax position or when more information becomes  available. We include our liability for 
unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalt ies and interest, in accrued income taxes and long- term liabilities on our Consolidated 
Balance Sheets and in income tax expense in our Con solidated Statements of Earnings.  
 
Accrued Liabilities  
 
The major components of accrued liabilities at Janu ary 31, 2015 , and February 1, 2014 , were state an d local tax liabilities, rent-related 
liabilities including accrued real estate taxes, lo yalty program liabilities and self-insurance reserv es.  
 
Long-Term Liabilities  
 
The major components of long-term liabilities at Ja nuary 31, 2015 , and February 1, 2014 , were unreco gnized tax benefits, rent-related 
liabilities, deferred compensation plan liabilities , self-insurance reserves and deferred revenue.  
 
Foreign Currency  
 
Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchang e rates in effect at our consolidated balance 
sheet date. For operations reported on a one -month  lag, we use the exchange rates in effect one month  prior to our consolidated balance sheet 
date. Results of operations and cash flows are tran slated using the average exchange rates throughout the period. The effect of exchange rate 
fluctuations on the translation of assets and liabi lities is included as a component of shareholders' equity in accumulated other comprehensive 
income. Gains and losses from foreign currency tran sactions, which are included in SG&A, have not been  significant in any of the periods 
presented.

Revenue Recognition  
 
Our revenue arises primarily from sales of merchand ise and services. We also record revenue from sales  of service contracts, extended 
warranties, other commissions and credit card progr ams. Revenue excludes sales taxes collected.  
 
We recognize revenue when the sales price is fixed or determinable, collection is reasonably assured a nd the customer takes possession of the 
merchandise, or in the case of services, the servic e has been provided. Revenue is recognized for stor e sales when the customer receives and 
pays for the merchandise. For online sales, we defe r revenue and the related product costs for shipmen ts that are in-transit to the customer and 
recognize revenue at the time the customer receives  the product. Online customers typically receive go ods within a few days of shipment. 
Revenue from merchandise sales and services is repo rted net of sales returns, including an estimate of  future returns based on historical return 
rates, with a corresponding reduction to cost of sa les. Our sales returns reserve was $25 million and $13 million at January 31, 2015 , and 
February 1, 2014 , respectively.  
 
We sell service contracts and extended warranties t hat typically have terms ranging from 3 months to 4  years. We also receive commissions for 
customer subscriptions with various third parties, including mobile phone network operators. In instan ces where we are deemed to be the obligor 
on the service contract or subscription, the servic e and commission revenue is deferred and recognized  ratably over the term of the service 
contract or subscription period. In instances where  we are not deemed to be the obligor on the service  contract or subscription, commissions are 
recognized in revenue when such commissions have be en earned, primarily driven by commencement of serv ice to the customer. Service and 
commission revenues earned from the sale of extende d warranties represented 2.1% , 2.2% and 2.5% of re venue in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 
(11-month), respectively.  
 
For revenue transactions that involve multiple deli verables, we defer the revenue associated with any undelivered elements. The amount of 
revenue deferred in connection with the undelivered  elements is determined using the relative fair val ue of each element, which is generally 
based on each element's relative retail price.  
 
At January 31, 2015 , and February 1, 2014 , short- term deferred revenue was $376 million , of which $ 50 million is included in current 
liabilities held for sale, and $399 million , respe ctively. At January 31, 2015 , and February 1, 2014  , deferred revenue included within long- term 
liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets was $49 million and $50 million , respectively.  
 
For additional information related to our credit ca rd arrangements and customer loyalty programs, see Credit Services and Financing and Sales 
Incentives, respectively, below.  
 
Gift Cards  
 
We sell gift cards to our customers in our retail s tores, through our websites and through selected th ird parties. We do not charge administrative 
fees on unused gift cards and our gift cards do not  have an expiration date. We recognize revenue from  gift cards when: (i) the gift card is 
redeemed by the customer, or (ii) the likelihood of  the gift card being redeemed by the customer is re mote ("gift card breakage"), and we 
determine that we do not have a legal obligation to  remit the value of unredeemed gift cards to the re levant jurisdictions. We determine our gift 
card breakage rate based upon historical redemption  patterns. Based on our historical information, the  likelihood of a gift card remaining 
unredeemed can be determined 24  months after the g ift card is issued. At that time, we recognize brea kage income for those cards for which the 
likelihood of redemption is deemed remote and we do  not have a legal obligation to remit the value of such unredeemed gift cards to the relevant 
jurisdictions. Gift card breakage income is include d in revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Earn ings.  
 
Gift card breakage income was as follows in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 (11-month) ($ in millions):  
 
Credit Services and Financing  
 
I n the U.S., we have an agreement with a bank for th e issuance of promotional financing and customer lo yalty credit cards bearing the Best Buy 
brand. Under the agreement, the bank manages and di rectly extends credit to our customers. Cardholders  who choose promotional financing can 
receive deferred-interest financing on qualifying p urchases. The bank is the sole owner of the account s receivable generated under the program 
and accordingly, we do not hold any consumer receiv ables related to these programs. We earn revenue fr om the bank based primarily on the 
performance of the portfolio.

Table of Contents  
 
   
We also have agreements for promotional financing a nd credit cards with banks for our businesses in Ca nada and Mexico, and we account for 
these programs in a manner consistent with the U.S.  agreement.  
   
In addition, we also accept Visa ® , MasterCard ® , Discover ® , JCB ® and American Express ® credit cards, as well as debit cards from all major  
international networks.  
 
Sales Incentives  
 
We frequently offer sales incentives that entitle o ur customers to receive a reduction in the price of  a product or service. Sales incentives include 
discounts, coupons and other offers that entitle a customer to receive a reduction in the price of a p roduct or service either at the point of sale or 
by submitting a claim for a refund or rebate. For s ales incentives issued to a customer in conjunction  with a sale of merchandise or services for 
which we are the obligor, the reduction in revenue is recognized at the time of sale, based on the exp ected retail value of the incentive expected 
to be redeemed.  
 
Customer Loyalty Programs  
   
We have customer loyalty programs which allow membe rs to earn points for each qualifying purchase. Poi nts earned enable members to receive 
a certificate that may be redeemed on future purcha ses at our Best Buy branded stores. There are two p rimary ways that members may 
participate and earn loyalty points.  
   
First, we have customer loyalty programs where memb ers earn points for each purchase. Depending on the  customer's membership level within 
our loyalty program, certificates expire either 2 o r 12 months from the date of issuance. The retail v alue of points earned by our loyalty program 
members is included in accrued liabilities and reco rded as a reduction of revenue at the time the poin ts are earned, based on the percentage of 
points that are projected to be redeemed.  
   
Second, under our credit card agreement, we have a customer loyalty credit card bearing the Best Buy b rand. Cardholders earn points for 
purchases made at our stores and related websites i n the U.S., as well as purchases at other merchants . Points earned entitle cardholders to 
receive certificates that may be redeemed on future  purchases at our stores and related websites. Cert ificates expire either 2 or 12 months from 
the date of issuance. The retail value of points ea rned by our cardholders is included in accrued liab ilities and recorded as a reduction of revenue 
at the time the points are earned, based on the per centage of points that are projected to be redeemed .  
   
We recognize revenue when: (i) a certificate is red eemed by the customer; (ii) a certificate expires, or (iii) the likelihood of a certificate being 
redeemed by a customer is remote ("certificate brea kage"). We determine our certificate breakage rate based upon historical redemption patterns. 
   
Cost of Goods Sold and Selling, General and Adminis trative Expenses  
   
The following table illustrates the primary costs c lassified in each major expense category:  
 
68  Cost of Goods Sold  
•    Total cost of products sold including:  
     —    Freight expenses associated with moving merchandise  inventories from our vendors to our distribution c enters;  
     —    Vendor allowances that are not a reimbursement of s pecific, incremental and identifiable costs to prom ote a vendor's products; and  
     —    Cash discounts on payments to merchandise vendors;  
•    Cost of services provided including:  
     —    Payroll and benefits costs for services employees; and  
     —    Cost of replacement parts and related freight expen ses;  
•    Physical inventory losses;  
•    Markdowns;  
•    Customer shipping and handling expenses;  
•    Costs associated with operating our distribution ne twork, including payroll and benefit costs, occupan cy costs, and depreciation; and  
•    Freight expenses associated with moving merchandise  inventories from our distribution centers to our r etail stores.  
Table of Contents  
 
 
Vendor Allowances  
   
We receive allowances from certain vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements intended to offset our costs of promoting and 
selling merchandise inventories. Vendor allowances are primarily in the form of receipt-based funds or  sell-through credits. Receipt-based funds 
are generally determined at an agreed percentage of  purchases and are initially deferred and recorded as a reduction of merchandise inventories. 
The deferred amounts are then included as a reducti on of cost of goods sold when the related product i s sold. Sell-through credits are generally 
determined at an agreed percentage of sales and are  recognized when the related product is sold. Vendo r allowances provided as a 
reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifi able costs, such as specialized store labor or trai ning costs, are included in SG&A as an 
expense reduction when the cost is incurred.  
   
Advertising Costs  
   
Advertising costs, which are included in SG&A, are expensed the first time the advertisement runs. Adv ertising costs consist primarily of digital, 
print and television advertisements, as well as pro motional events. Advertising expenses were $711 mil lion , $757 million and $703 million in 
fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 (11-month), respectivel y.  
   
Stock-Based Compensation  
   
We apply the fair value recognition provisions of a ccounting guidance as they relate to our stock-base d compensation, which require us to 
recognize expense for the fair value of our stock-b ased compensation awards. We recognize compensation  expense on a straight-line basis over 
the requisite service period of the award (or to an  employee's eligible retirement date, if earlier).  
   
2.  Discontinued Operations  
 
Discontinued operations comprise the following:

recorded an $18 million pre-tax loss.  
 
International Segment  
 
Five Star – During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we entere d into a definitive agreement to sell our Five Star  business to Yingtan City 
Xiangyuan Investment Limited Partnership and Zhejia ng Jiayuan Real Estate Group Co. The assets and lia bilities of our Five Star business are 
classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Bal ance Sheets and the results of Five Star are presen ted as discontinued operations in the

The composition of assets and liabilities held for sale as of January 31, 2015, was as follows ($ in m illions):  
 
Best Buy Europe – During the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we comple ted the sale of our 50% ownership interest in Best Buy Europe to CPW 
in return for the following consideration upon clos ing: net cash of £341 million ( $526 million ); £80  million ( $123 million ) of ordinary shares 
of CPW; £25 million ( $39 million ), plus 2.5% inte rest, to be paid by CPW on June 26, 2014; and £25 m illion ( $39 million ), plus 2.5% 
interest, to be paid by CPW on June 26, 2015. We su bsequently sold the ordinary shares of CPW for $123  million on July 3, 2013, and we 
received the first such deferred cash payment on Ju ne 26, 2014.  
 
In conjunction with our agreement to sell our 50% o wnership interest in Best Buy Europe, we entered in to a deal-contingent foreign currency 
forward contract to hedge £455 million of the total  £471 million of net proceeds. The contract was set tled in cash following the completion of 
the sale on June 26, 2013, and we recognized a $2 m illion loss in gain (loss) from discontinued operat ions on our Consolidated Statements of 
Earnings in fiscal 2014.  
 
The aggregate financial results of all discontinued  operations for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 (11-mon th) were as follows ($ in millions):

related to our Five Star reporting unit in fiscal 2 013 (11-month).  
(3)  Income tax benefit for fiscal 2014 includes a $27 million benefit related to a tax allocation bet ween continuing and discontinued operations and a $ 15 million benefit related to 
the impairment of our investment in Best Buy Europe . The fiscal 2014 effective tax rate for discontinu ed operations differs from the statutory tax rate p rimarily due to the 
previously mentioned tax allocation, sale of mindSH IFT, restructuring charges and the impairment of ou r investment in Best Buy Europe. The sale of mindSH IFT, 
restructuring charges and impairment generally incl uded no related tax benefit. The deferred tax asset s related to the sale of mindSHIFT and restructurin g charges generally 
resulted in an increase in the valuation allowance in an equal amount, of which the investment impairm ent is not tax deductible.  
(4)  Gain in fiscal 2014 is primarily comprised of the following: $28 million gain (with no tax impact ) from sale of Best Buy Europe fixed-line business in Switzerland in the first 
quarter; $24 million gain (with no tax impact) from  the sale of Best Buy Europe in the second quarter;  and loss of $18 million from sale of mindSHIFT in the fourth quarter.

3.   Fair Value Measurements  
 
Fair value is the price that would be received to s ell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an ex it price) in the principal or most advantageous 
market for the asset or liability in an orderly tra nsaction between market participants on the measure ment date. To measure fair value, we use a 
three-tier valuation hierarchy based upon observabl e and non-observable inputs:  
 
Level 1  — Unadjusted quoted prices that are available in a ctive markets for identical assets or liabilities a t the measurement date.  
 
Level 2  — Significant other observable inputs available at  the measurement date, other than quoted prices inc luded in Level 1, either directly or 
indirectly, including:  
 
 
Level 3  — Significant unobservable inputs that cannot be c orroborated by observable market data and reflect t he use of significant management 
judgment. These values are generally determined usi ng pricing models for which the assumptions utilize  management's estimates of market 
participant assumptions.  
 
Assets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Va lue on a Recurring Basis  
 
The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observ able market data when available. In instances in wh ich the inputs used to measure fair value 
fall into different levels of the fair value hierar chy, the fair value measurement has been determined  based on the lowest level input that is 
significant to the fair value measurement in its en tirety. Our assessment of the significance of a par ticular item to the fair value measurement in 
its entirety requires judgment, including the consi deration of inputs specific to the asset or liabili ty. The following tables set forth by level within 
the fair value hierarchy, our financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value o n a recurring basis at January 31, 2015 , and 
February 1, 2014 , according to the valuation techn iques we used to determine their fair values ($ in millions).

•  Quoted prices for identical or similar assets in  non-active markets; 
•  Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable  for the asset or liability; and

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument:  
   
Money Market Funds. Our money market fund investments were measured at fair value as they trade in an active market using quoted 
market prices and, therefore, are classified as Lev el 1.  
 
Corporate Bonds. Our corporate bond investments were measured at fai r value using quoted market prices. They were class ified as Level 2 
as they trade in a non-active market for which bond  prices are readily available.  
   
Commercial Paper. Our investments in commercial paper were measured u sing inputs based upon quoted prices for similar in struments in 
active markets and, therefore, were classified as L evel 2.  
   
Treasury Bills. Our Treasury bills were classified as Level 1 as th ey traded with sufficient frequency and volume to e nable us to obtain 
pricing information on an ongoing basis.  
   
Foreign Currency Derivative Instruments. Comprised primarily of foreign currency forward con tracts and foreign currency swap contracts, 
our foreign currency derivative instruments were me asured at fair value using readily observable marke t inputs, such as quotations on 
forward foreign exchange points and foreign interes t rates. Our foreign currency derivative instrument s were classified as Level 2 as these 
instruments are custom, over-the-counter contracts with various bank counterparties that are not trade d in an active market.  
 
Interest Rate Swap Derivative Instruments. Our interest rate swap contracts were measured at f air value using readily observable inputs, 
such as the LIBOR interest rate. Our interest rate swap derivative instruments were classified as Leve l 2 as these instruments are custom, 
over-the-counter contracts with various bank counte rparties that are not traded in an active market.  
   
Auction Rate Securities. Our investments in auction rate securities ("ARS") were classified as Level 3 as quoted prices were un available. 
Due to limited market information, we utilized a DC F model to derive an estimate of fair value. The as sumptions we used in preparing the 
DCF model include estimates with respect to the amo unt and timing of future interest and principal pay ments, forward projections of the 
interest rate benchmarks, the probability of full r epayment of the principal considering the credit qu ality and guarantees in place, and the 
rate of return required by investors to own such se curities given the current liquidity risk associate d with ARS.

Marketable Equity Securities. Our marketable equity securities were measured at f air value using quoted market prices. They were cla ssified 
as Level 1 as they trade in an active market for wh ich closing stock prices are readily available.  
   
Marketable Securities that Fund Deferred Compensati on. The assets that fund our deferred compensation cons ist of investments in mutual 
funds. These investments were classified as Level 1  as the shares of these mutual funds trade with suf ficient frequency and volume to enable 
us to obtain pricing information on an ongoing basi s.  
   
Assets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Va lue on a Nonrecurring Basis  
   
Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair va lue on a nonrecurring basis relate primarily to our  tangible fixed assets, goodwill and other 
intangible assets, which are remeasured when the de rived fair value is below carrying value on our Con solidated Balance Sheets. For these 
assets, we do not periodically adjust carrying valu e to fair value except in the event of impairment. When we determine that impairment has 
occurred, the carrying value of the asset is reduce d to fair value and the difference is recorded with in operating income in our Consolidated 
Statements of Earnings.  
   
The following table summarizes the fair value remea surements for non-restructuring property and equipm ent impairments and restructuring 
activities recorded for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014  ($ in millions):  
 
All of the fair value remeasurements included in th e table above were based on significant unobservabl e inputs (Level 3). Refer to Note 1, 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , for further information associated with the goodw ill impairments. Fixed asset fair values were 
derived using a DCF model to estimate the present v alue of net cash flows that the asset or asset grou p is expected to generate. The key inputs to 
the DCF model generally included our forecasts of n et cash generated from revenue, expenses and other significant cash outflows, such as 
capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate dis count rate. For the tradename, fair value was deriv ed using the relief from royalty method, as 
described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . In the case of assets for which the impairment wa s the result of restructuring 
activities, no future cash flows have been assumed as the assets will cease to be used and expected sa le values are nominal.  
 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments  
 
Our financial instruments, other than those present ed in the disclosures above, include cash, receivab les, short-term investments, other 
investments, accounts payable, other payables and l ong-term debt. The fair values of cash, receivables , short-term investments, accounts payable 
and other payables approximated carrying values bec ause of the short-term nature of these instruments.  If these instruments were measured at 
fair value in the financial statements, they would be classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarch y. Short-term investments other than those 
disclosed in the tables above represent time deposi ts. Fair

Summary  
   
Restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2015, 2014  and 2013 (11-month) were as follows ($ in millions ):  
   
Renew Blue Plan  
   
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 (11-month), we  began implementing initiatives intended to reduce costs and improve operating performance. 
These initiatives included focusing on core busines s activities, reducing headcount, updating our stor e operating model and optimizing our real 
estate portfolio. These cost reduction initiatives represented one of the key Renew Blue priorities fo r fiscal 2014 and 2015 and cost reductions 
will continue to be a priority in fiscal 2016. We i ncurred $29 million of charges related to Renew Blu e initiatives during fiscal 2015. Of the total 
charges, $10 million related to our Domestic segmen t, which consisted of employee termination benefits . The remaining $19 million of charges 
related to our International segment and consisted of employee termination benefits, property and equi pment impairments and facility closure 
and other costs. We expect to continue to implement  cost reduction initiatives throughout fiscal 2016,  as we further analyze our operations and 
strategies.  
   
We incurred $165 million of charges related to Rene w Blue initiatives during fiscal 2014. Of the total  charges, $129 million related to our 
Domestic segment, which consisted primarily of empl oyee termination benefits, investment impairments, and property and equipment 
impairments. The remaining $36 million of charges r elated to our International segment and consisted o f employee termination benefits, facility 
closure and other costs, and property and equipment  impairments.  
 
For continuing operations, the inventory write-down s related to our Renew Blue restructuring activitie s are presented in restructuring charges – 
cost of goods sold in our Consolidated Statements o f Earnings and the remainder of the restructuring c harges are presented in restructuring 
charges in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  The restructuring charges from discontinued operat ions related to this plan are presented in

Short-Term Debt  
 
U.S. Revolving Credit Facilities  
 
Our $500 million 364-day senior unsecured revolving  credit facility agreement with a syndicate of bank s, which was entered into on June 25, 
2013, expired on June 25, 2014.  
 
On June 30, 2014, we entered into a $1.25 billion f ive-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility  agreement (the "Five-Year Facility 
Agreement") with a syndicate of banks. The Five-Yea r Facility Agreement replaced the previous $1.5 bil lion senior unsecured revolving credit 
facility with a syndicate of banks, which was origi nally scheduled to expire in October 2016, but was terminated on June 30, 2014.  
 
The interest rate under the Five-Year Facility Agre ement is variable and is determined at our option a s: (i) the sum of (a) the greatest of (1) 
JPMorgan's prime rate, (2) the federal funds rate p lus 0.5% , and (3) the one-month London Interbank O ffered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 1.0% , and 
(b) a variable margin rate (the “ABR Margin”); or ( ii) the LIBOR plus a variable margin rate (the “LIB OR Margin”). In addition, a facility fee is 
assessed on the commitment amount. The ABR Margin, LIBOR Margin and the facility fee are based upon th e registrant's current senior 
unsecured debt rating. Under the Five-Year Facility  Agreement, the ABR Margin ranges from 0.0% to 0.92 5% , the LIBOR Margin ranges from

outstanding and at January 31, 2015, $1.25 billion was available under the Five-Year Facility Agreemen t.  
   
The Five-Year Facility Agreement is guaranteed by s pecified subsidiaries of Best Buy Co., Inc. and con tain customary affirmative and negative 
covenants. Among other things, these covenants rest rict Best Buy Co., Inc. and certain of its subsidia ries' ability to incur certain types or 
amounts of indebtedness, incur liens on certain ass ets, make material changes in corporate structure o r the nature of its business, dispose of 
material assets, engage in a change in control tran saction, make certain foreign investments, enter in to certain restrictive agreements, or engage 
in certain transactions with affiliates. The Five- Year Facility Agreement also contains financial cov enants that require us to maintain a maximum 
cash flow leverage ratio and a minimum interest cov erage ratio (both ratios measured quarterly for the  previous 12 months). The Five-Year 
Facility Agreement contains default provisions incl uding, but not limited to, failure to pay interest or principal when due and failure to comply 
with covenants.

Long -Term Debt  
   
Long-term debt consisted of the following ($ in mil lions):  
 
2018 Notes  
   
On July 16, 2013, we completed the sale of $500 mil lion principal amount of notes due August 1, 2018 ( the “2018 Notes”). The 2018 Notes bear 
interest at a fixed rate of 5.00% per year, payable  semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 of each y ear, beginning on February 1, 2014. Net 
proceeds from the sale of the 2018 Notes were $495 million , after underwriting and issue discounts to taling $5 million .  
   
We may redeem some or all of the 2018 Notes at any time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of  (1) 100% of the principal amount of the 
2018 Notes to be redeemed and (2) the sum of the pr esent values of each remaining scheduled payment of  principal and interest on the 2018 
Notes to be redeemed discounted to the redemption d ate on a semi -annual basis at the Treasury Rate plus 50 basis po ints. Furthermore, if a 
change of control triggering event occurs, we will be required to offer to purchase the remaining unre deemed 2018 Notes at a price equal to 
101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and un paid interest to the purchase date.  
   
The 2018 Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obl igations and rank equally with all of our other uns ecured and unsubordinated debt. The 
2018 Notes contain covenants that, among other thin gs, limit our ability and the ability of our subsid iaries to incur debt secured by liens and 
enter into sale and lease-back transactions.  
   
2016 and 2021 Notes  
   
In March 2011, we issued $350 million principal amo unt of notes due March 15, 2016 (the “2016 Notes”) and $650 million principal amount of 
notes due March 15, 2021 (the “2021 Notes” and, tog ether with the 2016 Notes, the “Notes”). The 2016 N otes bear interest at a fixed rate of 
3.75% per year, while the 2021 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.50% per year. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on March 15 
and September 15 of each year, beginning on Septemb er 15, 2011. The Notes were issued at a slight disc ount to par, which when coupled with 
underwriting discounts of $6 million , resulted in net proceeds from the sale of the Notes of $990 mil lion .  
   
We may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 1 00% of the principal amount and (ii) the 
sum of the present values of each remaining schedul ed payment of principal and interest discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual 
basis, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the prin cipal amount to the redemption date as described in  the indenture (including the supplemental 
indenture) relating to the Notes. Furthermore, if a  change of control triggering event occurs, we will  be required to offer to purchase the 
remaining unredeemed Notes at a price equal to 101%  of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid  interest to the purchase date.  
 
The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligati ons and rank equally with all of our other unsecure d and unsubordinated debt. The Notes 
contain covenants that, among other things, limit o ur ability to incur debt secured by liens or to ent er into sale and lease-back transactions.

6.   Derivative Instruments  
 
We manage our economic and transaction exposure to certain risks through the use of foreign currency d erivative instruments and interest rate 
swaps. Our objective in holding derivatives is to r educe the volatility of net earnings, cash flows an d net asset value associated with changes in 
foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.  We do not hold derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We have no 
derivatives that have credit risk-related contingen t features, and we mitigate our credit risk by enga ging with financial institutions with 
investment grade credit ratings as our counterparti es.  
 
We record all derivative instruments on our Consoli dated Balance Sheet at fair value and evaluate hedg e effectiveness prospectively and 
retrospectively when electing to apply hedge accoun ting. We formally document all hedging relations at  the inceptions for derivative hedges and 
the underlying hedged items, as well as the risk ma nagement objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction. In addition, we 
have derivatives which are not designated as hedgin g instruments.  
 
Net Investment Hedges  
 
In fiscal 2015, we entered into foreign exchange fo rward contracts to hedge against the effect of Cana dian dollar exchange rate fluctuations on a 
portion of our net investment in our Canadian opera tions. The contracts have terms up to 12 months. Fo r a net investment hedge, we recognize 
changes in the fair value of the derivative as a co mponent of foreign currency translation within othe r comprehensive income to offset a portion 
of the change in translated value of the net invest ment being hedged, until the investment is sold or liquidated. We limit recognition in net 
earnings of amounts previously recorded in other co mprehensive income to circumstances such as complet e or substantially complete liquidation 
of the net investment in the hedged foreign operati on. We report the ineffective portion of the gain o r loss, if any, in net earnings. We had no net 
investment hedge activity during fiscal 2014.  
 
Interest Rate Swaps  
 
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we entered in to receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest r ate swaps to mitigate the effect of interest rate 
fluctuations on a portion of our 2018 Notes. Our in terest rate swap contracts are considered perfect h edges because the critical terms and notional 
amounts match those of our fixed-rate debt being he dged and are therefore accounted as a fair value he dge using the shortcut method. Under the 
shortcut method, we recognize the change in the fai r value of the derivatives with an offsetting chang e to the carrying value of the debt. 
Accordingly, there is no impact on our Consolidated  Statements of Earnings from the fair value of the derivatives. We had no interest rate swap 
activity in fiscal 2014.  
 
Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments  
 
We use foreign currency forward contracts to manage  the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exc hange rates relative to recognized 
receivable and payable balances denominated in non- functional currencies and on certain forecast inven tory purchases denominated in non-
functional currencies. The contracts generally have  terms of up to 12 months. These derivative

7.   Shareholders' Equity  
 
Stock Compensation Plans  
 
Our 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "Omnibus Plan" ) authorizes us to grant or issue non-qualified sto ck options, incentive stock options, 
stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restri cted stock units and other equity awards up to a to tal of 22.5 million shares. We have not granted 
incentive stock options under the Omnibus Plan. Und er the terms of the Omnibus Plan, awards may be gra nted to our employees, officers, 
advisers, consultants and directors. Awards issued under the Omnibus Plan vest as determined by the Co mpensation and Human Resources 
Committee of our Board of Directors at the time of grant. Awards granted, forfeited or canceled under the previous plan, the 2004 Omnibus 
Stock and Incentive Plan, after February 1, 2014 ad just the amount available under the Omnibus Plan. A t January 31, 2015 , a total of 22.7

Upon adoption and approval of the Omnibus Plan, all  of our previous equity incentive compensation plan s were terminated. However, existing 
awards under those plans continued to vest in accor dance with the original vesting schedule and will e xpire at the end of their original term.  
 
Our outstanding stock options have a 10 -year term.  Outstanding stock options issued to employees gene rally vest over a three or four -year 
period, and outstanding stock options issued to dir ectors vest immediately upon grant. Share awards ve st based either upon attainment of 
specified goals or upon continued employment. Outst anding share awards that are not time-based vest at  the end of a three-year incentive period 
based upon our total shareholder return ("TSR") com pared to the TSR of companies that comprise Standar d & Poor's 500 Index ("market-
based"). We have time-based share awards that vest in their entirety at the end of three - and four -y ear periods, time-based share awards where 
25% of the award vests on the date of grant and 25%  vests on each of the three anniversary dates there after, and time-based share awards to 
directors vest one year from the grant date.  
 
During fiscal 2014, our Employee Stock Purchase Pla n was amended. The Plan permits employees to purcha se our common stock at a 5% 
discount from the market price at the end of semi-a nnual purchase periods and is non-compensatory. Dur ing fiscal 2013 (11-month), the Plan 
permitted our employees to purchase our common stoc k at a 15% discount from the market price of the st ock at the beginning or at the end of a 
semi-annual purchase period, whichever is less, and was considered compensatory. Employees are required to hold the common stock purchased 
for 12 months. In fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 (11-m onth), 0.3 million , 0.6 million and 1.0 million sh ares, respectively, were purchased through 
our employee stock purchase plans. At January 31, 2 015 , and February 1, 2014 , plan participants had accumulated $1 million and $2 million , 
respectively, to purchase our common stock pursuant  to these plans.  
 
Stock-based compensation expense was as follows in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 (11-month) ($ in millio ns):

Market -Based Share Awards  
 
The fair value of market-based share awards is dete rmined based on generally accepted valuation techni ques and the closing market price of our 
stock on the date of grant. A summary of the status  of our nonvested market-based share awards at Janu ary 31, 2015 , and changes during fiscal 
2015 , is as follows:  
 
At January 31, 2015 , there was $20 million of unre cognized compensation expense related to nonvested market-based share awards that we 
expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 1.9  years.  
 
Time-Based Share Awards  
 
The fair value of time- based share awards is determined based on the closi ng market price of our stock on the date of grant. This value is reduced 
by the present value of expected dividends during v esting when the employee is not entitled to dividen ds.

Earnings per Share  
 
We compute our basic earnings per share based on th e weighted-average number of common shares outstand ing, and our diluted earnings per 
share based on the weighted-average number of commo n shares outstanding adjusted by the number of addi tional shares that would have been 
outstanding had the potentially dilutive common sha res been issued. Potentially dilutive securities in clude stock options, nonvested share awards 
and shares issuable under our employee stock purcha se plan. Nonvested market-based share awards and no nvested performance-based share 
awards are included in the average diluted shares o utstanding each period if established market or per formance criteria have been met at the end 
of the respective periods.  
 
At January 31, 2015 , options to purchase 17.3 mill ion shares of common stock were outstanding as foll ows (shares in millions):  
 
The computation of dilutive shares outstanding excl udes the out-of-the-money stock options because suc h outstanding options' exercise prices 
were greater than the average market price of our c ommon shares and, therefore, the effect would be an ti-dilutive (i.e., including such options 
would result in higher earnings per share).  
 
The following table presents a reconciliation of th e numerators and denominators of basic and diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2015 , 2014 
and 2013 (11-month):

Comprehensive income (loss) is computed as net earn ings (loss) plus certain other items that are recor ded directly to shareholders' equity. In 
addition to net earnings (loss), the significant co mponents of comprehensive income (loss) include for eign currency translation adjustments and

The composition of net rent expense for all operati ng leases, including leases of property and equipme nt, was as follows in fiscal 2015 , 2014 
and 2013 (11-month) ($ in millions):  
 
The future minimum lease payments under our capital , financing and operating leases by fiscal year (no t including contingent rentals) at 
January 31, 2015 , were as follows ($ in millions):   
 
Total minimum lease payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease rent income of approximately $1 17 million due under future 
noncancelable subleases.  
 
9.    Benefit Plans  
 
We sponsor retirement savings plans for employees m eeting certain eligibility requirements. Participan ts may choose from various investment 
options, including a fund comprised of our company stock. Participants can contribute up to 50% of the ir eligible compensation annually as 
defined by the plan document, subject to Internal R evenue Service ("IRS") limitations. We match 100% o f the first 3% of participating 
employees' contributions and 50% of the next 2% . E mployer contributions vest immediately. The total e mployer contributions were $60 
million , $65 million and $62 million in fiscal 201 5 , 2014 and 2013 (11-month), respectively.  
 
We have a non-qualified, unfunded deferred compensa tion plan for highly compensated employees and memb ers of our Board of Directors. 
Amounts contributed and deferred under our deferred  compensation plan are credited or charged with the  performance of investment options 
offered under the plan and elected by the participa nts. In the event of bankruptcy, the assets of the plan are available to satisfy the claims of 
general creditors. The liability for compensation d eferred under the plan was $44 million and $54 mill ion at January 31, 2015 , and February 1, 
2014 , respectively, and is included in long-term l iabilities. We manage the risk of changes in the fa ir value of the liability for deferred 
compensation by electing to match our liability und er the plan with investment vehicles that offset a substantial portion of our exposure. The 
cash value of the investment vehicles, which includ es funding for future deferrals, was $97 million an d $96 million at January 31, 2015 , and 
February 1, 2014 , respectively, and is included in  other assets. Both the asset and the liability are  carried at fair value.

10.   Income Taxes  
 
The following is a reconciliation of the federal st atutory income tax rate to income tax expense in fi scal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 (11-month) ($ in 
millions):  
 
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we purchased CPW’s interest in the Best Buy Mobile profit share agreement for  $1.3 billion  (the “Mobile 
buy-out”). The Mobile buy-out completed by our U.K.  subsidiary resulted in the  $1.3 billion  purchase  price being assigned, for U.S. tax 
purposes only, to an intangible asset. The Mobile b uy-out did not, however, result in a similar intang ible asset in the U.K., as the Mobile buy- out 
was considered part of a tax-free equity transactio n for U.K. tax purposes.  
 
Because the U.S. tax basis in the intangible asset was considered under U.S. tax law to be held by our  U.K. subsidiary, which is regarded as a 
foreign corporation for U.S. tax purposes, ASC 740,   Income Taxes , requires that no deferred tax asset may be record ed in respect of the 
intangible asset. ASC 740-30-25-9 also precludes th e recording of a deferred tax asset on the outside basis difference of the U.K. subsidiary. As 
a result, the amortization of the U.S. tax basis in  the intangible asset only resulted in a periodic i ncome tax benefit by reducing the amount of the 
U.K. subsidiary’s income, if any, that would otherw ise have been subject to U.S. income taxes.  
 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we filed an el ection with the Internal Revenue Service to treat t he U.K. subsidiary as a disregarded entity such 
that its assets are now deemed to be assets held di rectly by a U.S. entity for U.S. tax purposes. This  tax-only election, which results in the 
liquidation of the U.K. subsidiary for U.S. tax pur poses, resulted in the elimination of the Company’s  outside basis difference in the U.K. 
subsidiary. Additionally, the election resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax asset (and corres ponding income tax benefit) for the remaining 
unrecognized inside tax basis in the intangible, in  a manner similar to a change in tax status as prov ided in ASC 740-10-25-32.  
 
Earnings from continuing operations before income t ax expense by jurisdiction was as follows in fiscal  2015 , 2014 and 2013 (11-month) ($ in

Deferred tax assets and liabilities included in our  Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows ($ in millions): 
 
At January 31, 2015 , we had total net operating lo ss carryforwards from international operations of $ 118 million , of which $110 million will 
expire in various years through 2025 and the remain ing amounts have no expiration. Additionally, we ha d acquired U.S. federal net operating 
loss carryforwards of $21 million which expire betw een 2023 and 2030 , U.S. federal foreign tax credit  carryforwards of $1 million which expire 
between 2022 and 2024 , state credit carryforwards of $12 million which expire in 2024 , and state cap ital loss carryforwards of $4 million 
which expire in 2019 .  
 
At January 31, 2015 , a valuation allowance of $143  million had been established, of which $1 million is against U.S. federal foreign tax credit 
carryforwards, $11 million is against U.S. federal and state capital loss carryforwards, $6 million is  against state credit carryforwards and other 
state deferred tax assets, and $125 million is agai nst certain international net operating loss carryf orwards and other international deferred tax 
assets. The $15 million decrease from February 1, 2 014 , is primarily due to the decrease in the valua tion allowance against the U.S. federal 
foreign tax credit carryforward.  
 
We have not provided deferred taxes on unremitted e arnings attributable to foreign operations that hav e been considered to be reinvested 
indefinitely. These earnings relate to ongoing oper ations and were $770 million at January 31, 2015 . It is not practicable to determine the 
income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not indefinitely reinvested.  
 
The following table provides a reconciliation of ch anges in unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 (11- month) ($ in millions): 
 
Unrecognized tax benefits of $297 million , $228 mi llion and $231 million at January 31, 2015 , Februa ry 1, 2014 , and February 2, 2013, 
respectively, would favorably impact our effective income tax rate if recognized.  
 
We recognize interest and penalties (not included i n the "unrecognized tax benefits" above), as well a s interest received from favorable tax 
settlements, as components of income tax expense. I nterest income of $6 million was recognized in fisc al 2015 . At January 31, 2015 , 
February 1, 2014 , and February 2, 2013, we had acc rued interest of $78 million , $91 million and $85 million , respectively, along with accrued 
penalties of $2 million , $2 million and $0 million  at January 31, 2015 , February 1, 2014 , and Febru ary 2, 2013, respectively.

We file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax retu rn, as well as income tax returns in various states  and foreign jurisdictions. With few 
exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federa l, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinat ions by tax authorities for years before 
fiscal 2005 .  
 
Because existing tax positions will continue to gen erate increased liabilities for us for unrecognized  tax benefits over the next 12  months, and 
since we are routinely under audit by various taxin g authorities, it is reasonably possible that the a mount of unrecognized tax benefits will 
change during the next 12  months. An estimate of t he amount or range of such change cannot be made at  this time. However, we do not expect 
the change, if any, to have a material effect on ou r consolidated financial condition, results of oper ations or cash flows within the next 12 
 months.  
 
11.   Segment and Geographic Information  
   
Segment Information  
   
Our chief operating decision maker ("CODM") is our Chief Executive Officer. Our business is organized into two reportable segments: 
Domestic (which is comprised of all operations with in the U.S. and its territories) and International (which is comprised of all operations outside 
the U.S. and its territories). Our CODM has ultimat e responsibility for enterprise decisions. Our CODM  determines, in particular, resource 
allocation for, and monitors performance of, the co nsolidated enterprise, the Domestic segment and the  International segment. The Domestic 
segment managers and International segment managers  have responsibility for operating decisions, alloc ating resources and assessing 
performance within their respective segments. Our C ODM relies on internal management reporting that an alyzes enterprise results to the net 
earnings level and segment results to the operating  income level.  
   
We aggregate our Canada and Mexico businesses into one International operating segment. Our Domestic a nd International operating segments 
also represent our reportable segments. The account ing policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 1, Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies .

Contingencies  
 
We are involved in a number of legal proceedings. W here appropriate, we have made accruals with respec t to these matters, which are reflected 
in our consolidated financial statements. However, there are cases where liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated 
and therefore accruals have not been made. We provi de disclosure of matters where we believe it is rea sonably possible the impact may be 
material to our consolidated financial statements.  
 
Securities Actions  
 
In February 2011, a purported class action lawsuit captioned, IBEW Local 98 Pension Fund, individually and on beh alf of all others similarly 
situated v. Best Buy Co., Inc., et al. , was filed against us and certain of our executive  officers in the U.S. District Court for the Distri ct of 
Minnesota. This federal court action alleges, among  other things, that we and the officers named in th e complaint violated Sections 10(b) and 
20A of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 under the Ex change Act in connection with press releases and ot her statements relating to our fiscal 
2011 earnings guidance that had been made available  to the public. Additionally, in March 2011, a simi lar purported class action was filed by a 
single shareholder, Rene LeBlanc, against us and ce rtain of our executive officers in the same court. In July 2011, after consolidation of the 
IBEW Local 98 Pension Fund and Rene LeBlanc actions , a consolidated complaint captioned, IBEW Local 98  Pension Fund v. Best Buy Co., 
Inc., et al., was filed and served. We filed a moti on to dismiss the consolidated complaint in Septemb er 2011, and in March 2012, subsequent to 
the end of fiscal 2012, the court issued a decision  dismissing the action with prejudice. In April 201 2, the plaintiffs filed a motion to alter or 
amend the court's decision on our motion to dismiss . In October 2012, the court granted plaintiff's mo tion to alter or amend the court's decision 
on our motion to dismiss in part by vacating such d ecision and giving plaintiff leave to file an amend ed complaint, which plaintiff did in October 
2012. We filed a motion to dismiss the amended comp laint in November 2012 and all responsive pleadings  were filed in December 2012. A 
hearing was held on April 26, 2013. On August 5, 20 13, the court issued an order granting our motion t o dismiss in part and, contrary to its 
March 2012 order, denying the motion to dismiss in part, holding that certain of the statements allege d to have been made were not forward-
looking statements and therefore were not subject t o the “safe-harbor” provisions of the Private Secur ities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA). 
Plaintiffs moved to certify the purported class. By  Order filed August 6, 2014, the court certified a class of persons or entities who acquired Best 
Buy common stock between 10:00 a.m. EDT on Septembe r 14, 2010, and December 13, 2010, and who were dam aged by the alleged violations 
of law. The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals granted ou r request for interlocutory appeal. Briefing is com plete. Oral argument is expected to be 
scheduled later in 2015. The trial court has stayed  proceedings while the appeal is pending. We contin ue to believe that these allegations are 
without merit and intend to vigorously defend our c ompany in this matter.

our Board of Directors serving during the relevant periods in fiscal 2011 and us as a nominal defendan t in the U.S. District Court for the State of 
Minnesota. The lawsuit alleges that the director de fendants breached their fiduciary duty, among other  claims, including violation of Section 10 
(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, in failing to correct public misrepresentations and  material misstatements and/or omissions 
regarding our fiscal 2011 earnings projections and,  for certain directors, selling stock while in poss ession of material adverse non-public 
information. Additionally, in July 2011, a similar purported class action was filed by a single shareh older, Daniel Himmel, against us and certain 
of our executive officers in the same court. In Nov ember 2011, the respective lawsuits of Salvatore M.  Talluto and Daniel Himmel were 
consolidated into a new action captioned, In Re: Be st Buy Co., Inc. Shareholder Derivative Litigation,  and a stay ordered pending the close of 
discovery in the consolidated IBEW Local 98 Pension  Fund v. Best Buy Co., Inc., et al. case.  
 
The plaintiffs in the above securities actions seek  damages, including interest, equitable relief and reimbursement of the costs and expenses they 
incurred in the lawsuits. As stated above, we belie ve the allegations in the above securities actions are without merit, and we intend to defend 
these actions vigorously. Based on our assessment o f the facts underlying the claims in the above secu rities actions, their respective procedural 
litigation history, and the degree to which we inte nd to defend our company in these matters, the amou nt or range of reasonably possible losses, 
if any, cannot be estimated.  
 
Cathode Ray Tube Action  
 
On November 14, 2011, we filed a lawsuit captioned In re Cathode Ray Tube Antitrust Litigation in the United States District Court for the 
Northern District of California. We allege that the  defendants engaged in price fixing in violation of  antitrust regulations relating to cathode ray 
tubes for the time period between March 1, 1995 thr ough November 25, 2007. No trial date has been set.  In connection with this action, we 
received settlement proceeds net of legal expenses and costs in the amount of $67 million in the first  quarter of fiscal 2016. We will continue to 
litigate against the remaining defendants and expec t further settlement discussions as this matter pro ceeds; however, it is uncertain whether we 
will recover additional settlement sums or a favora ble verdict at trial.  
 
Other Legal Proceedings  
 
We are involved in various other legal proceedings arising in the normal course of conducting business . For such legal proceedings, we have 
accrued an amount that reflects the aggregate liabi lity deemed probable and estimable, but this amount  is not material to our consolidated 
financial position, results of operations or cash f lows. Because of the preliminary nature of many of these proceedings, the difficulty in 
ascertaining the applicable facts relating to many of these proceedings, the variable treatment of cla ims made in many of these proceedings and 
the difficulty of predicting the settlement value o f many of these proceedings, we are not able to est imate an amount or range of any reasonably 
possible additional losses. However, based upon our  historical experience, the resolution of these pro ceedings is not expected to have a material 
effect on our consolidated financial position, resu lts of operations or cash flows.  
 
Commitments  
 
We engage Accenture LLP ("Accenture") to assist us with improving our operational capabilities and red ucing our costs in the information 
systems and human resources areas. We expect our fu ture contractual obligations to Accenture to range from $17 million to $89 million per year 
through fiscal 2018 , the end of the periods under contract.  
 
We had outstanding letters of credit and bankers' a cceptances for purchase obligations with an aggrega te fair value of $100 million at 
January 31, 2015 .

13.   Subsequent Events  
 
On February 13, 2015, we completed the sale of our Five Star business in China. The expected gain on t he sale will be included in the results of 
discontinued operations in the first quarter of fis cal 2016.  
 
On March 3, 2015, we announced a plan to return cap ital to shareholders. The plan includes a special, one-time dividend of $0.51 per share, or 
approximately $180 million , and a 21% increase in our regular quarterly dividend to $0.23 per share. We plan to resume share repurchases 
under the June 2011 program, with the intent to rep urchase $1 billion in shares over the next three ye ars.  
 
In March 2015, we made a decision to consolidate Fu ture Shop and Best Buy stores and websites in Canad a under the Best Buy brand. This 
resulted in permanently closing 66 Future Shop stor es and converting 65 Future Shop stores to the Best  Buy brand. The costs of implementing 
these changes primarily consist of lease exit costs , employee severance and asset impairments. We expe ct to incur total pre-tax restructuring 
charges and non-restructuring impairments in the ra nge of approximately $200 million to $280 million r elated to the actions. We expect that the 
majority of these charges will be recorded in the f irst quarter of fiscal 2016. The total charges incl udes approximately $140 million to $180 
million of cash charges.

7  (ii)  Former Participant . An individual who has been eligible to participat e in the Plan, who loses such 
eligibility by reason of a Termination of Employmen t or otherwise, and who again becomes 
eligible to participate in the Plan in a later Plan  Year, shall not be eligible to participate in the Plan 
for purposes of authorizing an Annual Deferral Amou nt for the Plan Year in which he or she again 
becomes so eligible unless he or she (x) has not be en eligible to make an Annual Deferral Amount 
election for two (2) or more consecutive years or ( y) has previously incurred a Termination of 
Employment and been paid all benefits under the Pla n after such Termination and before again

earned during the Plan Year or other period to whic h such election applies. No amount will be deferred

purposes of allocating the deferral of Base Salary between Plan Years, Base Salary earned for services  
performed during a payroll period that includes Dec ember 31st of any Plan Year that is paid in the 
following Plan Year shall be deemed to be earned en tirely in such later Plan Year.

any Participant’ s Company Contribution Account under this Plan, whi ch amount shall be for that 
Participant the Company Contribution Amount for tha t Plan Year. In no event, however, shall any such 
contribution be in lieu of or otherwise in replacem ent for an amount otherwise due to or on behalf of a 
Participant apart from the Plan. The amount so cred ited to a Participant may be smaller or larger than  the 
amount credited to any other Participant, and the a mount credited to any Participant for a Plan Year m ay 
be zero, even though one or more other Participants  receive a Company Contribution Amount for that 
Plan Year. The Company Contribution Amount, if any,  shall be credited as of the date selected by the 
Company.  
(b)  Time and Form of Payment . The Account Balance attributable to a Company Con tribution Account for a 
Plan Year shall be paid upon the same events and in  the same way and proportions as elected by the 
Participant with respect to the Deferral Account fo r such year. In the event no such election is made, such 
balance shall be paid in a lump sum within sixty (6 0) days after the end of the Plan Year in which the  
Participant dies or incurs a Termination of Employm ent.  
(a)  Election of Investment or Measurement Funds . A Participant, in connection with his or her 
commencement of participation in the Plan, shall el ect one or more investment funds as a measurement t o 
be used to determine the additional amounts to be c redited or debited to his or her Account Balance. 
Commencing with the first day that follows such com mencement and continuing thereafter for each 
subsequent day in which the Participant participate s in the Plan, the Participant may elect to add or delete 
one or more available investment funds or measures to be used to determine the additional amounts to b e 
credited or debited to his or her Account Balance, or to change the portion of his or her Account Bala nce 
allocated to any such fund. The Participant may cha nge the percentage of a current year Deferral and 
Company Contribution Accounts to be invested in eac h investment fund or elect to have all or part of t he 
Participant’ s Account Balance from prior years transferred amon g the investment funds at any time, or 
both. Any such election shall be effective as soon as administratively practicable after the election is 
made. Any such election shall continue in effect th ereafter unless and until a new election is made.  
(b)  Proportionate Allocation . In making an election the Participant shall speci fy, in increments of one 
percentage point (1%), the percentage of his or her  Account Balance to be allocated to an investment f und 
or measure.  
(c)  Measurement Funds . The Participant may elect one or more available i nvestment or measurement funds 
made available for this purpose, for the purpose of  crediting or  
 
 
debiting additional amounts to his or her Account B alance. As necessary, the Committee may, in its 
discretion, discontinue, substitute or add any such  fund. Each such action will take effect as of a da te

the Committee gives Participants advance written no tice of such change.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.6.     Vesting . A Participant shall be fully vested in his or her  Account Balance.  
 
 
9  (d)  Crediting or Debiting Method . The performance of each elected investment or mea surement fund (either 
positive or negative) will be determined by the Com mittee, in its reasonable discretion, based on the 
performance of such funds themselves. A Participant ’s Account Balance shall be credited or debited on a  
business daily basis based on the performance of su ch fund selected by the Participant, as determined by 
the Committee in its discretion, as though a Partic ipant’s Account Balance were invested in such funds 
selected by the Participant, in the percentages app licable to such day, at the closing price on such d ate.  
(e)  No Actual Investment . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan that may be interpreted to the 
contrary, the funds are to be used for measurement purposes only, and a Participant’ s election of any 
fund, the allocation to his or her Account Balance thereto, the calculation of additional amounts and the 
crediting or debiting of such amounts to a Particip ant’s Account Balance shall not be considered or 
construed in any manner as an actual investment of his or her Account Balance in such fund. Without 
limiting the foregoing, a Participant’s Account Bal ance and any sub -account balance thereof shall at all 
times be a bookkeeping entry only and shall not rep resent any investment made on his or her behalf by 
the Company, other Employer or the Trust; the Parti cipant shall at all times remain an unsecured credi tor 
of the Company or other Employer.  
(f)  Participant ’s Investment Elections . 
1.  General . The availability of investment funds for purposes  of crediting or debiting additional 
amounts to Account Balances is not a recommendation  to designate a deemed investment in any 
such investment fund. The selection of deemed inves tments is solely the responsibility of each 
Participant. No officer, employee or other agent of  the Company or other Employer or the Trustee 
is authorized to advise or make any recommendation concerning the selection of such funds and 
no such person is responsible for determining the s uitability or advisability of any such selection.  
2.  Participant Responsibility . Participants shall be solely responsible for sele cting, monitoring, and 
changing the investment funds in or by which their Account Balances are invested. Neither the 
Company, other Employer, Committee member, nor the Administrator shall be responsible for 
such investment decisions. To the extent a Particip ant does not affirmatively elect one or more 
investment funds with respect to his or her Account  Balance, he or she shall be deemed to have 
elected one or more funds designated for this purpo se by the Committee.  
2.7.  Payment of Withholdings to Trustees or Custodian Except as otherwise provided hereunder or unless 
otherwise directed by the Committee, an Employer sh all remit amounts withheld from  
 
 
Participants and any Company Contribution Amount to  the Trustee or other authorized custodian as soon as 
administratively feasible after such amounts are wi thheld or otherwise determined and payable.

fact that the Plan, the Trust and related documents  do not, and are not intended to, prescribe all rul es 
necessary to administer the Plan or anticipate all circumstances or events which may arise in the cour se of 
such administration.  
 
 
 
 
17  (b)  Code Section 409A . The Plan shall be administered, and the Committee  shall exercise its discretionary 
authority under the Plan, in a manner consistent wi th Code Section 409A and Treasury Regulations 
thereunder. Any permissible discretion to accelerat e or defer a Plan payment under such Regulations, t he 
power to exercise which is not otherwise assigned u nder the Plan, shall be exercised by the Committee.  In 
the event the matter over which such discretion may  be exercised relates to a Committee member, or suc h 
member is otherwise unable to objectively exercise such discretion, such member shall not take part in  
the deliberations and decisions regarding that matt er.  
(c)  Allocation to Participating Employers . To the extent practicable and necessary, the Comm ittee shall 
provide for an accounting of the Trust assets in su ch manner as will permit the accurate allocation of  
Account Balances or parts thereof, including the de emed investment earnings and losses attributable 
thereto, to the relevant Employer. The Committee sh all provide to each Employer all information 
necessary to permit each such Employer to prepare a ny reports or tax filings which may be required by 
reason of its status as an Employer.  
10.2.  Administration Upon Change In Control . 
(a)  General . For purposes of this Plan, the Committee, or an i ndependent third party administrator appointed 
by the Committee, shall be the “Administrator” at all times prior to the occurrence of a Change in  
Control. Upon and within one hundred twenty (120) d ays after a Change in Control, the individuals who 
comprised the Committee immediately prior to the Ch ange in Control (whether or not such individuals 
are members of the Committee following the Change i n Control) may, by written consent of a majority of  
such individuals, appoint an independent third part y administrator, and such independent third party 
administrator shall have the power and authority re served to the Committee hereunder except as 
otherwise provided. The Administrator shall have th e discretionary power to determine all questions 
arising in connection with the administration of th e Plan and the interpretation of the Plan and Trust  
including, but not limited to benefit entitlement d eterminations; provided, however, upon and after th e 
occurrence of a Change in Control, the Administrato r shall have no power to direct the investment of P lan 
assets or assets of the Trust or select any investm ent manager or custodial firm for the Plan or Trust . 
Upon and after the occurrence of a Change in Contro l, the Company shall pay all reasonable 
administrative expenses and fees of the Administrat or and supply full and timely information to the 
Administrator or all matters relating to the Plan, the Trust, the Participants and their Beneficiaries , the 
Account Balances of the Participants, the date of c ircumstances of the Retirement, Disability, death o r 
Termination of Employment of the Participants, and such other pertinent information as the Administrat or 
may reasonably require. In the event the individual s who comprised the Committee immediately prior to 
the Change in Control appoint an independent third party administrator upon or after the Change in 
Control, the Administrator may be terminated (and a  replacement appointed) thereafter only with the 
written consent of the  
 
 
majority of those Participants (or Beneficiaries fo r those Participants who are then deceased), per ca pita, 
who have an interest in the Plan on the date of suc h termination.

10.4.  Binding Effect of Decisions . The decision or action of the Committee and Admin istrator with respect to any

Committee or Administrator on all matters relating to the compensation of its Participants, the date a nd

other pertinent information as the Committee or Adm inistrator may reasonably require to administer the  Plan.  
11.1.  Termination . 
(a)  General . Although the Company anticipates that it will con tinue the Plan for an indefinite period of time, 
there is no guarantee that the Company will continu e the Plan or will not terminate the Plan at any ti me in 
the future. Accordingly, the Company reserves the r ight to discontinue its sponsorship of the Plan or to 
suspend or terminate the Plan at any time with resp ect to any or all of the participating Employees an d 
Directors. Except as otherwise provided or allowed for herein, however, such action shall not cancel a n

later than the end of the Plan Year in which such e vent occurs and, to the extent and manner allowed 
under Code Section 409A and Treasury Regulations th ereunder, all Account Balances of affected 
Participants remaining at the final liquidation of the Plan and Trust shall be paid in a lump sum 
notwithstanding the payment elections  
 
 
made by Participants. To the extent such liquidatio n and acceleration of payment is not so possible,

MISCELLANEOUS  
 
 
 
 
 
 
19  11.2.  Amendment . The Company may, at any time, amend or modify the  Plan in whole or in part; provided, however, 
that no such amendment shall (i) reduce the value o f a Participant’ s Account Balance determined as if the 
Participant had experienced a Termination of Employ ment as of the effective date of the amendment or 
modification, (ii) adversely affect any benefits to  which a Participant or Beneficiary has become enti tled as of the 
date of the amendment or modification, or (iii) ame nd or modify substantively this Section 11.2 or Sec tion 10.2 
coincident with or after a Change in Control, no ma tter when such amendment or modification is otherwi se 
purportedly effective.  
12.1.  Non -- --Guarantee of Employment . Nothing contained in this Plan shall be construed  as a contract of 
employment or other service between an Employer and  a Participant, or as a right of any Participant to  be 
continued in the employment or service of an Employ er, or as a limitation on the right of an Employer to 
discharge any Participant with or without notice or  with or without cause.  
12.2.  Rights to Trust Asset . No Participant or any other person shall have any  right to, or interest in, any part of the 
Trust assets upon Termination of employment or othe rwise, except as otherwise provided under the Plan.  If the 
assets of the Trust are insufficient to pay a Parti cipant’s benefits, the Participant’ s Employer shall pay any such 
amounts from its other general assets. If such Empl oyer does not timely pay such benefits, the sole re course of a 
claimant Participant or Beneficiary shall be agains t such Employer and neither the Company nor any oth er 
Employer shall be responsible to pay or provide for  the payment of such benefits or liable for the non payment 
thereof.  
12.3.  Suspension of Rules . 
(a)  Federal Securities and Other Laws . Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contr ary, and to the 
extent and for the time reasonably necessary to com ply with federal securities laws (or other applicab le 
laws or regulations), deferrals, Participant invest ment -direction, and payment dates and forms under the 
Plan may be suspended, changed, or delayed as neces sary to comply with such laws or regulations; 
provided, however, any payments so delayed shall be  paid to the Participant or Beneficiary as of the 
earliest date the Committee determines that such pa yment will not cause a violation of any such laws o r 
regulations.  
(b)  Section 162(m) . If the Committee reasonably determines that a sch eduled payment of benefits under the 
Plan will not be deductible by an Employer by reaso n of Code Section 162(m), it shall suspend all such  
payments to the extent not so deductible. Payments so suspended shall be paid within sixty (60) days a fter 
the affected Participant dies or incurs a Terminati on of Employment; provided, however, if the Partici pant 
is a Specified Employee when he or she incurs a Ter mination of Employment, payments suspended 
pursuant to this subsection shall be paid as descri bed in Section 4.4 or 5.4, as  
 
 
the case may be, as if the amounts so suspended wer e payable as a lump sum on the date of such 
Termination.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
20  (c)  Offset for Amounts Due . A Participant’ s Account Balance may be reduced by one or more off sets to 
repay any amounts then due and owing to an Employer , unless another means of repayment is agreed to 
by the Committee. Except for the right to immediate  offset for an amount up to $5,000, or such higher 
amount as allowed by Treasury Regulations or other directives under or related to Code Section 409A, 
the Account Balance shall not be so offset before i t is otherwise scheduled to be paid to the Particip ant or 
Beneficiary and the amount then offset shall not ex ceed the amount that would be otherwise so paid.  
12.4.  Requirement of Proof . In discharging their duties and responsibilities under the Plan, the Committee or other 
individual may require proof of any matter concerni ng this Plan, and no person shall acquire any right s or be 
entitled to receive any benefits under this Plan un til such proof is furnished.  
12.5.  Non -- --Alienation and Taxes . 
(a)  General . Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or as otherwise required by law, no right or 
interest of any Participant or Beneficiary in the P lan and the Trust shall be subject in any manner to  
anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignmen t, pledge, encumbrance, charge, attachment, 
garnishment, execution, levy, bankruptcy, or any ot her disposition of any kind, either voluntary or 
involuntary, prior to actual receipt of payment by the person entitled to such right or interest under  the 
provisions hereof, and any such disposition or atte mpted disposition shall be void.  
(b)  Tax Withholdings . 
(1)  General . Benefits earned under the Plan and payment of suc h benefits shall be subject to tax 
reporting and withholding as required by law and th e amount of such withholding may be 
determined by treating such benefits as being in th e nature of supplemental wages. If tax 
withholdings must be made before such benefits are paid to a Participant or Beneficiary (e.g., 
FICA taxes on deferrals), they shall be made from o ther wages paid to such individual apart from 
the Plan to the extent reasonably possible; provide d, however, if such other wages are insufficient 
for that purpose, the withholdings shall be made fr om and reduce deferrals or other contributions, 
as applicable, for the individual concerned or, if no such contributions are available, the relevant 
Employer shall advance the withholdings, the approp riate Account Balance of the individual 
concerned shall be reduced in the same amount, and upon the direction of the Committee the 
Trustee or other custodian shall remit to the Emplo yer an amount equal to such reduction.  
(2)  Tax Consequences . Neither the Company nor any other Employer repres ents or guarantees that 
any particular federal, foreign, state or local inc ome, payroll, or other tax consequence will result 
from participation in this Plan or payment of benef its under the Plan.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
21  12.6.  Savings Clause . 
(a)  General . If any term, covenant, or condition of this Plan,  or the application thereof to any person or 
circumstance, shall to any extent be held to be inv alid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Plan, or the 
application of any such term, covenant, or conditio n to persons or circumstances other than those as t o 
which it has been held to be invalid or unenforceab le, shall not be affected thereby, and, except to t he 
extent of any such invalidity or unenforceability, this Plan and each term, covenant, and condition he reof 
shall be valid and shall be enforced to the fullest  extent permitted by law.  
(b)  Section 409A . If any term, covenant, or condition of this Plan,  or the application thereof to any person or 
circumstance, shall be considered not to be in comp liance with Code Section 409A and Treasury 
Regulations thereunder, such as would cause all or part of the Participant’ s Account Balance to be 
currently taxable under such provisions, then such term, covenant, condition or application shall be 
considered modified to the extent necessary to achi eve its design and purpose and without such 
noncompliance or stricken if such modification is n ot reasonably possible.  
12.7.  Facility of Payment . If the Committee shall determine a Participant or  Beneficiary entitled to a distribution 
hereunder is incapable of caring for his or her own  affairs because of illness or otherwise, it may di rect any 
distribution from such Participant’ s Account Balances be made, in such shares as it sh all determine, to the 
spouse, child, parent or other blood relative of su ch Participant or Beneficiary, or any of them, or t o such other 
person or persons as the Committee may determine, u ntil such date as it shall determine such incapacit y no 
longer exists; provided, however, the exercise of t his discretion shall not cause an acceleration or d elay in the 
time of payment of Plan benefits except to the exte nt, and only for the duration of, the time reasonab ly necessary 
to resolve such matters or otherwise protect the in terests of the Plan. The Committee shall be under n o obligation 
to see to the proper application of the distributio ns so made to such person or persons and any such d istribution 
shall be a complete discharge of any liability unde r the Plan to such Participant or Beneficiary, to t he extent of 
such distribution.  
12.8.  Requirement of Releases . If, in the opinion of the Committee, any present or former spouse or dependent of a 
Participant or other person shall by reason of the law of any jurisdiction appear to have any bona fid e interest in 
Plan benefits that may become payable to a Particip ant or with respect to a deceased Participant, or o therwise has 
asserted such a claim, the Committee may direct suc h benefits be withheld pending receipt of such writ ten 
releases as it deems necessary to prevent or avoid any conflict or multiplicity of claims with respect  to the 
payment of such benefits, but only to the extent an d for the duration reasonably necessary to resolve such matters 
or otherwise protect the interests of the Plan.  
12.9.  Board Action . Any action which is required or permitted to be t aken by the Board of Directors of the Company 
under the Plan may be taken by the Compensation Com mittee of such Board or any other authorized commit tee 
of such Board.  
12.10.  Computational Errors . In the event mathematical, accounting, or similar  errors are made in processing or 
paying a benefit under the Plan, the Committee may make such equitable adjustments as it deems appropr iate 
(which may be retroactive) to correct such errors.
