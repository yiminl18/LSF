See
 the Summary of Business Segment Data and Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information, including revenuesand earnings from operations, for each of our business segments.
Intellectual Property
We own numerous patents and have
 licenses for the use of patents owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture. In additionto
 owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and from third parties. For example, the U.S. governmenthas
 licenses in our patents that are developed in performance of government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventionscovered
 by such patents for government purposes. Unpatented research, development and engineering skills, as well as certain trademarks, tradesecrets,
 and  other  intellectual  property  rights,  also  make  an  important  contribution  to  our  business.  While  our  intellectual  property  rights  in  theaggregate
 are  important  to  the  operation  of  each  of  our  businesses,  we  do  not  believe  that  our  business  would  be  materially  affected  by  theexpiration of any particular intellectual pro
perty right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement.Non-U.S. Revenues
See Note 
21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding non-U.S. revenues.Research and Development
Research
 and development expenditures involve experimentation, design, development and related test activities for defense systems, new andderivative
 jet  aircraft  including  both  commercial  and  military,  advanced  space  and  other  company-sponsored  product  development.  These  areexpensed as incurred includi
ng amounts allocable as reimbursable overhead costs on U.S. government contracts.Our total research and development expense, net amounted to 
$3.3 billion , $3.0 billion and $3.1 billion in 2015, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Research
 and development costs also include bid and proposal efforts related to government products and services, as well as costs incurred inexcess
 of  amounts  estimated  to  be  recoverable  under  cost-sharing  research  and  development  agreements.  Bid  and  proposal  costs  were $286 million 
, $289 million and $285 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. 3

The
 commercial  jet  aircraft  market  and  the  airline  industry  remain  extremely  competitive.  We  face  aggressive  international  competitors  who  areintent
 on  increasing  their  market  share,  such  as  Airbus,  Embraer  and  Bombardier,  and  other  entrants  from  Russia,  China  and  Japan.  We  arefocused
 on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts. We intend to continue to compete with other airplane manufacturers byproviding
 customers with greater value products, services, and support. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services networkwhich
 spans the life cycle of the airplane: aircraft acquisition, readying for service, maintenance and engineering, enhancing and upgrading, andtransition
ing to the next model - as well as the daily cycle of gate-to-gate operations. This enables us to provide a high level of customer satisfactionand productivity.
BDS
 faces  strong  competition  in  all  market  segments,  primarily  from  Lockheed  Martin  Corporation,  Northrop  Grumman  Corporation,  RaytheonCompany and General Dynamics Corporation. Non-U.S. companies such as
 BAE Systems and Airbus Group, continue to build a strategic presencein
 the U.S. market by strengthening their North American operations and partnering with U.S. defense companies. In addition, certain competitorshave
 occasionally formed teams with other competitors to address specific customer requirements. BDS expects the trend of strong competition tocontinue into 
2016 . Regulatory Matters
Our
 businesses are heavily regulated in most of our markets. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but notlimited
 to  all  of  the  branches  of  the  U.S.  military,  NASA,  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  and  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security.Similar government authorities exist in our internation
al markets.Government Contracts. 
The U.S.  government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, as wellas
 for default, based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If any of our U.S. government contracts were to be terminated forconvenience,
 we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of ourgovernment
 contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted andcould require us to pay the difference between the orig
inal contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted fromthe original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us li
able for damages resulting from the default.4

Table of ContentsCommercial
 Aircraft. In  the U.S., our commercial aircraft products are required to comply with FAA regulations governing production and qualitysystems,
 airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. Internationally, similar requirements exist forairworthiness,
 installation  and operational  approvals.  These  requirements  are  generally  administered  by the  national  aviation  authorities  of  eachcountry and, in the case of Europe, coordinated by the Europe
an Joint Aviation Authorities.Environmental. 
We  are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including thedischarge,
 treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We continually assess our compliance status andmanagement
 of  environmental  matters  to  ensure  our  operations  are  in  substantial  compliance  with  all  applicable  environmental  laws  andregulations.
 Investigation, remediation, and operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sitesare
 a normal, recurring part of our operations. These costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the U.S. government. It is reasonablypossible
 that  costs  incurred  to  ensure  continued  environmental  compliance  could  have  a  material  impact  on  our  results  of  operations,  financialcondition
 or cash flows if additional work requirements or more stringent clean-up standards are imposed by regulators, new areas of soil, air andgroundwater contamination are discovere
d and/or expansions of work scope are prompted by the results of investigations.A Potentially Responsibl
e Party (PRP) has joint and several liability under existing U.S. environmental laws. Where we have been designated a PRPby
 the Environmental Protection Agency or a state environmental agency, we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the full costof
 remediating contamination at our facilities or former facilities or at third-party sites. If we were required to fully fund the remediation of a site forwhich
 we were originally assigned a partial share, the statutory framework would allow us to pursue rights to contribution from other PRPs. Foradditional information relating to env
ironmental contingencies, see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.International. 
Our  international sales are subject to U.S. and non-U.S. governmental regulations and procurement policies and practices, includingregulations
 relating  to  import-export  control,  investment,  exchange  controls  and  repatriation  of  earnings.  International  sales  are  also  subject  tovarying currency, political and economic risks.
Raw Materials, Parts, and Subassemblies
We
 are  highly  dependent  on  the  availability  of  essential  materials,  parts  and  subassemblies  from  our  suppliers  and  subcontractors.  The  mostimportant
 raw materials required for our aerospace products are aluminum (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions), titanium (sheet, plate, forgingsand
 extrusions) and composites (including carbon and boron). Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification ofthe
 sources could take one year or more. Many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a sole-sourcebasis with a number of companies.
Suppliers
We
 are dependent upon the ability of a large number of suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance specifications, quality standards anddelivery
 schedules  at  our  anticipated  costs.  While  we  maintain  an  extensive  qualification  and  performance  surveillance  system  to  control  riskassociated
 with  such  reliance  on  third  parties,  failure  of  suppliers  or  subcontractors  to  meet  commitments  could  adversely  affect  productionschedules
 and program/contract profitability, thereby jeopardizing our ability to fulfill commitments to our customers. We are also dependent on theavailability of energy sources, such as electricity, at affordable prices.

Table of ContentsItem 1A. Risk Factors
An
 investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ materiallyfrom
 our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the informationcontained in this report.
Our Commercial Airplanes business depends heavily on commercial airlines, and is subject to unique risks.
Market
 conditions have a significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft. The  commercial aircraft market is predominantly driven by long-term
 trends  in  airline  passenger  and  cargo  traffic.  The  principal  factors  underlying  long-term  traffic  growth  are  sustained  economic  growth  andpolitical
 stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further influenced by airline profitability, availabilityof
 aircraft  financing,  world  trade  policies,  government-to-government  relations,  technological  changes,  price  and  other  competitive  factors,  fuelprices,
 terrorism,  epidemics  and  environmental  regulations.  Traditionally,  the  airline  industry  has  been  cyclical  and  very  competitive  and  hasexperienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be
 more cost competitive. In addition, availability of financing to non-U.S. customersdepends
 in part on the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industrygeneral
ly, or in the financial stability of one or more of our major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or could cause customers toseek
 to  postpone  or  cancel  contractual  orders  and/or  payments  to  us,  which  could  result  in  lower  revenues,  profitability  and  cash  flows  and  areduction
 in our contractual backlog. In addition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period ofseveral years, any of these macroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect del
iveries over a long period.We enter into
 firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses which could subject us to losses if we have cost overrunsor
 if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft  sales contracts are often entered into years before the aircraftare
 delivered. In order to account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing generally consists of a fixedamount
 as  modified  by  price  escalation  formulas  derived  from  labor,  commodity  and  other  price  indices.  Our  revenue  estimates  are  based  oncurrent
 expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of our control. Escalation factors canfluctuate
 significantly  from  period  to  period.  Changes  in  escalation  amounts  can  significantly  impact  revenues  and  operating  margins  in  ourCommercial Airplanes business.
We
 derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines. We  can make no assurance that any customer willexercise
 purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us. In addition, fleet decisions,airline
 consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues andlimit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.
Our
 Commercial Airplanes business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy production system, achieve planned production ratetargets, successfully develop new aircraft or new derivative aircraft, and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standards.
The
 commercial aircraft business is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with U.S and non-U.S. suppliers, highly-skilled
 labor from thousands of employees and other partners, and stringent regulatory requirements and performance and reliability standards. Inaddition,
 the introduction of new aircraft programs and/or derivatives, such as the 787-10, 737 MAX and 777X, involves increased risks associatedwith meeting development, testing, production an
d certification schedules. As7

Table of Contentsa
 result,  our  ability  to  deliver  aircraft  on  time,  satisfy  regulatory  and  customer  requirements,  and  achieve  or  maintain,  as  applicable,  programprofitability is subject to significant risks.
We
 must meet planned production rate and productivity improvement targets in order to satisfy customer demand and maintain our profitability. We continue to increase production rates for the
 737, 767 and 787 programs, while at the same time engaging in significant ongoing development of the787-10, 737
 MAX and 777X aircraft. In addition, we continue to seek opportunities to reduce the costs of building our aircraft, including working withour
 suppliers  to  reduce  supplier  costs,  identifying  and  implementing  productivity  improvements,  and  optimizing  how  we  manage  inventory.  Ifproductio
n rate ramp-up efforts at any of our commercial aircraft assembly facilities are delayed or if our suppliers cannot timely deliver componentsto
 us at the cost and rates necessary to achieve our targets, we may be unable to meet delivery schedules and the financial performance of one ormore of our programs may suffer.
Operational
 challenges  impacting  the  production  system  for  one  or  more  of  our  commercial  aircraft  programs  could  result  in  production  delaysand/or
 failure  to  meet  customer  demand  for  new  aircraft,  either  of  which  would  negatively  impact  our  revenues  and  operating  margins. Our commercial
 aircraft production system is extremely complex. Operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, failure to meetinternal
 performance plans, or delays or failures to achieve required regulatory certifications, could result in significant out-of-sequence work andincreased
 production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers, impacts to aircraft performance and/or increased warranty or fleet supportcosts.
 Further, if we cannot efficiently and cost-effectively incorporate design changes into early build 787 aircraft, we may face further profitabilitypressures on this program.
If our
 commercial airplanes fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirements, we could face additional costs and/or lower revenues. Developing and
 manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatoryagencies, can be costly and technolo
gically challenging. These challenges are particularly significant with newer aircraft programs. Any failure of anyBoeing aircraft to satisfy performance or reliability requirements could result in d
isruption to our operations, higher costs and/or lower revenues.Changes
 in levels of U.S. government defense spending or overall acquisition priorities could negatively impact our financial positionand results of operations.
We
 derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the U.S. government, primarily from defense related programs with the U.S.  DoD .  Levels ofU.S.
 defense spending in future  periods are very  difficult  to predict and subject  to significant  risks.  In addition, significant  budgetary  delays andconstraints have alrea
dy resulted in reduced spending levels, and additional reductions may be forthcoming. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act(The
 Act) established limits on U.S. government discretionary spending, including a reduction of defense spending by approximately $490 billionbetween the 2012 and 2021 U.S. gov
ernment fiscal years. The Act also provided that the defense budget would face “sequestration” cuts of up to anadditional
 $500 billion during that same period to the extent that discretionary spending limits are exceeded. The impact of sequestration cuts hasbeen reduced with respect to FY2016 and FY2017 follow
ing the enactment of The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 in November 2015. However, long-term
 uncertainty remains with respect to overall levels of defense spending and it is likely that U.S. government discretionary spending levels willcontinue to be subject to significant pressure, inclu
ding risk of future sequestration cuts.In
 addition,  there  continues  to  be  significant  uncertainty  with  respect  to  program-level  appropriations  for  the U.S.  DoD and  other  governmentagencies
 (including  NASA)  within  the  overall  budgetary  framework  described  above.  While  the  FY2016  appropriations  enacted  December  2015included
 funding  for  Boeing’s  major  programs,  such  as  F/A-18,  CH-47  Chinook,  AH-64  Apache, KC-46A  Tanker and  P-8 programs,  uncertaintyremains about how defense budgets in
 FY2017 and beyond will affect Boeing’s programs. We also expect that ongoing concerns regarding the U.S.national debt will continue
 to place downward8

 on U.S. DoD spending levels. Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions associatedwith
 the authorizations and appropriations process could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any ofthese impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Company’s operatio
ns, financial position and/or cash flows.In
 addition,  as  a  result  of  the  significant  ongoing  uncertainty  with  respect  to  both  U.S.  defense  spending  levels  and  the  nature  of  the  threatenvironment,
 we expect the U.S.  DoD to  continue to emphasize cost-cutting and other efficiency initiatives in its procurement processes. If we canno
 longer  adjust  successfully  to  these  changing  acquisition  priorities  and/or  fail  to  meet  affordability  targets  set  by  the U.S.  DoD customer,  ourrevenues and market share would be further impacted.
We conduct a significant portion of our business pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which are subject to un
ique risks.In 
2015 , 27% of  our  revenues  were  earned  pursuant  to  U.S.  government  contracts,  which  include  foreign  military  sales  through  the  U.S.government. Business conducted pursuant to such contracts is subj
ect to extensive procurement regulations and other unique risks.Our sales to the U.S. government are subject to extensive procurement regulations, and cha
nges to those regulations could increase our costs. New procurement
 regulations,  or  changes  to  existing  requirements,  could  increase  our  compliance  costs  or  otherwise  have  a  material  impact  on  theoperating
 margins of our BDS business. These requirements may result in increased compliance costs, and we could be subject to additional costsin
 the  form  of  withheld  payments  and/or  reduced  future  business  if  we  fail  to  comply  with  these  requirements  in  the  future.  Compliance  costsattributable
 to  current  and  potential  future  procurement  regulations  such  as  these  could  negatively  impact  our  financial  condition  and  operatingresults.
The
 U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate one or more of our contracts. The  U.S. government contracting party may modify, curtail orterminate
 its contracts and subcontracts with us, without prior notice and either at its convenience or for default based on performance. In addition,funding
 pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations process due tofiscal
 constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programscould also
 result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such as “continuing resolutions”rather
 than full-year appropriations. Any loss or anticipated loss or reduction of expected funding and/or modification, curtailment, or termination ofone or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our earnin
gs, cash flow and/or financial position.We
 are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under U.S.government
 contracts. U.S.  government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency,routinely
 audit  government  contractors.  These  agencies  review  our  performance  under  contracts,  cost  structure  and  compliance  with  applicablelaws,
 regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found tobe
 misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must berefunded.
 Any  inadequacies  in  our  systems  and  policies  could  result  in  withholds  on  billed  receivables,  penalties  and  reduced  future  business.Furthermore,
 if  any  audit,  inquiry  or  investigation  uncovers  improper  or  illegal  activities,  we  could  be  subject  to  civil  and  criminal  penalties  andadministrative
 sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment fromdoing
 business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if suchallegations are later determined to be false.

Table of ContentsWe enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns.
Our
 BDS business generated approximately 72% of  its 2015 revenues  from fixed-price contracts. While fixed-price contracts enable us to benefitfrom
 performance improvements, cost reductions and efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced margins or incurring losses if we areunable
 to achieve estimated costs and revenues. If our estimated costs exceed our estimated price, we recognize reach-forward losses which cansignificantly
 affect our reported results. For example, during the second quarter of 2015, we recorded a reach-forward loss of $835  million on  theUSAF
 KC-46A Tanker contract,  primarily driven by additional costs attributable to design changes, testing and manufacturing complexity. The longterm
 nature  of  many  of  our  contracts  makes  the  process  of  estimating  costs  and  revenues  on  fixed-price  contracts  inherently  risky.  Fixed-pricecontracts often contain price incentives and penalties tied
 to performance which can be difficult to estimate and have significant impacts on margins.In addition, some of our contracts have specific provisions relating to cost, schedu
le and performance.Fixed-price
 development  contracts  are  generally  subject  to  more  uncertainty  than  fixed-price  production  contracts.  Many  of  these  developmentprograms
 have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays andhigher
 costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. Examples of significant BDSfixed-price development contracts include Commercia
l Crew, Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker , and commercial and military satellites. We enter into cost-type contracts which also carry risks.
Our
 BDS business generated approximately 28% of  its 2015 revenues  from cost-type contracting arrangements. Some of these are developmentprograms
 that have complex design and technical challenges. These cost-type programs typically have award or incentive fees that are subject touncertainty
 and may be earned over extended periods. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit ratesor
 program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Programs whose contracts are primarily cost-type include GMD , Proprietary and 
SLS programs. We enter into contracts that include in-orbit incentive payments that subject us to r
isks.Contracts in the
 commercial satellite industry and certain government satellite contracts include in-orbit incentive payments. These in-orbit paymentsmay
 be paid over time after final satellite acceptance or paid in full prior to final satellite acceptance. In both cases, the in-orbit incentive payment isat
 risk if the satellite does not perform  to specifications  for up to 15 years after acceptance.  The net present value of in-orbit incentive fees weultimately
 expect  to  realize  is  recognized  as  revenue  in  the  construction  period.  If  the  satellite  fails  to  meet  contractual  performance  criteria,customers
 will  not  be  obligated  to  continue  making  in-orbit  payments  and/or  we  may  be  required  to  provide  refunds  to  the  customer  and  incursignificant charges.
Our
 ability  to  deliver  products  and  services  that  satisfy  customer  requirements  is  heavily  dependent  on  the  performance  of  oursubcontractors and suppliers, as well as on the availability of raw materials and other components.
We
 rely  on  other  companies  including  subcontractors  and  suppliers  to  provide  and  produce  raw  materials,  integrated  components  and  sub-assemblies,
 and production commodities and to perform some of the services that we provide to our customers. If one or more of our suppliers orsubcontractors
 experiences  delivery  delays  or  other  performance  problems,  we  may  be  unable  to  meet  commitments  to  our  customers  or  incuradditional
 costs.  In  addition,  if  one  or  more  of  the  raw  materials  on  which  we  depend  (such  as  aluminum,  titanium  or  composites)  becomesunavail
able or is available only at very high prices, we may be unable to deliver one or more of our products in a timely fashion or at budgeted costs.In some instances,
10

Table of Contentswe
 depend upon a single source of supply. Any service disruption from one of these suppliers, either due to circumstances beyond the supplier’scontrol,
 such as geo-political developments, or as a result of performance problems or financial difficulties, could have a material adverse effect onour
 ability to meet commitments to our customers or increase our operating costs. For example, we continue to monitor political unrest involvingRussia and Ukraine, where we and some of our sup
pliers source titanium products and/or have operations.We
 use estimates in accounting for many contracts and programs. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financialresults.
Contract and program accounting require judgme
nt relative to assessing risks, estimating revenues and costs and making assumptions for scheduleand
 technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts and programs, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion iscomplicated and subject to many variables.
 Assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract or program becausecosts
 also include expected increases in wages and employee benefits, material prices and allocated fixed costs. Incentives or penalties related toperformance
 on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assessanticipated
 performance. Suppliers’ assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profit rates. Estimates of award fees arealso used in sales and profit rates based on actua
l and anticipated awards.With
 respect  to  each  of  our  commercial  aircraft  programs,  inventoriable  production  costs  (including  overhead),  program  tooling  and  other  non-recurring
 costs and routine warranty costs are accumulated and charged as cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. Aprogram
 consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort fordelivery
 under existing and anticipated contracts limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates. To establish the relationship ofsales
 to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period overwhich
 the units can reasonably be expected to be produced and (c) the units’ expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and othernon-recurring
 costs, and routine warranty costs for the total program. Several factors determine accounting quantity, including firm orders, letters ofintent
 from prospective customers and market studies. Changes to customer or model mix, production costs and rates, learning curve, changes toprice
 escalation indices, costs of derivative aircraft, supplier performance, customer and supplier negotiations/settlements, supplier claims and/orcertification
 issues can impact these estimates. Any such change in estimates relating to program accounting may adversely affect future financialperformance.
Because
 of the  significance  of  the judgments  and estimation  processes  described  above,  materially  different  sales  and profit  amounts  could berecorded if
 we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances orestimates
 may adversely affect future period financial performance. For additional information on our accounting policies for recognizing sales andprofits, see our
 discussion under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Critical Accounting Policies – Contract Accounting/Program Accounting”on pages 
44 – 45 and Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 55 – 66 of this Form 10-K.11

Table of ContentsCompetition within our markets and with respect to the products we sell
 may reduce our future contracts and sales.The
 markets  in  which  we  operate  are  highly  competitive  and  one  or  more  of  our  competitors  may  have  more  extensive  or  more  specializedengineering,
 manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas. In our Commercial Airplanes business, we anticipate increasingcompetition
 among  non-U.S.  aircraft  manufacturers  and  service  providers  in  one  or  more  of  our  market  segments.  In  our  BDS  business,  weanticipate
 that the effects of defense industry consolidation, fewer large and new programs and new priorities, including near and long-term costcompetitiveness,
 of our U.S. DoD and  international customers will intensify competition for many of our products and services. Furthermore, we arefacing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. There
 can be no assurance that we will be able to competesuccessfully
 against  our  current  or  future  competitors  or  that  the  competitive  pressures  we  face  will  not  result  in  reduced  revenues  and  marketshare.
We derive a significant portion of our revenues from non-U.S. sales and are subject to the risks of doing business in other countr
ies.In 
2015 ,  non-U.S.  customers  accounted  for  approximately 59% of  our  revenues.  We  expect  that  non-U.S.  sales  will  continue  to  account  for  asignificant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, we are subject to risks of doing b
usiness internationally, including:•
changes in regulatory requirements; •
domestic  and  international  government  policies,  including  requirements  to  expend  a  portion  of  program  funds  locally  and  governmentalindustrial cooperation or participatio
n requirements;•
fluctuations in international currency excha nge rates;•
volatility  in international political and economic environments and changes in non-U.S. national priorities and budgets, which can lead todelays or fluctuations in orders;
•
the complexity and necessity of using non-U.S. representatives a nd consultants;•
the  uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases, including the availability of financing from the Export-Import Bankof the United States;
•
uncertainties and restrictions concerning the ava ilability of funding credit or guarantees;•
imposition of domestic and international taxes, exp ort controls, tariffs, embargoes, sanctions and other trade restrictions;•
the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise sprea d over many countries;•
compliance with a variety of international la ws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad; and•
unforeseen developments and con ditions, including terrorism, war, epidemics and international conflicts.While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations in the future.
The
 outcome  of  litigation  and  of  government  inquiries  and  investigations  involving  our  business  is  unpredictable  and  an  adversedecision in any such matter could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.
We
 are involved in a number of litigation matters. These matters may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used tobenefit
 our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of any of theselawsuits could have
12

Table of Contentsa
 material impact on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the UnitedStates
 and its various states, as well as other jurisdictions in which we operate. As a result, we are sometimes subject to government inquiries andinvestigations
 of our business due, among other things, to our business relationships with the U.S. government, the heavily regulated nature of ourindustry,
 and in the case of environmental proceedings, our current or past ownership of certain property. Any such inquiry or investigation couldpotentially result in an adverse ruling a
gainst us, which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.A
 significant  portion  of our  customer  financing  portfolio  is concentrated  among  certain  customers  based in  the United  States,  and  incertain types of Boeing aircraft, which exposes us to concentration risks.
A
 significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in distinct geographic regions, particularly inthe
 United States. Our portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8F aircraft.If
 one or more customers holding a significant portion of our portfolio assets experiences financial difficulties or otherwise defaults on or does notrenew
 its  leases  with  us  at  their  expiration,  and  we  are  unable  to  redeploy  the  aircraft  on  reasonable  terms,  or  if  the  types  of  aircraft  that  areconcentrated
 in our portfolio suffer greater than expected declines in value, our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position could be materiallyadversely affected.
We
 may be unable to obtain debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments at competitive rates, on commercially reasonableterms or in sufficient amounts.
We
 depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments. As of December  31, 2015 and 2014 ,  ourairplane
 financing commitments totaled $16,283  million and $16,723 million .  If we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financingcommitments or
 meet other business requirements, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. A number of factors could cause us to incur increasedborrowing
 costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include disruptions or declines in theglobal
 capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings. The occurrence of any or all of these events mayadversely affect our ability to fund our operations and contractual or fina
ncing commitments.We may not realize the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures/strategic alliances or divestitures.
As
 part of our business strategy, we may merge with or acquire businesses and/or form joint ventures and strategic alliances. Whether we realizethe
 anticipated benefits from these acquisitions and related activities depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate the operations of the acquiredbusiness, the performanc
e of the underlying product and service portfolio, and the performance of the management team and other personnel of theacquired
 operations.  Accordingly,  our  financial  results  could  be  adversely  affected  by  unanticipated  performance  issues,  legacy  liabilities,transaction-related
 charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets, credit guarantees, partnerperformance
 and indemnifications. Consolidations of joint ventures could also impact our reported results of operations or financial position. Whilewe
 believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there is no assurance that thesetransactions
 will be successful.  We also may make strategic divestitures  from time to time. These transactions  may result in continued financialinvolvement
 in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Nonperformance bythose divested businesses could affect our future financi
al results through additional payment obligations, higher costs or asset write-downs.13

Table of ContentsOur insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures.
We
 are  exposed  to  liabilities  that  are  unique  to  the  products  and  services  we  provide.  We  maintain  insurance  for  certain  risks  and,  in  somecircumstances,
 we  may  receive  indemnification  from  the  U.S.  government.  The  amount  of  our  insurance  coverage  may  not  cover  all  claims  orliabilities
 and we may be forced to bear substantial costs. For example, liabilities arising from the use of certain of our products, such as aircrafttechnologies,
 missile systems, border security systems, anti-terrorism technologies, and/or air traffic management systems may not be insurable oncommercially
 reasonable terms. While some of these products are shielded from liability within the U.S. under the SAFETY Act provisions of the2002
 Homeland Security Act, no such protection is available outside the U.S., potentially resulting in significant liabilities. The amount of insurancecoverage we maintain may be inadeq
uate to cover these or other claims or liabilities.Business disruptions could seriously affect our future sales and financial condition or increase our costs and expenses.
Our
 business may be impacted by disruptions including threats to physical security, information technology or cyber-attacks or failures, damagingweather
 or other acts of nature and pandemics or other public health crises. Any of these disruptions could affect our internal operations or ourability
 to deliver products and services to our customers. Any significant production delays, or any destruction, manipulation or improper use of ourdata, information systems or networks could impact our sales, increase our expenses and/or have an adverse effect on the reputation of Boeing and
of our products and services.
Some of our and our suppliers’ workforces are represented by labor unions, which may lead to work stoppages.
Approximately 
61,000 employees,  which constitute 38% of  our total workforce, were union represented as of December  31, 2015 . We experienced a
 work stoppage in 2008 when a labor strike halted commercial aircraft and certain BMA program production. We may experience additional workstoppages
 in the future, which could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict how stable our relationships, currently with 11 U.S. labororganizations and 
6 non-U.S. labor organizations, will be or whether we will be able to meet the unions’ requirements without impacting our financialcondition.
 The unions may also limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. Union actions at suppliers can also affect us. Work stoppages andinstability
 in our union relationships could delay the production and/or development of our products, which could strain relationships with customersand cause a loss of revenues which wou
ld adversely affect our operations.We
 have substantial pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, which have a material impact on our earnings, shareholders ' equity and cash flows from operations and could have significant adverse impacts in future periods.
We
 have qualified defined benefit pension plans that cover the majority of our employees. Potential pension contributions include both mandatoryamounts
 required under the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act and  discretionary contributions to improve the plans '  funded status. Theextent
 of future contributions depends heavily on market factors such as the discount rate and the actual return on plan assets. We estimate futurecontributions
 to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions could  have a significant effecton
 future contributions as well as on our annual pension costs and/or result in a significant change to shareholders '  equity. For U.S. governmentcontracts, we allocate pension costs to individua
l contracts based on U.S. Cost Accounting Standards which can also affect contract profitability. Wealso
 provide  other  postretirement  benefits  to  certain  of  our  employees,  consisting  principally  of  health  care  coverage  for  eligible  retirees  andqualifying depende
nts. Our estimates of future costs associated with these benefits are also subject to assumptions, including14

Table of Contentsestimates
 of the level of medical cost increases. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and otherpostretireme
nt plan accounting policies, see “  Management '  s Discussion and Analysis -  Critical Accounting Policies -  Pension Plans ”  on pages 46 – 
47 of this Form 10-K. Although GAAP expense and pension or other postretirement benefit contributions are not directly related, the key economicfactors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or stock we would contrib
ute to our plans.Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.
We
 are  subject  to  various  federal,  state,  local  and  non-U.S.  laws  and  regulations  related  to  environmental  protection,  including  the  discharge,treatment,
 storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, finesand
 civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if we were to violate or become liable underenvironmental
 laws or regulations. In some cases, we may be subject to such costs due to environmental impacts attributable to our current or pastmanufacturing
 operations  or  the  operations  of  companies  we  have  acquired.  In  other  cases,  we  may  become  subject  to  such  costs  due  to  anindemnification
 agreement  between  us  and  a  third  party  relating  to  such  environmental  liabilities.  In  addition,  new  laws  and  regulations,  morestringent
 enforcement  of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new remediationrequirements
 could result in additional costs. For additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see Note 11 to our ConsolidatedFinancial Statements.
Unauthorized access to our or our customers’ information and systems could negatively impact our business.
We
 face certain security threats, including threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and systems. We maintain an extensivenetwork
 of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight in order to address thesethreats.
 While  these  measures  are  designed  to  prevent,  detect  and  respond  to  unauthorized  activity  in  our  systems,  certain  types  of  attacks,including
 cyber-attacks,  could  result  in  significant  financial  or  information  losses  and/or  reputational  harm.  In  addition,  we  manage  informationtechnology
 systems for certain customers. Many of these customers face similar security threats. If we cannot prevent the unauthorized access,release and/or corruption of our
 customers’ confidential, classified or personally identifiable information, our reputation could be damaged, and/or wecould face financial losses.

Boeing Military Aircraft ( BMA ) segment, partially offset by lower unalloc ated pension and other postretirement benefit expense of$1,089 million 
. Earnings
 from operations in 2014 increased by $911 million compared with 2013 primarily reflecting higher earnings at Commercial Airplanes of$616
 million and lower unallocated items and eliminations of $485 million. The decrease in unallocated items is due to the A-12 litigation settlementof
 $406 million which was recorded in 2013 and lower 2014 deferred compensation of $194 million. The A-12 aircraft litigation settlement resulted inthe Company recording a 
$406 million pre-tax charge in 2013, which consisted of  writing-off A-12 inventory, recorded as cost of sales, and providingthree EA-18G Growlers at no cost to the U.S. Navy, recorded as a reduction in revenues.

increased by $19 million in 2015 and decreased by $194 millio n in 2014, primarily driven by changes in broad stockmarket conditions and our stock price.
Eliminations and
 other unallocated expense decreased by $64 million in 2015 primarily  due to the timing of the elimination of profit on intercompanyaircraft
 deliveries and expense allocations. The increase of $143 million in 2014 was primarily due to insurance recoveries which were recorded inthe third quar
ter of 2013.Litigation settlements include the 201

decreased by $53 million in 2014 as a result of lower weighted average debt bal ances.Our
 effective income tax rates were 27.7% , 23.7% and 26.4% for  the years ended December  31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 ,  respectively. Our 2015 effective
 tax rate was higher than 2014 primarily  due to tax benefits of $524  million recorded  in the second quarter of 2014 related to tax basisadjustments and settlement of the 2007 - 2010 federal tax audits. Our 2014 effective tax rate was lower than 2
013 primarily due to the tax benefits of$524 million 
recorded in the second quarter of 2014. For additional discussion relate
d to Income Taxes, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Total Costs and Expenses (“Cost of Sales”)
Cost
 of sales, for both products and services, consists primarily of raw materials, parts, sub-assemblies, labor, overhead and subcontracting costs.Our
 Commercial  Airplanes segment  predominantly  uses  program  accounting  to account  for  cost  of sales  and BDS predominantly  uses contractaccounting.
 Under  program  accounting,  cost  of  sales  for  each  commercial  airplane  program  equals  the  product  of  (i)  revenue  recognized  inconnection
 with  customer  deliveries  and  (ii)  the  estimated  cost  of  sales  percentage  applicable  to  the  total  remaining  program.  Under  contractaccounting,
 the  amount  reported  as  cost  of  sales  is  determined  by  applying  the  estimated  cost  of  sales  percentage  to  the  amount  of  revenuerecognized.

 U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The decrease in contractual backlog at December  31, 2015 compared with December 31,
 2014  was  primarily  due  to  deliveries  in  excess  of  net  orders.  The  increase  in  contractual  backlog  at  December  31,  2014  compared  withDecember
 31, 2013 was primarily due to commercial airplane orders and reclassifications from unobligated backlog related to incremental funding.The increase was partially offset by commercial airplane d
eliveries and revenues recognized on awarded contracts . Unobligated
 backlog  includes  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  government  definitive  contracts  for  which  funding  has  not  been  authorized.  The  decreases  inunobligated
 backlog  in 2015 and 2014 were  primarily  due  to  reclassifications  to  contractual  backlog  related  to  incremental  funding  for  BDScontracts, partially offset by contract awards.
Additional Considerations
KC-46A
 Tanker In  2011, we were awarded a contract  from the U.S.  Air Force ( USAF )  to  design,  develop,  manufacture  and deliver  four  nextgeneration
 aerial  refueling  tankers.  The  KC-46A  Tanker  is  a  derivative  of  our  767  commercial  aircraft.  This Engineering,  Manufacturing  andDevelopment 
( EMD )  contract  is  a  fixed-price  incentive  fee  contract  valued  at  $4.9  billion  and  involves  highly  complex  designs  and  systemsintegration.
 We have also begun work on low  rate initial production ( LRIP )  aircraft for the USAF. The USAF is expected to authorize two low rateinitial production lots in 2016 for a total of 19 aircraft, subject to satisfactory progress being mad
e on the EMD contract . In
 second quarter 2014, we recorded a reach-forward loss of $425 million on the EMD contract.  In second quarter 2015, we recorded an additionalreach-forwar
d loss of $835 million. $513 million of this loss was recorded at our Commercial Airplanes segment and the remaining $322 million wasrecorded in our 
BMA segment. The $835 million loss include s $670 million related to the EMD contract and $165 million related to LRIP aircraft. The reach-forward
 loss on the EMD contract  was driven primarily by design changes required in the aircraft fuels and aerial refueling systems whichwere
 identified as we prepared for and conducted ground and flight testing. Other costs include additional qualification and certification testing aswell as investments that will enable us to meet our deliv
ery commitments in 2017. The reach-forward24

Table of Contentsloss
 related to LRIP aircraft  was primarily driven by increased manufacturing complexity resulting from design changes. As with any developmentprogram,
 this program remains subject to additional reach-forward losses if we experience technical or quality issues, schedule delays or increasedcosts.
We
 continue  to  expect  to  meet  our  commitment  to  deliver  18  fully  operational  aircraft  to  the  customer  by  August  2017.  The  contract  containsproduction
 options for both LRIP aircraft  and full rate production aircraft. If all options under the contract are exercised, we expect to deliver 179aircraft for a total expected contract value of approximately $30 billion.
Russia/Ukraine 
We continue to monitor political unrest involving Russia and Ukraine, where we and some of  our suppliers source titanium productsand/or have
 operations. A number of our commercial customers also have operations in Russia and Ukraine. To date, we have not experienced anysignificant
 disruptions to production or deliveries. Should suppliers or customers experience disruption, our production and/or deliveries could bematerially impacted.
Export-Import
 Bank  of  the  United  States Many  of  our  non-U.S.  customers  finance  purchases  through  the  Export-Import  Bank  of  the  UnitedStates.
 Following the expiration of the bank’s charter on June 30, 2015, the bank’s charter was reauthorized in December 2015. The bank is nowauthorized through September 30, 2019. How
ever, until the U.S. Senate confirms members sufficient to reconstitute a quorum of the bank’s board ofdirectors,
 the bank will not be able to approve any transaction totaling more than $10 million. As a result, we may fund additional commitmentsand/or
 enter into new financing arrangements with customers. Certain of our non-U.S. customers also may seek to delay purchases if they cannotobtain
 financing at reasonable costs, and there may be further impacts with respect to future sales campaigns involving non-U.S. customers. Wecontinue to work with our
 customers to mitigate risks associated with the lack of a quorum of the bank’s board of directors and assist with alternativethird party financing sources.
Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Commercial Airplanes
Business Environment and Trends
Airline Industry Environment 
Global economic  activity and global trade, which are the primary drivers of the demand for air travel, grew below thelong-term
 average for the fourth year in a row in 2015. Despite this, passenger traffic continued to grow more than 5%, as it has every year since2010,
 and accelerated to more than 6% in 2015. While growth was strong across all major world regions, there continues to be significant variationbetween
 regions and airline business models. Airlines operating in the Middle East and Asia Pacific regions as well as low-cost-carriers globally arecurrently leading passenger growth.
Air
 cargo traffic grew at 5% in the first quarter and 3% in the second quarter of 2015 compared with the same periods in 2014. However, weakerglobal industrial production and
 world trade resulted in little to no cargo traffic growth during the remainder of the year. The slowing air cargo marketrecovery has
 resulted in reduced orders and demand for new freighter aircraft and freighter conversions, and in January 2016, we announced plansto further reduce production rates on the 747 program.
Airline
 financial performance also plays a role in the demand for new capacity. Airlines continue to focus on increasing revenue through alliances,partnerships,
 new marketing initiatives, and effective leveraging of ancillary services and related revenues. Airlines are also relentlessly focusing onreducing
 costs by renewing fleets to leverage more efficient airplanes and in 2015 benefited significantly from lower fuel costs. Net profits for theglobal airline industry are estimated to
 total $33 billion in 2015 compared to $17 billion in 2014. We expect airline profits to continue to grow in 2016,driven by strong passenger demand and relativ
ely low oil prices.25

Table of ContentsThe
 long-term outlook for the industry continues to remain positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth: economic growth and theincreasi
ng propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights betweencountries. Our
 20-year forecast projects a long-term average growth rate of 4.9% per year for passenger traffic and 4.2% for cargo traffic. Based onlong-term
 global economic growth projections of 3.1% average annual GDP growth, and factoring in increased utilization of the worldwide airplanefleet and requirements to replace older airplan
es, we project a $5.6 trillion market for approximately 38,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years.The
 industry  remains  vulnerable  to  near-term  exogenous  developments  including  fuel  price  spikes,  credit  market  shocks,  terrorism,  naturaldisasters, conflicts, epidemics and increased glo
bal environmental regulations.Industry
 Competitiveness The  commercial  jet  airplane  market  and  the  airline  industry  remain  extremely  competitive.  Market  liberalization  inEurope and Asia is enabling low-cost airlines to
 continue gaining market share. These airlines are increasing the pressure on airfares. This results incontinued
 cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable marketposition at acceptable profit margins.
Continued
 access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately11% of Commercial Airplanes’ contractual backl
og, in dollar terms, is with U.S. airlines, including cargo carriers.We
 face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access tomost
 of  the  same  customers  and  suppliers.  With  government  support,  Airbus  has  historically  invested  heavily  to  create  a  family  of  products  tocompete
 with ours. Regional jet makers Embraer and Bombardier, coming from the less than 100-seat commercial jet market, continue to developlarger and increasing
ly capable airplanes. Additionally, other competitors from Russia, China and Japan are developing commercial jet aircraft in themarket
 above 90 seats. Many of these competitors  have historically enjoyed access to government-provided  financial support, including “launchaid,” which greatly reduces the commercial risks associated with airp
lane development activities and enables airplanes to be brought to market morequickly
 than otherwise possible. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expectthese pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years.
Worldwide,
 airplane sales are generally conducted in U.S. dollars. Fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors, allof whom have significant costs in other currencies. Changes in value of the U.S.
 dollar relative to their local currencies impact competitors’ revenuesand

Aircraft accounted for as revenues by Commercial Airplanes and as operating leases in consolidation identified by parenthesesEarnings From Operations
Earnings
 from operations in 2015 decreased by $1,254 million or 20% compared  with 2014 primarily  due to higher reach-forward losses of $1,160million
 and higher research and development spending of $459 million, largely on the 777X, which more than offset higher new airplane deliveriesand
 mix. During the fourth quarter of 2015 we recorded a charge of $885 million to recognize a reach-forward loss on the 747 program. In addition,we
 recorded reach-forward  losses on the USAF  KC-46A Tanker contract  of $513  million in  the second quarter of 2015 and $238  million in  thesecond
 quarter of 2014. Operating margins in 2015 decreased primarily due to additional reach-forward losses, higher research and developmentexpense and the dilutive impact of 787 vol
ume and mix.Earnings
 from  operations  in  2014  increased  by  $616  million  or  11%  compared  with  2013.  The  increase  in  earnings  is  primarily  due  to  higherearnings
 of $947 million driven by higher new airplane deliveries and commercial aviation services revenue growth. This earnings increase waspartially offset by a reach-

Table of Contentsforward
 loss  of  $238  million  recorded  in  the  second  quarter  of  2014  related  to  the  USAF  KC-46A  Tanker  contract  and  higher  research  anddevelopm
ent expense of $74 million. The increase in research and development reflects higher spending on the 777X, 787-10 and 737 MAX, whichmore
 than offset lower 787-9 spending. Operating margins decreased from 10.9% in 2013 to 10.7% in 2014 primarily due to the dilutive impact of747 and 787 deliveries an
d the USAF KC-46A Tanker reach-forward loss.Backlog
Firm
 backlog  represents  orders  for  products  and services  where  no contingencies  remain  before  we and the  customer  are  required  to  perform.Backlog
 does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customers receiving approval from theirBoard
 of Directors, shareholders or government and completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expiredprior
 to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Firm orders exclude options. A number of our customers mayhave
 contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays. We continue to address customer claims and requests for other contractualrelief
 as they arise. However, once orders are included in firm backlog, orders remain in backlog until canceled or fulfilled, although the value oforders is adjusted as changes to price and sched
ule are agreed to with customers.The decrease in con
tractual backlog during 2015 was due to deliveries in  excess of net orders. The increase in contractual backlog during 2014 wasdue
 to net orders in excess of deliveries. The decrease in unobligated backlog during 2015 and 2014 was primarily due to the reclassification fromunobligated
 to contractual backlog related to incremental funding of the existing multi-year contract for Commercial Airplanes’ share of the USAF KC-46A Tanker 
contract. Accounting
 Quantity The  accounting  quantity  is  our  estimate  of  the  quantity  of  airplanes  that  will  be  produced  for  delivery  under  existing  andanticipated
 contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenueand cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize o
n sales of individual airplanes throughout aprogram’s
 life.  Estimation  of  each  program’s  accounting  quantity  takes  into  account  several  factors  that  are  indicative  of  the  demand  for  thatprogram,
 including  firm  orders,  letters  of  intent  from  prospective  customers  and  market  studies.  We  review  our  program  accounting  quantitiesquarterly.
The
 accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to beunder
 contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantitymust be considered.

737 Program 
The  accounting quantity for the 737 program increased by 600 units during 2015 due to the program ’  s normal progress of obtainingadditional
 orders and delivering airplanes. We are currently producing at a rate of 42 per month and plan an additional increase to 47 per month in2017. We plan to further increase the rate to 52 per month in 2018 and to 57 per month in 201
9. First delivery of the 737 MAX is expected in 2017.747 Program 
Lower-tha n-expected demand for large commercial passenger and freighter aircraft and slower-than-expected growth of global freighttraffic
 have resulted in market uncertainties, ongoing pricing pressures and fewer orders than anticipated. During the second half of 2015, the cargomarket
 recovery slowed, and in January 2016, we announced a plan to further reduce the production rate to 0.5 per month as well as recognize areach-forward
 loss of $885  million on  the program. The charge, which was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2015, is primarily related to loweranticipat
ed revenues reflecting ongoing pricing and market pressures, as well as higher estimated costs due to the reduced production rate. We arecurrently producing at
 a rate of 1.3 per month with plans to reduce the rate to 1.0 per month in March 2016, further reduce the rate to 0.5 per monthin 
September 2016 and  then return to 1.0 per month in 2019. We have a number of completed aircraft in inventory as well as unsold productionpositions
 and we remain focused on obtaining additional orders and implementing cost-reduction efforts. If we are unable to obtain sufficient ordersin
 2016  and/or  market,  production  and  other  risks  cannot  be  mitigated,  the  program  could  face  an  additional  reach-forward  loss  that  may  bematerial.
767 Program 
The  accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 34 units during 2015 due to the program's progress of obtaining additionalorders
 and delivering airplanes. The 767 assembly line includes a 767 derivative to support the tanker program. We are currently producing at acombined tanker and
29

Table of Contentscommercial
 production rate of 1.5 per month and plan to increase to 2 per month in 2016. We plan to further increase the rate to 2.5 per month inthe fourth qua
rter of 2017.777
 Program The  accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 50 units during 2015 due to the program’s normal progress of obtainingadditio
nal orders and delivering airplanes. We are currently producing at a rate of 8.3 per month and plan to reduce the rate to 7 per month in 2017.In the
 fourth quarter of 2013, we launched the 777X, which features a new composite wing, new engines and folding wing-tips. The 777X will have aseparate program accounting quantity, which wi
ll be determined in the year of first airplane delivery, targeted for 2020.787 Program 
We continue to  produce at a rate of 10 per month and plan for rate increases to 12 per month in 2016 and 14 per month by the end ofthe decade. First delivery of the 787-10 derivative aircraft is targeted for 2018. The accounti
ng quantity of 1,300 units remains unchanged.We
 remain focused on increasing the production rate to 12 per month in 2016 and improving productivity. We continue to monitor and addresschallenges
 associated with aircraft production and assembly for both the 787-8 and 787-9, including management of our manufacturing operationsand
 extended global supply chain, completion and integration of traveled work, as well as completing and delivering early build aircraft. In addition,we
 continue to work with our customers and suppliers to assess the specific impacts of schedule changes, including requests for contractual reliefrelated to delivery delays and suppl
ier assertions.During
 2009, we concluded that the first three flight-test 787 aircraft could not be sold as previously anticipated due to the inordinate amount ofrework
 and unique and extensive modifications made to those aircraft. As a result, costs associated with these airplanes were included in researchand
 development  expense.  Based  on  sales  activity  and  market  interest  we  continue  to  believe  that  the  remaining  787  flight-test  aircraft  arecommercially
 saleable and we continue to include costs related to these aircraft in program inventory. However, there is risk that we may be unableto
 sell these aircraft. If we determine that any of the remaining flight-test aircraft cannot be sold, we would incur additional material charges relatedto the reclassification of costs associated with those aircraft to research and develo
pment expense.The
 combination  of  production  challenges,  change  incorporation  on  early  build  aircraft,  schedule  delays,  customer  and  supplier  impacts  andchanges to price escalation factors has created significa
nt pressure on program profitability and we continue to have near breakeven gross margins.If
 risks related to these challenges, together with risks associated with planned production rate increases, or introducing or manufacturing the 787-10
 derivative as scheduled cannot be mitigated, the program could face additional customer claims and/or supplier assertions, further pressures onprogram
 profitability  and/or  a  reach-forward  loss.  We  continue  to  implement  mitigation  plans  and  cost-reduction  efforts  to  improve  programprofitability and address program risks.
Fleet Support 
We  provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation.Collecti
vely known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational lifeof
 the  airplane.  They  include  flight  and  maintenance  training,  field  service  support,  engineering  services,  information  services  and  systems  andtechnical
 data  and  documents.  The  costs  for  fleet  support  are  expensed  as  incurred  and  have  historically  been  approximately 1.5% of  totalconsolidated costs of products and services.

 Development The  following  chart  summarizes  the  time  horizon  between  go-ahead  and  planned  initial  delivery  for  major  CommercialAirplanes derivatives and programs.
Reflects models in development during 2015
We launched the 787-10 in June 20
13 and the 777X in November 2013.Additional Considerations
The
 development  and  ongoing  production  of  commercial  aircraft  is  extremely  complex,  involving  extensive  coordination  and  integration  withsuppliers
 and highly-skilled labor from thousands of employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards,as
 well  as  those  of  customers  and  regulators,  can  be  costly  and  technologically  challenging.  In  addition,  the  introduction  of  new  aircraft  andderivatives,
 such as the 787-10, 737 MAX and 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certificationschedules.
 As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable,program
 profitability is subject to significant risks. Factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or isdetermined
 to have reach-forward losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, productioncosts
 and  rates,  changes  to  price  escalation  factors  due  to  changes  in  the  inflation  rate  or  other  economic  indicators,  performance  or  reliabilityissues
 involving  completed  aircraft,  capital  expenditures  and other  costs  associated  with  increasing  or  adding  new production  capacity,  learningcurve,
 additional change incorporation, achieving anticipated cost reductions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand fornew
 airplanes and derivatives and status of customer claims, supplier assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe the cost andrevenue
 estimates incorporated in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of our airplane programs createsfinancial
 risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger terminationprovisions, order cancellations or other financi
ally significant exposure.Defense, Space & Security
Business Environment and Trends
United States Government
 Defense Environment Overview The  enactment of The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 in November 2015 establishedoverall
 defense spending levels for FY2016 and FY2017. However, uncertainty remains with respect to levels of defense spending for FY2018 andbeyond,
 including risk of future sequestration cuts. Significant  uncertainty also continues with respect to program-level appropriations for the U.S.Department
 of  Defense  ( U.S.  DoD )  and  other  government  agencies,  including  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration,  within  theoverall
 budgetary  framework  described  above.  Future  budget  cuts,  including  cuts  mandated  by  sequestration,  or  future  procurement  decisionsassociated
 with  the  authorization  and  appropriations  process  could  result  in  reductions,  cancellations  and/or  delays  of  existing  contracts  orprograms. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Company’s operations, fina
ncial position and/or cash flows.In
 addition to the risks described above, if Congress is unable to pass appropriations bills in a timely manner, a government shutdown could resultwhich
 may have impacts above and beyond those resulting from budget cuts, sequestration impacts or program-level appropriations. For example,requirements to

 employees in the U.S. DoD or other government agencies could result in payment delays, impair our ability to perform work on existingcontracts, and/or negatively impact future orders.
International Environment Overview 
The international market continues to  be driven by complex and evolving security challenges and the need tomodernize
 aging  equipment  and  inventories.  BDS  expects  that  it  will  continue  to  have  a  wide  range  of  international  opportunities  across  Asia,Europe and the Middle East given the div

Table of ContentsRevenues
BDS 
revenues  in 2015 decreased by $493  million compared  with 2014 due  to  lower  revenues  in  all  three  segments. BDS revenues  in  2014decrease
d by $2,316 million compared with 2013 primarily due to lower revenues of $1,775 million in the BMA segment and lower revenues of $509 million in the 
Network & Space Systems ( N&SS ) segment. Earnings From Operations
BDS 
earnings  from operations in 2015 increased by $141 million compared with 2014 due  to higher earnings in all three segments. Included aboveare
 net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $49  million lower in 2015 compared  with 2014 ,  primarily reflecting highercharges
 of $135  million on  the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract recorded at BMA which  more than offset higher favorable adjustments in the Global Services & Support 
( GS&S ) segment. BDS
 earnings from operations in 2014 decreased by $102 million compared with 2013 due to lower earnings of $200 million and $21 million in theBMA
 and N&SS segments, partially offset by higher earnings of $119 million in the GS&S segment.  Included above are net favorable cumulativecontract
 catch-up adjustments, which were $96 million higher in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily reflecting higher favorable adjustments in theGS&S segment.
Backlog
Total
 backlog is comprised of contractual backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which we have received funding, andunobligated
 backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which funding has not yet been authorized and appropriated. BDStotal
 backlog was $57,675  million at December 31, 2015 ,  reflecting a decrease of 7% from December  31, 2014 .  BDS total backlog was $61,913million at December 31, 2014, reflecting a
 decrease of 8% from December 31, 2013. For further details on the changes between periods, refer to thediscussions of the
 individual segments below.Additional Considerations
Our BDS
 business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs havecost-type
 contracting  arrangements.  In  these  cases,  the  associated  financial  risks  are  primarily  in  reduced  fees,  lower  profit  rates  or  programcancellation
 if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based  Midcourse Defense ( GMD), Proprietary and Space Launch System ( 
SLS ) programs. Some
 of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Many of these programs have highly complex designs. As technical orquality
 issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to performthe
 work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. Theseprograms
 are  ongoing,  and  while  we  believe  the  cost  and  fee  estimates  incorporated  in  the  financial  statements  are  appropriate,  the  technicalcomplexity
 of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could beextended,
 which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. Theseprograms
 have  risk  for  reach-forward  losses  if  our  estimated  costs  exceed  our  estimated  contract  revenues.  Examples  of  significant  fixed-pricedevelopment programs include Sau
di F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew and commercial and military satellites.33

revenues  in 2015 decreased by $18 million compared  with 2014 primarily  due to lower revenues of $1,083 million from fewer deliveries andmix
 on the F/A-18, Apache and V-22 programs, partially offset by higher revenues related to a cumulative catch-up adjustment recorded in the thirdquarter of 2015 on the F-15 program due to contract negotiations and hi

revenues in 2014 decreased by $1,775 million, or  12%, compared with 2013 primarily due to a reduction of revenue of $1,730 million related toF-15 and USAF KC-46A Tanker milestones, fewer C-17 aircraft deliv
eries and delivery mix on the P-8 program.Earnings From Operations
BMA 
earnings  from operations in 2015 increased by $17 million compared with 2014 primarily due  to lower C-17 charges, higher Chinook deliveriesand
 higher earnings on the F-15 program, primarily due to a cumulative catch-up adjustment recorded in the third quarter of 2015. These increaseswere
 partially offset by higher charges of $135  million on  the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract and lower earnings on proprietary programs. BMA recorded
 charges of $322 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $187 million in the second quarter of 2014 related to the USAF KC-46A Tankercontract.
 In addition, BMA recorded  a charge of $48  million in  the first quarter of 2014 to write-off inventory and accrue termination liabilities as aresult
 of our decision to produce three fewer C-17 aircraft in 2015 than previously planned. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustmentswere 
$96 million lower in 2015 than in 2014 primarily driven  by the USAF KC-46A Tanker charges and lower favorable F/A-18 adjustments, partiallyoffset by higher favorable F-15 program adjustments.
BMA 
earnings  from operations in 2014 decreased by $200 million, or 13%, compared with 2013 primarily due to 2014 charges of $235 million andlower
 earnings of $73 million related to fewer deliveries on the C-17 program. The charges recorded in 2014 included $187 million related to theUSAF
 KC-46A Tanker contract and $48 million to write off inventory and accrue termination liabilities as a result of our 2014 decision to producethree
 fewer C-17 aircraft in 2015 than previously planned. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. These decreases were partiallyoffset
 by higher earnings of $65 million related to improved performance on the F/A-18 program. In addition, in 2013, we recorded a charge of $64million
 to write off inventory and accrue termination liabilities as a result of the Republic of Korea's announcement to restart its F-X fighter aircraftcompetition.
 Net favorable cumulative  contract  catch-up adjustments  were $39 million lower in 2014 than in 2013 primarily  driven by the reach-forward loss on the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract, partially offset by higher favorabl
e adjustments to the F/A-18 and F-15 programs.34

$10 million lower in 2015 than in 2014 primarily due to higher unfavorable adj ustments on commercial satellite programs.N&SS 
earnings  from operations in 2014 decreased by $21 million compared with 2013 primarily due to lower earnings of $84 million on severalcommercial

revenues  in 2014 decreased by $32 million compared with 2013 primarily due to lower volume of $277 million in IL and TSGS programs. These
 decreases  were  partially  offset  by  higher  Aircraft  Modernization  &  Sustainment  ( AM&S )  revenues  of  $245  million  primarily  related  todeliveries of three 
AEW&C Peace Eagle to Turkey in 2014. Earnings From Operations

Business Environment and Trends
BCC’s
 gross customer financing and investment portfolio at December  31, 2015 totaled $3,459  million .  A substantial portion of BCC’s portfolio isconcentrated
 among  certain  U.S.  commercial  airline  customers.  BCC’s  portfolio  is  also  concentrated  by  varying  degrees  across  Boeing  aircraftproduct types, most notably 717 and 747-8F aircraft.
BCC
 provided customer financing of $586  million and $489 million during 2015 and 2014 .  While we may be required to fund a number of newaircraft deliveries in 2016, we expect alternative fina
ncing will be available at reasonable prices from broad and globally diverse sources.Aircraft
 values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 2,300 western-built commercial
 jet aircraft ( 9.5% of  current world fleet) were parked at the end of 2015 ,  including both in-production and out-of-production aircrafttypes.
 Of these parked aircraft, approximately 11% are  not expected to return to service. At the end of 2014 and 2013 , 9.8% and 9.2% of  thewestern-built
 commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types withrelatively few operators, are placed out of service.

 segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease, interest income from financing receivables andnotes, and
 other income. BCC ’s  revenues in 2015 are  consistent with 2014. BCC ’s  revenues in 2014 increased by $8 million compared with 2013primarily
 due to higher aircraft return condition payments of $60 million, partially offset by a decrease in finance lease income and lower interestincome.
Earnings From Operations
BCC’s
 earnings from operations are presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses, asset impairment expense, depreciationon
 leased equipment and other operating expenses. Earnings from operations in 2015 decreased by $42 million compared  with 2014 primarily due to
 higher asset impairment expense. Earnings from operations in 2014 decreased by $15 million compared with 2013 due to $60 million increase inasset
 impairment expense, partially offset by a reduction in the provision for losses on receivables, driven by a change to a customer credit ratingrecorded in the first quarter of 2014, in addition to lower depreciati

Net cash provided by  operating activities was $9.4 billion during 2015 , compared with $8.9 billion during 2014 and $8.2 billionin 
2013 . The increase of $0.5 billion in 2015 was primarily due to  lower inventory growth, partially offset by lower receipts of advances and progressbillings.
 The increase of $0.7 billion in 2014 was primarily due to higher customer advances which more than offset higher gross inventory. Ourinvestment in
 gross inventories decreased by $0.3 billion in 2015 primarily in our  BDS business, largely driven by ending production of C-17 aircraft,which more
 than offset continued investment in commercial airplane program inventory. Our investment in gross inventories increased $7.6 billion in 2014 
and  $5.7 billion in 2013 ,  largely driven by continued investment in commercial airplane program inventory, primarily 787 inventory. Advancesand
 progress billings increased by $0.4  billion in 2015 , $6.9 billion in 2014 and  $3.9 billion in 2013 ,  primarily due to payments from CommercialAirplane
 customers. Discretionary contributions to our pension plans were insignificant in 2015 compared with $0.8 billion in 2014 and $1.5 billion in 2013 
. Investing Activities 
Cash  used by investing activities was $1.8 billion during 2015 compared with $2.5 billion provided during 2014 and $5.2 billionused during 
2013 ,  largely due to changes in investments in time deposits. Net  proceeds from investments were $0.6 billion in 2015 compared with $4.8
 billion in 2014 and net contributions to investments  of $2.9  billion in 2013 .  In 2015 ,  capital expenditures totaled $2.5  billion ,  up from $2.2 billion 
in 2014 and $2.1 billion in 2013 .  We expect capital expenditures in 2016 to be consistent with 2015 due  to continued investment to supportgrowth.
Financing Activities 
Cash used  by financing activities was $7.9 billion during 2015 , a decrease of $0.7 billion compared with 2014 primarily due to higher
 new borrowings of $0.8  billion and  lower repayments of debt and distribution rights of $0.9  billion in 2015 ,  which more than offset highershare
 repurchases of $0.8  billion and  higher dividend payments of $0.4  billion in 2015 .  Cash used by financing activities was $8.6  billion during 2014,
 an increase of $4.3 billion compared with 2013 primarily due to higher share repurchases of $3.2 billion, higher dividends paid of $0.6 billionand a decrease in proceeds from stock options exercised of $0.8 bi
llion in 2014, partially offset by higher new borrowings of $0.4 billion in 2014.39

Table of ContentsDuring 
2015 ,  we issued $1.7 billion and repaid $0.9 billion of  debt. At December  31, 2015 and 2014 the  recorded balance of debt was $10.0 billion and 
$9.1 billion of  which $1.2  billion and $0.9 billion was  classified as short-term. At December  31, 2015 and 2014 this  includes $2.4  billion of debt attributable to 
BCC , of which $0.5 billion and $0.1 billion was classified as short-term. During 
2015 and 2014 we  repurchased 46.7  million and 46.6 million shares  totaling $6.8  billion and $6.0 billion through  our open market sharerepurchase
 program. In 2015  and 2014 ,  we had 0.7  million shares  transferred to us from employees for tax withholdings. At December  31, 2015 , the amount available under the share repurch
ase plan, announced on December 14, 2015, totaled $14 billion . Capital
 Resources We  have substantial borrowing capacity. Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debtcovenants as described below. We
 have a commercial paper program that continues to serve as a significant potential source of short-term liquidity.Throughout 
2015 and  at December  31, 2015 ,  we  had  no  commercial  paper  borrowings  outstanding.  Currently,  we  have $5.0  billion of  unusedborrowing
 capacity on revolving credit line agreements. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support ourgeneral corporate borrowing needs.
Financing
 commitments totaled $16.3 billion and $16.7 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014 .  We anticipate that we will not be required to fund asignificant
 portion of our financing commitments  as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers.Historically,
 we have not been required to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we willnot
 be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. In addition, many of our non-U.S. customers finance aircraft purchases throughthe Export-Import
 Bank of the United States. Following the expiration of the bank’s charter on June 30, 2015, the bank’s charter was reauthorized inDecember
 2015.  The  bank  is  now  authorized  through  September  30,  2019.  However,  until  the  U.S.  Senate  confirms  members  sufficient  toreconstitute
 a quorum of the bank’s board of directors, the bank will not be able to approve any transaction totaling more than $10 million. As aresult, we may fund additional commitments and/or enter into new financi
ng arrangements with customers.In
 the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities, our commercial aircraft financing commitments, unfavorableresolution
 of litigation or other loss contingencies, or other business requirements, we expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuingcommercial
 paper or term debt. We believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing short-term andlong-term
 commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunitiesshould
 they  arise  within  the  next  year.  However,  there  can  be  no  assurance  of  the  cost  or  availability  of  future  borrowings,  if  any,  under  ourcommercial paper program, in the debt markets or our credit facilities.
At 
December 31, 2015 and 2014 ,  our pension plans were $17.9  billion and $17.3 billion underfunded  as measured under GAAP. On an Employee Retirement Income
 Security Act ( ERISA )  basis our plans are more than 100% funded at December 31, 2015 with  minimal required contributions in2016 
.  We expect to make contributions to our plans of approximately $0.1 billion in 2016 .  We may be required to make higher contributions to ourpension plans in future years.
At 
December  31,  2015 ,  we  were  in  compliance  with  the  covenants  for  our  debt  and  credit  facilities.  The  most  restrictive  covenants  include  alimitation
 on  mortgage  debt  and  sale  and  leaseback  transactions  as  a  percentage  of  consolidated  net  tangible  assets  (as  defined  in  the  creditagreements),
 and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined). When considering debt covenants, we continue tohave substantial bor
rowing capacity.40

Pension
 and  Other  Postretirement  Benefits Pension  cash  requirements  are  based  on  an  estimate  of  our  minimum  funding  requirements,pursuant
 to ERISA regulations,  although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are basedon both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to pl
ans that are funded through trusts.Purchase
 Obligations Purchase  obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify afixed,
 minimum  or  range  of  quantities;  specify  a  fixed,  minimum,  variable,  or  indexed  price  provision;  and  specify  approximate  timing  of  thetransaction.
 Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of FinancialPosition.
Purchase
 Obligations  Not  Recorded  on  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Financial  Position Production  related  purchase  obligations  notrecorded
 on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include agreements for inventory procurement, tooling costs, electricity and naturalgas
 contracts,  property,  plant  and  equipment,  and  other  miscellaneous  production  related  obligations.  The  most  significant  obligation  relates  toinventory
 procurement  contracts.  We  have  entered  into  certain  significant  inventory  procurement  contracts  that  specify  determinable  prices  andquantities,
 and  long-term  delivery  timeframes.  In  addition,  we  purchase  raw  materials  on  behalf  of  our  suppliers.  These  agreements  requiresupplier
s and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangementswith
 suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventorycommitments
 is  supported  by  firm  contracts  and/or  has  historically  resulted  in  settlement  through  reimbursement  from  customers  for  penaltypayments to
 the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contractaccounting.
 Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimateof the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the tabl

 of  Financial  Position  primarily  include  accounts  payable  and  certain  other  current  and  long-term  liabilities  including  accruedcompensation.
Industrial Participation Agreements 
We have entered into  various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. tofacilitate
 economic flow back and/or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goodsand/or
 services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid onsupply
 contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through otherparties
 (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. We do not commit to industrial participation agreements unlessa
 contract for sale of our products or services is signed. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participationcommitments.
 During 2015 ,  we incurred no such penalties. As of December  31, 2015 ,  we have outstanding industrial participation agreementstotaling 
$18.4  billion that  extend through 2030 .  Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included inpurchase
 obligations  in  the  table  above.  To  be  eligible  for  such  a  purchase  order  commitment  from  us,  a  foreign  supplier  must  have  sufficientcapability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and sch

Core Operating Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings Per Share
Our Consolidated Fina
ncial Statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting  Principles in the United States of America ( GAAP 
) which we supplement with certain non-GAAP fina ncial information. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as asubstitute
 for  the  related  GAAP  measures,  and  other  companies  may  define  such  measures  differently.  We  encourage  investors  to  review  ourfinancial
 statements  and  publicly-filed  reports  in  their  entirety  and  not  to  rely  on  any  single  financial  measure.  Core  operating  earnings,  coreoperating
 margin  and  core  earnings  per  share  exclude  the  impact  of  certain  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefit  expenses  that  are  notallocated to
 business segments - see Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management uses core operating earnings, core operatingmargin
 and core earnings per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these coreearnings
 measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit costprimarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to U.S. government contracts.

Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies
Contract Accounting
Contract
 accounting is used to determine revenue, cost of sales, and profit predominantly by our BDS business. Contract accounting involves ajudgmental
 process  of  estimating  the  total  sales  and  costs  for  each  contract,  which  results  in  the  development  of  estimated  cost  of  salespercentages.
 For  each  contract,  the  amount  reported  as  cost  of  sales  is  determined  by  applying  the  estimated  cost  of  sales  percentage  to  theamount of revenue recognized.
Due
 to the size, duration and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subjectto
 many variables. Total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regardingcontract
 options,  change  orders,  incentive  and  award  provisions  associated  with  technical  performance,  and  price  adjustment  clauses  (such  asinflatio
n or index-based clauses). The majority of these contracts are with the U.S. government where the price is generally based on estimated costto
 produce  the  product  or  service  plus  profit.  Federal  Acquisition  Regulations  provide  guidance  on  the  types  of  cost  that  will  be  reimbursed  inestablishing
 contract  price.  Total  contract  cost  estimates  are  largely  based  on  negotiated  or  estimated  purchase  contract  terms,  historicalperformance trends,
 business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical andschedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, busin
ess volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements.Revenue
 and  cost  estimates  for  all  significant  contracts  are  reviewed  and  reassessed  quarterly.  Changes  in  these  estimates  could  result  inrecognition
 of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the contract’s inception to date revenues, cost of sales and profit, in the period in which suchchanges are made. Changes in revenu
e and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reach-forward loss, whichwould
 be recorded immediately in earnings. For the year ended December  31, 2015 ,  net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, includingreach-forward
 losses, across all contracts decreased Earnings from operations by $224 million .  For the years ended December  31, 2014 and 2013net
 favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts increased Earnings from operations by $100 million 
and $242 million . Due
 to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could berecorded
 if  we  used  different  assumptions  or  if  the  underlying  circumstances  were  to  change.  Changes  in  underlying  assumptions/estimates,supplier
 performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin forall
 contracts in BDS for all of 2015 had  been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for theyear by approximately 
$304 million .  In addition, a number of our fixed price development contracts are in a reach-forward loss position. Changes toestimated losses are recorded immediately in earnin
gs.Program Accounting
Program
 accounting  requires  the  demonstrated  ability  to  reliably  estimate  the  relationship  of  sales  to  costs  for  the  defined  program  accountingquantity.
 A  program  consists  of  the  estimated  number  of  units  (accounting  quantity)  of  a  product  to  be  produced  in  a  continuing,  long-termproduction
 effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to makereasonably
 dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost ofsales
 is  determined  by  applying  the  estimated  cost  of  sales  percentage  for  the  total  remaining  program  to  the  amount  of  sales  recognized  forairplanes delivered and acc
epted by the customer.44

Table of ContentsFactors
 that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured partcosts,
 major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs. Estimation of the accountingquantity for
 each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, lettersof
 intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and salesprice for all unsold units within 
the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales pricesfor
 all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. Cost estimates arebased
 largely  on  negotiated  and  anticipated  contracts  with  suppliers,  historical  performance  trends,  and  business  base  and  other  economicprojections.
 Factors  that  influence  these  estimates  include  production  rates,  internal  and  subcontractor  performance  trends,  customer  and/orsupplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticip
ated labor agreements, and inflationary or deflationary trends.To
 ensure  reliability  in  our  estimates,  we  employ  a  rigorous  estimating  process  that  is  reviewed  and  updated  on  a  quarterly  basis.  Changes  inestimates
 are  normally  recognized  on  a  prospective  basis;  when  estimated  costs  to  complete  a  program  exceed  estimated  revenues  fromundelivered
 units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in theaccounting quantity.
The
 program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non-recurring and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program.Because of the higher unit production costs experi
enced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling andother
 non-recurring  costs,  new  commercial  aircraft  programs,  such  as  the  787  program,  typically  have  lower  initial  margins  than  establishedprograms.
 In addition, actual costs incurred for earlier units in excess of the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantityare
 included  within  program  inventory  as  deferred  production  costs.  Deferred  production,  unamortized  tooling  and  other  non-recurring  costs  areexpected
 to be fully recovered when all units in the accounting quantity  are delivered as the expected unit cost  for later  deliveries  is below theestimated average cost as learning curve and other improvements are real
ized.Due to the significance of
 judgment in the estimation process described above, it is reasonably possible that changes in underlying circumstances orassumptions
 could  have  a  material  effect  on  program  gross  margins.  If  the  combined  gross  margin  percentages  for  our  commercial  airplaneprograms
 had been estimated to be 1% higher or lower it would have a similar effect on the Commercial Airplane segment’s operating margins. Forthe
 year-ended December 31, 2015, a 1% increase or decrease in operating margins for our Commercial Airplane segment would have a $650million impact on ope
rating earnings.The 747 is in a
 reach-forward loss position at December 31, 2015 while the 787 program had near breakeven margins during 2015. Absent changesin
 estimated revenues or costs, subsequent 747 deliveries are recorded at zero margin. Reductions to the estimated loss in subsequent periods arespread
 over all undelivered units in the accounting quantity, whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded immediately as an additionalreach-forward
 loss. If we are unable to mitigate risks associated with the 747 and 787 programs, or if we are required to change one or more of ourpricing,
 cost or other assumptions related to these programs, we could be required to record additional reach-forward losses which could have amaterial effect on our reported results.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible 
ImpairmentsWe
 test  goodwill  for  impairment  by  performing  a  qualitative  assessment  or  using  a  two-step  impairment  process.  If  we  choose  to  perform  aqualitative
 assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as an initial step in assessing the fair value of operations. Ifwe determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operati
ons, the45

Table of Contentstwo-step
 impairment process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the two-step impairment process isused,
 we first compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than bookvalue,
 a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part onthe
 fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount ofgoodwill impairment.
We
 estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate offuture
 sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements andgeneral market conditions. Changes in thes
e forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any.The
 cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at thedate of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any.
We completed our assessment of goodwill as of
 April 1, 2015 and determined that  there is no impairment of goodwill. As of December 31, 2015 , we estimated that the fair value of
 each reporting unit significantly exceeded its corresponding carrying value. Changes in our forecasts, or decreases inthe
 value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairmentcharges in future periods.
As
 of December  31, 2015 and 2014 ,  we had $490  million of  indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the Jeppesen and Aviall brand and tradenames
 acquired  in  business  combinations.  We  test  these  intangibles  for  impairment  by  comparing  their  carrying  value  to  current  projections  ofdiscounted
 cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows representsthe
 amount of the impairment. A 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows would not impact the carrying value of these indefinite-lived intangibleassets.
Pension Plans
The
 majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that hadparticipated
 in defined benefit pension plans will transition to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Accountingrules
 require  an  annual  measurement  of  our  projected  obligation  and  plan  assets.  These  measurements  are  based  upon  several  assumptions,including
 the  discount  rate  and  the  expected  long-term  rate  of  asset  return.  Future  changes  in  assumptions  or  differences  between  actual  andexpected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual ex
pense, projected benefit obligation and Shareholders’ equity.The
 following table shows the sensitivity of our pension plan liability and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate as ofDecember 31, 2015

Section
 219  of  the  Iran  Threat  Reduction  and  Syria  Human  Rights  Act  of  2012  and  Section  13(r)  of  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  asamended
 (the “Act”), require disclosure of certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran that occurred during the period covered by thisreport.
 Disclosure is required even if the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. We have disclosedsuch activities
 in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2015 and such disclosure is incorporated herein by reference. Duringthe
 fourth quarter of 2015, we agreed to sell aircraft maintenance manuals to Iran Air Tours. We generated no revenues or net profits during thefourth
 quarter of 2015 from these activities. These sales were authorized by a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”).Boeing
 applied  for  the  OFAC  license  consistent  with  guidance  from  the  U.S.  government  in  connection  with  ongoing  negotiations  between  the“P5+1”
 nations and Iran related to, among other things, the safety of Iran’s civil aviation industry. We may engage in additional activities pursuant tothis license, which sales may require additi
onal disclosure pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Act.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Interest Rate Risk
We
 have  financial  instruments  that  are  subject  to  interest  rate  risk,  principally  fixed-rate  debt  obligations,  and  customer  financing  assets  andliabilities. Additiona
lly, BCC uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. Historically, we havenot
 experienced material gains or losses on our customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes. As of December  31, 2015 , the
 impact over the next 12 months of a 100 basis point rise in interest rates to our pre-tax earnings would not be significant. The investors in ourfixed-rate
 debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interestrate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
We
 are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We useforeign
 currency  forward  contracts  to  hedge  the  price  risk  associated  with  firmly  committed  and  forecasted  foreign  denominated  payments  andreceipts
 related  to  our  ongoing  business.  Foreign  currency  forward  contracts  are  sensitive  to  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  AtDecember
 31,  2015 ,  a  10%  increase  or  decrease  in  the  exchange  rate  in  our  portfolio  of  foreign  currency  contracts  would  have  increased  ordecreased
 our unrealized losses by $229  million .  Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations,such unrealized losses
 or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactionsbeing hedge
d. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk.47

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Years ended December 31
, 2015, 2014 and 2013(Dollars in millions, except per share data)
Note 
1 – Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
The
 Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report have been prepared by management of The Boeing Company (herein referred to as“Boeing,” the “Company,” “we,”
 “us,” or “our”). These statements include the accounts of all majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entitiesthat
 are  required  to  be  consolidated.  All  significant  intercompany  accounts  and  transactions  have  been  eliminated.  Certain  amounts  have  beenreclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
During
 2015 we adopted FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet  Classification of Deferred Income Taxes, which requires that
 the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position reflect all deferred income tax assets and liabilities as non-current. The Company elected toretrospectively apply the provisions of this standard and pri
or year balances have been revised to reflect the current year presentation.Standards Issued and Not Yet Implemented
In
 May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue  from Contracts withCustomers 
.  The  new  standard  was  originally  effective  for  reporting  periods  beginning  after  December  15,  2016  and  early  adoption  was  notpermitted.
 On August 12, 2015, the FASB approved a one year delay of the effective date to reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017,while
 permitting companies to voluntarily adopt the new standard as of the original effective date. The comprehensive new standard will supersedeexisting
 revenue  recognition  guidance  and  require  revenue  to  be  recognized  when  promised  goods  or  services  are  transferred  to  customers  inamounts
 that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Adoption of the newrules
 could affect the timing of revenue recognition for certain transactions. The guidance permits two implementation approaches, one requiringretrospective
 application of the new standard with restatement of prior years and one requiring prospective application of the new standard withdisclosure
 of results under old standards. The Company is currently evaluating when to adopt the new standard, the impacts of adoption and theimplementation approach to be used.
Use of Estimates
Management
 makes assumptions and estimates to prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in theUnited
 States  of  America.  Those  assumptions  and  estimates  directly  affect  the  amounts  reported  in  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.Significant
 estimates for which changes in the near term are considered reasonably possible and that may have a material impact on the financialstatements are disclosed in these Notes to the Consolid
ated Financial Statements.Operating Cycle
For
 classification of certain current assets and liabilities, we use the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle, which isgenerally longer than one year 
. 55

Table of ContentsRevenue and Related Cost Recognition
Contract Accounting 
Contract  accounting is used for development and production activities predominantly by Defense, Space & Security ( BDS ). The
 majority of business conducted by BDS is performed under contracts with the U.S. government and other customers that extend over severalyears.
 Contract  accounting  involves  a  judgmental  process  of  estimating  total  sales  and  costs  for  each  contract  resulting  in  the  development  ofestimated
 cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of salespercentage
 to the amount of revenue recognized. When the current estimates of total sales and costs for a contract indicate a loss, a provision forthe entire loss on the contract is recognized.
Changes
 in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effect on operating income are recognized using a cumulative catch-up adjustmentwhich
 recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a contract’s percent complete. In2015 
,  net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts decreased Earnings from operationsby 
$224 and  diluted EPS by $0.23 .  In 2014 and 2013 net  favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across allcontracts
 increased Earnings from operations by $100 and $242 and  diluted EPS by $0.10 and $0.23 .  Significant adjustments during the threeyears
 ended December 31, 2015 included  reach-forward losses of $835 and $425 on the USAF  KC-46A Tanker contract  recorded during 2015 and 2014 
. We
 combine contracts for accounting purposes when they are negotiated as a package with an overall profit margin objective. These essentiallyrepresent
 an agreement to do a single project for a single customer, involve interrelated construction activities with substantial common costs, andare performed concurrently or sequentially. When a group of contracts is combined, reven
ue and profit are earned uniformly over the performance ofthe
 combined contracts. Similarly, we may segment a single contract or group of contracts when a clear economic decision has been made duringcontract negotiations that would produce different rates of profitabil
ity for each element or phase of the contract.Sales
 related  to  fixed-price  contracts  are  recognized  as  deliveries  are  made,  except  for  certain  fixed-price  contracts  that  require  substantialperformance
 over an extended period before deliveries begin, for which sales are recorded based on the attainment of performance milestones.Sales related
 to contracts in which we are reimbursed for costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit are recorded as costs are incurred. The FederalAcquisition
 Regulations  provide  guidance  on  the  types  of  cost  that  will  be  reimbursed  in  establishing  contract  price.  Contracts  may  containprovisions
 to earn incentive and award fees if specified targets are achieved. Incentive and award fees that can be reasonably estimated and areprobable
 are recorded over the performance period of the contract. Incentive and award fees that cannot be reasonably estimated are recordedwhen awarded.
Program
 Accounting Our  Commercial  Airplanes  segment  predominantly  uses  program  accounting  to  account  for  cost  of  sales  related  to  itsprograms.
 Program  accounting  is applicable to  products  manufactured  for  delivery  under  production-type  contracts  where  profitability  is realizedover
 multiple contracts and years. Under program accounting, inventoriable production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, andwarranty
 costs  are  accumulated  and  charged  to  cost  of  sales  by  program  instead  of  by  individual  units  or  contracts.  A  program  consists  of  theestimated
 number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existingand
 anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of therevenue and cost of
 existing and anticipated contracts. To establish the relationship of sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimatesof
 (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced,and
 (c) the units’ expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs for the totalprogram.
56

Table of ContentsWe
 recognize sales for commercial airplane deliveries as each unit is completed and accepted by the customer. Sales recognized represent theprice negotiated with the customer,
 adjusted by an escalation formula as specified in the customer agreement. The amount reported as cost of salesis
 determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanesdelivered
 and accepted by the customer. Changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effects on program margins are recognizedprospectively
 except in cases where the program is determined to have a reach-forward loss in which case the loss is recognized in the currentperiod. See Note 
11 .Concession
 Sharing  Arrangements We  account  for  sales  concessions  to  our  customers  in  consideration  of  their  purchase  of  products  andservices
 as  a  reduction  to  revenue  when  the  related  products  and  services  are  delivered.  The  sales  concessions  incurred  may  be  partiallyreimbursed
 by certain suppliers in accordance with concession sharing arrangements. We record these reimbursements, which are presumed torepresent reductions in the price of the vendor’s products or services, as a reduction in C
ost of products.Spare Parts Revenue 
We recognize sales of spare parts upon delivery and the amo unt reported as cost of sales is recorded at average cost.Service
 Revenue Service  revenue is recognized when the service is performed with the exception of U.S. government service agreements, whichare
 accounted for using contract accounting. Service activities primarily include: support agreements associated with military aircraft and helicoptercontracts,
 space travel on Commercial Crew, ongoing maintenance of International Space Station, and technical and flight operation services forcommercial
 aircraft. Service revenue and associated cost of sales from pay-in-advance subscription fees are deferred and recognized as servicesare rendered.
Financial
 Services  Revenue We  record  financial  services  revenue  associated  with  sales-type/finance  leases,  operating  leases,  and  notesreceivable.
Lease
 and financing revenue arrangements are included in Sales of services on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For sales-type/financeleases,
 we record an asset at lease inception. This asset is recorded at the aggregate future minimum lease payments, estimated residual value ofthe leased
 equipment, and deferred incremental direct costs less unearned income. Income is recognized over the life of the lease to approximate alevel
 rate of return on the net investment. Residual values, which are reviewed periodically, represent the estimated amount we expect to receive atlease
 termination  from  the  disposition  of  the  leased  equipment.  Actual  residual  values  realized  could  differ  from  these  estimates.  Declines  inestimated residual value that are deemed other-than-temporary are recogn
ized in the period in which the declines occur.For
 operating leases, revenue on leased aircraft and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Operating leaseassets,
 included in Customer financing, are recorded at cost and depreciated over the period that we project we will hold the asset to an estimatedresidual
 value,  using  the  straight-line  method.  We  periodically  review  our  estimates  of  residual  value  and  recognize  forecasted  changes  byprospectively adjusting
 depreciation expense.For
 notes receivable, notes are recorded net of any unamortized discounts and deferred incremental direct costs. Interest income and amortizationof any discounts are recorded ratably over the related term of the note.
Reinsurance
 Revenue Our  wholly-owned  insurance  subsidiary,  Astro  Ltd.,  participates  in  a  reinsurance  pool  for  workers’  compensation.  Themember
 agreements and practices of the reinsurance pool minimize any participating members’ individual risk. Reinsurance revenues were $136 , $135 
and $160 during 2015 , 2014 and 2013 ,  respectively. Reinsurance costs related to premiums and claims paid to the reinsurance pool were$132 
, $144 and $147 during 2015 , 2014 and 2013 ,  respectively. Revenues and costs are presented net in Cost of sales in the ConsolidatedStatements of Operations.

Table of ContentsFleet Support
We
 provide  assistance  and  services  to  facilitate  efficient  and  safe  aircraft  operation  to  the  operators  of  all  our  commercial  airplane  models.Collectively
 known as fleet support services, these activities and services include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineeringservices,
 and technical data and documents. Fleet support activity begins prior to aircraft delivery as the customer receives training, manuals, andtechnical
 consulting support. This activity continues throughout the aircraft’s operational life. Services provided after delivery include field servicesupport,
 consulting on maintenance, repair, and operational issues brought forth by the customer or regulators, updating manuals and engineeringdata,
 and the issuance of service bulletins that impact the entire model’s fleet. Field service support involves our personnel located at customerfacilities providing and coordi
nating fleet support activities and requests. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred as Cost of services.Research and Development
Research
 and  development  includes  costs  incurred  for  experimentation,  design,  and  testing,  as  well  as  bid  and  proposal  efforts  related  togovernment produ
cts and services which are expensed as incurred unless the costs are related to certain contractual arrangements with customers.Costs
 that are incurred pursuant to such contractual arrangements are recorded over the period that revenue is recognized, consistent with ourcontract
 accounting  policy.  We  have  certain  research  and  development  arrangements  that  meet  the  requirement  for  best  efforts  research  anddevelopment
 accounting. Accordingly, the amounts funded by the customer are recognized as an offset to our research and development expenserather than
 as contract revenues. Research and development expense included bid and proposal costs of $286 , $289 and $285 in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 
, respectively. We
 have established cost sharing arrangements with some suppliers for the 787 program. Our cost sharing arrangements state that the suppliercontributions
 are for reimbursements of costs we incur for experimentation, basic design, and testing activities during the 787 development. In eacharrangement,
 we retain substantial rights to the 787 part or component covered by the arrangement. The amounts received from these cost sharingarrangements
 are recorded as a reduction to research and development expenses since we have no obligation to refund any amounts received perthe
 arrangements regardless of the outcome of the development efforts. Specifically, under the terms of each agreement, payments received fromsupplier
s for their share of the costs are typically based on milestones and are recognized as earned when we achieve the milestone events and noongoing
 obligation on our part exists. In the event we receive a milestone payment prior to the completion of the milestone, the amount is classifiedin Accrued liabilities un
til earned.Share-Based Compensation
We provide various forms of
 share-based compensation to our employees. For awards settled in shares, we measure compensation expense basedon
 the  grant-date  fair  value  net  of  estimated  forfeitures.  For  awards  settled  in  cash,  or  that  may  be  settled  in  cash,  we  measure  compensationexpense
 based on the fair value at each reporting date net of estimated forfeitures. The expense is recognized over the requisite service period,which is generally the vesting perio
d of the award.58

Table of ContentsIncome Taxes
Provisio
ns for federal, state, and non-U.S. income taxes are calculated on reported Earnings before income taxes based on current tax law and alsoinclude,
 in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets andliabilities.
 Such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized indifferent
 time  periods  for  financial  reporting  purposes  than  for  income  tax  purposes.  Significant  judgment  is  required  in  determining  income  taxprovisions and evaluating
 tax positions.The
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of taxpositions
 taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured forfinancial
 statement purposes and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such taxpositions
 changes,  the  change  in  estimate  is  recorded  in  the  period  in  which  the  determination  is  made.  Tax-related  interest  and  penalties  areclassified as a component of Income tax expense.
Postretirement Plans
The
 majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that hadparticipated
 in  defined  benefit  pension  plans  will  transition  to  a  company-funded  defined  contribution  retirement  savings  plan  in  2016.  We  alsoprovide
 postretirement  benefit  plans  other  than  pensions,  consisting  principally  of  health  care  coverage  to  eligible  retirees  and  qualifyingdependents.
 Benefits under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of service and,for
 some pension plans, benefits are also based on the employee’s annual earnings. The net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirementplans is determined using the projected unit credit method and several actuari
al assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, thelong-term
 rate  of  asset  return,  and  medical  trend  (rate  of  growth  for  medical  costs).  A  portion  of  net  periodic  pension  and  other  postretirementincome
 or expense is not recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs, and reflected ininventory
 at the end of a reporting period. Actuarial gains and losses, which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions, arereflected
 in Shareholders’ equity (net of taxes). If actuarial gains and losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities weamortize
 them over the average future service period of employees. The funded status of our pension and postretirement plans is reflected on theConsolidated Statement
s of Financial Position.Postemployment Plans
We record a liability for postemployment benefits, such as severance or job traini
ng, when payment is probable, the amount is reasonably estimable,and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumul
ated.59

Table of ContentsEnvironmental Remediation
We
 are  subject  to  federal  and  state  requirements  for  protection  of  the  environment,  including  those  for  discharge  of  hazardous  materials  andremediation
 of  contaminated  sites.  We  routinely  assess,  based  on  in-depth  studies,  expert  analyses  and  legal  reviews,  our  contingencies,obligations,
 and commitments  for remediation  of contaminated  sites,  including assessments  of ranges and probabilities of recoveries  from  otherresponsible
 parties and/or insurance carriers. Our policy is to accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to environmentalremediation
 sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The amount of the liability isbased
 on  our  best  estimate  or  the  low  end  of  a  range  of  reasonably  possible  exposure  for  investigation,  cleanup,  and  monitoring  costs  to  beincurred.
 Estimated remediation costs are not discounted to present value as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. We may beable
 to recover a portion of the remediation costs from insurers or other third parties. Such recoveries are recorded when realization of the claim forrecovery is deemed probable.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash
 and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments, such as commercial paper, time deposits, and other money market instruments,which
 have original maturities of three months or less. We aggregate our cash balances by bank where conditions for right of set-off are met, andreclassify
 any negative balances, consisting mainly of uncleared checks, to Accounts payable. Negative balances reclassified to Accounts payablewere 
$163 and $241 at December 31, 2015 and 2014 . Inventories
Inventoried
 costs  on  commercial  aircraft  programs  and  long-term  contracts  include  direct  engineering,  production  and  tooling  and  other  non-recurring
 costs,  and  applicable  overhead,  which  includes  fringe  benefits,  production  related  indirect  and  plant  management  salaries  and  plantservices, not in excess of
 estimated net realizable value. To the extent a material amount of such costs are related to an abnormal event or are fixedcosts
 not appropriately attributable to our programs or contracts, they are expensed in the current period rather than inventoried. Inventoried costsinclude
 amounts relating to programs and contracts with long-term production cycles, a portion of which is not expected to be realized within oneyear. Included in inventory for federal government contracts is an allocati
on of allowable costs related to manufacturing process reengineering.Commercial aircraft programs
 inventory includes deferred production costs and supplier advances. Deferred production costs represent actual costsincurred for
 production of early units that exceed the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity. Higher production costsare
 experienced at the beginning of a new or derivative airplane program. Units produced early in a program require substantially more effort (laborand
 other  resources)  than  units  produced  later  in  a  program  because  of  volume  efficiencies  and  the  effects  of  learning.  We  expect  that  thesedeferred
 costs will be fully recovered when all units included in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries isbelow
 the estimated average cost of all units in the program. Supplier advances represent payments for parts we have contracted to receive fromsuppliers in the future. As parts are received, supplier advances are amortize
d to work in process.The
 determination of net realizable value of long-term contract costs is based upon quarterly reviews that estimate costs to be incurred to completeall
 contract requirements. When actual contract costs and the estimate to complete exceed total estimated contract revenues, a loss provision isrecorded.
 The determination of net realizable value of commercial aircraft program costs is based upon quarterly program reviews that estimaterevenue
 and  cost  to  be  incurred  to  complete  the  program  accounting  quantity.  When  estimated  costs  to  complete  exceed  estimated  programrevenues to go, a program loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss o
n all undelivered units in the accounting quantity.60

Table of ContentsUsed
 aircraft purchased by the Commercial Airplanes segment and general stock materials are stated at cost not in excess of net realizable value.See ‘Aircraft Valuation’ within this
 Note for a discussion of our valuation of used aircraft. Spare parts inventory is stated at lower of average unit costor
 net realizable value. We review our commercial spare parts and general stock materials quarterly to identify impaired inventory, including excessor obsolete inventory,
 based on historical sales trends, expected production usage, and the size and age of the aircraft fleet using the part. Impairedinventories are charged to Cost of products in the period the impairment occurs.
Included
 in inventory for commercial aircraft programs are amounts paid or credited in cash, or other consideration to certain airline customers, thatare
 referred to as early issue sales consideration. Early issue sales consideration is recognized as a reduction to revenue when the delivery of theaircraft under contract
 occurs. If an airline customer does not perform and take delivery of the contracted aircraft, we believe that we would have theability
 to recover amounts paid. However, to the extent early issue sales consideration exceeds advances and is not considered to be otherwiserecoverable, it would be written off in the current period.
We net advances and progress
 billings on long-term contracts against inventory in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Advances andprogress billings in excess of related inve
ntory are reported in Advances and billings in excess of related costs.Precontract Costs
We
 may, from time to time, incur costs in excess of the amounts required for existing contracts. If we determine the costs are probable of recoveryfrom
 future  orders,  then  we  capitalize  the  precontract  costs  we  incur,  excluding  start-up  costs  which  are  expensed  as  incurred.  Capitalizedprecontract
 costs  are included in Inventories,  net of advances and progress  billings, in the  accompanying  Consolidated Statements  of FinancialPosition.
 Should future orders not materialize or we determine the costs are no longer probable of recovery, the capitalized costs would be writtenoff.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property,
 plant  and  equipment  are  recorded  at  cost,  including  applicable  construction-period  interest,  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  aredepreciated principally over the following estimated
 useful lives: new buildings and land improvements, from 10 to 40 years; and new machinery andequipment,
 from 4  to 20 years. The principal methods of depreciation are as follows: buildings and land improvements, 150% declining balance;and
 machinery  and  equipment,  sum-of-the-years’  digits.  Capitalized  internal  use  software  is  included  in  Other  assets  and  amortized  using  thestraight
 line  method  over 5 years.  We  periodically  evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  remaining  depreciable  lives  assigned  to  long-lived  assets,including assets that may be subject to a management pla
n for disposition.Long-lived
 assets  held  for  sale  are  stated  at  the  lower  of  cost  or  fair  value  less  cost  to  sell.  Long-lived  assets  held  for  use  are  subject  to  animpairment
 assessment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carryingvalue
 is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference betweenthe carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.
Asset Retirement Obligations
We
 record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liability’s fair value can be reasonably estimated, including certain asbestos removal,asset decommissioning and contractual le
ase restoration obligations. Recorded amounts are not material.61

Table of ContentsWe
 also  have  known  conditional  asset  retirement  obligations,  such  as  certain  asbestos  remediation  and  asset  decommissioning  activities  to  beperformed in
 the future, that are not reasonably estimable due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation.Accordingly,
 these obligations have not been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. A liability for these obligations will be recorded inthe
 period when sufficient information regarding timing and method of settlement becomes available to make a reasonable estimate of the liability’sfair
 value. In addition, there may be conditional asset retirement obligations that we have not yet discovered (e.g. asbestos may exist in certainbuildings
 but we have not become aware of it through the normal course of business), and therefore, these obligations also have not been includedin the Consolidated Financial
 Statements.Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangibles
Goodwill
 and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized,  but are tested for impairment  annually and when an eventoccurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. Our annual testing date is April 1.
We
 test  goodwill  for  impairment  by  performing  a  qualitative  assessment  or  using  a  two-step  impairment  process.  If  we  choose  to  perform  aqualitative
 assessment and determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the relatedoperations,
 the  two-step  impairment  process  is  then  performed;  otherwise,  no  further  testing  is  required.  For  operations  where  the  two-stepimpairment
 process  is  used,  we  first  compare  the  carrying  value  of  net  assets  to  the  fair  value  of  the  related  operations.  If  the  fair  value  isdetermined
 to be less than carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value forgoodwill
 is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value belowcarrying value represents the amount of goodwill imp
airment.Indefinite-lived
 intangibles  consist  of  brand  and  trade  names  acquired  in  business  combinations.  We  test  these  intangibles  for  impairment  bycomparing
 their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying valueover the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment.
Our
 finite-lived acquired intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: developed technology,from 
5 to 14 years; product know-how, from 6 to 30 years; customer base, from 3 to 19 years; distribution rights, from 3 to 27 years; and other, from3 
to 32 years. We evaluate the potential impairment of finite-lived acquired intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicatethat
 the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows ofthe asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.

Table of ContentsInvestments
Time deposits are held-to-maturity investments that are carried at cost.
Available-for-sale
 securities  include  commercial  paper,  U.S.  government  agency  securities,  and  corporate  debt  securities.  Available-for-salesecurities are recorded at fair value, and unrealized gain
s and losses are recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensiveincome.
 Realized gains and losses  on available-for-sale  securities  are  recognized  based on the  specific  identification  method.  Available-for-salesecurities are assessed for impairment quarterly.
The
 equity method of accounting is used to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control,over
 an investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of an investee of between20% 
and 50% . We
 classify  investment  income  and  loss  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations  based  on  whether  the  investment  is  operating  or  non-operatin
g in nature. Operating investments align strategically and are integrated with our operations. Earnings from operating investments, includingour
 share  of  income  or  loss  from  equity  method  investments,  dividend  income  from  certain  cost  method  investments,  and  any  impairments  orgain/loss
 on the disposition of these investments, are recorded in Income from operating investments, net. Non-operating investments are those wehold
 for  non-strategic  purposes.  Earnings  from  non-operating  investments,  including  interest  and  dividends  on  marketable  securities,  and  anyimpairments or gain/loss on the disposition of these inv
estments are recorded in Other income/(expense), net.Derivatives
All
 derivative instruments are recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent of holding them.We
 use derivative instruments to principally manage a variety of market risks. For derivatives designated as hedges of the exposure to changes infair
 value of the recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment (referred to as fair value hedges), the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in theperiod of
 change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. The effect of that accounting is toinclude in earni
ngs the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. For our cash flow hedges, the effectiveportion of
 the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported in comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same periodor
 periods  during  which  the  hedged  forecasted  transaction  affects  earnings.  The  ineffective  portion  of  the  gain  or  loss  of  a  cash  flow  hedge  isreported
 in  earnings  immediately.  We  have  agreements  to  purchase  and  sell  aluminum  to  address  long-term  strategic  sourcing  objectives  andinternational

Aircraft Valuation
Used
 aircraft under trade-in commitments and aircraft under repurchase commitments In  conjunction with signing a definitive agreement forthe
 sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in usedaircraft
 at a specified price upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. Additionally, we have entered into contingent repurchase commitments with certaincustomers
 wherein we agree to repurchase the Sale Aircraft at a specified price, generally  10 to 15 years after  delivery of the Sale Aircraft. Ourrepurchase
 of the Sale Aircraft is contingent upon a future, mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft. If we execute anagreement for the sale of additional new aircraft, and if the customer exercises its right to sell the Sale

Table of ContentsAircraft
 to us, a contingent repurchase commitment would become a trade-in commitment. Our historical experience is that contingent repurchasecommitments infrequently become trade-in commitments.
Exposure related to trade-in commitments may take the form of:
(1)
adjustments to revenue for the difference between the contractual trade-in price in the definitive agreement and our best estimate of thefair value of the trade-in aircraft as of the date of such agreement, which would be recogniz
ed upon delivery of the Sale Aircraft, and/or(2)
charges  to  cost  of  products  for  adverse  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  trade-in  aircraft  that  occur  subsequent  to  signing  of  a  definitiveagreement
 for Sale Aircraft but prior to the purchase of the used trade-in aircraft. Estimates based on current aircraft values would beincluded in Accrued liabilitie
s.The
 fair value of trade-in aircraft is determined using aircraft-specific data such as model, age and condition, market conditions for specific aircraftand
 similar  models,  and  multiple  valuation  sources.  This  process  uses  our  assessment  of  the  market  for  each  trade-in  aircraft,  which  in  mostinstances
 begins years before the return of the aircraft. There are several possible markets in which we continually pursue opportunities to placeused
 aircraft. These markets include, but are not limited to, the resale market, which could potentially include the cost of long-term storage; theleasing
 market,  with  the  potential  for  refurbishment  costs  to  meet  the  leasing  customer’s  requirements;  or  the  scrap  market.  Trade-in  aircraftvaluation
 varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft. On a quarterly basis, we update our valuationanalysis
 based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into a market or using current published third-party aircraft valuationsbased on the type and age of the aircraft, adjusted for individu
al attributes and known conditions.Used aircraft
 acquired by the Commercial Airplanes segment are included in Inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value as it is our intentto
 sell these assets. To mitigate costs and enhance marketability, aircraft may be placed on operating lease. While on operating lease, the assetsare included in Customer financing.
Customer
 financing Customer  financing includes operating lease equipment, notes receivable, and sales-type/finance leases. Sales-type/financeleases are treated as receivables, and allo
wances for losses are established as necessary.We
 assess  the  fair  value  of  the  assets  we  own,  including  equipment  under  operating  leases,  assets  held  for  sale  or  re-lease,  and  collateralunderlying receivables, to determine if their fair values are l
ess than the related assets’ carrying values. Differences between carrying values and fairvalues
 of sales-type/finance leases and notes and other receivables, as determined by collateral value, are considered in determining the allowancefor losses on receivables.
We
 use a median calculated from published collateral values from multiple third-party aircraft value publications based on the type and age of theaircraft
 to determine the fair value of aircraft. Under certain circumstances,  we apply judgment based on the attributes  of the specific aircraft orequipment,
 usually  when  the  features  or  use  of  the  aircraft  vary  significantly  from  the  more  generic  aircraft  attributes  covered  by  outsidepublications.
Impairment review for
 assets under operating leases and held for sale or re-lease We evaluate for impairment assets  under operating lease orassets
 held for sale or re-lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may beless
 than the carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow, including our intentions for howlong
 we will hold an asset subject to operating lease before it is sold, the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset,periods in which the asset may be held in prep
aration for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic64

Table of Contentslife of the asset. We record assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.
When
 we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value overthe fair value of the asset.
Allowance
 for losses on customer financing receivables We  record the potential impairment of customer financing receivables in a valuationaccount,
 the balance of which is an accounting estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses. The allowance for losses on receivables relates to twocomponents of receivables: (a) receivables that are evaluate
d individually for impairment and (b) all other receivables.We
 determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts dueaccording
 to  the  original contractual terms  of  the  receivable agreement,  without regard  to  any  subsequent restructurings.  Factors  considered inassessing
 collectability include, but are not limited to, a customer’s extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. Wedetermine
 a specific impairment allowance based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of therelated collateral we would exp
ect to realize.We
 review the adequacy of the allowance attributable  to the remaining receivables (after  excluding receivables subject to a specific impairmentallowa
nce) by assessing both the collateral exposure and the applicable cumulative default rate. Collateral exposure for a particular receivable is theexcess
 of the carrying value of the receivable over the fair value of the related collateral. A receivable with an estimated fair value in excess of thecarrying
 value is considered to have no collateral exposure. The applicable cumulative default rate is determined using two components: customercredit
 ratings and weighted average remaining contract term. Internally assigned credit ratings, our credit quality indicator, are determined for eachcustomer in the portfolio. Those ratings are updated based up
on public information and information obtained directly from our customers.We
 have entered into agreements with certain customers that would entitle us to look beyond the specific collateral underlying the receivable forpurposes
 of determining the collateral exposure as described above. Should the proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral asset resultingfrom
 a default condition be insufficient to cover the carrying value of our receivable (creating a shortfall condition), these agreements would, forexample,
 permit us to take the actions necessary to sell or retain certain other assets in which the customer has an equity interest and use theproceeds to cover the shortfall.
Each quarter we review customer
 credit ratings, published historical credit default rates for different rating categories, and multiple third-party aircraftvalue
 publications as a basis to validate the reasonableness of the allowance for losses on receivables. There can be no assurance that actualresults
 will not differ from estimates or that the consideration of these factors in the future will not result in an increase or decrease to the allowancefor losses on receivables.
Warranties
In conjunction with certain product sales, we provide warranties that cover factors such as non-conformance to specifications and defects in material
and
 design. The majority of our warranties are issued by our Commercial Airplanes segment. Generally, aircraft sales are accompanied by a three to 
four -year standard warranty for systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us or manufactured to certain standardsunder
 our authorization. These warranties are included in the programs’ estimate at completion. On occasion we have made commitments beyondthe
 standard  warranty  obligation  to  correct  fleet-wide  major  issues  of  a  particular  model,  resulting  in  additional  accrued  warranty  expense.Warranties
 issued by our BDS segments principally relate to sales of military aircraft and weapons hardware and are included in the contract costestimates.
 These sales are generally accompanied by a six month to two -year warranty period and cover systems, accessories, equipment, parts,and software manufactured by us to certain contractual specifications. Estimated costs related to stand
ard warranties are recorded in the65

Table of Contentsperiod
 in which the related product sales occur. The warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date reflects the estimated number of monthsof
 warranty coverage outstanding for products delivered times the average of historical monthly warranty payments, as well as additional amountsfor
 certain major warranty issues that exceed a normal claims level. Estimated costs of these additional warranty issues are considered changes tothe initial liability estimate.
We
 provide  guarantees  to  certain  commercial  airplane  customers  which  include  compensation  provisions  for  failure  to  meet  specified  aircraftperformance
 targets. We account for these performance guarantees as warranties. The estimated liability for these warranties is based on knownand
 anticipated operational characteristics and forecasted customer operation of the aircraft relative to contractually specified performance targets,and
 anticipated settlements when contractual remedies are not specified. Estimated payments are recorded as a reduction of revenue at delivery ofthe
 related  aircraft.  We  have  agreements  that  require  certain  suppliers  to  compensate  us  for  amounts  paid  to  customers  for  failure  of  suppliedequipment
 to meet specified performance targets. Claims against suppliers under these agreements are included in Inventories and recorded as areduction
 in  Cost  of  products  at  delivery  of  the  related  aircraft.  These  performance  warranties  and  claims  against  suppliers  are  included  in  theprograms’ estimate at completion.
Supplier Penalties
We
 record an accrual for supplier penalties when an event occurs that makes it probable that a supplier penalty will be incurred and the amount isreasonably estimable. Until an event occurs, we fully a
nticipate accepting all products procured under production-related contracts.Guarantees
We
 record a liability in Accrued liabilities for the fair value of guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002. For a residual valueguarantee
 where  we  received  a  cash  premium,  the  liability  is  equal  to  the  cash  premium  received  at  the  guarantee’s  inception.  For  creditguarantees,
 the liability is equal to the present value of the expected loss. We determine the expected loss by multiplying the creditor’s default rateby
 the  guarantee  amount  reduced  by  the  expected  recovery,  if  applicable,  for  each  future  period  the  credit  guarantee  will  be  outstanding.  If  atinception
 of a guarantee, we determine there is a probable related contingent loss, we will recognize a liability for the greater of (a) the fair value ofthe guarantee as described above or (b) the probabl
e contingent loss amount.Note

Note 
3 – Earnings Per ShareBasic
 and diluted earnings per share are computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method that determines earningsper
 share  for  common  shares  and  participating  securities.  The  undistributed  earnings  are  allocated  between  common  shares  and  participatingsecurities
 as if all earnings had been distributed during the period. Participating securities and common shares have equal rights to undistributedearnings.
Basic
 earnings  per  share  is  calculated  by  taking  net  earnings,  less  earnings  available  to  participating  securities,  divided  by  the  basic  weightedaverage common shares outstanding.
Diluted
 earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities, divided by the diluted weightedaverage common shares outstanding.

 determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts dueaccording to the original contractual terms. As of 
December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we had no material receivables that were greater than 30 days past due and we had no impaired customer financ
ing receivables during 2015 and 2014.Income
 recognition is generally suspended for financing receivables at the date full recovery of income and principal becomes not probable. Incomeis
 recognized  when  financing  receivables  become  contractually  current  and  performance  is  demonstrated  by  the  customer.  For  the  year  endedDecember
 31,  2013,  interest  income  recognized  on  such  receivables  was $30 ,  and  the  average  recorded  investment  in  impaired  financingreceivables was 
$376 . The

 adequacy of the allowance for losses is assessed quarterly. Three primary factors influencing the level of our allowance for losses on customerfinancing
 receivables  are  customer  credit  ratings,  default  rates  and  collateral  values.  We  assign  internal  credit  ratings  for  all  customers  anddetermine
 the creditworthiness of each customer based upon publicly available information and information obtained directly from our customers.Our rating categories are comparable to those used by the major credit rating agenc

Table of ContentsCustomer Financing Exposure
Customer
 financing is collateralized by security in the related asset. The value of the collateral is closely tied to commercial airline performance andoverall
 market conditions and may be subject to reduced valuation with market decline. Declines in collateral values are also a significant driver ofour allowance for losses. Generally, out-of-production aircraft have exp
erienced greater collateral value declines than in-production aircraft.Our
 customer  financing  portfolio  is  primarily  collateralized  by  out-of-production  aircraft.  The  majority  of  customer  financing  carrying  values  areconcentrated in the following aircraft models at December 31:

10 – Other AssetsSea Launch
At 
December 31, 2015 and 2014 ,  Other assets included $356 of  receivables related to our former investment in the Sea Launch venture whichbecame
 payable  by  certain  Sea  Launch  partners  following  Sea  Launch’s  bankruptcy  filing  in  June  2009.  The $356 includes $147 related  to  apayment
 made by us under a bank guarantee on behalf of Sea Launch and $209 related  to loans (partner loans) we made to Sea Launch. The netamounts
 owed  to  Boeing  by  each  of  the  partners  are  as  follows:  S.P.  Koroley  Rocket  and  Space  Corporation  Energia  of  Russia  – $223 ,  POYuzhnoye Mashinostroitelny Zavod of Ukrai
ne – $89 and KB Yuzhnoye of Ukraine – $44 .Althoug
h each partner is contractually obligated to reimburse us for its share of the bank guarantee, the Russian and Ukrainian partners have raiseddefenses to enforcement and contested our
 claims. On February 1, 2013, we filed an action in the United States District Court for the Central Districtof
 California  seeking  reimbursement  from  the  other  Sea  Launch  partners  of  the $147 bank  guarantee  payment  and  the $209 partner  loanobligations. On September 28, 2015, the district court granted summary judgment in
77

Table of ContentsBoeing’s
 favor  on all claims  against the  other  partners.  Further  proceedings  will determine  the final  damage amount,  including potential  interestpayments.
 If the partners decide to appeal or seek reconsideration of the district court’s ruling additional proceedings would ensue. Prior to theseproceedings,
 we had filed a Notice of Arbitration with the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce seeking reimbursement from the other partners for aportion
 of these amounts. In 2010, the arbitrator ruled that the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter, which rulinghas been on appeal in the Swedish appell
ate courts since mid-2014. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Supreme Court of Sweden confirmed ourright
 to pursue this appeal in the Swedish appellate courts . We believe the partners have the financial wherewithal to pay and intend to pursuevigorously
 all  of  our  rights  and  remedies.  In  the  event  we  are  unable  to  secure  reimbursement  of $147 related  to  our  payment  under  the  bankguarantee and 
$209 related to partner loans made to  Sea Launch, we could incur additional charges. Our current assessment as to the collectabilityof these receivables takes into account the current economic cond
itions in Russia and Ukraine, although we will continue to monitor the situation.Spirit AeroSystems
As
 of December 31, 2015, Other assets included $140 of  receivables related to an indemnification from Spirit AeroSystems, Inc. (Spirit), for costsincurred related to pension and retiree
 medical obligations of former Boeing employees that were subsequently employed by Spirit. During the fourthquarter
 of 2014, Boeing filed a complaint against Spirit in Delaware Superior Court seeking to enforce our rights to indemnification and to recoverfrom
 Spirit amounts incurred by Boeing for pension and retiree medical obligations. We expect to fully recover from Spirit and do not expect to incurany losses.

Table of ContentsThe
 liabilities recorded represent our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible costs expected to be incurred to remediatesites,
 including operation and maintenance over periods of up to 30 years. It is reasonably possible that we may incur charges that exceed theserecorded
 amounts because of regulatory agency orders and directives, changes in laws and/or regulations, higher than expected costs and/or thediscovery
 of new or additional contamination. As part of our estimating process, we develop a range of reasonably possible alternate scenarios thatincludes the high end of a 
range of reasonably possible cost estimates for all remediation sites for which we have sufficient information based on ourexperience
 and  existing  laws  and  regulations.  There  are  some  potential  remediation  obligations  where  the  costs  of  remediation  cannot  bereasonably
 estimated. At December  31, 2015 and 2014 ,  the high end of the estimated range of reasonably possible remediation costs exceededour recorded liabilities by

$1,485  $1,504 Commercial Aircraft Commitments
In
 conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certaincustomers
 that  give  them  the  right  to  trade  in  used  aircraft  at  a  specified  price  upon  the  purchase  of  Sale  Aircraft.  The  probability  that  trade-incommitments
 will be exercised is determined by using both quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative information from othersources.
 The probability of exercise is assessed quarterly, or as events trigger a change, and takes into consideration the current economic andairline
 industry environments. Trade-in commitments, which can be terminated by mutual consent with the customer, may be exercised only duringthe period specified in the agreement, and requ
ire advance notice by the customer.Trade-in
 commitment agreements at December  31, 2015 have  expiration dates from 2016 through 2026 .  At December 31, 2015 and 2014 ,  totalcontractual
 trade-in commitments were $1,585 and $2,392 .  As of December  31, 2015 and 2014 ,  we estimated that it was probable we would beobligated
 to  perform  on  certain  of  these  commitments  with  net  amounts  payable  to  customers  totaling $240 and $446 and  the  fair  value  of  therelated trade-in aircraft was 
$240 and $446 . 79

 concluded  that  no  reserve  for  future  potential  losses  is  required  for  these  financing  commitments  based  upon  the  terms,  such  ascollateralization and interest rates, under whic
h funding would be provided.Standby Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds
We
 have  entered  into  standby  letters  of  credit  and  surety  bonds  with  financial  institutions  primarily  relating  to  the  guarantee  of  our  futureperformance
 on  certain  contracts.  Contingent  liabilities  on  outstanding  letters  of  credit  agreements  and  surety  bonds  aggregated  approximately$4,968 
and $3,985 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 . Commitments to ULA
We
 and Lockheed Martin Corporation have each committed to provide ULA with additional capital contributions in the event ULA does not havesufficient fund
s to make a required payment to us under an inventory supply agreement. As of December 31, 2015 , ULA’s total remaining obligation to Boeing under the inventory supply agre
ement was $120 . See Note 6 .C-17
Productio
n of the C-17 aircraft ended in the fourth quarter of 2015. At December 31, 2015 , one aircraft remained unsold, while our backlog includesinternational orders for 
four C-17 aircraft that are scheduled for delivery in 2016. During 2015 we received orders for six C-17 aircraft and we believeit
 is probable that we will receive an order for the remaining unsold aircraft from an international customer. Should an order not materialize we couldincur charges to write down inventory.
F/A-18
At 
December 31, 2015 ,  our backlog included 48 F/A-18 aircraft under contract with the U.S. Navy. The orders in backlog include an order for 15 aircraft
 finalized in October 2015. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, passed in December 2015, funds 12 additional F/A-18 aircraft that,combined
 with  the  orders  in  backlog,  would  complete  production  in  mid-2018.  The  President’s  Fiscal  Year  2017  Budget  request  submitted  inFebruary
 2016  includes  funding  for two additional  F/A-18  aircraft.  We  are  continuing  to  work  with  our  U.S.  customers  as  well  as  internationalcustomers to secure additional orders that would extend the program bey
ond 2018. 80

Table of ContentsShould
 additional orders not materialize, it is reasonably possible that we will decide to end production of the F/A-18 in 2018. We are still evaluatingthe full financial impact of a potential productio
n shutdown, including any recovery that may be available from the U.S. government.KC-46A Tanker
We have also begun work on 
low rate initial production aircraft for the U.S. Air Force ( USAF ). The USAF is expected to authorize two low rate initialproduction 
lots  in 2016 for a total of 19 aircraft, subject to satisfactory progress being made on the Engineering,  Manufacturing and Developmentcontract.
 At  December  31,  2015,  we  had  approximately $429 of  capitalized  precontract  costs  and $1,589 of  potential  termination  liabilities  tosuppliers associated with the KC-46A Ta

McDonnell
 Douglas Corporation insured its executives with Company Owned Life Insurance (COLI), which are life insurance policies with a cashsurrender
 value. Although we do not use COLI currently, these obligations from the merger with McDonnell Douglas are still a commitment at thistime.
 We have loans in place to cover costs paid or incurred to carry the underlying life insurance policies. As of December 31,  2015 and 2014 , the cash
 surrender  value was $487 and $466 and  the  total  loans  were $456 and $439 .  As  we  have  the  right  to  offset  the  loans  against  the  cashsurrender
 value of the policies, we present the net asset in Other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 
. United States Government Defense Environment Overview
The
 enactment  of  The  Bipartisan  Budget  Act  of  2015  in  November  2015  established  overall  defense  spending  levels  for  FY2016  and  FY2017.However,
 uncertainty  remains  with  respect  to  levels  of  defense  spending  for  FY2018  and  beyond,  including  risk  of  future  sequestration  cuts.Significant
 uncertainty  also  continues  with  respect  to  program-level  appropriations  for  the  U.S.  Department  of  Defense  (U.S.  DoD)  and  othergovernment agencies, includin
g the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, within the overall budgetary framework described above. Futurebudget
 cuts,  including  cuts  mandated  by  sequestration,  or  future  procurement  decisions  associated  with  the  authorization  and  appropriationsprocess
 could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effecton the results of the Company’s operations, financial p
osition and/or cash flows.In
 addition to the risks described above, if Congress is unable to pass appropriations bills in a timely manner, a government shutdown could resultwhich
 may have impacts above and beyond those resulting from budget cuts, sequestration impacts or program-level appropriations. For example,requirements to furlough employees in the
 U.S. DoD or other government agencies could result in payment delays, impair our ability to perform workon existing contracts, and/or negatively impact future orders.
KC-46A Tanker and BDS Fixed-Price Development Contracts
Fixed-price
 development work is inherently uncertain and subject to significant variability in estimates of the cost and time required to complete thework.
 BDS fixed-price contracts with significant development work include Commercial Crew, Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker and commercialand
 military satellites. The operational and technical complexities of these contracts create financial risk, which could trigger termination provisions,order
 cancellations  or  other  financially  significant  exposure.  Changes  to  cost  and  revenue  estimates  could  result  in  lower  margins  or  materialcharges
 for reach-forward losses. For example, during the second quarter of 2015, higher estimated costs to complete the KC-46A Tanker contractfor the USAF resulted in a reach-forward loss of 
$835 . 81

Table of ContentsRecoverable Costs on Government Contracts
Our
 final incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and review for allowability by the U.S. government, which can result in payment demandsrelated to
 costs they believe should be disallowed. We work with the U.S. government to assess the merits of claims and where appropriate reservefor
 amounts disputed. If we are unable to satisfactorily resolve disputed costs, we could be required to record an earnings charge and/or providerefunds to the U.S. government.
Russia/Ukraine
We
 continue to monitor political unrest involving Russia and Ukraine, where we and some of our suppliers source titanium products and/or haveoperations.
 A number of our commercial customers also have operations in Russia and Ukraine. To date, we have not experienced any significantdisruptions
 to production or deliveries. Should suppliers or customers experience disruption, our production and/or deliveries could be materiallyimpacted.
747 Program
During
 the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a charge of $885 to  recognize a reach-forward loss on the 747 program primarily due to slower thanexpected
 growth  in  global  cargo  markets,  resulting  in  market  and  pricing  pressures  and  fewer  orders  than  anticipated  driving  reductions  in  ourplanned
 production rates. The charge is primarily related to lower anticipated revenues reflecting ongoing pricing and market pressures as well ashigher
 estimated costs due to the reduction in the production rate from 1.0 per month to 0.5 per month in September  2016 .  We currently plan toreturn to a
 rate of 1.0 per month in 2019. We have a number of completed aircraft in inventory as well as unsold production positions and we remainfocused
 on obtaining additional orders and implementing cost-reduction efforts. If we are unable to obtain sufficient orders in 2016 and/or market,production and other risks cannot be mitigated, the program could face a
n additional reach-forward loss that may be material.787 Program
During 2015 the
 787 program continued to have near breakeven gross margins. The combination of production challenges, change incorporation onearly
 build aircraft,  schedule delays, customer  and supplier impacts and changes to price escalation factors has created significant pressure onprogram
 profitability.  If  risks  related  to  this  program,  including  risks  associated  with  planned  production  rate  increases  or  introducing  andmanufacturing
 the  787-10  derivative  as  scheduled  cannot  be  mitigated,  the  program  could  face  additional  customer  claims  and/or  supplierassertions, as well as a reach-forward loss that may be material.

March 31, 2021 . Since inception, ULA has consumed $1,253 of the $1,360 of inventory that was contributed by us and
 has  yet  to  consume $107 .  Under  the  inventory  supply  agreement,  we  have  recorded  revenues  and  cost  of  sales  of $1,367 through December
 31, 2015 .  ULA has made payments of $1,740 to  us under the inventory supply agreement and we have made $71 of indemnificationpayments to ULA.
We agreed to indemnify ULA against potenti
al losses that ULA may incur in the event ULA is unable to obtain certain additional contract pricing fromthe
 USAF for four satellite missions. We believe ULA is entitled to additional contract pricing. In December 2008, ULA submitted a claim to theUSAF
 to re-price the contract value for two satellite missions. In March 2009, the USAF issued a denial of that claim. In June 2009, ULA filed anotice
 of  appeal,  and  in  October  2009,  ULA  filed  a  complaint  before  the  Armed  Services  Board  of  Contract  Appeals  (ASBCA)  for  a  contractadjustment
 for the price of the two satellite missions. In September 2009, the USAF exercised its option for a third satellite mission. During the thirdquarter
 of 2010, ULA submitted a claim to the USAF to re-price the contract value of the third mission. The USAF did not exercise an option for afourth
 mission prior to the expiration of the contract. In March 2011, ULA filed a notice of appeal before the ASBCA, seeking to re-price the thirdmission.
 On November 20, 2013, the ASBCA denied USAF motions for summary judgment against ULA in  large part, leaving ULA ’s claims against the
 USAF substantially intact. The hearing before the ASBCA concluded on December 20, 2013. The parties filed their final post-hearing briefs inMay
 2014.  The  ASBCA  may  now  issue  a  decision  at  any  time.  If  ULA  is  ultimately  unsuccessful  in  obtaining  additional  pricing,  we  may  beresponsible for an
83

Table of Contentsindemnification payment up to 
$261 and may record up to $277 in pre-tax losses associated with the three missions. Potential
 payments for Other Delta contracts include $85 related to deferred support costs and $91 related to deferred production costs. In June2011,
 the  Defense  Contract  Management  Agency  (DCMA)  notified  ULA  that  it  had  determined  that $271 of  deferred  support  costs  are  notrecoverable
 under government contracts. In December 2011, the DCMA notified ULA of the potential non-recoverability of an additional $114 of deferred
 production costs. ULA and Boeing believe that all costs are recoverable and in November 2011, ULA filed a certified claim with the USAFfor
 collection of deferred support and production costs. The USAF issued a final decision denying ULA’s certified claim in May 2012. On June 14,2012,
 Boeing  and  ULA  filed  a  suit  in  the  Court  of  Federal  Claims  seeking  recovery  of  the  deferred  support  and  production  costs  from  the  U.S.government.
 On November 9, 2012, the U.S. government filed an answer to our claim and asserted a counterclaim for credits that it alleges wereoffset
 by deferred support cost invoices. We believe that the U.S. government’s counterclaim is without merit, and have filed an answer challengingit
 on multiple grounds. The litigation is in the discovery phase and the Court has not yet set a trial date. If, contrary to our belief, it is determined thatsome
 or all of the deferred support or production costs are not recoverable, we could be required to record pre-tax losses and make indemnificationpayments to ULA for up to 
$317 of the costs questioned by the DCMA. Other Indemnifications 
In conjunction with our  sales of Electron Dynamic Devices, Inc. and Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power businesses and ourCommercial Airplanes
 facilities in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma, we agreed to indemnify, for an indefinite period, the buyersfor costs
 relating to pre-closing environmental conditions and certain other items. We are unable to assess the potential number of future claims thatmay
 be asserted under these indemnifications, nor the amounts thereof (if any). As a result, we cannot estimate the maximum potential amount offuture
 payments  under  these  indemnities  and  therefore,  no  liability  has  been  recorded.  To  the  extent  that  claims  have  been  made  under  theseindemnities
 and/or are probable and reasonably estimable, liabilities associated with these indemnities are included in the environmental liabilitydisclosure in Note 
11 .Credit
 Guarantees We  have  issued  credit  guarantees,  principally  to  facilitate  the  sale  and/or  financing  of  commercial  aircraft.  Under  thesearrangements,
 we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event that lease or loan payments are not made by the originallessee
 or debtor or certain specified services are not performed. A substantial portion of these guarantees has been extended on behalf of originallessees or
 debtors with less than investment-grade credit. Our commercial aircraft credit guarantees are collateralized by the underlying commercialaircraft and certain other assets. Current outstanding credit guarantees expire with
in the next five years.Industrial Revenue Bonds
Industrial
 Revenue Bonds (IRB) issued by the City of Wichita and St. Louis County were used to finance the purchase and/or construction of realand
 personal property at our Wichita and St. Louis sites. Tax benefits associated with IRBs include a ten-year property tax abatement and a salestax
 exemption from the Kansas Department of Revenue, and a twelve-year property tax abatement and sales tax exemption from St. Louis County.We
 record these properties on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, along with capital lease obligations to repay the proceeds of theIRBs.
 We have also purchased the IRBs and therefore are the bondholders as well as the borrower/lessee of the properties purchased with the IRBproceeds.
The
 capital lease obligations and IRB assets are recorded net in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. As of December  31, 2015 and2014 
, the assets and liabilities associated with the C ity of Wichita and St. Louis County IRBs were $584 and $638 . 84

14 – Postretirement PlansThe
 majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that hadparticipated in defined benefit pe
nsion plans will transition to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016.We fund our major pension plans through trusts. Pension assets are pl
aced in trust solely for the benefit of the plans’ participants, and are structuredto
 maintain liquidity that is sufficient to pay benefit obligations as well as to keep pace over the long-term with the growth of obligations for futurebenefit payments.
We
 also have other postretirement benefits (OPB) other than pensions which consist principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees andqualifying
 dependents, and to a lesser extent, life insurance to certain groups of retirees. Retiree health care is provided principally until age 65 forapproximately
 half those retirees who are eligible for health care coverage. Certain employee groups, including employees covered by most UnitedAuto
 Workers bargaining agreements, are provided lifetime health care coverage. The funded status of the plans is measured as the differencebetween the plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligatio
n (PBO). We have recognized the aggregate of all overfunded plans in Otherassets,
 and the aggregate of all underfunded plans in either Accrued retiree health care or Accrued pension plan liability, net. The portion of theamount by
 which the actuarial present value of benefits included in the PBO exceeds the fair value of plan assets, payable in the next 12 months, isreflected in Accrued liabilities.

72,121  75,622 Fair value of plan assets
56,306  61,082 Assumptions
The
 following assumptions, which are the weighted average for all plans, are used to calculate the benefit obligation at December 31 of each yearand the net periodic benefit cost for the subsequent year.
December 31,
2015  2014  2013 Discount rate:
        Pension
4.20 % 3.90 % 4.80 %Other postretirement benefits
3.80 % 3.50 % 4.20 %Expected return on plan assets
7.00 % 7.00 % 7.50 %Rate of compensation increase
4.00 % 3.80 % 4.00 %The
 discount rate for each plan is determined based on the plans’ expected future benefit payments using a yield curve developed from high qualitybonds that
 are rated as Aa or better by at least half of the four rating agencies utilized as of the measurement date. The yield curve is fitted to yieldsdeveloped
 from bonds at various maturity points. Bonds with the ten percent highest and the ten percent lowest yields are omitted. A portfolio ofabout
 400 bonds is used to construct the yield curve. Since corporate bond yields are generally not available at maturities beyond 30 years, it isassumed that
 spot rates will remain level beyond that 30-year point. The present value of each plan’s benefits is calculated by applying the discountrates to projected benefit cash flows. All bonds are U.S. issues, with a minimum outstand
ing of $50.The pension fund’s expected return on plan assets
 assumption is derived from a review of actual historical returns achieved by the pension trust andanticipated
 future long-term performance of individual asset classes. While consideration is given to recent trust performance and historical returns,the
 assumption represents a long-term, prospective return. The expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic benefit cost for theupcoming
 plan year is determined based on the expected return on plan assets assumption and the market-related value of plan assets (MRVA).Since
 our adoption of the accounting standard for pensions in 1987, we have determined the MRVA based on a five -year moving average of planassets. As of 
December 31, 2015 , the MRVA was approximately $2,731 greater than the fair market value of assets. 89

 rate5.00 % 5.00 % 5.00 %Year that trend reached ultimate rate
2021  2018  2018 Assumed
 health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. To determine the health care costtrend rates we look at a combination of information includi
ng ongoing claims cost monitoring, annual statistical analyses of claims data, reconciliationof
 forecast claims against actual claims, review of trend assumptions of other plan sponsors and national health trends, and adjustments for plandesign
 changes, workforce changes, and changes in plan participant behavior. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trendrates would have the following effect:

Investment Strategy 
The overall  objective of our pension assets is to earn a rate of return over time to satisfy the benefit obligations of the pensionplans
 and to maintain sufficient liquidity to pay benefits and address other cash requirements of the pension fund. Specific investment objectives forour
 long-term  investment  strategy  include  reducing  the  volatility  of  pension  assets  relative  to  pension  liabilities,  achieving  a  competitive  totalinvestment
 return, achieving diversification between and within asset classes and managing other risks. Investment objectives for each asset classare determined based on specific risks and investment op
portunities identified.We
 periodically update our long-term, strategic asset allocations. We use various analytics to determine the optimal asset mix and consider planliability
 characteristics, liquidity characteristics, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. We identify investmentbenchmarks for the asset classes in the strategic asset allocation that are market-based and inv
estable where possible.Actual allocations to
 each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy changes, market value fluctuations, the lengthof
 time it takes to fully implement investment allocation positions, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. Short-term investments andexchange-traded
 derivatives are used to rebalance the actual asset allocation to the target asset allocation. The asset allocation is monitored andrebalanced on a monthly basis.
The actual and target allocations by asset class for the pensi
on assets at December 31 were as follows:

 income  securities  are  invested  primarily  in  a  diversified  portfolio  of  long  duration  instruments.  Global  equity  securities  are  invested  in  adiversified portfolio of U.S. and non-U.S. companies, across various i
ndustries and market capitalizations.Real
 estate and real assets include global private investments that may be held through an investment in a limited partnership (LP) or other fundstructures
 and publicly traded investments (such as Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in the case of real estate). Real estate includes, but isnot
 limited to, investments in office, retail, apartment and industrial properties. Real assets include, but are not limited to, investments in naturalresources
 (such  as  energy,  farmland  and  timber),  commodities  and  infrastructure.  Private  equity  investment  vehicles  are  primarily  limitedpartnerships (LPs) and fund-of-funds that mainly invest in U.S. and non-U.S. levera
ged buyout, venture capital and special situation strategies.Hedge
 fund investments  seek to capitalize on inefficiencies  identified across and within different  asset classes or markets.  Hedge fund strategytypes include, but are not limited to directional, event driven, relativ
e value, long-short and multi-strategy.Investment
 managers are retained for explicit investment  roles specified by contractual  investment  guidelines. Certain investment  managers areauthorized
 to use derivatives, such as equity or bond futures, swaps, options and currency futures or forwards. Derivatives are used to achieve thedesired
 market  exposure  of  a  security  or  an  index,  transfer  value-added  performance  between  asset  classes,  achieve  the  desired  currencyexposure, adjust portfolio duration or rebalanc
e the total portfolio to the target asset allocation.As
 a percentage of total pension plan assets, derivative net notional amounts were 13.1% and 3.5% for  fixed income, including to-be-announcedmortgage-backed securities and treasury forwards, and 
4.0% and 2.0% for global equity and commodities at December 31, 2015 and 2014 . Risk
 Management In  managing  the  plan  assets,  we  review  and  manage  risk  associated  with  funded  status  risk,  interest  rate  risk,  market  risk,counterparty
 risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. Liability matching and asset class diversification are central to our risk management approachand
 are  integral  to  the  overall  investment  strategy.  Further,  asset  classes  are  constructed  to  achieve  diversification  by  investment  strategy,  byinvestment manager, by industry or
 sector and by holding. Investment manager guidelines for publicly traded assets are specified and are monitoredregularly
 through  the  custodian.  Credit  parameters  for  counterparties  have  been  established  for  managers  permitted  to  trade  over-the-counterderivatives.
 Valuation  is  governed  through  several  types  of  procedures,  including  reviews  of  manager  valuation  policies,  custodian  valuationprocesses, pricing vendor practices, pricing reconcil
iation, and periodic, security-specific valuation testing . Fair Value Measurements 
The  following table presents our plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of December 31,  2015 and 2014 . The fair value
 hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based onquoted
 prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and Level 3includes
 fair  values  estimated  using  significant  unobservable  inputs.  We  have  retrospectively  adopted  ASU  No.  2015-07, Disclosures  forInvestments
 in Certain Entities that calculate Net Asset Value Per Share .  The fair value hierarchy now excludes certain investments which arevalued using Net Asset Value (NAVs) as a practica
l expedient.91

 income  securities  are  primarily  valued  upon  a  market  approach,  using  matrix  pricing  and  considering  a  security’s  relationship  to  othersecurities
 for which quoted prices in an active market may be available, or an income approach, converting future cash flows to a single presentvalue amount. Inputs used in developi
ng fair value estimates include reported trades, broker quotes, benchmark yields, and base spreads.Common/collective/pooled
 funds are typically common or collective trusts valued at their NAVs that are calculated by the investment manager orsponsor
 of the fund and have daily or monthly liquidity. Derivatives included in the table above are over-the-counter and are primarily valued usingan
 income approach with inputs that include benchmark yields, swap curves, cash flow analysis, rating agency data and interdealer broker rates.Exchang
e-traded derivative positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflectedin the payables and receivabl
es portion of the table.Cash
 equivalents and other short-term investments (which are used to pay benefits) are held in a separate account which consists of a commingledfund
 (with daily liquidity) and separately held short-term securities and cash equivalents. All of the investments in this cash vehicle are valued dailyusing
 a  market  approach  with  inputs  that  include  quoted  market  prices  for  similar  instruments.  In  the  event  a  market  price  is  not  available  forinstruments
 with  an  original  maturity  of  one  year  or  less,  amortized  cost  is  used  as  a  proxy  for  fair  value.  Common  and  preferred  stock  equitysecurities are primarily valued using a market approach b
ased on the quoted market prices of identical instruments.Private
 equity  and  private  debt  NAV  valuations  are  based  on  the  valuation  of  the  underlying  investments,  which  include  inputs  such  as  cost,operating
 results, discounted future cash flows and market based comparable data. For those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis(primarily LPs) we use NAVs, adjusted for subsequent cash flows a
nd significant events.Real
 estate and real asset NAV valuations are based on valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, discountedfuture
 cash  flows,  independent  appraisals  and  market  based  comparable  data.  For  those  investments  reported  on  a  one-quarter  lagged  basis(primarily
 LPs) NAVs are adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events. Publicly traded REITs and infrastructure stocks are valuedusing
 a market approach based on quoted market prices of identical instruments. Exchange-traded commodities futures positions are reported inaccordance with changes in dai
ly variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table.Hedge
 funds  consist  of  direct  hedge  funds  and  fund-of-fund  limited  liability  company  (LLC)  structures.  For  direct  hedge  funds  the  NAVs  aregenerally based on
 valuation of the underlying investments. This is primarily done by applying a market or income valuation methodology dependingon
 the specific type of security or instrument held. The NAVs of the fund-of-funds are based on the NAVs of the underlying hedge funds as well asany
 cash  and accruals  held at  the fund-of-fund  level. Redemptions  in hedge funds  are based on specific  terms  and conditions  of  the individualfunds.
Investments
 in private equity, private debt, real estate, real assets, and hedge funds are primarily calculated and reported by the General Partner(GP),
 fund manager or third party administrator. Additionally, some investments in fixed income and equity are made via commingled vehicles andare
 valued in a similar fashion. Pension assets invested in commingled and limited partnership structures rely on the NAV of these investments asthe practical expedient for the valuations.

Certain

 the plans are terminated within five years thereafter, the assets in the plan first will be used to provide the level of retirement benefits requiredby 
ERISA ,  and then any surplus will be used to fund a trust to continue present and future payments under the postretirement medical and lifeinsurance benefits in our group insuranc
e benefit programs.We
 have an agreement with the U.S. government with respect to certain pension plans. Under the agreement, should we terminate any of the plansunder conditio
ns in which the plan’s assets exceed that plan’s obligations, the U.S. government will be entitled to a fair allocation of any of the plan’sassets based on plan contributions that were reimburse
d under U.S. government contracts.Defined Contribution Plans
We
 provide certain defined contribution plans to all eligible employees. The principal plans are the Company-sponsored 401(k) plans. The expensefor these defined contribution plans was 
$768 , $764 and $742 in 2015, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Note 
15 – Share-Based Compensation and Other Compensation ArrangementsShare-Based Compensation
Our
 2003 Incentive Stock Plan, as amended and restated, permits awards of incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights,restricted
 stock or units, performance shares, performance restricted stock or units, performance units and other stock and cash-based awards toour
 employees, officers, directors, consultants, and independent contractors. The aggregate number of shares of our stock authorized for issuanceunder the plan is 
87,000,000 . Shares
 issued as a result of stock option exercises or conversion of stock unit awards will be funded out of treasury shares, except to the extentthere
 are insufficient treasury shares, in which case new shares will be issued. We believe we currently have adequate treasury shares to satisfythese issuances during 
2016 . 95

, $87 and $89 , respectively.The
 stock options granted in February 2013 had a fair value of $15.85 which  was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with thefollowing assumptions: expected life of 
6 years , expected volatility of 29.0% based upon our historical stock volatility, risk-free interest rates of 1.0% , and expected dividend yield of 
2.6% . The
 expected volatility of the stock options is based on a combination of our historical stock volatility and the volatility levels implied on the grantdate
 by  actively  traded  option  contracts  on  our  common  stock.  We  determined  the  expected  term  of  the  stock  option  grants  to  be  six  years,calculated using the “simplified”
96

Table of Contentsmethod
 in  accordance  with  the  SEC  Staff  Accounting  Bulletin  110.  We  use  the  “simplified”  method  since  we  changed  the  vesting  terms,  taxtreatment
 and  the  recipients  of  our  stock  options  beginning  in  2006  such  that  we  believe  our  historical  data  prior  to  2006  does  not  provide  areasonable
 basis upon which to estimate expected term and we do not have enough option exercise data from our grants issued subsequent to2006 to support our own estimate as a result of vesting terms and changes in the stock price.
Restricted Stock Units
In February  
2015, 2014 and 2013 , we granted to our executives 590,778 , 695,651 and 1,375,414 restricted stock units (RSUs) as  part of our long-term incentive program with grant date fair
 values of $154.64 , $129.58 and $75.97 per unit, respectively. The RSUs granted under this program will vest and
 settle in common stock (on a one-for-one basis) on the third anniversary of the grant date. If an executive terminates employment becauseof
 retirement, involuntary layoff, disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary) will receive a proration of stock units based on active employmentduring
 the three-year service period. In all other cases, the RSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate. In addition to RSUsawarded
 under our long-term incentive program, we grant RSUs to certain executives and employees to encourage retention or to reward variousachievements.
 These RSUs are labeled other RSUs in the table below. The fair values of all RSUs are estimated using the average of the high andlow stock prices on the date of grant.
RSU activity for the year ended

Performance-
Based Restricted Stock Units (PBRSUs) are stock units that pay out based on the Company’s total shareholder return as compared toa
 group of peer companies over a three-year period. The award payout can range from 0% to 200% of  the initial PBRSU grant, but will not exceed400% 
of  the initial value (excluding dividend equivalent credits). The PBRSUs granted under this program will vest at the payout amount and settlein
 common stock (on a one-for-one basis) on the third anniversary of the grant date. If an executive terminates employment because of retirement,involuntary
 layoff,  disability,  or death,  the  employee (or  beneficiary)  remains  eligible under the  award and, if the  award is earned,  will receive  aproration
 of stock units based on active employment during the three-year service period. In all other cases, the PBRSUs will not vest and all rightsto the stock units will terminate.

Performance Awards
Performance
 Awards are cash units that pay out based on the achievement of long-term financial goals at the end of a three-year period. Each unithas
 an initial value of $100 dollars.  The amount payable at the end of the three-year performance period may be anywhere from $0 to $200 dollars per
 unit, depending on the Company’s performance against plan for a three-year period. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to paythese
 awards in cash, stock, or a combination of both after the three-year performance period. Compensation expense, based on the estimatedperformance payout, is recognized ratably over the performance period.
During 
2015,  2014 and 2013 ,  we granted Performance Awards to our executives with the payout based on the achievement of financial goals foreach 
three -year  period following the grant date. The minimum payout amount is $0 and the maximum amount we could be required to pay out forthe 
2015, 2014 and 2013 Performance  Awards is $349 , $327 and $255 ,  respectively. The 2013 grant  is expected to be paid out in cash in March 2016 
. Deferred Compensation
The
 Company has a deferred compensation plan which permits executives to defer receipt of a portion of their salary, bonus, and certain otherincentive awards. Participants can diversify deferred compe

 contracts  to  manage  currency  risk  associated  with  certain  transactions,  specifically  forecasted  sales  and  purchases  made  in  foreigncurrencies.
 Our foreign currency contracts hedge forecasted transactions through 2021 .  We use commodity derivatives, such as swaps and fixed-price
 purchase commitments to hedge against potentially unfavorable price changes for items used in production. Our commodity contracts hedgeforecasted transactions through 
2020 . Fair Value Hedges
Interest

 market funds, available-for-sale debt investments and equity securities are valued using a market approach based on the quoted marketprices or broker/dealer quotes of identical or comparable i
nstruments.Derivatives
 include foreign  currency,  commodity  and interest  rate  contracts.  Our  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  are valued using an incomeapproach
 based on the present value of the forward rate less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valuedusing
 an income approach based on the present value of the commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Thefair value of our interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analys
is based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve.Certain
 assets  have  been  measured  at  fair  value  on  a  nonrecurring  basis  using  significant  unobservable  inputs  (Level  3).  The  following  tablepresents
 the nonrecurring losses recognized for the years ended December 31 due to long-lived asset impairment, and the fair value and assetclassification of the related assets as of the impairment date:

$278  ($165 )  $206  ($202 ) The
 fair value of the impaired operating lease equipment is derived by calculating a median collateral value from a consistent group of third partyaircraft
 value publications. The values provided by the third party aircraft publications are derived from their knowledge of market trades and othermarket
 factors. Management reviews the publications quarterly to assess the continued appropriateness and consistency with market trends. Undercertain
 circumstances, we adjust values based on the attributes and condition of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or useof the
 aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by third party publications, or on the expected net sales price for theaircraft.
 Property, plant and equipment, Other assets and Acquired intangible assets were primarily valued using an income approach based on thediscounted cash flows associated with the u
nderlying assets.For Level 3 assets that were measure
d at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the year ended December 31, 2015 , the following table presents the fair value of those assets as of the measurement date, valuation techniques a

 The range represents the sum of the highest and lowest values for all aircraft subject to fair value measurement, according to the third partyaircraft valuation publications that we use in o

 to other financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of our indemnifications and financingcommitments

20 – Legal ProceedingsVarious
 legal  proceedings,  claims  and  investigations  related  to  products,  contracts,  employment  and  other  matters  are  pending  against  us.Potentially material contingenci
es are discussed below.We
 are subject to various U.S. government inquiries and investigations, from which civil, criminal or administrative proceedings could result or haveresulted
 in the past. Such proceedings involve or could involve claims by the government for fines, penalties, compensatory and treble damages,restitution and/or forfeitures. Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divis
ions or104

ions, can also be suspended or debarred from government contracts, or lose its export privileges, based on the results of investigations. Webelieve,
 based upon current information, that the outcome of any such government disputes and investigations will not have a material effect on ourfinancial
 position, results of operations, or cash flows. Where it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses in excess of recorded amounts inconnection
 with any of the matters set forth below, we will disclose either the amount or range of reasonably possible losses in excess of suchamounts or, where no such amount or range can be reasonably estimate
d, the reasons why no such estimate can be made.Employment, Labor and Benefits Litigation
In
 the second quarter of 2014, Boeing agreed to a $90 settlement with plaintiffs in the Harkness case with respect to litigation initiated by formerBoeing
 employees in 2007 upon the sale of the Wichita facility to Spirit AeroSystems, Inc. (Spirit) in 2005. The settlement was approved by thedistrict
 court in a fairness hearing in September 2015. The payment was made in the fourth quarter and the indemnification receivable from Spirit isincluded in Other Assets at December 31, 2015.
On October 13, 2006,
 we were named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. Plaintiffs, seekingto
 represent a class of similarly situated participants and beneficiaries in The Boeing Company Voluntary Investment Plan (the VIP), alleged thatfees
 and expenses incurred by the VIP were and are unreasonable and excessive, not incurred solely for the benefit of the VIP and its participants,and were
 undisclosed to participants. The plaintiffs further alleged that defendants breached their fiduciary duties in violation of §502(a)(2) of ERISA ,
 and sought injunctive and equitable relief pursuant to §502(a)(3) of ERISA .  The parties reached a provisional settlement on August 26, 2015,subject to a fairness hearing cur
rently scheduled for March 2016. We do not expect this matter or the associated settlement to have a material effecton our financial position, results of operations or cash flo

BLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
The Boeing Company
Chicago, Illinois
We
 have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December  31, 2015 , based
 on  criteria  established  in Internal  Control  –  Integrated  Framework  (2013) issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  theTreadway
 Commission.  The  Company’s  management  is  responsible  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  for  itsassessment
 of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal ControlOver Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an o
pinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We
 conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standardsrequire
 that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  wasmaintained
 in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk thata
 material  weakness  exists,  testing  and  evaluating  the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control  based  on  the  assessed  risk,  andperforming
 such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for ouropinion.
A
 company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive andprincipal
 financial  officers,  or  persons  performing  similar  functions,  and  effected  by  the  company’s  board  of  directors,  management,  and  otherpersonnel
 to provide reasonable assurance  regarding  the reliability  of financial reporting  and the preparation  of financial statements  for  externalpurposes
 in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policiesand
 procedures  that  (1)  pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the  transactions  anddispositions
 of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation offinancial
 statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  company  are  beingmade
 only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of  the  company;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regardingprevention
 or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use,  or  disposition  of  the  company’s  assets  that  could  have  a  material  effect  on  thefinancial statements.
Because
 of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management overrideof
 controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation ofthe
 effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequatebecause of changes in conditio
ns, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In
 our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December  31, 2015 , based on the
 criteria established in Internal Control –  Integrated Framework (2013) issued  by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the TreadwayCommission.
We
 have  also  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States),  the  consolidatedfinancial
 statements  as  of  and  for  the  year  ended December  31, 2015 of  the  Company  and  our  report  dated February  10, 2016 expressed  anunqualified opinion on those 
financial statements./s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP

(As Amended and Restated as of January 1, 2016)
SECTION 1. PURPOSE OF THE PLAN
The

 to 2008, the plan provided two separate benefits to participants, the Supplemental Benefit and the Excess Benefit. The purposeof
 the Supplemental Benefit is to provide retirement benefits to supplement the benefits provided by the Pension Value Plan, for aselect
 group of management or highly compensated employees of The Boeing Company and its Affiliates or Subsidiaries who areparticipant
s in the Pension Value Plan. The purpose of the Excess Benefit component is to provide restoration and excess benefits toeligible
 employees of The Boeing Company and its Affiliates or Subsidiaries who are participants in the Pension Value Plan.Effective
 January 1, 2008, for ease of communications with participants, the plan was restated to merge both components into asingle SERP Benefit. This change was not intended to have a substantive impact on participant benefits.
The
 adoption of the Plan is not intended to result in any duplication of benefits by awarding additional benefits for any period ofservice
 with the Company for which the participant is otherwise entitled to benefits under another non-qualified plan. TheCommittee
 will have sole and absolute discretion in determining whether an adjustment in benefits under this Plan is necessary toprevent a prohibited duplication of benefits.
The
 Plan was restated effective January 1, 2008 to comply with section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.The
 Plan was restated effective January 1, 2009 to make additional clarifying changes. The Plan was restated effective as of May 1,2013
 to make Designated Domestic Partners and same sex Spouses eligible for pre-commencement survivor benefits and optionalforms of benefit with a survivor annuity under the Plan. These Designate
d Domestic Partner benefits will be available to Participantswhose Commencement Date (or pre-commencement death) occurs on or after May 1, 2013 and before January 1, 2017.
Notwithstanding
 any provision in the Plan to the contrary, effective December 31, 2015, benefits will cease to accrue under thePension Value
 Plan (other than the allocation of Interest Credits to the extent required under Section 4.2 of the Pension Value Plan).To
 reflect this change, benefits will cease to accrue under this Plan as of December 31, 2015 (other than as attributable to suchInterest Credits).

redited with additional PBRSUs (“dividend equivalent PBRSUs”) equal in number to the number ofshares of Boeing stock that could b
e bought with the cash dividends that would be paid on the PBRSUs in your account if each PBRSU were a share ofBoeing stock. The number of PBRSUs that results fro

ed, as necessary, so that the total dividend equivalent PRBSUs which vest as of the Vesting Date will equal the dividend equivalentPBRSUs which accumulate during the Measure
ment Period multiplied by the payout percentage level.5.
