Item 7.01.Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
On February 7, 2023, Jamie Iannone, Chief Executive Officer of eBay Inc. (“eBay”), shared the following message with eBay employees:
  
Team,
 
Over the past few months, we’ve taken a thoughtful look at where we are as a company with considerations of the macroeconomic situation around the world
and how to best invest and operate so that we can continue to be successful. To create long-term, sustainable growth for eBay, we need to evolve our
organization as we take the next step in our strategy — focused on driving growth, building a trusted marketplace, empowering enthusiasts and seeding new
technologies for the future.
 
As a result of these considerations and our future-forward plans, I have some hard news to share. Over the next 24 hours, we’ll be letting approximately 500
employees globally know that their jobs will be eliminated. This number represents about 4% of our total employee base. In some locations, the notifications
are proposals subject to consultation as required by applicable law.
 
There is no easy way to communicate this — but I do want to share with you why we are making this decision, and where we’re headed next.
 
Today’s actions are designed to strengthen our ability to deliver better end-to-end experiences for our customers and to support more innovation and scale
across our platform. They also help us make sure we’re concentrating on where we can make the biggest impact, including expanding Focus Categories,
creating trusted experiences and investing in new technologies.
 
Importantly, this shift gives us additional space to invest and create new roles in high-potential areas — new technologies, customer innovations and key
markets — and to continue to adapt and flex with the changing macro, ecommerce and technology landscape. We’re also simplifying our structure to make
decisions more effectively and with more speed.
 
On a more personal note, I want to acknowledge that while these actions will move our business forward, they also affect our colleagues. For those directly
impacted by these changes, I know this news is particularly difficult. Thank you for your incredible talent, passion, and achievements to help get us to where
we are today. I’m so grateful for the impact that you made at eBay. We want to support you as you navigate the transition including providing comprehensive
transition packages with severance and employee incentive payments.
 
While today’s actions are not easy, I know this team will come together to support each other as eBayers always do. The dedication and commitment that you
all bring every day on behalf of our customers — and each other — inspires me every day. I look forward to the opportunities for growth and innovation in our
future.
 
Jamie
