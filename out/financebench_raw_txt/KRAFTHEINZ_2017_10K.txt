forward-looking statement in this report, except as required by applicable law or regulation.
PART I
Item 1. Business.
General
Kraft Heinz is one of the largest food and beverage companies in the world, with sales in approximately 190 countries and territories. We manufacture and
market food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee, and other grocery
products, throughout the world, under a host of iconic brands including Heinz, Kraft, Oscar Mayer, Philadelphia, Velveeta, Lunchables, Planters, Maxwell
House, Capri Sun, Ore-Ida, Kool-Aid, Jell-O. A globally recognized producer of delicious foods, we provide products for all occasions whether at home, in
restaurants or on the go. As of December 30, 2017, we had assets of $120.2 billion. Our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market
(“NASDAQ”) under the ticker symbol “KHC”.
On July 2, 2015 (the “2015 Merger Date”), through a series of transactions, we consummated the merger of Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (“Kraft”) with and into a
wholly-owned subsidiary of H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation (“Heinz”) (the “2015 Merger”). At the closing of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was renamed The
Kraft Heinz Company and H. J. Heinz Company changed its name to Kraft Heinz Foods Company. While we were organized as a Delaware corporation in
2013 (as Heinz), both Kraft and Heinz each had been pioneers in the food industry for over 100 years.
Before the consummation of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was controlled by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ("Berkshire Hathaway") and 3G Global Food Holdings, L.P.
(“3G Capital”) (together, the "Sponsors"), following their acquisition of H. J. Heinz Company (the “2013 Merger”).
See Note 1, Background and Basis of Presentation, and Note 2, Merger and Acquisition, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on
the 2015 Merger.
Reportable Segments
We manage and report our operating results through four segments. We have three reportable segments defined by geographic region: United States, Canada,
and Europe. Our remaining businesses are combined and disclosed as “Rest of World”. Rest of World is comprised of two operating segments: Latin
America; and Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa (“AMEA”).
In the third quarter of 2017, we announced our plans to reorganize certain of our international businesses to better align our global geographies. These plans
include moving our Middle East and Africa businesses from the AMEA segment into the Europe segment, forming the Europe, Middle East, and Africa
(“EMEA”) segment. The remaining AMEA businesses will become the Asia Pacific (“APAC”) segment, which will remain in Rest of World. We expect these
changes to become effective in the first quarter of 2018. As a result, we expect to restate our Europe and Rest of World segments to reflect these changes for
historical periods presented in the first quarter of 2018.
See Note 19, Segment Reporting, to the consolidated financial statements for our geographic financial information by segment.
Net Sales by Product Category
In the first quarter of 2017, we reorganized the products within our product categories to reflect how we manage our business. We have reflected this change
for all historical periods presented. The product categories that contributed 10% or more to consolidated net sales in any of the periods presented were:
 December 30,
2017
(52 weeks)  December 31,
2016
(52 weeks)  January 3,
2016
(53 weeks)
Condiments and sauces 25% 24% 32%
Cheese and dairy 21% 21% 15%
Ambient meals 9% 9% 10%
Frozen and chilled meals 10% 10% 12%
Meats and seafood 10% 10% 8%
We completed the 2015 Merger on July 2, 2015. As a result, 2016 was the first full year of combined Kraft and Heinz results, while 2015 included a full year
of Heinz results and post-2015 Merger results of Kraft. The year-over-year fluctuations in the percentages between 2015 and 2016 are primarily driven by
including Kraft’s results.
1
Sales and Customers
Our products are sold through our own sales organizations and through independent brokers, agents and distributors to chain, wholesale, cooperative and
independent grocery accounts, convenience stores, drug stores, value stores, bakeries, pharmacies, mass merchants, club stores, foodservice distributors and
institutions, including hotels, restaurants, hospitals, health care facilities, and certain government agencies. Our products are also sold online through various
e-commerce platforms and retailers. Our largest customer, Walmart Inc., represented approximately 21% of our net sales in 2017, approximately 22% of our
net sales in 2016, and approximately 20% of our net sales in 2015.
Additionally, we have significant customers in different regions around the world; however, none of these customers individually are material to our
consolidated business. In 2017, the five largest customers in our United States segment accounted for approximately 48% of United States segment net sales,
the five largest customers in our Canada segment accounted for approximately 72% of Canada segment net sales, and the five largest customers in our Europe
segment accounted for approximately 31% of our Europe segment net sales.
Raw Materials and Packaging
We manufacture (and contract for the manufacture of) our products from a wide variety of raw food materials. We purchase and use large quantities of
commodities, including dairy products, meat products, coffee beans, nuts, tomatoes, potatoes, soybean and vegetable oils, sugar and other sweeteners, corn
products, wheat and other goods to manufacture our products. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of resins and cardboard to package our
products and natural gas to operate our facilities. For commodities that we use across many of our product categories, such as corrugated paper and energy,
we coordinate sourcing requirements and centralize procurement to leverage our scale. In addition, some of our product lines and brands separately source
raw materials that are specific to their operations. We source these commodities from a variety of providers including large, international producers, and
smaller, local, independent sellers. Where appropriate, we seek to establish preferred purchaser status and/or have developed strategic partnerships with many
of our suppliers with the objective of achieving favorable pricing and dependable supply for many of our commodities. The prices of raw materials and
agricultural materials that we use in our products are affected by external factors, such as global competition for resources, currency fluctuations, severe
weather or global climate change, consumer, industrial or investment demand, and changes in governmental regulation and trade, alternative energy, and
agricultural programs.
Our procurement teams monitor worldwide supply and cost trends so we can obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production at competitive prices.
Although the prices of our principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate, we believe there will be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and
that they are generally available from numerous sources. We use a range of hedging techniques in an effort to limit the impact of price fluctuations on many
of our principal raw materials. However, we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from
increases in specific raw material costs. We actively monitor changes to commodity costs so that we can seek to mitigate the effect through pricing and other
operational measures.
Competition
Our products are sold in highly competitive marketplaces, which have experienced increased concentration and the growing presence of e-commerce retailers,
large-format retailers, and discounters. Competitors include large national and international food and beverage companies and numerous local and regional
companies. We compete with both branded and generic products, in addition to retailer brands, wholesalers, and cooperatives. We compete primarily on the
basis of product quality and innovation, brand recognition and loyalty, service, the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences, the introduction of
new products and the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and marketing programs, distribution, shelf space, merchandising support, and price.
Improving our market position or introducing new products requires substantial advertising and promotional expenditures.
2
Trademarks and Intellectual Property
Our trademarks are material to our business and are among our most valuable assets. Depending on the country, trademarks generally remain valid for as long
as they are in use or their registration status is maintained. Trademark registrations generally are for renewable, fixed terms. Significant trademarks by
segment based on net sales in 2017 were:
  Majority Owned and Licensed Trademarks
United States  Kraft, Oscar Mayer, Heinz, Philadelphia, Lunchables, Velveeta, Planters, Maxwell House, Capri Sun*, Ore-Ida, Kool-Aid, Jell-O
Canada  Kraft, Heinz, Philadelphia, Cracker Barrel, P’Tit Cheese, Maxwell House, Tassimo*, Classico
Europe  Heinz, Plasmon, Pudliszki, Honig, HP, Benedicta
Rest of World  Heinz, ABC, Master, Quero, Golden Circle, Kraft, Wattie's, Glucon D, Complan
*Used under license
We sell some products under brands we license from third parties, including Capri Sun packaged drink pouches for sale in the United States, TGI Fridays
frozen snacks and appetizers in the United States and Canada, McCafe ground, whole bean, and on-demand single cup coffees in the United States and
Canada, and Taco Bell Home Originals Mexican-style food products in U.S. grocery stores. In our agreements with Mondelēz International, Inc. (“Mondelēz
International”), we each granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in named jurisdictions for
certain periods of time following the spin-off of Kraft from Mondelēz International in 2012.
We own numerous patents worldwide. We consider our portfolio of patents, patent applications, patent licenses under patents owned by third parties,
proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes, and related intellectual property rights to be material to our operations. Patents, issued or applied
for, cover inventions ranging from basic packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves. While our patent
portfolio is material to our business, the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business.
Our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of the patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various
countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of
patent, the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability of legal remedies in the country.
Research and Development
Our research and development focuses on achieving the following four objectives:
•growth through product improvements and renovation, innovation, and line extensions,
•uncompromising product safety and quality,
•superior customer satisfaction, and
•cost reduction.
Research and development expense was approximately $93 million in 2017, $120 million in 2016, and $105 million in 2015.
Seasonality
Although crops constituting some of our raw food ingredients are harvested on a seasonal basis, most of our products are produced throughout the year.
Seasonal factors inherent in our business change the demand for products, including holidays, changes in seasons, or other annual events. These factors
influence our quarterly sales, operating income, and cash flows.
Employees
We had approximately 39,000 employees as of December 30, 2017.
3
Regulation
The manufacture and sale of consumer food and beverage products is highly regulated. Our business operations, including the production, transportation,
storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, quality and safety of our products and their ingredients, occupational safety and health
practices, are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States, as well as laws and
regulations administered by government entities and agencies outside the United States in markets in which our products are manufactured, distributed or
sold. In the U.S., our activities are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, U.S.
Department of Agriculture, Federal Trade Commission, Department of Labor, Department of Commerce and Environmental Protection Agency, as well as
various state and local agencies. We are also subject to numerous similar and other laws and regulations outside of North America, including but not limited
to laws and regulations governing food safety, health and safety, anti-corruption, and data privacy. In our business dealings, we are also required to comply
with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act, the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act, and various other anti-
corruption regulations in the regions in which we operate. We rely on legal and operational compliance programs, as well as in-house and outside counsel, to
guide our businesses in complying with applicable laws and regulations of the countries in which we do business.
Environmental Regulation
Our activities throughout the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight. Various laws concerning the handling, storage, and disposal of
hazardous materials and the operation of facilities in environmentally sensitive locations may impact aspects of our operations.
In the United States, where a significant portion of our business operates, these laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). CERCLA
imposes joint and several liability on each potentially responsible party. We are involved in a number of active proceedings in the United States under
CERCLA (and other similar state actions and legislation) related to our current operations and certain closed, inactive, or divested operations for which we
retain liability. We do not currently expect these to have a material effect on our earnings or financial condition.
As of December 30, 2017, we had accrued an amount we deemed appropriate for environmental remediation. Based on information currently available, we
believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will
not have a material effect on our earnings or financial condition. However, it is difficult to predict with certainty the potential impact of future compliance
efforts and environmental remedial actions and thus, future costs associated with such matters may exceed current reserves.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.
We operate in a highly competitive industry.
The food and beverage industry is highly competitive across all of our product offerings. We compete based on product innovation, price, product quality,
nutritional value, service, taste, convenience, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing and distribution, promotional activity, and the ability
to identify and satisfy consumer preferences.
We may need to reduce our prices in response to competitive and customer pressures. These pressures may also restrict our ability to increase prices in
response to commodity and other cost increases. Failure to effectively assess, timely change and set proper pricing or trade incentives may negatively impact
the achievement of our objectives.
The rapid emergence of new distribution channels, particularly e-commerce, may create consumer price deflation, affecting our retail customer relationships
and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases. We may also need to increase or reallocate
spending on marketing, retail trade incentives, materials, advertising, and new product innovation to maintain or increase market share. These expenditures
are subject to risks, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts. If we are unable to compete effectively, our profitability,
financial condition, and operating results may suffer.
Changes in the retail landscape or the loss of key retail customers could adversely affect our financial performance.
Retail customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs, and food distributors in our major markets, may continue to consolidate, resulting in fewer but
larger customers for our business across various channels. Consolidation also produces larger retail customers that may seek to leverage their position to
improve their profitability by demanding improved efficiency, lower pricing, more favorable terms, increased promotional programs, or specifically tailored
product offerings. In addition, larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and
market their own retailer brands. Retail consolidation and increasing retailer power could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial
condition, and operating results.
Retail consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers’ business operations or financial performance may have a corresponding
material and adverse effect on us. For example, if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing, then they may delay, decrease, or cancel
purchases of our products, or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition,
and operating results.
In addition, technology-based systems, which give consumers the ability to shop through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, are also
significantly altering the retail landscape in many of our markets. If we are unable to adjust to developments in these changing landscapes, we may be
disadvantaged in key channels and with certain consumers, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating
results.
Maintaining, extending, and expanding our reputation and brand image are essential to our business success.
We have many iconic brands with long-standing consumer recognition across the globe. Our success depends on our ability to maintain brand image for our
existing products, extend our brands to new platforms, and expand our brand image with new product offerings.
We seek to maintain, extend, and expand our brand image through marketing investments, including advertising and consumer promotions, and product
innovation. Negative perceptions on the role of food and beverage marketing could adversely affect our brand image or lead to stricter regulations and
scrutiny of marketing practices. Existing or increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our advertising, consumer promotions, and marketing, or our response
to those restrictions, could limit our efforts to maintain, extend, and expand our brands. Moreover, adverse publicity about legal or regulatory action against
us, our quality and safety, our environmental or social impacts, or our suppliers and, in some cases, our competitors, could damage our reputation and brand
image, undermine our customers’ confidence, and reduce demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our
operations.
In addition, our success in maintaining, extending, and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment.
We increasingly rely on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns. The growing use of social and digital media increases the speed and
extent that information, including misinformation, and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands or our products, or our
suppliers and, in some cases, our competitors, on social or digital media, whether or not valid, could seriously damage our brands and reputation. In addition,
we might fail to anticipate consumer preferences, invest sufficiently in maintaining, extending, and expanding our brand image. If we do not maintain, extend,
and expand our reputation or brand image, then our product sales, financial condition, and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.
6
Our international operations subject us to additional risks and costs and may cause our profitability to decline.
We are a global company with sales in approximately 190 countries and territories; approximately 30% of our 2017 net sales were generated outside of the
United States. As a result, we are subject to risks inherent in global operations. These risks, which can vary substantially by market, are described in many of
the risk factors discussed in this section and also include:
•compliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the United States, including anti-bribery laws such as the FCPA;
•changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in
tax laws or their interpretation, or tax audit implications;
•the imposition of increased or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers or similar restrictions on our sales or regulations, taxes or policies that might
negatively affect our sales;
•currency devaluations or fluctuations in currency values;
•compliance with antitrust and competition laws, data privacy laws, and a variety of other local, national and multi-national regulations and laws in
multiple jurisdictions;
•discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies in or across foreign jurisdictions;
•changes in capital controls, including currency exchange controls, government currency policies or other limits on our ability to import raw materials
or finished product into various countries or repatriate cash from outside the United States;
•challenges associated with cross-border product distribution;
•changes in local regulations and laws, the uncertainty of enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions, and foreign ownership restrictions and the
potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources;
•risks and costs associated with political and economic instability, corruption, anti-American sentiment and social and ethnic unrest in the countries in
which we operate;
•the risks of operating in developing or emerging markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation, application and
enforceability of laws and regulations and the enforceability of contract rights and intellectual property rights;
•risks arising from the significant and rapid fluctuations in currency exchange markets and the decisions and positions that we take to hedge such
volatility;
•changing labor conditions and difficulties in staffing our operations;
•greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles; and
•design, implementation and use of effective control environment processes across our diverse operations and employee base.
In addition, political and economic changes or volatility, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, public
corruption, expropriation and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand.
Slow economic growth or high unemployment in the markets in which we operate could constrain consumer spending, and declining consumer purchasing
power could adversely impact our profitability. All of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased sales, and could materially and adversely
affect our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations.
We must leverage our brand value to compete against retailer brands and other economy brands.
In nearly all of our product categories, we compete with branded products as well as retailer and other economy brands, which are typically sold at lower
prices. Our products must provide higher value and/or quality to our consumers than alternatives, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty.
Consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value and/or quality between our products and retailer or other economy brands change in
favor of competitors’ products or if consumers perceive this type of change. If consumers prefer retailer or other economy brands, then we could lose market
share or sales volumes or shift our product mix to lower margin offerings. A change in consumer preferences could also cause us to increase capital,
marketing, and other expenditures, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.
7
Our financial success depends on our ability to correctly predict, identify, and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand, to offer new
products to meet those changes, and to respond to competitive innovation.
Consumer preferences for food and beverage products change continually. Our success depends on our ability to predict, identify, and interpret the tastes and
dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to consumer preferences, including with respect to health and wellness. If we do not offer
products that appeal to consumers, our sales and market share will decrease, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial
condition, and operating results.
We must distinguish between short-term fads, mid-term trends, and long-term changes in consumer preferences. If we do not accurately predict which shifts
in consumer preferences will be long-term, or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences, our sales could decline. In
addition, because of our varied consumer base, we must offer an array of products that satisfy a broad spectrum of consumer preferences. If we fail to expand
our product offerings successfully across product categories, or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster growing or more profitable categories, demand
for our products could decrease, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.
Prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food and beverage products could influence consumer preferences and
acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs. We strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations, but we may not be
successful in our efforts. Continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our product sales,
financial condition, and operating results.
In addition, achieving growth depends on our successful development, introduction, and marketing of innovative new products and line extensions. There are
inherent risks associated with new product or packaging introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance or potential impacts on
our existing product offerings. We may be required to increase expenditures for new product development. Successful innovation depends on our ability to
correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance, to obtain, protect and maintain necessary intellectual property rights, and to avoid infringing upon the
intellectual property rights of others. We must also be able to respond successfully to technological advances by and intellectual property rights of our
competitors, and failure to do so could compromise our competitive position and impact our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.
We may be unable to drive revenue growth in our key product categories, increase our market share, or add products that are in faster growing and
more profitable categories.
Our future results will depend on our ability to drive revenue growth in our key product categories and growth in the food and beverage industry in the
countries in which we operate. Our future results will also depend on our ability to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing
and more profitable categories and our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories. Our failure to drive revenue growth, limit market
share decreases in our key product categories, or develop innovative products for new and existing categories could materially and adversely affect our
product sales, financial condition, and operating results.
An impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated operating results.
We test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually in the second quarter or when a triggering event occurs. We performed
our annual impairment testing in the second quarter of 2017. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the reporting unit’s estimated fair value
with its carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value, the second step would be applied to measure the difference
between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, the goodwill would be
considered impaired and would be reduced to its implied fair value. We test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of
each intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, the intangible asset would be considered impaired and would be reduced
to its fair value.
Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates and market factors. Estimating the
fair value of individual reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well
as industry and economic conditions. These assumptions and estimates include projected revenues and income growth rates, terminal growth rates,
competitive and consumer trends, market-based discount rates, and other market factors. If current expectations of future growth rates are not met or market
factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then one or more reporting units or intangible assets might become impaired in the
future. As goodwill and intangible assets associated with recently acquired businesses are recorded on the balance sheet at their estimated acquisition date fair
values, those amounts are more susceptible to an impairment risk if business operating results or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate. Additionally, recently
impaired intangible assets can also be more susceptible to future impairment as they are recorded on the balance sheet at their recently estimated fair values.
8
An impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our operating results or net worth.
Commodity, energy, and other input prices are volatile and could negatively affect our consolidated operating results.
We purchase and use large quantities of commodities, including dairy products, meat products, coffee beans, nuts, soybean and vegetable oils, sugar and other
sweeteners, corn products, tomatoes, cucumbers, potatoes, onions, other fruits and vegetables, spices, flour, and wheat to manufacture our products. In
addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of resins, cardboard, glass, plastic, metal, paper, fiberboard, and other materials to package our products
and we use other inputs, such as water and natural gas, to operate our facilities. We are also exposed to changes in oil prices, which influence both our
packaging and transportation costs. Prices for commodities, energy, and other supplies are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to
predict, including global competition for resources, currency fluctuations, severe weather or global climate change, crop failures or shortages due to plant
disease or insect and other pest infestation, consumer, industrial or investment demand, and changes in governmental regulation and trade, alternative energy,
including increased demand for biofuels, and agricultural programs. Additionally, we may be unable to maintain favorable arrangements with respect to the
costs of procuring raw materials, packaging, services, and transporting products, which could result in increased expenses and negatively affect our
operations. Furthermore, the cost of raw materials and finished products may fluctuate due to movements in cross-currency transaction rates. Rising
commodity, energy, and other input costs could materially and adversely affect our cost of operations, including the manufacture, transportation, and
distribution of our products, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
Although we monitor our exposure to commodity prices as an integral part of our overall risk management program, and seek to hedge against input price
increases to the extent we deem appropriate, we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from
increases in specific raw materials costs. For example, hedging our costs for one of our key commodities, dairy products, is difficult because dairy futures
markets are not as developed as many other commodities futures markets. Continued volatility or sustained increases in the prices of commodities and other
supplies we purchase could increase the costs of our products, and our profitability could suffer. Moreover, increases in the prices of our products to cover
these increased costs may result in lower sales volumes. If we are not successful in our hedging activities, or if we are unable to price our products to cover
increased costs, then commodity and other input price volatility or increases could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating
results.
We rely on our management team and other key personnel.
We depend on the skills, working relationships, and continued services of key personnel, including our experienced management team. In addition, our ability
to achieve our operating goals depends on our ability to identify, hire, train, and retain qualified individuals. We compete with other companies both within
and outside of our industry for talented personnel, and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract, train, and retain other talented personnel. Any such loss or
failure could adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.
We may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from streamlining actions to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our
competitiveness.
We have implemented a number of cost savings initiatives, including our Integration Program (as defined below), that we believe are important to position
our business for future success and growth. We have evaluated changes to our organization structure to enable us to reduce costs, simplify or improve
processes, and improve our competitiveness. Our future success may depend upon our ability to realize the benefits of our cost savings initiatives. In addition,
certain of our initiatives may lead to increased costs in other aspects of our business such as increased conversion, outsourcing, or distribution costs. We must
be efficient in executing our plans to achieve cost savings and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food and beverage industry, particularly in an
environment of increased competitive activity. To capitalize on our efforts, we must carefully evaluate investments in our business, and execute on those areas
with the most potential return on investment. If we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from our efforts, we could be cost disadvantaged in the
marketplace, and our competitiveness, production, and profitability could be adversely affected.
9
Changes in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers could adversely impact us.
We derive significant portions of our sales from certain significant customers (see Sales and Customers within Item 1, Business, of this report). There can be
no assurance that all of our significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past,
particularly as increasingly powerful retailers may demand lower pricing and focus on developing their own brands. The loss of a significant customer or a
material reduction in sales or a change in the mix of products we sell to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales,
financial condition, and operating results.
Disputes with significant suppliers, including disputes related to pricing or performance, could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers
and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.
In addition, the financial condition of such customers and suppliers is affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our control. A significant
deterioration in the financial condition of significant customers and suppliers could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and
operating results.
We may not be able to successfully execute our international expansion strategy.
We plan to drive additional growth and profitability through international markets. Consumer demands, behaviors, tastes and purchasing trends may differ in
international markets and, as a result, our sales may not be successful or meet expectations, or the margins on those sales may be less than currently
anticipated. We may also face difficulties integrating foreign business operations with our current sourcing, distribution, information technology systems, and
other operations. Any of these challenges could hinder our success in new markets or new distribution channels. There can be no assurance that we will
successfully complete any planned international expansion or that any new business will be profitable or meet our expectations.
Changes in tax laws and interpretations could adversely affect our business.
We are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and in numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and foreign tax liabilities are dependent on the
jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed. Additionally, the amount of taxes paid is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax
laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. A number of factors influence our effective tax rate, including changes in tax laws and treaties as well as the
interpretation of existing laws and rules. Federal, state, and local governments and administrative bodies within the U.S., which represents a majority of our
operations, and other foreign jurisdictions have implemented, or are considering, a variety of broad tax, trade, and other regulatory reforms that may impact
us. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “U.S. Tax Reform”) enacted on December 22, 2017 resulted in changes in our corporate tax rate, our deferred
income taxes, and the taxation of foreign earnings. We are still assessing the impact of the U.S. Tax Reform, and while a number of impacts are anticipated to
be positive, certain provisions may have adverse or uncertain effects. Relatedly, changes in tax laws resulting from the Organization for Economic Co-
operation and Development’s (OECD) multi-jurisdictional plan of action to address “base erosion and profit sharing” could impact our effective tax rate. It is
not currently possible to accurately determine the potential impact of these proposed or future changes, but these changes could have a material impact on our
business.
Significant judgment, knowledge, and experience are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Our future effective tax rate is
impacted by a number of factors including changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, increases in expenses not deductible for tax,
including impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions, and changes in available tax credits. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many
transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are also regularly subject to audits by tax authorities. Although we believe
our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax
provisions and accruals. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes more difficult. The
results of an audit or litigation could adversely affect our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
Compliance with changes in laws, regulations, and related interpretations could impact our business.
As a large, global food and beverage company, we operate in a highly-regulated environment with constantly-evolving legal and regulatory frameworks.
Various laws and regulations govern production, storage, distribution, sales, advertising, labeling, including on-pack claims, information or disclosures,
marketing, licensing, trade, labor, tax, and environmental matters, as well as health and safety practices. Government authorities regularly change laws and
regulations and their interpretations. Our compliance with new or revised laws and regulations, or the interpretation and application of existing laws and
regulations, could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations. As a consequence of the legal and
regulatory environment in which we operate, we are faced with a heightened risk of legal claims and regulatory enforcement actions.
10
Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that
courts or regulators will agree with our interpretations or that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies and procedures. Moreover, a
failure to maintain effective control processes could lead to violations, unintentional or otherwise, of laws and regulations. Legal claims or regulatory
enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties
that could materially and adversely affect our product sales, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, the costs and other effects of
defending potential and pending litigation and administrative actions against us may be difficult to determine and could adversely affect our financial
condition and operating results.
Product recalls or other product liability claims could materially and adversely affect us.
Selling products for human consumption involves inherent legal and other risks, including product contamination, spoilage, product tampering, allergens, or
other adulteration. We could decide to, or be required to, recall products due to suspected or confirmed product contamination, adulteration, product
mislabeling or misbranding, tampering, or other deficiencies. Product recalls or market withdrawals could result in significant losses due to their costs, the
destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time.
We could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients, or the food safety system
generally. Adverse attention about these types of concerns, whether or not valid, may damage our reputation, discourage consumers from buying our
products, or cause production and delivery disruptions.
We may also suffer losses if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations, or if our products cause injury, illness, or death. In addition, our
marketing could face claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism. A significant product liability or other legal judgment or a related regulatory
enforcement action against us, or a significant product recall, may materially and adversely affect our reputation and profitability. Moreover, even if a product
liability or fraud claim is unsuccessful, has no merit, or is not pursued, the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could
materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.
Unanticipated business disruptions could adversely affect our ability to provide our products to our customers.
We have a complex network of suppliers, owned manufacturing locations, co-manufacturing locations, distribution networks, and information systems that
support our ability to consistently provide our products to our customers. Factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control, such as weather, raw material
shortages, natural disasters, fire or explosion, political unrest, terrorism, generalized labor unrest, or health pandemics, could damage or disrupt our operations
or our suppliers’ or co-manufacturers’ operations. These disruptions may require additional resources to restore our supply chain or distribution network. If
we cannot respond to disruptions in our operations, whether by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution
locations, or if we are unable to quickly repair damage to our information, production, or supply systems, we may be late in delivering, or be unable to
deliver, products to our customers and may also be unable to track orders, inventory, receivables, and payables. If that occurs, our customers’ confidence in us
and long-term demand for our products could decline. Any of these events could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and
operating results.
We may not successfully identify or complete strategic acquisitions, alliances, divestitures or joint ventures.
From time to time, we may evaluate acquisition candidates, alliances, or joint ventures that may strategically fit our business objectives or we may consider
divesting businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or growth or profitability targets. These activities may present financial, managerial, and
operational risks including, but not limited to, diversion of management’s attention from existing core businesses, difficulties integrating or separating
personnel and financial and other systems, inability to effectively and immediately implement control environment processes across a diverse employee
population, adverse effects on existing or acquired customer and supplier business relationships, and potential disputes with buyers, sellers, or partners.
Activities in such areas are regulated by numerous antitrust and competition laws in the United States, the European Union, and other jurisdictions, and we
may be required to obtain the approval of acquisition and joint venture transactions by competition authorities, as well as to satisfy other legal requirements.
To the extent we undertake acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures, or other developments outside our core regions or in new categories, we may face additional
risks related to such developments. For example, risks related to foreign operations include compliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the
United States, such as the FCPA, currency rate fluctuations, compliance with foreign regulations and laws, including tax laws, and exposure to politically and
economically volatile developing markets. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating
results.
11
Our performance may be adversely affected by economic and political conditions in the United States and in various other nations where we do
business.
Our performance has been in the past and may continue in the future to be impacted by economic and political conditions in the United States and in other
nations where we do business. Economic and financial uncertainties in our international markets, including uncertainties surrounding the United Kingdom's
impending withdrawal from the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) and changes to major international trade arrangements (e.g., the North
American Free Trade Agreement), could negatively impact our operations and sales. Other factors impacting our operations in the United States and in
international locations where we do business include export and import restrictions, currency exchange rates, currency devaluation, cash repatriation
restrictions, recessionary conditions, foreign ownership restrictions, nationalization, the impact of hyperinflationary environments, terrorist acts, and political
unrest. Such factors in either domestic or foreign jurisdictions could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating
results. For further information on Venezuela, see Note 13, Venezuela - Foreign Currency and Inflation, to the consolidated financial statements.
Volatility of capital markets or macro-economic factors could adversely affect our business.
Changes in financial and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity, and interest rate volatility, may increase the cost of financing as well
as the risks of refinancing maturing debt. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term ratings assigned by rating organizations. A
decrease in these ratings could limit our access to capital markets and increase our borrowing costs, which could materially and adversely affect our financial
condition and operating results.
Some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged. Consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger
customers, some of which are highly leveraged and facing increased competition and continued credit market volatility. These factors have caused some
customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk. A significant adverse change in the financial and/or credit position of a customer or
counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer or counterparty and could limit our ability to collect receivables. This
could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity.
Our results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension, labor, and people-related expenses.
Inflationary pressures and any shortages in the labor market could increase labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
operating results or financial condition. Our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits in the United States, Canada, and other foreign
jurisdictions, including pension, health and welfare, and severance benefits. Any declines in market returns could adversely impact the funding of pension
plans, the assets of which are invested in a diversified portfolio of equity and fixed-income securities and other investments. Additionally, the annual costs of
benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectively-bargained wage and benefit agreements.
Furthermore, we may be subject to increased costs or experience adverse effects to our operating results if we are unable to renew collectively bargained
agreements on satisfactory terms. Our financial condition and ability to meet the needs of our customers could be materially and adversely affected if strikes
or work stoppages and interruptions occur as a result of delayed negotiations with union-represented employees both in and outside of the United States.
Volatility in the market value of all or a portion of the derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices may cause
volatility in our operating results and net income.
We use commodity futures and options to partially hedge the price of certain input costs, including dairy products, coffee beans, meat products, wheat, corn
products, soybean oils, sugar and natural gas. Changes in the values of these derivatives are currently recorded in net income, resulting in volatility in both
gross profits and net income. We report these gains and losses in cost of products sold in our consolidated statements of income to the extent we utilize the
underlying input in our manufacturing process. We report these gains and losses in general corporate expenses in our segment operating results until we sell
the underlying products, at which time we reclassify the gains and losses to segment operating results. We may experience volatile earnings as a result of
these accounting treatments.
12
Our net sales and net income may be exposed to exchange rate fluctuations.
We derive a substantial portion of our net sales from international operations. We hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenue, and pay expenses in a variety
of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the British pound sterling, euro, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, New Zealand dollar, Brazilian real,
Indonesian rupiah, and Chinese renminbi. Since our consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in exchange rates from
period to period will have an impact on our reported results. We have implemented currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign
currency exchange rates. However, these hedging strategies may not be successful and any of our unhedged foreign exchange exposures will continue to be
subject to market fluctuations. In addition, in certain circumstances, we may incur costs in one currency related to services or products for which we are paid
in a different currency. As a result, factors associated with international operations, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, could significantly
affect our results of operations and financial condition.
We are significantly dependent on information technology and we may be unable to protect our information systems against service interruption,
misappropriation of data, or breaches of security.
We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic and financial information, to
manage a variety of business processes and activities, and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements. We also depend on our information
technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations, personnel, customers, and suppliers. These
information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, may be susceptible to damage, invasions, disruptions, or shutdowns due to
hardware failures, computer viruses, hacker attacks, and other cybersecurity risks, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophic events or other
factors. If our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown, by unintentional or malicious actions of employees and
contractors or by cyber-attacks, and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience business
disruptions, reputational damage, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the leakage of confidential information, and the loss of customers and sales,
causing our product sales, financial condition, and operating results to be adversely affected and the reporting of our financial results to be delayed.
In addition, if we are unable to prevent security breaches or disclosure of non-public information, we may suffer financial and reputational damage, litigation
or remediation costs, fines, or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners, customers,
consumers, or suppliers.
Misuse, leakage, or falsification of information could result in violations of data privacy laws and regulations, damage to our reputation and credibility, loss of
opportunities to acquire or divest of businesses or brands, and loss of ability to commercialize products developed through research and development efforts
and, therefore, could have a negative impact on net sales. In addition, we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated
confidential information belonging to us, our current or former employees, or to our suppliers or consumers, and may become subject to legal action and
increased regulatory oversight. We could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach
or to repair or replace networks and information systems.
Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands.
We consider our intellectual property rights, particularly and most notably our trademarks, but also our patents, trade secrets, copyrights and licensing
agreements, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent,
trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements, third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements, and policing of third-party
misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks, products, new features of our products, or our technology, or
any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property, may diminish our competitiveness
and could materially harm our business.
We may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology, brands, or products. Any litigation regarding patents or
other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business
operations. Third-party claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements. We also may be subject to
significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products.
13
Our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers, suppliers or regulators operate.
We may be impacted by severe weather and other geological events, including hurricanes, earthquakes, floods or tsunamis that could disrupt our operations or
the operations of our customers, suppliers, and regulators. Natural disasters or other disruptions at any of our facilities or our suppliers’ facilities may impair
or delay the delivery of our products. Influenza or other pandemics could disrupt production of our products, reduce demand for certain of our products, or
disrupt the marketplace in the foodservice or retail environment with consequent material adverse effects on our results of operations. While we insure against
many of these events and certain business interruption risks, we cannot provide any assurance that such insurance will compensate us for any losses incurred
as a result of natural or other disasters. To the extent we are unable to, or cannot, financially mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or
effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a single location, there could be a material adverse effect on our
business and results of operations, and additional resources could be required to restore our supply chain.
Our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business.
We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, and are permitted to incur a substantial amount of additional indebtedness, including secured debt. Our
existing debt, together with any incurrence of additional indebtedness, could have important consequences, including, but not limited to:
•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, debt service requirements,
acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes;
•resulting in a downgrade to our credit rating, which could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, and access to capital markets;
•restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;
•limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are not as
highly leveraged;
•making it more difficult for us to make payments on our existing indebtedness;
•requiring a substantial portion of cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby
reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;
•exposing us to risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency as we earn profits in a variety of currencies around the world and substantially all of
our debt is denominated in U.S. dollars; and
•in the case of any additional indebtedness, exacerbating the risks associated with our substantial financial leverage.
In addition, there can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financings will be available to us
to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other needs. As a result, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity.
There is no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or
to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
The creditors who hold our debt could also accelerate amounts due in the event that we default, which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of the
maturity of our other debt. If our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required creditors under our
indebtedness instruments to avoid being in default. If we breach the covenants under our indebtedness instruments and seek a waiver, we may not be able to
obtain a waiver from the required creditors. If this occurs, we would be in default under our indebtedness instruments, the creditors could exercise their rights,
as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.
14
The Sponsors have substantial control over us and may have conflicts of interest with us in the future.
The Sponsors own approximately 51% of our common stock. Six of our 11 directors had been directors of Heinz prior to the closing of the 2015 Merger and
remained directors of Kraft Heinz pursuant to the merger agreement. In addition, some of our executive officers, including Bernardo Hees, our Chief
Executive Officer, are partners of 3G Capital, one of the Sponsors. As a result, the Sponsors have the potential to exercise influence over management and
have substantial control over decisions of our Board of Directors as well as over any action requiring the approval of the holders of our common stock,
including adopting any amendments to our charter, electing directors, and approving mergers or sales of substantially all of our capital stock or our assets. In
addition, to the extent that the Sponsors collectively hold a majority of our common stock, they together would have the power to take shareholder action by
written consent to adopt amendments to our charter or take other actions, such as corporate transactions, that require the vote of holders of a majority of our
outstanding common stock. The directors designated by the Sponsors may have significant authority to effect decisions affecting our capital structure,
including the issuance of additional capital stock, incurrence of additional indebtedness, the implementation of stock repurchase programs and the decision of
whether or not to declare dividends. Additionally, the Sponsors are in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire
and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. The Sponsors may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be
complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as the Sponsors continue to own a
significant amount of our equity, they will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions.
Future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause volatility in the price of our common stock or cause the share price to fall.
Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market
price of our common stock, and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.
Kraft Heinz, 3G Capital, and Berkshire Hathaway entered into a registration rights agreement requiring us to register for resale under the Securities Act all
registrable shares held by 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway, which represents all shares of our common stock held by the Sponsors as of the date of the
closing of the 2015 Merger. As of the closing of the 2015 Merger, registrable shares represented approximately 51% of our outstanding common stock on a
fully diluted basis. Although the registrable shares are subject to certain holdback and suspension periods, the registrable shares are not subject to a “lock-up”
or similar restriction under the registration rights agreement. Accordingly, sales of a large number of registrable shares may be made upon registration of such
shares with the SEC in accordance with the terms of the registration rights agreement. Registration and sales of our common stock effected pursuant to the
registration rights agreement will increase the number of shares being sold in the public market and may increase the volatility of the price of our common
stock.
Our ability to pay regular dividends to our shareholders is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and may be limited by our debt
agreements or limitations under Delaware law.
Although it is currently anticipated that we will continue to pay regular quarterly dividends, any such determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion
of the Board of Directors and will be dependent on then-existing conditions, including our financial condition, income, legal requirements, including
limitations under Delaware law, and other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant. The Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, change the
amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely. For these reasons, shareholders will not be able to rely on dividends to
receive a return on investment. Accordingly, realization of any gain on shares of our common stock may depend on the appreciation of the price of our
common stock, which may never occur.
15
While we have remediated the previously-identified material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we may identify other
material weaknesses in the future.
In November 2017, we restated our consolidated financial statements for the quarters ended April 1, 2017 and July 1, 2017 in order to correctly classify cash
receipts from the payments on sold receivables (which are cash receipts on the underlying trade receivables that have already been securitized) to cash
provided by investing activities (from cash provided by operating activities) within our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. In connection with
these restatements, management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the misapplication of Accounting
Standards Update 2016-15. Specifically, we did not maintain effective controls over the adoption of new accounting standards, including communication with
the appropriate individuals in coming to our conclusions on the application of new accounting standards. As a result of this material weakness, our
management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 1, 2017 and July 1, 2017. While we have
remediated the material weakness and our management has determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 30, 2017,
there can be no assurance that our controls will remain adequate. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various
inherent limitations, including judgments used in decision-making, the nature and complexity of the transactions we undertake, assumptions about the
likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, cost limitations, and other limitations. If other material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our
internal control are discovered or occur in the future or we otherwise must restate our financial statements, it could materially and adversely affect our
business and results of operations or financial condition, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend significant resources to correct
the weaknesses or deficiencies, subject us to fines, penalties, investigations or judgments, harm our reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor
confidence.
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.
None.
Item 2. Properties.
Our corporate co-headquarters are located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Chicago, Illinois. Our co-headquarters are leased and house certain executive
offices, our U.S. business units, and our administrative, finance, legal, and human resource functions. We maintain additional owned and leased offices
throughout the regions in which we operate.
We manufacture our products in our network of manufacturing and processing facilities located throughout the world. As of December 30, 2017, we operated
83 manufacturing and processing facilities. We own 80 and lease three of these facilities. Our manufacturing and processing facilities count by segment as of
December 30, 2017 was:
 Owned  Leased
United States 41  1
Canada 2  —
Europe 11  —
Rest of World 26  2
We maintain all of our manufacturing and processing facilities in good condition and believe they are suitable and are adequate for our present needs. We also
enter into co-manufacturing arrangements with third parties if we determine it is advantageous to outsource the production of any of our products.
Item 3. Legal Proceedings.
We are routinely involved in legal proceedings, claims, and governmental inquiries, inspections or investigations (“Legal Matters”) arising in the ordinary
course of our business. While we cannot predict with certainty the results of Legal Matters in which we are currently involved or may in the future be
involved, we do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve any of the Legal Matters that are currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition or results of operations.
Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.
Not applicable.

PART II
Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.
Our common stock is listed on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol “KHC”. At February 10, 2018, there were approximately 53,000 holders of record of our
common stock.
Our stock began publicly trading on July 6, 2015. Our quarterly highest and lowest market prices and dividends declared are:
 2017 Quarters  2016 Quarters
 First  Second  Third  Fourth  First  Second  Third  Fourth
Market price-high $ 97.77 $ 93.88 $ 90.38 $ 82.48 $ 79.16 $ 89.40 $ 90.54 $ 90.15

Comparison of Cumulative Total Return
The following graph compares the cumulative total return on our common stock with the cumulative total return of the Standard & Poor's (“S&P”) 500 Index
and the S&P Consumer Staples Food Products, which we consider to be our peer group. This graph covers the period from July 6, 2015 (the first day our
common stock began trading on NASDAQ) through December 29, 2017 (the last trading day of our fiscal year). The graph shows total shareholder return
assuming $100 was invested on July 6, 2015 and the dividends were reinvested on a daily basis.

Item 6. Selected Financial Data.
Periods Presented:
On June 7, 2013, H. J. Heinz Company was acquired by Heinz (formerly known as Hawk Acquisition Holding Corporation), a Delaware corporation
controlled by the Sponsors, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated February 13, 2013, as amended by the Amendment to Agreement and Plan
of Merger, dated March 4, 2013, by and among H. J. Heinz Company, Heinz, and Hawk Acquisition Sub, Inc. (“Hawk”).
The 2013 Merger established a new accounting basis for Heinz. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements present both predecessor and successor
periods, which relate to the accounting periods preceding and succeeding the completion of the 2013 Merger. The predecessor and successor periods are
separated by a vertical line to highlight the fact that the financial information for such periods has been prepared under two different historical-cost bases of
accounting.
Additionally, on October 21, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a change in our fiscal year-end from the Sunday closest to April 30 to the Sunday closest
to December 31. In 2013, as a result of the change in fiscal year-end, the 2013 Merger, and the creation of Hawk, there are three 2013 reporting periods as
described below.
The “Successor” (Heinz, renamed to The Kraft Heinz Company at the closing of the 2015 Merger) period includes:
•The consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 30, 2017 (a 52-week period, including a full year of Kraft Heinz results);
•The consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 (a 52-week period, including a full year of Kraft Heinz results);
•The consolidated financial statements for the year ended January 3, 2016 (a 53-week period, including a full year of Heinz results and post-2015
Merger results of Kraft);
•The consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 28, 2014 (a 52-week period, including a full year of Heinz results); and
• The period from February 8, 2013 through December 29, 2013 (the “2013 Successor Period”), reflecting:
▪The creation of Hawk on February 8, 2013 and the activity from February 8, 2013 to June 7, 2013, which related primarily to the issuance
of debt and recognition of associated issuance costs and interest expense; and
▪All activity subsequent to the 2013 Merger. Therefore, the 2013 Successor Period includes 29 weeks of operating activity (June 8, 2013 to
December 29, 2013). We indicate in the selected financial data table the weeks of operating activities in this period.
The “Predecessor” (H. J. Heinz Company) period includes, but is not limited to:
•The consolidated financial statements of H. J. Heinz Company prior to the 2013 Merger on June 7, 2013, which includes the period from April 29,
2013 through June 7, 2013 (the “2013 Predecessor Period”); this represents six weeks of activity from April 29, 2013 through the 2013 Merger; and
•The consolidated financial statements of H. J. Heinz Company for the fiscal year from April 30, 2012 to April 28, 2013 (“Fiscal 2013”).

(a)  On December 9, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a change to our fiscal year end from Sunday to Saturday. Effective December 31, 2016, we operate on a 52 or 53-week fiscal year ending
on the last Saturday in December in each calendar year. In prior years, we operated on a 52 or 53-week fiscal year ending the Sunday closest to December 31. As a result, we occasionally have a
53rd week in a fiscal year. Our 2015 fiscal year includes a 53rd week of activity.
(b)Amounts exclude the operating results and any associated impairment charges and losses on sale related to the Company's Shanghai LongFong Foods business in China and U.S. Foodservice
frozen desserts business, which were divested in Fiscal 2013.
(c)Amounts exclude the current portion of long-term debt. Additionally, amounts include interest rate swap hedge accounting adjustments of $123 million at April 28, 2013. There were no interest
rate swaps requiring such hedge accounting adjustments at December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, January 3, 2016, December 28, 2014, or December 29, 2013.
(d)The increases in net sales, total assets, and long-term debt from December 28, 2014 to January 3, 2016 reflect the impact of the 2015 Merger. See Note 2, Merger and Acquisition, to the
consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Overview
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial
statements and related notes contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Description of the Company:
We manufacture and market food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee,
and other grocery products throughout the world.
We manage and report our operating results through four segments. We have three reportable segments defined by geographic region: United States, Canada,
and Europe. Our remaining businesses are combined and disclosed as “Rest of World”. Rest of World is comprised of two operating segments: Latin America
and AMEA.
In the third quarter of 2017, we announced our plans to reorganize certain of our international businesses to better align our global geographies. These plans
include moving our Middle East and Africa businesses from the AMEA operating segment into the EMEA operating segment. The remaining AMEA
businesses will become the APAC operating segment. We currently expect these changes to become effective in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018. As a
result, we expect to restate our Europe and Rest of World segments to reflect these changes for historical periods presented as of March 31, 2018.
19
See Note 19, Segment Reporting, to the consolidated financial statements for our financial information by segment.
Items Affecting Comparability of Financial Results
The 2015 Merger:
We completed the 2015 Merger on July 2, 2015. As a result, 2016 was the first full year of combined Kraft and Heinz results, while 2015 included a full year
of Heinz results and post-2015 Merger results of Kraft. For comparability, we disclose in this report certain unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial information, which presents 2015 as if the 2015 Merger had been consummated on December 30, 2013, the first business day of our 2014 fiscal
year, and combines the historical results of Heinz and Kraft. See the Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information section
at the end of this item for additional information.
See Note 1, Background and Basis of Presentation, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the 2015 Merger.
Integration and Restructuring Expenses:
In 2017, we substantially completed our multi-year program announced following the 2015 Merger (the “Integration Program”), for which we expect to incur
cumulative pre-tax costs of approximately $2.1 billion. Approximately 60% of these costs will be cash expenditures. As of December 30, 2017, we have
incurred cumulative pre-tax costs of $2,055 million related to the Integration Program. These costs primarily included severance and employee benefit costs
(including cash and non-cash severance), costs to exit facilities (including non-cash costs such as accelerated depreciation), and other costs incurred as a
direct result of integration activities related to the 2015 Merger.
Total expenses related to our restructuring activities, including the Integration Program, were $457 million in 2017, $1,012 million in 2016, and $1,023
million in 2015. Integration Program costs included in these totals were $339 million in 2017, $887 million in 2016, and $829 million in 2015.
We anticipate cumulative capital expenditures of approximately $1.4 billion related to the Integration Program. As of December 30, 2017, we have incurred
$1.3 billion in capital expenditures since the inception of the Integration Program. The Integration Program was designed to reduce costs, integrate, and
optimize our combined organization. Since the inception of the Integration Program, our cumulative pre-tax savings achieved are approximately $1,725
million, primarily benefiting the United States and Canada segments.
See Note 3, Integration and Restructuring Expenses, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
U.S. Tax Reform:
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“U.S. Tax Reform”) was enacted by the U.S. federal government. The legislation significantly changed
U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering the federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, effective January 1, 2018, implementing a territorial tax
system, and imposing a one-time toll charge on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 30, 2017. The two material items that
impacted us in 2017 were the corporate tax rate reduction and the one-time toll charge. While the corporate tax rate reduction is effective January 1, 2018, we
accounted for this anticipated rate change in 2017, the period of enactment.
We have estimated the provisional tax impacts related to the toll charge, certain components of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, including
depreciation and executive compensation, and the change in our indefinite reinvestment assertion. As a result, we recognized a net tax benefit of
approximately $7.0 billion, including a reasonable estimate of our deferred income tax benefit of approximately $7.5 billion related to the corporate rate
change, which was partially offset by a reasonable estimate of $312 million for the toll charge and approximately $125 million for other tax expenses,
including a change in our indefinite reinvestment assertion.
See Critical Accounting Policies within this item and Note 8, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
53rd Week:
On December 9, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a change to our fiscal year end from Sunday to Saturday. Effective December 31, 2016, we operate
on a 52 or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December in each calendar year. In prior years, we operated on a 52 or 53-week fiscal year
ending the Sunday closest to December 31. As a result, we occasionally have a 53rd week in a fiscal year. Our 2015 fiscal year included a 53rd week of
activity.
20
Series A Preferred Stock:
On June 7, 2016, we redeemed all outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock. We funded this redemption primarily through the issuance of long-term
debt in May 2016, as well as other sources of liquidity, including our commercial paper program, U.S. securitization program, and cash on hand.
See Equity and Dividends within this item, along with Note 16, Debt, and Note 17, Capital Stock, to the consolidated financial statements for additional
information.
Results of Operations
Due to the size of Kraft’s business relative to the size of Heinz’s business prior to the 2015 Merger, and for purposes of comparability, the Results of
Operations include certain unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information (the “pro forma financial information”) adjusted to assume that
Kraft and Heinz were a combined company for the full year 2015. This pro forma financial information reflects combined historical results, final purchase
accounting adjustments, and adjustments to align accounting policies. The pro forma adjustments impacted our consolidated results and all of our segments.
There are no pro forma adjustments for 2017 or 2016 as Kraft and Heinz were a combined company for these periods. For more information, see
Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.
In addition, we disclose in this report certain non-GAAP financial measures, which, for 2015, are derived from the pro forma financial information. These
non-GAAP financial measures assist management in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision-making by removing
the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations. For additional information and reconciliations from
our consolidated financial statements see Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information and Non-GAAP Financial
Measures.

Year Ended December 30, 2017 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016:
Net sales and Organic Net Sales decreased 1.0% to $26.2 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 due to unfavorable volume/mix (1.5 pp) partially offset by higher
pricing (0.5 pp). Volume/mix was unfavorable in the United States and Canada, partially offset by growth in Europe and Rest of World. Higher pricing in Rest
of World and the United States was partially offset by lower pricing in Canada and Europe.
Year Ended December 31, 2016 compared to the Year Ended January 3, 2016:
Net sales increased 44.4% to $26.5 billion in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by the 2015 Merger.
Pro forma net sales decreased 3.5% primarily due to the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency (2.5 pp), 53rd week of shipments in 2015 (1.2 pp), and
divestitures (0.1 pp). Excluding these impacts, Organic Net Sales increased 0.3% due to higher net pricing (0.3 pp) and neutral volume/mix (0.0 pp). Net
pricing was higher in Rest of World, United States, and Canada despite deflation in key commodities (which we define as dairy, meat, coffee and nuts) in the
United States and Canada, primarily in dairy, coffee, and meats in the United States. These price increases were partially offset by lower net pricing in
Europe. Neutral volume/mix was primarily due to declines in meats and foodservice in the United States, partially offset by growth of condiments and sauces
globally, and coffee and refrigerated meal combinations in the United States.

Year Ended December 30, 2017 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016:
Operating income increased 10.3% to $6.8 billion in 2017 compared to $6.1 billion in 2016. This increase was primarily due to lower Integration Program
and other restructuring expenses in the current period, savings from the Integration Program and other restructuring activities, and lower overhead costs,
partially offset by higher input costs in local currency, lower Organic Net Sales, lower unrealized gains on commodity hedges in the current period, and the
unfavorable impact of foreign currency (0.4 pp).
Net income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders increased 218.6% to $11.0 billion in 2017 compared to $3.5 billion in 2016. The increase was
primarily due to a lower effective tax rate in the current period, the operating income factors discussed above, and the absence of the Series A Preferred Stock
dividend in the current period, partially offset by higher interest expense and higher other expense/(income), net, detailed as follows:
•The effective tax rate was a 98.7% benefit in 2017 compared to 27.5% expense in 2016. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by
the $7.0 billion tax benefit from U.S. Tax Reform, lower tax benefits associated with deferred tax effects of statutory rate changes, and taxes on
income of foreign subsidiaries in the current period. See Note 8, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information
related to our effective tax rates.
•The Series A Preferred Stock was fully redeemed on June 7, 2016. Accordingly, there were no dividends for 2017, compared to $180 million in the
prior period. See Equity and Dividends within this item for additional information.
•Interest expense increased to $1.2 billion in 2017 compared to $1.1 billion in 2016. This increase was primarily due to the May 2016 issuances of
long-term debt and borrowings under our commercial paper programs, which began in the second quarter of 2016.
•Other expense/(income), net was an expense of $9 million in 2017 compared to income of $15 million in 2016. This increase was primarily due to a
$36 million nonmonetary currency devaluation loss in the current period compared to $24 million in the prior period related to our Venezuelan
operations. See Note 13, Venezuela - Foreign Currency and Inflation, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
22
Adjusted EBITDA increased 1.9% to $7.9 billion in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to savings from the Integration Program and other restructuring
activities and lower overhead costs, partially offset by higher input costs in local currency, a decline in Organic Net Sales, and the unfavorable impact of
foreign currency (0.4pp). Segment Adjusted EBITDA results were as follows:
•United States Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased primarily driven by Integration Program savings and lower overhead costs in the current period,
partially offset by unfavorable key commodity costs, primarily in dairy, meat, and coffee, and volume/mix declines.
•Europe Segment Adjusted EBITDA was flat primarily driven by productivity savings that were offset by higher input costs in local currency and the
unfavorable impact of foreign currency (1.6 pp).
•Rest of World Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased primarily due to higher input costs in local currency, increased commercial investments, and
the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (3.4 pp), partially offset by Organic Net Sales growth.
•Canada Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased primarily due to a decline in Organic Net Sales, partially offset by Integration Program savings, lower
overhead costs in the current period, and the favorable impact of foreign currency (1.7 pp).
Year Ended December 31, 2016 compared to the Year Ended January 3, 2016:
Operating income increased 132.7% to $6.1 billion in 2016 compared to $2.6 billion in 2015. This increase was primarily driven by the 2015 Merger, as well
as the following:
•Savings from the Integration Program and other restructuring activities and favorable pricing net of key commodity costs in United States and
Canada.
•Non-cash costs of $347 million relating to the fair value adjustment of Kraft’s inventory in purchase accounting in the prior period.
The increase in operating income was partially offset by unfavorable impacts of $188 million from foreign currency and $62 million from a 53rd week of
shipments in the prior period.
Net income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders increased $3.7 billion to income of $3.5 billion in 2016 compared to a loss of $266 million in 2015.
The increase was due to the growth in operating income, fewer Series A Preferred Stock dividend payments, lower other expense/(income), net, lower interest
expense, and a lower effective tax rate, detailed as follows:
•Series A Preferred Stock dividend cash distributions decreased to $180 million in 2016 compared to $900 million in 2015. This decrease was
primarily due to the redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock on June 7, 2016. In addition, due to the December 8, 2015 common stock dividend
declaration, we were required to accelerate payment of the March 7, 2016 preferred dividend to December 8, 2015. This resulted in one Series A
Preferred Stock dividend payment in the current period compared to five in the prior period.
•Other expense/(income), net improved to income of $15 million in 2016, compared to expense of $305 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily
due to a $234 million nonmonetary currency devaluation loss related to our Venezuelan subsidiary in the prior period and call premiums of $105
million related to our 2015 debt refinancing activities.
•Interest expense decreased to $1.1 billion in 2016 compared to $1.3 billion in 2015. This decrease was primarily due to a $236 million write-off of
debt issuance costs related to 2015 debt refinancing activities and a $227 million loss released from accumulated other comprehensive
income/(losses) due to the early termination of certain interest rate swaps in the prior period as well as lower interest rates following our debt
refinancing in connection with the 2015 Merger. These were partially offset by the assumption of $8.6 billion aggregate principal amount of Kraft’s
long-term debt obligations in the 2015 Merger, the issuance of new long-term debt in conjunction with the redemption of our Series A Preferred
Stock, and new borrowings under our commercial paper program. See Note 16, Debt, and Note 17, Capital Stock, to the consolidated financial
statements for additional information.
•The effective tax rate was 27.5% in 2016, compared to 36.2% in 2015. The change in effective tax rate was primarily driven by higher earnings
repatriation charges and the nondeductible nonmonetary currency devaluation loss related to our Venezuelan subsidiary in the prior period, partially
offset by lower tax benefits associated with taxes on income of foreign subsidiaries, tax exempt income, and deferred tax effects of statutory rate
changes in the current period. See Note 8, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of effective tax rates.
23
Adjusted EBITDA increased 15.4% to $7.8 billion in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by savings from the Integration Program and other
restructuring activities and favorable pricing net of key commodity costs, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (3.4 pp) and a 53rd
week of shipments in the prior period (approximately 1.5 pp). Segment Adjusted EBITDA results were as follows:
•United States Segment Adjusted EBITDA growth was primarily driven by savings from the Integration Program and favorable pricing net of key
commodity costs, partially offset by volume/mix declines and the impact of a 53rd week of shipments (approximately 1.5 pp) in the prior period.
•Canada Segment Adjusted EBITDA growth was primarily driven by savings from the Integration Program and favorable pricing net of key
commodity costs, partially offset by higher input costs in local currency, unfavorable impact of foreign currency (4.4 pp), and a 53rd week of
shipments (approximately 1.5 pp) in the prior period.
•Europe Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased primarily due to unfavorable impact of foreign currency (6.5 pp), lower pricing, impact of a 53rd
week of shipments (approximately 1.0 pp) in the prior period as well as an increase in marketing investments, partially offset by savings in
manufacturing costs.
•Rest of World Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased due to unfavorable impact of foreign currency (17.4 pp), increased marketing investments, and
a 53rd week of shipments (approximately 1.0 pp) in the prior period, partially offset by organic sales growth.

Results of Operations by Segment
Management evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including net sales, Organic Net Sales, and segment adjusted earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation, and amortization (“Segment Adjusted EBITDA”). Management uses Segment Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate segment performance and
allocate resources. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by
removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations. These items include depreciation and
amortization (excluding integration and restructuring expenses; including amortization of postretirement benefit plans prior service credits), equity award
compensation expense, integration and restructuring expenses, merger costs, unrealized gains/(losses) on commodity hedges (the unrealized gains and losses
are recorded in general corporate expenses until realized; once realized, the gains and losses are recorded in the applicable segment’s operating results),
impairment losses, gains/(losses) on the sale of a business, and nonmonetary currency devaluation (e.g., remeasurement gains and losses). In addition,
consistent with the manner in which management evaluates segment performance and allocates resources, Segment Adjusted EBITDA includes the operating
results of Kraft on a pro forma basis, as if Kraft had been acquired as of December 30, 2013.

Year Ended December 30, 2017 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016:
Net sales and Organic Net Sales decreased 1.5% to $18.4 billion due to unfavorable volume/mix (1.9 pp) partially offset by higher pricing (0.4 pp).
Unfavorable volume/mix was primarily driven by distribution losses in nuts, cheese, and meat, and lower shipments in foodservice. The decline was partially
offset by gains in refrigerated meal combinations, boxed dinners, and frozen meals. Pricing was higher driven primarily by price increases in cheese.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 2.4% primarily driven by Integration Program savings and lower overhead costs, partially offset by unfavorable key
commodity costs, primarily in dairy, meat, and coffee, as well as unfavorable volume/mix.
Year Ended December 31, 2016 compared to the Year Ended January 3, 2016:
Net sales increased 70.3% to $18.6 billion primarily driven by the 2015 Merger. Pro forma net sales decreased 1.5% due to a 53rd week of shipments in the
prior period (1.2 pp). Organic Net Sales decreased 0.3% due to unfavorable volume/mix (0.5 pp) partially offset by higher net pricing (0.2 pp). Unfavorable
volume/mix was primarily due to declines in meat, foodservice, ready-to-drink beverages, and nuts that were partially offset by gains in coffee and
innovation-related gains in refrigerated meal combinations and boxed dinners. Net pricing was higher despite deflation in key commodities, primarily in
dairy, coffee, and meat.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 25.0% primarily due to savings from the Integration Program and favorable pricing net of key commodity costs,
partially offset by volume/mix declines across several categories and the impact of a 53rd week of shipments (approximately 1.5 pp) in the prior period.

Year Ended December 30, 2017 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016:
Net sales decreased 5.2% to $2.2 billion, including the favorable impact of foreign currency (1.8 pp). Organic Net Sales decreased 7.0% due to unfavorable
volume/mix (5.3 pp) and lower pricing (1.7 pp). Volume/mix was unfavorable across several categories and was most pronounced in cheese, coffee, and
boxed dinners, primarily due to delayed execution of go-to-market agreements with key retailers, retail distribution losses (primarily in cheese), and lower
inventory levels at retail versus the prior year. Lower pricing was due to higher promotional activity, primarily in cheese.
28
Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 0.5%, including favorable impact of foreign currency (1.7 pp). Excluding the currency impact, Segment Adjusted
EBITDA decreased primarily due to lower Organic Net Sales partially offset by Integration Program savings and lower overhead costs in the current period.
Year Ended December 31, 2016 compared to the Year Ended January 3, 2016:
Net sales increased 60.7% to $2.3 billion primarily driven by the 2015 Merger. Pro forma net sales decreased 3.2% due to the unfavorable impact of foreign
currency (3.5 pp) and a 53rd week of shipments in the prior period (1.1 pp). Organic Net Sales increased 1.4% driven by favorable volume/mix (0.8 pp) and
higher net pricing (0.6 pp). Favorable volume/mix reflected higher shipments of condiments and sauces and gains in foodservice that were partially offset by
lower shipments in cheese versus the prior year. Price increases were driven by significant pricing actions taken to offset higher input costs in local currency.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 18.7% despite the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (4.4 pp). This increase was primarily driven by Integration
Program savings and favorable pricing net of key commodity costs, partially offset by higher input costs in local currency and the impact of a 53rd week of
shipments (approximately 1.5 pp) in the prior period.

Year Ended December 30, 2017 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016:
Net sales increased 1.1% to $2.4 billion, including favorable impact of foreign currency (0.3 pp). Organic Net Sales increased 0.8% driven by favorable
volume/mix (1.7 pp), partially offset by lower pricing (0.9 pp). Favorable volume/mix was primarily driven by higher shipments in foodservice and growth in
condiments and sauces, partially offset by ongoing declines in infant nutrition in Italy. Lower pricing was primarily due to higher promotional activity in the
UK and Italy versus the prior period.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA was flat, including the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (1.6 pp). Excluding the currency impact, the increase was
primarily driven by productivity savings, partially offset by higher input costs in local currency.
Year Ended December 31, 2016 compared to the Year Ended January 3, 2016:
Net sales decreased 10.9% to $2.4 billion, reflecting the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency, divestitures, and a 53rd week of shipments in the prior
period. Pro forma net sales decreased 11.0% partially due to the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency (5.8 pp), divestitures (1.6 pp), and a 53rd week of
shipments in the prior period (1.0 pp). Organic Net Sales decreased 2.6% due to lower net pricing (2.5 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (0.1 pp). Lower net
pricing was primarily due to increased promotional activity across most categories versus the prior period. Unfavorable volume/mix was primarily due to
lower shipments across most categories in the UK partially offset by growth in condiments and sauces.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 16.7% partially due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (6.5 pp). Excluding the currency impact, the
Segment Adjusted EBITDA decline was primarily due to lower net pricing, the impact of a 53rd week of shipments (approximately 1.0 pp) in the prior period
as well as an increase in marketing investments, partially offset by savings in manufacturing costs.

Year Ended December 30, 2017 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016:
Net sales increased 3.9% to $3.3 billion despite the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (1.5 pp). Organic Net Sales increased 5.4% driven by higher
pricing (4.6 pp) and favorable volume/mix (0.8 pp). Higher pricing was primarily driven by pricing actions taken to offset higher input costs in local currency,
primarily in Latin America. Favorable volume/mix was primarily driven by growth in condiments and sauces across all regions partially offset by volume/mix
declines in several markets associated with distributor network re-alignment.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 6.1% including the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (3.4 pp). Excluding the currency impact, Segment Adjusted
EBITDA decreased primarily due to higher input costs in local currency and higher commercial investments partially offset by Organic Net Sales growth.
Year Ended December 31, 2016 compared to the Year Ended January 3, 2016:
Net sales decreased 4.0% to $3.2 billion, reflecting the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency and a 53rd week of shipments in the prior period, which were
partially offset by the inclusion of twelve months of the Kraft business in the current period. Pro forma net sales decreased 8.7% due to the unfavorable
impacts of foreign currency (13.2 pp, including a 10.5 pp impact from the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar) and a 53rd week of shipments in the prior
period (1.4 pp). Organic Net Sales increased 5.9% driven by higher net pricing (3.2 pp) and favorable volume/mix (2.7 pp). Higher net pricing was driven
primarily by pricing actions to offset higher input costs in local currency, primarily in Latin America. Favorable volume/mix was primarily driven by growth
in condiments and sauces across all regions, partially offset by declines in nutritional beverages in India.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 11.5% primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (17.4 pp, including a 14.0 pp impact from the
devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar). Excluding the currency impact, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased, primarily driven by organic sales growth that
was partially offset by increased marketing investments and a 53rd week of shipments (approximately 1.0 pp) in the prior period.
Critical Accounting Policies
Note 1, Background and Basis of Presentation, to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to
prepare our consolidated financial statements. The following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates, as well as the accounting policies
we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements.
Principles of Consolidation:
The consolidated financial statements include The Kraft Heinz Company, as well as our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany
transactions are eliminated.
Revenue Recognition:
We recognize revenues when title and risk of loss pass to our customers. We record revenues net of consumer incentives and trade promotions and include all
shipping and handling charges billed to customers. We also record provisions for estimated product returns and customer allowances as reductions to revenues
within the same period that the revenue is recognized. We base these estimates principally on historical and current period experience factors.
30
Advertising, Consumer Incentives, and Trade Promotions:
We promote our products with advertising, consumer incentives, and trade promotions. Consumer incentives and trade promotions include, but are not limited
to, discounts, coupons, rebates, performance based in-store display activities, and volume-based incentives. Consumer incentive and trade promotion
activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these
estimates principally on historical utilization, redemption rates, or current period experience factors. We review and adjust these estimates each quarter based
on actual experience and other information.
Advertising expenses are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”). For interim reporting purposes, we charge advertising to
operations as a percentage of estimated full year sales activity and marketing costs. We review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual
experience and other information. We recorded advertising expenses of $629 million in 2017, $708 million in 2016, and $464 million in 2015.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets:
The carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets was $98.5 billion at December 30, 2017 and $97.4 billion at December 31, 2016. These
balances are largely attributable to asset valuations performed in connection with the 2013 Merger and the 2015 Merger. See Note 2, Merger and Acquisition,
and Note 7, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for additional information.
We test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually in the second quarter or when a triggering event occurs. The first step
of the goodwill impairment test compares the reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets
exceeds its fair value, the second step would be applied to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill. If the
carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, the goodwill would be considered impaired and would be reduced to its implied fair value. We test
indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of each intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds fair
value, the intangible asset would be considered impaired and would be reduced to fair value.
We performed our annual impairment testing in the second quarter of 2017. No impairment of goodwill was reported as a result of our 2017 annual goodwill
impairment test. Each of our goodwill reporting units had excess fair value over its carrying value of at least 10% as of April 2, 2017 (our goodwill
impairment testing date). Additionally, as a result of our annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss
of $49 million in SG&A in 2017. This loss was due to continued declines in nutritional beverages in India. The loss was recorded in our Europe segment as
the related trademark is owned by our Italian subsidiary. Each of our other brands had excess fair value over its carrying value of at least 10% as of April 2,
2017.
Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates and market factors. Estimating the
fair value of individual reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well
as industry and economic conditions. These assumptions and estimates include projected revenues and income growth rates, terminal growth rates,
competitive and consumer trends, market-based discount rates, and other market factors. If current expectations of future growth rates are not met or market
factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then one or more of our reporting units or intangible assets might become impaired
in the future. Additionally, as goodwill and intangible assets associated with recently acquired businesses are recorded on the balance sheet at their estimated
acquisition date fair values, those amounts are more susceptible to an impairment risk if business operating results or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate.
Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated periods benefited, and are reviewed when appropriate for possible
impairment.
31
Postemployment Benefit Plans:
We maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees. These include pension benefits, postretirement health care benefits, and defined
contribution benefits. The cost of these plans is charged to expense over the working life of the covered employees. We generally amortize net actuarial gains
or losses in future periods within cost of products sold and SG&A.
For our postretirement benefit plans, our 2018 health care cost trend rate assumption will be 6.7%. We established this rate based upon our most recent
experience as well as our expectation for health care trend rates going forward. We anticipate the weighted average assumed ultimate trend rate will be 4.9%.
The year in which the ultimate trend rate is reached varies by plan, ranging between the years 2018 and 2030. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a
significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have had the
following effects, increase/(decrease) in cost and obligation, as of December 30, 2017 (in millions):
 One-Percentage-Point
 Increase  (Decrease)
Effect on annual service and interest cost $ 4 $ (3)
Effect on postretirement benefit obligation 55 (47)
Our 2018 discount rate assumption will be 3.6% for service cost and 3.0% for interest cost for our postretirement plans. Our 2018 discount rate assumption
will be 3.8% for service cost and 3.3% for interest cost for our U.S. pension plans and 3.0% for service cost and 2.2% for interest cost for our non-U.S.
pension plans. We model these discount rates using a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments with durations that match the expected future
cash flows of the plans. Changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of changes in bond yields year-over-year.
In 2016, we changed the method we use to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of net pension cost/(benefit) and net postretirement benefit
plan costs resulting in a decrease to these cost components. We now use a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the
specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. Previously, we estimated service cost
and interest cost using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the
period. We made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service cost and interest cost by improving the correlation between projected benefit
cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates. This change will not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations. We accounted for this
change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate.
Our 2018 expected return on plan assets will be 4.4% (net of applicable taxes) for our postretirement plans. Our 2018 expected rate of return on plan assets
will be 5.5% for our U.S. pension plans and 4.5% for our non-U.S. pension plans. We determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan
assets’ historical long-term investment performance, current and future asset allocation, and estimates of future long-term returns by asset class. We attempt to
maintain our target asset allocation by re-balancing between asset classes as we make contributions and monthly benefit payments.
While we do not anticipate further changes in the 2018 assumptions for our U.S. and non-U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans, as a sensitivity
measure, a 100-basis point change in our discount rate or a 100-basis-point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following
effects, increase/(decrease) in cost (in millions):
 U.S. Plans  Non-U.S. Plans
 100-Basis-Point  100-Basis-Point
 Increase  Decr ease  Increase  Decr ease
Effect of change in discount rate on pension costs $ 9 $ (19) $ 8 $ (21)
Effect of change in expected rate of return on plan assets on pension costs (46) 46 (41) 41
Effect of change in discount rate on postretirement costs (4) (9) — (1)
Effect of change in expected rate of return on plan assets on postretirement costs (11) 11 — —
32
Income Taxes:
We compute our annual tax rate based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we earn
income. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating the uncertainty of our tax positions. We recognize a benefit for
tax positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained upon examination. The amount of benefit recognized is the largest amount of benefit that
we believe has more than a 50% probability of being realized upon settlement. We regularly monitor our tax positions and adjust the amount of recognized tax
benefit based on our evaluation of information that has become available since the end of our last financial reporting period. The annual tax rate includes the
impact of these changes in recognized tax benefits. When adjusting the amount of recognized tax benefits, we do not consider information that has become
available after the balance sheet date, however we do disclose the effects of new information whenever those effects would be material to our financial
statements. Unrecognized tax benefits represent the difference between the amount of benefit taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the amount of
benefit recognized for financial reporting. These unrecognized tax benefits are recorded primarily within other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
We record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. When assessing the need for valuation
allowances, we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Should a change in circumstances lead to a change in
judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years, we would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in
circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or charge to income. The resolution of tax reserves and changes in valuation allowances could be
material to our results of operations for any period but is not expected to be material to our financial position.
U.S. Tax Reform significantly changed U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering the federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, effective January 1,
2018, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time toll charge on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 30,
2017. In addition, there are many new provisions, including changes to bonus depreciation, the deduction for executive compensation and interest expense, a
tax on global intangible low-taxed income provisions (“GILTI”), the base erosion anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”), and a deduction for foreign-derived intangible
income (“FDII”). The two material items that impacted us in 2017 were the corporate tax rate reduction and the one-time toll charge. While the corporate tax
rate reduction is effective January 1, 2018, we accounted for this anticipated rate change in 2017, the period of enactment.
The SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”), which provides us with up to one year to finalize accounting for the impacts of U.S. Tax
Reform. When the initial accounting for U.S Tax Reform impacts is incomplete, we may include provisional amounts when reasonable estimates can be made
or continue to apply the prior tax law if a reasonable estimate cannot be made. We have estimated the provisional tax impacts related to the toll charge, certain
components of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, including depreciation and executive compensation, and the change in our indefinite
reinvestment assertion. As a result, we recognized a net tax benefit of approximately $7.0 billion, including a reasonable estimate of our deferred income tax
benefit of approximately $7.5 billion related to the corporate rate change, which was partially offset by a reasonable estimate of $312 million for the toll
charge and approximately $125 million for other tax expenses, including a change in our indefinite reinvestment assertion. We have elected to account for the
tax on GILTI as a period cost and thus have not adjusted any of the deferred tax assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries for U.S. Tax Reform. The
ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts due to gathering additional information to more precisely compute the amount of tax, changes in
interpretations and assumptions, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions we may take. We expect to finalize accounting for the impacts
of U.S. Tax Reform when the 2017 U.S. corporate income tax return is filed in 2018.
In connection with U.S. Tax Reform, we have also reassessed our international investment assertions and no longer consider the historic earnings of our
foreign subsidiaries as of December 30, 2017 to be indefinitely reinvested. We have made a reasonable estimate of local country withholding taxes that would
be owed when our historic earnings are distributed. As a result, we have recorded deferred income taxes of $96 million on approximately $1.2 billion of
historic earnings.

Contingencies
See Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our contingencies.
33
Commodity Trends
We purchase and use large quantities of commodities, including dairy products, meat products, coffee beans, nuts, tomatoes, potatoes, soybean and vegetable
oils, sugar and other sweeteners, corn products, and wheat to manufacture our products. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of resins,
metals, and cardboard to package our products and natural gas to operate our facilities. We continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these
commodities.
We define our key commodities in the United States and Canada as dairy, meat, coffee, and nuts. In 2017, we experienced cost increases in our key
commodities, including dairy, meat, and coffee, while costs for nuts were flat. We manage commodity cost volatility primarily through pricing and risk
management strategies. As a result of these risk management strategies, our commodity costs may not immediately correlate with market price trends.
Dairy commodities, primarily milk and cheese, are the most significant cost components of our cheese products. We purchase our dairy raw material
requirements from independent third parties, such as agricultural cooperatives and independent processors. Market supply and demand, as well as government
programs, significantly influence the prices for milk and other dairy products. Significant cost components in our meat business include pork, beef, and
poultry, which we primarily purchase from applicable local markets. Livestock feed costs and the global supply and demand for U.S. meats influence the
prices of these meat products. The most significant cost component of our coffee products is coffee beans, which we purchase on global markets. Quality and
availability of supply, currency fluctuations, and consumer demand for coffee products impact coffee bean prices. The most significant cost components in
our nut products include peanuts, cashews, and almonds, which we purchase on both domestic and global markets, where global market supply and demand is
the primary driver of prices.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We believe that cash generated from our operating activities, securitization programs, commercial paper programs, and Senior Credit Facility (as defined
below) will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs, restructuring expenditures, planned capital expenditures, contributions to our
postemployment benefit plans, future contractual obligations (including repayments of long-term debt), and payment of our anticipated quarterly common
stock dividends. We intend to use our cash on hand and our commercial paper programs for daily funding requirements. Overall, we do not expect any
negative effects on our funding sources that would have a material effect on our short-term or long-term liquidity.
Cash Flow Activity for 2017 compared to 2016:
Net Cash Provided by/Used for Operating Activities:
Net cash provided by operating activities was $527 million for the year ended December 30, 2017 compared to $2.6 billion for the year ended December 31,
2016. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by the $1.2 billion pre-funding of our postretirement benefit plans in 2017,
lower collections on receivables as more were non-cash exchanged for sold receivables, favorable changes in accounts payable from vendor payment term
renegotiations that were less pronounced than the prior year, and increased cash payments of employee bonuses in 2017. The decrease in cash provided by
operating activities was partially offset by lower cash payments for income taxes in 2017 driven by our pre-funding of postretirement plan benefits following
U.S. Tax Reform enactment on December 22, 2017.
Net Cash Provided by/Used for Investing Activities:
Net cash provided by investing activities was $1.2 billion for the year ended December 30, 2017 compared to $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31,
2016. The decrease in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to lower cash inflows from our accounts receivable securitization and factoring
programs, as well as lower proceeds from cash settlements on net investment hedges. Capital expenditures were flat in 2017 compared to 2016. We expect
2018 capital expenditures to be approximately $850 million. The expected decrease is primarily attributed to the wind-up of footprint costs in the U.S. and
Canada related to our Integration Program.
Net Cash Provided by/Used for Financing Activities:
Net cash used for financing activities was $4.2 billion for the year ended December 30, 2017 compared to $4.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016.
The decrease was driven by the benefit of fewer dividend payments in 2017 compared to 2016, which more than offset higher net repayments of long-term
debt and commercial paper in 2017 compared to 2016, including cash outflows associated with the redemption of our Series A Preferred Stock in 2016.
Dividend payments were lower in 2017 compared to 2016 due to the absence of the Series A Preferred Stock dividend and the impact of four common stock
cash distributions in 2017 compared to five such distributions in 2016. See Equity and Dividends for additional information on cash distributions related to
common stock and Series A Preferred Stock.
34
Cash Flow Activity for 2016 compared to 2015:
Net Cash Provided by/Used for Operating Activities:
Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.6 billion in 2016 compared to $1.3 billion in 2015. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was
primarily due to an increase in operating income as a result of the 2015 Merger, as well as favorable changes in accounts payable due to payment term
extensions from vendor renegotiations. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by lower collections on receivables as more
were non-cash exchanged for sold receivables, as well as unfavorable changes in other current liabilities, and to a lesser degree, inventories. The change in
other current liabilities was primarily driven by increased payments in 2016 related to income taxes.
Net Cash Provided by/Used for Investing Activities:
Net cash provided by investing activities was $1.5 billion in 2016 compared to net cash used for investing activities of $8.3 billion in 2015. The change was
primarily driven by increased cash inflows from our accounts receivable securitization and factoring programs, partially offset by an increase in capital
expenditures and lower proceeds from cash settlements on net investment hedges. Capital expenditures increased to $1.2 billion in 2016 primarily due to
integration and restructuring activities in the United States. The change also reflected cash paid to acquire Kraft in 2015. See Note 2, Merger and Acquisition,
to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the 2015 Merger.
Net Cash Provided by/Used for Financing Activities:
Net cash used for financing activities was $4.6 billion in 2016 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $10.0 billion in 2015. This decrease in
cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by proceeds of $10.0 billion from our issuance of common stock to the Sponsors in connection
with the 2015 Merger, the Series A Preferred Stock redemption in June 2016, and the impact of five common stock cash distributions in 2016 compared to
two such cash distributions in 2015. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by net proceeds from our long-term debt
issuances in May 2016 and net proceeds from our issuance of commercial paper, which were our primary sources of funding for the Series A Preferred Stock
redemption. Additionally, in the prior year we had a benefit from proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, which were largely offset by repayments of
long-term debt. Our cash used for financing activities in 2016 also reflected the impact of one cash distribution related to our Series A Preferred Stock in 2016
compared to five such cash distributions in 2015. See Equity and Dividends within this item for additional information on cash distributions related to
common stock and Series A Preferred Stock.
Cash Held by International Subsidiaries:
Of the $1.6 billion cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet at December 30, 2017, $1.1 billion was held by international subsidiaries.
In the future, we could repatriate up to approximately $6.5 billion of international cash to the U.S. without incurring any additional significant income tax
expense. Our approximately $5.0 billion of unremitted historic earnings of our foreign subsidiaries was taxed via the U.S. Tax Reform toll charge in 2017. In
connection with U.S. Tax Reform, we have also reassessed our international investment assertions and no longer consider these earnings to be indefinitely
reinvested. We have made a reasonable estimate of local country withholding taxes that would be owed when our historic earnings are distributed. As a result,
we have recorded an estimate of $96 million related to deferred income taxes to reflect local country withholding taxes that will be owed when this cash is
distributed. The remaining amount of up to approximately $1.5 billion represents intercompany loans and previously taxed income which could be repatriated
to the U.S. without incurring any additional significant income tax expense.
Total Debt:
In 2017, we obtained funding through our U.S. and European commercial paper programs. As of December 30, 2017, we had $448 million of commercial
paper outstanding, with a weighted average interest rate of 1.541%. As of December 31, 2016, we had $642 million of commercial paper outstanding, with a
weighted average interest rate of 1.074%. The maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during the year ended December 30, 2017 was $1.2 billion.
We maintain our $4.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Senior Credit Facility”). Subject to certain conditions, we may increase the
amount of revolving commitments and/or add additional tranches of term loans in a combined aggregate amount of up to $1.0 billion. Our Senior Credit
Facility contains customary representations, covenants, and events of default. No amounts were drawn on our Senior Credit Facility at December 30, 2017, at
December 31, 2016, or during the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and January 3, 2016.
In August 2017, we repaid $600 million aggregate principal amount of our previously outstanding senior unsecured loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility”).
Accordingly, there were no amounts outstanding on the Term Loan Facility at December 30, 2017. At December 31, 2016, $600 million aggregate principal
amount of our Term Loan Facility was outstanding.
35
Our long-term debt, including the current portion, was $31.1 billion at December 30, 2017 and $31.8 billion at December 31, 2016. The decrease in long-term
debt was primarily due to our June 2017 repayment of approximately $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes that matured in the period and
our August 2017 repayment of the $600 million aggregate principal amount Term Loan Facility. The decrease was partially offset by approximately $1.5
billion aggregate principal amount of long-term debt issued in August 2017. Our long-term debt contains customary representations, covenants, and events of
default. We were in compliance with all such covenants at December 30, 2017. See Note 16, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional
information.
We have approximately $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount and $C200 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes that will mature in the third
quarter of 2018. We expect to fund these long-term debt repayments primarily with new long-term debt issuances, cash on hand, and cash generated from our
operating activities.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:
We do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements that we believe are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.
See Note 14, Financing Arrangements, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounts receivable securitization and factoring
programs and other financing arrangements.
Aggregate Contractual Obligations:
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 30, 2017 (in millions):

Other long-term liabilities(e) 80 106 94 280 560
Total 5,715 7,208 6,903 33,664 53,490
(a)  Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our long-term debt, including interest on variable and fixed rate long-term debt. Interest on variable rate long-term debt is calculated based on
interest rates at December 30, 2017.
(b)  Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our capital leases, including expected cash payments of interest expense.
(c)Operating leases represent the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases.
(d)We have purchase obligations for materials, supplies, property, plant and equipment, and co-packing, storage and distribution services based on projected needs to be utilized in the normal
course of business. Other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing, advertising, capital expenditures, information technology, and professional services. Arrangements are
considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure, and approximate timing of the transaction.
A few of these obligations are long-term and are based on minimum purchase requirements. Certain purchase obligations contain variable pricing components, and, as a result, actual cash
payments are expected to fluctuate based on changes in these variable components. Due to the proprietary nature of some of our materials and processes, certain supply contracts contain penalty
provisions for early terminations. We do not believe that a material amount of penalties is reasonably likely to be incurred under these contracts based upon historical experience and current
expectations. We exclude amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities from the table above.
(e) Other long-term liabilities primarily consist of estimated payments for the one-time toll charge related to U.S. tax reform, as well as postretirement benefit commitments. Certain other long-term
liabilities related to income taxes, insurance accruals, and other accruals included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the above table as we are unable to estimate the timing of
payments for these items. Future payments related to other long-term liabilities decreased primarily due to payments of $1.2 billion in 2017 to pre-fund a portion of our U.S. postretirement plan
benefits. See Note 10, Postemployment Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
During the second quarter of 2016, we redeemed all outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, therefore we no longer pay Series A Preferred Stock
dividends. See Note 17, Capital Stock, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Pension plan contributions were $330 million in 2017. We estimate that 2018 pension plan contributions will be approximately $50 million. Beyond 2018, we
are unable to reliably estimate the timing of contributions to our pension plans. Our actual contributions and plans may change due to many factors, including
the timing of regulatory approval for the windup of certain non-U.S. pension plans, changes in tax, employee benefit, or other laws and regulations, tax
deductibility, significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates, or other factors. As such, estimated pension plan
contributions for 2018 have been excluded from the above table.
Postretirement benefit plan contributions were $1.3 billion in 2017, including payments of $1.2 billion to pre-fund a portion of our U.S. postretirement plan
benefits following enactment of U.S. Tax Reform on December 22, 2017. We estimate that 2018 postretirement benefit plan contributions will be
approximately $15 million. Beyond 2018, we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of contributions to our postretirement benefit plans. Our actual
contributions and plans may change due to many factors, including changes in tax, employee benefit, or other laws and regulations, tax deductibility,
significant differences between expected and actual postretirement plan asset performance or interest rates, or other factors. As such, estimated postretirement
benefit plan contributions for 2018 have been excluded from the above table.
At December 30, 2017, the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, including an accrual of related interest and penalties along
with positions only impacting the timing of tax benefits, was approximately $428 million. The timing of payments will depend on the progress of
examinations with tax authorities. We do not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year. We are unable to make a
reasonably reliable estimate as to if or when any significant cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur; therefore, we have excluded the amount of net
unrecognized tax benefits from the above table.
Equity and Dividends
Series A Preferred Stock Dividends:
On June 7, 2016, we redeemed all outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock. Accordingly, we no longer pay any associated dividends, and there
were no such dividend payments in 2017.
Prior to the redemption, we made cash distributions of $180 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $900 million in 2015. Our Series A Preferred
Stock entitled holders to a 9.00% annual dividend, to be paid in four dividends, in arrears on each March 7, June 7, and December 7, in cash. In 2015, there
were five dividend payments because, concurrent with the declaration of our common stock dividend on December 8, 2015, we also declared and paid the
Series A Preferred Stock dividend that would otherwise have been payable on March 7, 2016. Accordingly, there were no cash distributions related to our
Series A Preferred Stock in the first quarter of 2016, resulting in only one dividend payment in 2016 prior to redemption.
See Note 17, Capital Stock, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Series A Preferred Stock.
Common Stock Dividends:
We paid common stock dividends of $2.9 billion in 2017, $3.6 billion in 2016, and $1.3 billion in 2015. Additionally, on February 16, 2018, our Board of
Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.625 per share of common stock, which is payable on March 23, 2018 to shareholders of record on March 9, 2018.
The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends on various factors, including our net income, financial
condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making.

Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information
The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is presented to illustrate the estimated effects of the 2015 Merger, which was
consummated on July 2, 2015, and the related equity investments, based on the historical results of operations of Heinz and Kraft. See Note 1, Background
and Basis of Presentation, and Note 2, Merger and Acquisition, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the 2015 Merger.
The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income for the year ended January 3, 2016 is based on the historical financial
statements of Heinz and Kraft after giving effect to the 2015 Merger, related equity investments, and the assumptions and adjustments described in the
accompanying notes to this unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income.
The Kraft Heinz statement of income information for the year ended January 3, 2016 was derived from the consolidated financial statements included
elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The historical Kraft statement of income includes information for the six months ended June 27, 2015 derived from Kraft’s
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 7, 2016 and information for
the period from June 27, 2015 to July 2, 2015 derived from Kraft’s books and records.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income are presented as if the 2015 Merger had been consummated on December 30, 2013, the
first business day of our 2014 fiscal year, and combine the historical results of Heinz and Kraft. This is consistent with internal management reporting. The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income set forth below primarily give effect to the following assumptions and adjustments:
•Application of the acquisition method of accounting;
•The issuance of Heinz common stock to the Sponsors in connection with the equity investments;
•The pre-closing Heinz share conversion;
•The exchange of one share of Kraft Heinz common stock for each share of Kraft common stock; and
•Conformance of accounting policies.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other
things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the completion of the acquisition. We
utilized estimated fair values at the 2015 Merger Date to allocate the total consideration exchanged to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. This allocation was final as of July 3, 2016.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared in accordance with SEC Regulation S-X Article 11 and is not
necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been realized had the transactions been completed as of the dates indicated, nor are they
meant to be indicative of our anticipated combined future results. In addition, the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of
income do not reflect any additional anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies, cost savings, or any integration costs that may result from the 2015 Merger.
The historical consolidated financial information has been adjusted in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income to
give effect to unaudited pro forma events that are (1) directly attributable to the transaction, (2) factually supportable and (3) are expected to have a
continuing impact on the results of operations of the combined company. As a result, under SEC Regulation S-X Article 11, certain expenses such as deal
costs and non-cash costs related to the fair value step-up of inventory (“Inventory Step-up Costs”), if applicable, are eliminated from pro forma results in the
periods presented. In contrast, under the ASC 805 presentation in Note 2, Merger and Acquisition, to the consolidated financial statements, these expenses are
required to be included in prior year pro forma results.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, including the related notes, should be read in conjunction with the historical
consolidated financial statements and related notes of Kraft, and with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The
historical SEC filings of Kraft are available to the public at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.

Adjustments included in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income are as follows:
(a)Represents the change to align Kraft's accounting policy to our accounting policy for postemployment benefit plans. Kraft historically elected a mark-to-market accounting policy and
recognized net actuarial gains or losses and changes in the fair value of plan assets immediately in earnings upon remeasurement. Our policy is to initially record such items in other
comprehensive income/(loss). Also represents the elimination of Kraft’s historical amortization of postemployment benefit plan prior service credits.
(b)Represents the elimination of nonrecurring non-cash costs related to the fair value adjustment of Kraft’s inventory. See Note 2, Merger and Acquisition, to the consolidated financial statements
for additional information on the determination of fair values.
(c)Represents incremental amortization resulting from the fair value adjustment of Kraft’s definite-lived intangible assets in connection with the 2015 Merger. The net change in depreciation
expense resulting from the fair value adjustment of property, plant, and equipment was insignificant. See Note 2, Merger and Acquisition, to the consolidated financial statements for additional
information on the determination of fair values.
(d)Represents the incremental compensation expense due to the fair value remeasurement of certain of Kraft’s equity awards in connection with the 2015 Merger. See Note 9, Employees’ Stock
Incentive Plans, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the conversion of Kraft’s equity awards in connection with the 2015 Merger.
(e)Represents the elimination of non-recurring deal costs incurred in connection with the 2015 Merger.
(f)Represents the incremental change in interest expense resulting from the fair value adjustment of Kraft’s long-term debt in connection with the 2015 Merger, including the elimination of the
historical amortization of deferred financing fees and amortization of original issuance discount.
We calculated the income tax effect of the pro forma adjustments using a 38.5% weighted average statutory tax rate for the periods presented.
Additionally, for 2015, we calculated the unaudited pro forma weighted average number of basic shares outstanding by adding the Kraft Heinz weighted
average number of basic shares outstanding (which included the Sponsors' shares and the converted Kraft shares weighted for the period from the 2015
Merger through the year ended January 3, 2016) and the Sponsors' shares (as converted) and the converted Kraft shares (both weighted from the beginning of
the year through the 2015 Merger Date). We calculated the unaudited pro forma weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding by adding the effect
of dilutive securities to the unaudited pro forma weighted average number of basic shares outstanding, including dilutive securities related to Kraft Heinz. The
Kraft Heinz diluted EPS calculation did not include these securities as Kraft Heinz was in a net loss position and such securities were anti-dilutive.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The non-GAAP financial measures we provide in this report should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, results prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).
To supplement the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have presented Organic Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, and
Adjusted EPS, which are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures presented may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP
financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define these non-GAAP financial measures in the same way. These measures
are not substitutes for their comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, such as net sales, net income/(loss), diluted earnings per common share (“EPS”), or
other measures prescribed by U.S. GAAP, and there are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures.
Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assist in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making
by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations. Management believes that presenting our
non-GAAP financial measures (i.e., Organic Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EPS) is useful to investors because it (i) provides investors with
meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items, (ii) permits investors to view performance using the same
tools that management uses to budget, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate historical performance, and (iii) otherwise provides supplemental
information that may be useful to investors in evaluating our results. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when
considered together with the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provides investors with additional
understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures.
Organic Net Sales is defined as net sales excluding, when they occur, the impact of acquisitions, currency, divestitures, and a 53rd week of shipments. We
calculate the impact of currency on net sales by holding exchange rates constant at the previous year’s exchange rate, with the exception of Venezuela
following our June 28, 2015 currency devaluation, for which we calculate the previous year’s results using the current year’s exchange rate. Organic Net
Sales for any period prior to the 2015 Merger Date includes the operating results of Kraft on a pro forma basis, as if Kraft had been acquired as of December
30, 2013. Organic Net Sales is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of
certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) from continuing operations before interest expense, other expense/(income), net, and provision for/(benefit
from) income taxes; in addition to these adjustments, we exclude, when they occur, the impacts of depreciation and amortization (excluding integration and
restructuring expenses; including amortization of postretirement benefit plans prior service credits), integration and restructuring expenses, merger costs,
unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges, impairment losses, losses/(gains) on the sale of a business, nonmonetary currency devaluation (e.g.,
remeasurement gains and losses), and equity award compensation expense (excluding integration and restructuring expenses). Adjusted EBITDA for any
period prior to the 2015 Merger Date includes the operating results of Kraft on a pro forma basis, as if Kraft had been acquired as of December 30, 2013.
Adjusted EBITDA is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain
items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations.
Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share excluding, when they occur, the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses, merger costs,
unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges, impairment losses, losses/(gains) on the sale of a business, nonmonetary currency devaluation (e.g.,
remeasurement gains and losses), and U.S. Tax Reform, and including, when they occur, adjustments to reflect preferred stock dividend payments on an
accrual basis. Adjusted EPS for any period prior to the 2015 Merger Date includes the operating results of Kraft on a pro forma basis, as if Kraft had been
acquired as of December 30, 2013. We believe Adjusted EPS provides important comparability of underlying operating results, allowing investors and
management to assess operating performance on a consistent basis.

(f)  For Adjusted EPS, we present the impact of the Series A Preferred Stock dividend payments on an accrual basis. Accordingly, we included adjustments to EPS to exclude $180 million of Series
A Preferred Stock dividends from the fourth quarter of 2015 (to reflect the March 7, 2016 Series A Preferred Stock dividend that was paid in December 2015), to include such $180 million
Series A Preferred Stock dividend payment in the first quarter of 2016, and to exclude $51 million of Series A Preferred Stock dividends from the second quarter of 2016 (to reflect that it was
redeemed on June 7, 2016).
(g)U.S. Tax Reform included a tax benefit of $7.0 billion in 2017 related to enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act by the U.S. government on December 22, 2017. There were no such expenses in
2016 or 2015. See Overview at the beginning of this item for additional information.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
We are exposed to market risks from adverse changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, interest rates, and production costs. We monitor and
manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets
and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that volatility in these markets may have on our operating results. We maintain risk management policies
that principally use derivative financial instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may arise from variations
in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. See Note 1, Background and Basis of Presentation, and Note 11, Financial
Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements for details of our market risk management policies and the financial instruments used to hedge those
exposures.
By policy, we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.
Effect of Hypothetical 10% Fluctuation in Market Prices: 
The potential gain or loss on the fair value of our outstanding commodity contracts, foreign exchange contracts, cross-currency, and swap contracts, assuming
a hypothetical 10% fluctuation in commodity prices, currency rates, and swap rates, would be (in millions):
 December 30,
2017
(52 weeks)  December 31,
2016
(52 weeks)
Commodity contracts $ 23 $ 39
Foreign currency contracts 173 179
Cross-currency swap contracts 287 306
It should be noted that any change in the fair value of the contracts, real or hypothetical, would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the
underlying hedged items. In relation to foreign currency contracts, this hypothetical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same
direction relative to the U.S. dollar. Our utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior
year. Changes in our portfolio of financial instruments are a function of our results of operations, debt repayment and debt issuances, market effects on debt
and foreign currency, and our acquisition and divestiture activities.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of The Kraft Heinz Company
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Kraft Heinz Company and its subsidiaries as of December 30, 2017 and December 31,
2016, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 30, 2017, including the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as
the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2017, based on
criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
30, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it presents cash receipts relating to beneficial
interests obtained in securitized trade receivables in 2017.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and
for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's
internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
47
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Kraft Heinz Company
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1. Background and Basis of Presentation
Description of the Company
We manufacture and market food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee,
and other grocery products throughout the world.
Organization
On July 2, 2015 (the “2015 Merger Date”), through a series of transactions, we consummated the merger of Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (“Kraft”) with and into a
wholly-owned subsidiary of H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation (“Heinz”) (the “2015 Merger”). At the closing of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was renamed The
Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz”). Before the consummation of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was controlled by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ("Berkshire
Hathaway") and 3G Global Food Holdings, L.P. (“3G Capital”) (together, the "Sponsors"), following their acquisition of H. J. Heinz Company (the “2013
Merger”) on June 7, 2013. See Note 2, Merger and Acquisition, for additional information on the 2015 Merger.
Immediately prior to the consummation of the 2015 Merger, each share of Heinz issued and outstanding common stock was reclassified and changed into
0.443332 of a share of Kraft Heinz common stock. All share and per share amounts in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial
statements and related notes have been retroactively adjusted for all historical periods presented prior to the 2015 Merger Date to give effect to this
conversion, including reclassifying an amount equal to the change in value of common stock to additional paid-in capital. In the 2015 Merger, all outstanding
shares of Kraft common stock were converted into the right to receive, on a one-for-one basis, shares of Kraft Heinz common stock. Deferred shares and
restricted shares of Kraft were converted to deferred shares and restricted shares of Kraft Heinz, as applicable. In addition, upon the completion of the 2015
Merger, the Kraft shareholders of record immediately prior to the closing of the 2015 Merger received a special cash dividend of $16.50 per share.
The Sponsors initially owned 850 million shares of common stock in Heinz. Berkshire Hathaway also held a warrant to purchase 46 million additional shares
of common stock, which it exercised in June 2015. Additionally, in connection with the 2013 Merger, we issued an $8.0 billion preferred stock investment in
Heinz which entitled Berkshire Hathaway to a 9.00% annual dividend. Prior to, but in connection with, the 2015 Merger, the Sponsors made equity
investments whereby they purchased an additional 500 million newly issued shares of Heinz common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 billion.
Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation:
The consolidated financial statements include The Kraft Heinz Company, as well as our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany
transactions are eliminated.
Use of Estimates:
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.
GAAP”), which requires us to make accounting policy elections, estimates, and assumptions that affect a number of amounts in our consolidated financial
statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. If actual amounts differ from estimates, we
include the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period the actual amounts become known. Historically, the aggregate differences, if any,
between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
Translation of Foreign Currencies:
For all significant foreign operations, the functional currency is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated at the exchange rate
in effect at each period end. Income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the period. Translation adjustments
arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) on
the balance sheet. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net income/(loss) for the period.
55
Highly Inflationary Accounting:
We apply highly inflationary accounting if the cumulative inflation rate in an economy for a three-year period meets or exceeds 100 percent. Under highly
inflationary accounting, the financial statements of a subsidiary are remeasured into our reporting currency (U.S. dollars) based on the legally available
exchange rate at which we expect to settle the underlying transactions. Exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities
are reflected in net income/(loss), rather than accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) on the balance sheet, until such time as the economy is no
longer considered highly inflationary. Certain non-monetary assets and liabilities are recorded at the applicable historical exchange rates. We apply highly
inflationary accounting to the results of our Venezuelan subsidiary.
Cash and Cash Equivalents:
Cash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Inventories:
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We value inventories primarily using the average cost method.
Property, Plant and Equipment:
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Machinery
and equipment are depreciated over periods ranging from three to 20 years and buildings and improvements over periods up to 40 years. Capitalized software
costs are included in property, plant and equipment and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software, which do not exceed
seven years. We review long-lived assets for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
Such conditions include significant adverse changes in the business climate, current-period operating or cash flow losses, significant declines in forecasted
operations, or a current expectation that an asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow
analyses to determine if an impairment exists. When testing for impairment of assets held for use, we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which
cash flows are separately identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Impairment losses on assets
to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets:
We test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually in the second quarter or when a triggering event occurs. The first step
of the goodwill impairment test compares the reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets
exceeds its fair value, the second step would be applied to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill. If the
carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, the goodwill would be considered impaired and would be reduced to its implied fair value. We test
indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of each intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds fair
value, the intangible asset would be considered impaired and would be reduced to fair value.
Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates and market factors. Estimating the
fair value of individual reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well
as industry and economic conditions. These assumptions and estimates include projected revenues and income growth rates, terminal growth rates,
competitive and consumer trends, market-based discount rates, and other market factors. If current expectations of future growth rates are not met or market
factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then one or more of our reporting units or intangible assets might become impaired
in the future. Additionally, as goodwill and intangible assets associated with recently acquired businesses are recorded on the balance sheet at their estimated
acquisition date fair values, those amounts are more susceptible to an impairment risk if business operating results or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate.
We performed our annual impairment testing in the second quarter of 2017. See Note 7, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for additional information.
Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated periods benefited, and are reviewed when appropriate for possible
impairment.
Revenue Recognition:
We recognize revenues when title and risk of loss pass to our customers. We record revenues net of consumer incentives and trade promotions and include all
shipping and handling charges billed to customers. We also record provisions for estimated product returns and customer allowances as reductions to revenues
within the same period that the revenue is recognized. We base these estimates principally on historical and current period experience factors.
56
Advertising, Consumer Incentives, and Trade Promotions:
We promote our products with advertising, consumer incentives, and trade promotions. Consumer incentives and trade promotions include, but are not limited
to, discounts, coupons, rebates, performance based in-store display activities, and volume-based incentives. Consumer incentive and trade promotion
activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these
estimates principally on historical utilization, redemption rates, or current period experience factors. We review and adjust these estimates each quarter based
on actual experience and other information.
Advertising expenses are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”). For interim reporting purposes, we charge advertising to
operations as a percentage of estimated full year sales activity and marketing costs. We review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual
experience and other information. We recorded advertising expenses of $629 million in 2017, $708 million in 2016, and $464 million in 2015.
Research and Development Expense:
We expense costs as incurred for product research and development within SG&A. Research and development expense was approximately $93 million in
2017, $120 million in 2016, and $105 million in 2015.
Postemployment Benefit Plans:
We maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees. These include pension benefits, postretirement health care benefits, and defined
contribution benefits. The cost of these plans is charged to expense over the working life of the covered employees. We generally amortize net actuarial gains
or losses in future periods within cost of products sold and SG&A.
Financial Instruments:
As we source our commodities on global markets and periodically enter into financing or other arrangements abroad, we use a variety of risk management
strategies and financial instruments to manage commodity price, foreign currency exchange rate, and interest rate risks. Our risk management program
focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our
operating results. One way we do this is through actively hedging our risks through the use of derivative instruments. As a matter of policy, we do not use
highly leveraged derivative instruments, nor do we use financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value, which fluctuates based on changing market conditions.
Certain derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, while others are not designated as hedging instruments and
are marked to market through earnings. The effective portion of gains and losses on cash flow hedges are deferred as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income/(losses) and are recognized in earnings at the time the hedged item affects earnings, in the same line item as the underlying hedged
item. We also designate certain derivatives and non-derivatives as net investment hedges to hedge the net assets of certain foreign subsidiaries which are
exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The fair value of these derivatives and remeasurements of our non-derivatives designated as net
investment hedges are calculated each period with changes reported in foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive
income/(losses). Such amounts will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) until the complete or substantially complete liquidation of
our investment in the underlying foreign operations. The income statement classification of gains and losses related to derivative instruments not designated
as hedging instruments is determined based on the underlying intent of the contracts. Cash flows related to the settlement of derivative instruments designated
as net investment hedges of foreign operations are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within investing activities. All other cash flows
related to derivative instruments are generally classified within operating activities. For additional information on derivative activity within our operating
results, see Note 11, Financial Instruments.
To qualify for hedge accounting, a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged must be achieved at
inception and maintained throughout the hedged period. Any hedging ineffectiveness is recognized in net earnings when the change in the value of the hedge
does not offset the change in the value of the underlying hedged item. We formally document our risk management objectives, strategies for undertaking the
various hedge transactions, the nature of and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items, and method for assessing hedge effectiveness.
Additionally, for qualified hedges of forecasted transactions, we specifically identify the significant characteristics and expected terms of the forecasted
transactions. If it becomes probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, the hedge will no longer be effective and all of the derivative gains or losses
would be recognized in earnings in the current period.
Unrealized gains and losses on our commodity derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in general corporate expenses until realized.
Once realized, the gains and losses are recorded within the applicable segment operating results.
57
When we use financial instruments, we are exposed to credit risk that a counterparty might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of our
agreement. We minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure
we have with each counterparty, and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. We also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant, non-
exchange traded derivative contracts with a duration of greater than one year be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master
agreement. We are also exposed to market risk as the value of our financial instruments might be adversely affected by a change in foreign currency exchange
rates, commodity prices, or interest rates. We manage market risk by incorporating monitoring parameters within our risk management strategy that limit the
types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that we hedge with derivative instruments.
Foreign currency cash flow hedges:
We use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and intercompany actual and forecasted
transactions. Our principal foreign currency exposures that are hedged include the British pound sterling, euro, and Canadian dollar. These instruments
include forward foreign exchange contracts. Substantially all of these derivative instruments are highly effective and qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
We exclude forward points from the assessment and measurement of hedge ineffectiveness and report such amounts in current period net income as interest
expense.
Net investment hedges:
We have numerous investments in our foreign subsidiaries, the net assets of which are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage
this risk by utilizing derivative and non-derivative instruments, including cross-currency swap contracts and certain foreign denominated debt designated as
net investment hedges.
Interest rate cash flow hedges: 
From time to time, we have used derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. We have primarily
used interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of interest payment cash flows on a portion of our future debt obligations. Substantially all of these derivative
instruments have been highly effective and have qualified for hedge accounting treatment.
Commodity derivatives:
We are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we primarily use as raw materials. We enter into commodity purchase
contracts primarily for coffee beans, meat products, sugar, wheat products, corn products, vegetable oils, cocoa products, and dairy products. These
commodity purchase contracts generally are not subject to the accounting requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities under the normal
purchases exception. We also use commodity futures and options to economically hedge the price of certain commodity costs, including coffee beans, meat
products, sugar, wheat products, corn products, vegetable oils, cocoa products, dairy products, diesel fuel, and packaging products. We do not designate these
commodity contracts as hedging instruments. We also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments, and we occasionally use related
futures to economically cross hedge a commodity exposure.
Income Taxes:
We recognize income taxes based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and record deferred tax assets or liabilities for any difference
between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting. We also recognize deferred tax assets for temporary differences, operating loss carryforwards, and tax
credit carryforwards. Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, planning opportunities, and expectations about
future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, is dependent upon generating sufficient
taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods.
We apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax
benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate
resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect income in the quarter of such change.
We record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. When assessing the need for valuation
allowances, we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Should a change in circumstances lead to a change in
judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years, we would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in
circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or charge to income. The resolution of tax reserves and changes in valuation allowances could be
material to our results of operations for any period, but is not expected to be material to our financial position.
58
Common Stock and Preferred Stock Dividends:
Dividends are recorded as a reduction to retained earnings. When we have an accumulated deficit, dividends are recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in
capital.
New Accounting Pronouncements
Accounting Standards Adopted in the Current Year:
In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued accounting standards update (“ASU”) 2016-09 related to equity-based award
accounting and presentation. Under this guidance, excess tax benefits upon the exercise of share- based payment awards are recognized in our tax provision
rather than within equity. Cash flows related to excess tax benefits are classified as operating activities rather than financing activities. Additionally, cash
flows related to employee tax withholdings on restricted share vesting are classified as financing activities. This ASU became effective in the first quarter of
2017. We adopted the guidance related to excess tax benefits on a prospective basis. As a result, we recognized a tax benefit of $22 million in our
consolidated statement of income for 2017 related to our excess tax benefits upon the exercise of share-based payment awards. We retrospectively adopted the
guidance related to cash flow classification of employee tax withholdings on restricted share vesting. This guidance did not have a material impact on our
consolidated statement of cash flows for 2016. The impact on our consolidated statement of cash flows for 2015 was a $31 million decrease to cash flows
provided by financing activities and a corresponding increase to cash flows provided by operating activities. Our equity award compensation cost continues to
reflect estimated forfeitures.
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15 related to the classification of certain cash payments and cash receipts on the statement of cash flows. This
ASU provided guidance on eight specific cash flow classification matters, which must be adopted in the same period using a retrospective transition
method. We early adopted this ASU in the first quarter of 2017. We now classify consideration received for beneficial interest obtained for transferring trade
receivables in securitization transactions as investing activities instead of operating activities. Accordingly, we reclassified cash receipts from the payments on
sold receivables (which are cash receipts on the underlying trade receivables that have already been securitized) to cash provided by investing activities (from
cash provided by operating activities). The impact on our consolidated statement of cash flows was $2.6 billion for 2016, and $1.3 billion for 2015. In
connection with the adoption of ASU 2016-15, we also corrected other immaterial cash flow misstatements within operating activities, which had misstated
the amount of beneficial interest obtained in the non-cash exchange from the securitization of trade receivables. Additionally, we now classify cash payments
for debt prepayment and debt extinguishment costs as cash outflows from financing activities rather than cash outflows from operating activities. The impact
on our consolidated statement of cash flows for 2015 was a $105 million decrease to cash provided by financing activities and a corresponding increase to
cash provided by operating activities. There was no impact on our consolidated statement of cash flows for 2016.
In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18 requiring the statement of cash flows to explain the change in restricted cash and restricted cash
equivalents, in addition to cash and cash equivalents. We early adopted this ASU in the first quarter of 2017. Accordingly, we restated our cash and cash
equivalents balances in the consolidated statements of cash flows to include restricted cash of $51 million at December 31, 2016, $75 million at January 3,
2016, and $12 million at December 28, 2014. Additionally, cash provided by investing activities in 2016 decreased by $24 million and cash used for investing
activities in 2015 decreased by $64 million. As required by the ASU, we have provided a reconciliation from cash and cash equivalents as presented on our
condensed consolidated balance sheets to cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as reported on our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. See
Note 4, Restricted Cash, for this reconciliation, as well as a discussion of the nature of our restricted cash balances.
Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted:
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, which superseded previously existing revenue recognition guidance. Under this ASU, companies will apply a
principles-based five step model to recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers and in an amount that reflects the
consideration for which the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU will be effective beginning in the first
quarter of our fiscal year 2018. The ASU may be applied using a full retrospective method or a modified retrospective transition method, with a cumulative-
effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The ASU also provides for certain practical expedients, including the option to expense as incurred the
incremental costs of obtaining a contract, if the contract period is for one year or less. We plan to use this practical expedient upon adoption of this ASU; the
impact is expected to be insignificant as this expedient aligns with our current practice. Additionally, we plan to make the following policy elections upon
adoption of this ASU in the first quarter of 2018: (i) we will account for shipping and handling costs as contract fulfillment costs, and (ii) we will exclude
taxes imposed on and collected from customers in revenue producing transactions (e.g, sales, use, and value added taxes) from the transaction price. We
expect that the impact of adopting this guidance will be immaterial to our financial statements and related disclosures. There will be no impact to net income
upon adoption of this ASU. We will adopt this ASU using the full retrospective method on the first day of our fiscal year 2018.
59
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which superseded previously existing leasing guidance. The ASU is intended to establish the principles
that lessees and lessors shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising
from a lease. The new guidance requires lessees to reflect most leases on their balance sheets as assets and obligations. This ASU will be effective beginning
in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The new guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition, and
provides for certain practical expedients. While we are still evaluating the impact this ASU will have on our financial statements and related disclosures, we
have completed our scoping reviews and have made progress in our assessment phase. We have identified our significant leases by geography and by asset
type as well as our leasing processes which will be impacted by the new standard. Furthermore, we have developed a data extraction strategy, made
significant progress on lease data collection efforts, and identified an accounting system to support the future state leasing process. We have also made
progress in developing the policy elections we will make upon adoption. We expect that our financial statement disclosures will be expanded to present
additional details of our leasing arrangements. At this time, we are unable to reasonably estimate the expected increase in assets and liabilities on our
condensed consolidated balance sheets upon adoption. We will adopt this ASU on the first day of our fiscal year 2019.
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16 related to the income tax accounting impacts of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory, such as
intellectual property and property, plant and equipment. Under the new accounting guidance, current and deferred income taxes should be recognized upon
transfer of the assets. Previously, recognition of current and deferred income taxes was prohibited until the asset was sold to an external party. This ASU will
be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018. The new guidance must be adopted on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-
effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the adoption period. We will adopt this ASU on the first day of our fiscal year 2018. While we
are still evaluating the impact of this ASU, we currently anticipate a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of approximately $100 million upon
adoption.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 related to goodwill impairment testing. This ASU eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.
Under the new guidance, if a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, the entity will record an impairment charge based on that difference. The
impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Previously, if the fair value of a reporting unit was lower than its
carrying amount (Step 1), an entity was required to calculate any impairment charge by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount
(Step 2). Additionally, under the new standard, entities that have reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts will no longer be required to perform
the qualitative assessment to determine whether to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. As a result, reporting units with zero or negative carrying
amounts will generally be expected to pass the simplified impairment test; however, additional disclosure will be required of those entities. This ASU will be
effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2020. Early adoption is permitted for annual and interim goodwill impairment testing dates after
January 1, 2017. The new guidance must be adopted on a prospective basis. While we are still evaluating the timing of adoption, we currently do not expect
this ASU to have a material impact on our financial statements and related disclosures.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01 clarifying the definition of a business used in determining whether transactions should be accounted for as
acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The ASU provides a screen for entities to determine if an integrated set of assets and activities (“set”) is not
a business. If substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar
identifiable assets, the set is not a business. If this screen is not met, the entity then determines if the set meets the minimum requirement of a business. For a
set to be a business, it must include an input and a substantive process which together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The current
guidance does not specify the minimum processes that are required for a set be a business. The ASU also updates the definition of outputs to be the result of
inputs and processes applied to those inputs that provide goods or services to customers, investment income (such as dividends or interest), or other revenues.
This ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018 and must be adopted on a prospective basis. We will adopt this ASU on the
first day of our fiscal year 2018. We currently expect the adoption of this ASU to result in more transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions or disposals.
We currently cannot reasonably estimate the impact that adoption of this ASU will have on our financial statements and related disclosures as it will depend
on the facts and circumstances of individual transactions.
60
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07 related to the presentation of net periodic benefit cost (pension and postretirement cost). This ASU will be
effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018. Under the new guidance, the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost must be
presented in the same statement of income line item as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered by employees during the period.
Other components of net periodic benefit cost must be disaggregated from the service cost component in the statements of income and must be presented
outside the operating income subtotal. Additionally, only the service cost component will be eligible for capitalization in assets. The new guidance must be
applied retrospectively for the statement of income presentation of service cost components and other net periodic benefit cost components and prospectively
for the capitalization of service cost components. There is a practical expedient that allows us to use historical amounts disclosed in our Postemployment
Benefits footnote as an estimation basis for retrospectively applying the statement of income presentation requirements. We plan to use this practical
expedient when we adopt this ASU on the first day of our fiscal year 2018. The retrospective impact of adopting ASU 2017-07 in 2018 is expected to be (in
millions):
 December 30,
2017
(52 weeks)  December 31,
2016
(52 weeks)  January 3,
2016
(53 weeks)
Increase/(decrease) to cost of products sold $ 558 $ 373 $ 202
Increase/(decrease) to selling, general and administrative expenses 78 93 (30)
Increase/(decrease) to operating income(a) (636) (466) (172)
(a)Includes amortization of prior service costs/(credits), curtailments, special/contractual termination benefits, and certain settlements. These components of net pension and postretirement
cost/(benefit) are excluded from Segment Adjusted EBITDA and totaled approximately $(480) million in 2017, $(340) million in 2016, and $(120) million in 2015.
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12 related to accounting for hedging activities. This guidance will impact the accounting for our financial (i.e.,
foreign exchange and interest rate) and non-financial (i.e., commodity) hedging activities. Key components of this ASU that could impact us are as follows:
•Grants the ability to hedge the risk associated with the change in a contractually specified component of the purchase or sale of a non-financial item
instead of the total contractual price, which could allow more commodity contracts to qualify for hedge accounting;
•Requires us to defer the entire change in value of the derivative, including the effective and ineffective portion, into other comprehensive income
until the hedged item impacts net income. When released, the deferred hedge gains and losses, including the ineffective portion, will be recognized in
the same statement of income line affected by the hedged item;
•Allows us to recognize changes in the fair value of excluded components in other comprehensive income (which will be amortized into net income
over the life of the derivative) or in net income in the related period;
•Changes hedge effectiveness testing, including timing and allowable methods of testing; and,
•Requires additional tabular disclosures in the footnotes to the financial statements.
The method for adopting the revised standard is modified retrospective. This ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019. Early
adoption is permitted, including in an interim period. We are currently evaluating the timing of adoption and the impact this ASU will have on our financial
statements and related disclosures.
Note 2. Merger and Acquisition
Transaction Overview:
As discussed in Note 1, Background and Basis of Presentation, Heinz merged with Kraft on July 2, 2015. The Kraft businesses manufacture and market food
and beverage products, including cheese, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee, packaged dinners, refrigerated meals, snack nuts, dressings, and other grocery
products, primarily in the United States and Canada. Following the 2015 Merger Date, the operating results of the Kraft businesses have been included in our
consolidated financial statements. For the period from the 2015 Merger Date through January 3, 2016, Kraft's net sales were $8.5 billion and net income was
$478 million.
The 2015 Merger was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations and Heinz was considered to be the acquiring
company. Under the acquisition method of accounting, total consideration exchanged was (in millions):
Aggregate fair value of Kraft common stock $ 42,502
$16.50 per share special cash dividend 9,782
Fair value of replacement equity awards 353
Total consideration exchanged $ 52,637
61
Valuation Assumptions and Purchase Price Allocation:
We utilized estimated fair values at the 2015 Merger Date to allocate the total consideration exchanged to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. This allocation was final as of July 3, 2016.
The final purchase price allocation to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction was (in millions):
Cash $ 314
Other current assets 3,423
Property, plant and equipment 4,179
Identifiable intangible assets 47,771
Other non-current assets 214
Trade and other payables (3,026)
Long-term debt (9,286)
Net postemployment benefits and other non-current liabilities (4,739)
Deferred income tax liabilities (16,675)
Net assets acquired 22,175
Goodwill on acquisition 30,462
Total consideration 52,637
Fair value of shares exchanged and equity awards 42,855
Total cash consideration paid to Kraft shareholders 9,782
Cash and cash equivalents of Kraft at the 2015 Merger Date 314
Acquisition of business, net of cash on hand $ 9,468
The 2015 Merger resulted in $30.5 billion of non tax deductible goodwill relating principally to synergies expected to be achieved from the combined
operations and planned growth in new markets. Goodwill has been allocated to our segments as shown in Note 7, Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
The purchase price allocation to identifiable intangible assets acquired was:
 Fair Value  Weighted Average Life
 (in millions of dollars)  (in years)
Indefinite-lived trademarks $ 43,104  
Definite-lived trademarks 1,690 24
Customer-related assets 2,977 29
Total $ 47,771  
We valued trademarks using either the excess earnings method or relief from royalty method, which are both variations of the income approach. We used the
excess earnings method for our most significant trademarks due to their impact on the cash flows of the business and used the relief from royalty method for
the remaining trademarks and licenses. For customer relationships, we used the distributor method, a variation of the excess earnings method that uses
distributor-based inputs for margins and contributory asset charges.
Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in developing the valuations included the estimated annual net cash flows for each indefinite-lived or
definite-lived intangible asset (including net sales, cost of products sold, selling and marketing costs, and working capital/contributory asset charges), the
discount rate that appropriately reflects the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the assessment of each asset’s life cycle, and competitive trends, as
well as other factors. We determined the assumptions used in the financial forecasts using historical data, supplemented by current and anticipated market
conditions, estimated product category growth rates, management plans, and market comparables.
We used carrying values as of July 2, 2015 to value trade receivables and payables, as well as certain other current and non-current assets and liabilities, as we
determined that they represented the fair value of those items at the 2015 Merger Date.
We valued finished goods and work-in-process inventory using a net realizable value approach, which resulted in a step-up of $347 million that was
recognized in cost of products sold in the period from the 2015 Merger Date to September 27, 2015 as the related inventory was sold. Raw materials and
packaging inventory was valued using the replacement cost approach.
62
We valued property, plant and equipment using a combination of the income approach, the market approach and the cost approach, which is based on current
replacement and/or reproduction cost of the asset as new, less depreciation attributable to physical, functional, and economic factors.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of the 2015 Merger Date represented the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the
fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and their tax bases.
Pro Forma Results:
Our unaudited pro forma results, prepared in accordance with ASC 805, as if Kraft had been acquired as of December 30, 2013 were (in millions, except per
share data):
 January 3,
2016
(53 weeks)
Net sales $ 27,447
Net income 1,761
Basic earnings per share 0.72
Diluted earnings per share 0.70
The unaudited pro forma results include certain purchase accounting adjustments. We have made pro forma adjustments to exclude deal costs of $166 million
($102 million net of tax) and $347 million ($213 million net of tax) of non-cash costs related to the fair value step-up of inventory (“Inventory Step-up
Costs”) from 2015, because such costs are non-recurring and are directly attributable to the 2015 Merger.
The unaudited pro forma results do not include any anticipated cost savings or other effects of future restructuring efforts. Unaudited pro forma amounts are
not necessarily indicative of results had the 2015 Merger occurred on December 30, 2013 or of future results.
Note 3. Integration and Restructuring Expenses
As part of our restructuring activities, we incur expenses that qualify as exit and disposal costs under U.S. GAAP. These include severance and employee
benefit costs and other exit costs. Severance and employee benefit costs primarily relate to cash severance, non-cash severance, including accelerated equity
award compensation expense, and pension and other termination benefits. Other exit costs primarily relate to lease and contract terminations. We also incur
expenses that are an integral component of, and directly attributable to, our restructuring activities, which do not qualify as exit and disposal costs under U.S.
GAAP. These include asset-related costs and other implementation costs. Asset-related costs primarily relate to accelerated depreciation and asset impairment
charges. Other implementation costs primarily relate to start-up costs of new facilities, professional fees, asset relocation costs, and costs to exit facilities.
Employee severance and other termination benefit packages are primarily determined based on established benefit arrangements, local statutory requirements,
or historical benefit practices. We recognize the contractual component of these benefits when payment is probable and estimable; additional elements of
severance and termination benefits associated with non-recurring benefits are recognized ratably over each employee’s required future service period. Charges
for accelerated depreciation are recognized on long-lived assets that will be taken out of service before the end of their normal service, in which case
depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over its shortened useful life. Asset impairments establish a new fair value basis for assets held
for disposal or sale and those assets are written down to expected net realizable value if carrying value exceeds fair value. All other costs are recognized as
incurred.
63
Integration Program:
Following the 2015 Merger, we announced a multi-year program (the “Integration Program”) designed to reduce costs, streamline and simplify our operating
structure as well as optimize our production and supply chain network across our businesses in the United States and Canada segments.
We expect to incur pre-tax costs of approximately $2.1 billion related to the Integration Program. These pre-tax costs are comprised of the following
categories:
•Organization costs (approximately $400 million) associated with streamlining and simplifying our operating structure, resulting in workforce
reduction (primarily severance and employee benefit costs).
•Footprint costs (approximately $1.3 billion) associated with optimizing our production and supply chain network, resulting in workforce reduction
and facility closures and consolidations (primarily asset-related costs and severance and employee benefit costs).
•Other costs (approximately $400 million) incurred as a direct result of integration activities, including other exit costs (primarily lease and contract
terminations) and other implementation costs (primarily professional services and other third-party fees).
Approximately 60% of the Integration Program costs will be reflected in cost of products sold and approximately 60% will be cash expenditures.
In 2017, we substantially completed our Integration Program. Overall, as part of the Integration Program, we have closed net six factories and consolidated
our distribution network. We expect to eliminate approximately 5,200 positions, 4,900 of whom have left the Company as of December 30, 2017. The
Integration Program liability at December 30, 2017 related primarily to the elimination of general salaried and factory positions across the United States and
Canada.
As of December 30, 2017, we have incurred cumulative costs of $2,055 million, including $339 million in 2017, $887 million in 2016, and $829 million in
2015. The $2,055 million of cumulative costs included $539 million of severance and employee benefit costs, $858 million of non-cash asset-related costs,
$550 million of other implementation costs, and $108 million of other exit costs. The related amounts incurred in 2017 were a $142 million credit related to
severance and employee benefit costs, $208 million of non-cash asset-related costs, $260 million of other implementation costs, and $13 million of other exit
costs.
We expect to incur further Integration Program costs in 2018.
Our liability balance for Integration Program costs that qualify as exit and disposal costs under U.S. GAAP (i.e., severance and employee benefit costs and
other exit costs), was (in millions):
 Severance and
Employee Benefit
Costs  Other Exit Costs(a) Total
Balance at December 31, 2016 $ 99 $ 10 $ 109
Charges/(credits) (142) 13 (129)
Cash payments (70) (7) (77)
Non-cash utilization 137 6 143
Balance at December 30, 2017 $ 24 $ 22 $ 46
(a) Other exit costs primarily consist of lease and contract terminations.
We expect that a substantial portion of the liability for severance and employee benefit costs as of December 30, 2017 to be paid in 2018. The liability for
other exit costs primarily relates to lease obligations. The cash impact of these obligations will continue for the duration of the lease terms, which expire
between 2019 and 2026.
Restructuring Activities:
In addition to our Integration Program in North America, we have a small number of other restructuring programs globally, which are focused primarily on
workforce reduction and factory closure and consolidation. Related to these programs, approximately 600 employees left the Company in 2017. These
programs resulted in expenses of $118 million in 2017, including $50 million of severance and employee benefit costs, $10 million of non-cash asset-related
costs, $48 million of other implementation costs, and $10 million of other exit costs. Other restructuring program expenses totaled $125 million in 2016 and
$194 million in 2015.
64
Our liability balance for restructuring project costs that qualify as exit and disposal costs under U.S. GAAP (i.e., severance and employee benefit costs and
other exit costs), was (in millions):
 Severance and

Balance at December 31, 2016 $ 12 $ 25 $ 37
Charges/(credits) 50 10 60

Non-cash utilization (8) (1) (9)
Balance at December 30, 2017 $ 16 $ 25 $ 41
(a) Other exit costs primarily consist of lease and contract terminations.
We expect that a substantial portion of the liability for severance and employee benefit costs as of December 30, 2017 to be paid in 2018. The liability for
other exit costs primarily relates to lease obligations. The cash impact of these obligations will continue for the duration of the lease terms, which expire
between 2018 and 2026.

Note 7. Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill:
Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill, by segment, were (in millions):
 United States  Canada  Europe  Rest of World  Total

Balance at December 30, 2017 $ 33,700 $ 5,246 $ 3,059 $ 2,819 $ 44,824
We test goodwill for impairment at least annually in the second quarter or when a triggering event occurs. We performed our 2017 annual impairment test as
of April 2, 2017. As a result of our 2017 annual impairment test, there was no impairment of goodwill. Each of our goodwill reporting units had excess fair
value over its carrying value of at least 10% as of April 2, 2017.
66
Our goodwill balance consists of 18 reporting units and had an aggregate carrying value of $44.8 billion as of December 30, 2017. As a majority of our
goodwill was recently recorded in connection with the 2013 Merger and the 2015 Merger, representing fair values as of those merger dates, there was not a
significant excess of fair values over carrying values as of April 2, 2017. We have a risk of future impairment to the extent that individual reporting unit
performance does not meet our projections. Additionally, if our current assumptions and estimates, including projected revenues and income growth rates,
terminal growth rates, competitive and consumer trends, market-based discount rates, and other market factors, are not met, or if valuation factors outside of
our control change unfavorably, the estimated fair value of our goodwill could be adversely affected, leading to a potential impairment in the future. No
events occurred during the period ended December 30, 2017 that indicated it was more likely than not that our goodwill was impaired. There were no
accumulated impairment losses to goodwill as of December 30, 2017.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets:
Changes in the carrying amount of indefinite-lived intangible assets, which primarily consisted of trademarks, were (in millions):
Balance at December 31, 2016 $ 53,307
Translation adjustments 397
Impairment losses on indefinite-lived intangible assets (49)
Balance at December 30, 2017 $ 53,655
We test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually in the second quarter or when a triggering event occurs. We performed our 2017
annual impairment test as of April 2, 2017. As a result of our 2017 annual impairment test, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $49 million in
SG&A in 2017. This loss was due to continued declines in nutritional beverages in India. The loss was recorded in our Europe segment as the related
trademark is owned by our Italian subsidiary. Each of our other brands had excess fair value over its carrying value of at least 10% as of April 2, 2017.
Our indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of a large number of individual brands and had an aggregate carrying value of $53.7 billion as of
December 30, 2017. As a majority of our indefinite-lived intangible assets were recently recorded in connection with the 2013 Merger and the 2015 Merger,
representing fair values as of those merger dates, there was not a significant excess of fair values over carrying values as of April 2, 2017. We have a risk of
future impairment to the extent individual brand performance does not meet our projections. Additionally, if our current assumptions and estimates, including
projected revenues and income growth rates, terminal growth rates, competitive and consumer trends, market-based discount rates, and other market factors,
are not met, or if valuation factors outside of our control change unfavorably, the estimated fair values of our indefinite-lived intangible assets could be
adversely affected, leading to potential impairments in the future. No events occurred during the period ended December 30, 2017 that indicated it was more
likely than not that our indefinite-lived intangible assets were impaired.
There was no impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets as a result of our 2016 testing. In 2015, we recognized non-cash impairment losses of $58
million in SG&A, primarily related to declines within frozen soup in the United States, frozen meals and snacks primarily in the United Kingdom, and pasta
sauce in the United States and Canada.
Definite-lived intangible assets:
Definite-lived intangible assets were (in millions):

Amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets was $279 million in 2017, $268 million in 2016, and $178 million in 2015. Aside from amortization
expense, the changes in definite-lived intangible assets from December 31, 2016 to December 30, 2017 primarily reflect the impact of foreign currency. We
estimate that amortization expense related to definite-lived intangible assets will be approximately $272 million for the next twelve months and
approximately $270 million for each of the four years thereafter.

Note 8. Income Taxes
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“U.S. Tax Reform”) was enacted by the U.S. federal government. The legislation significantly changed
U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering the federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, effective January 1, 2018, implementing a territorial tax
system, and imposing a one-time toll charge on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 30, 2017. In addition, there are many new
provisions, including changes to bonus depreciation, the deduction for executive compensation and interest expense, a tax on global intangible low-taxed
income provisions (“GILTI”), the base erosion anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”), and a deduction for foreign-derived intangible income (“FDII”). The two material
items that impacted us in 2017 were the corporate tax rate reduction and the one-time toll charge. While the corporate tax rate reduction is effective January 1,
2018, we accounted for this anticipated rate change in 2017, the period of enactment.
The SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”), which provides us with up to one year to finalize accounting for the impacts of U.S. Tax
Reform. When the initial accounting for U.S Tax Reform impacts is incomplete, we may include provisional amounts when reasonable estimates can be made
or continue to apply the prior tax law if a reasonable estimate cannot be made. We have estimated the provisional tax impacts related to the toll charge, certain
components of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, including depreciation and executive compensation, and the change in our indefinite
reinvestment assertion. As a result, we recognized a net tax benefit of approximately $7.0 billion, including a reasonable estimate of our deferred income tax
benefit of approximately $7.5 billion related to the corporate rate change, which was partially offset by a reasonable estimate of $312 million for the toll
charge and approximately $125 million for other tax expenses, including a change in our indefinite reinvestment assertion. We have elected to account for the
tax on GILTI as a period cost and thus have not adjusted any of the deferred tax assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries for U.S. Tax Reform. The
ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts due to gathering additional information to more precisely compute the amount of tax, changes in
interpretations and assumptions, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions we may take. We expect to finalize accounting for the impacts
of U.S. Tax Reform when the 2017 U.S. corporate income tax return is filed in 2018.
In connection with U.S. Tax Reform, we have also reassessed our international investment assertions and no longer consider the historic earnings of our
foreign subsidiaries as of December 30, 2017 to be indefinitely reinvested. We have made a reasonable estimate of local country withholding taxes that would
be owed when our historic earnings are distributed. As a result, we have recorded deferred income taxes of $96 million on approximately $1.2 billion of
historic earnings.

Tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options and other equity instruments recorded directly to additional paid-in capital totaled $30 million in 2016 and
$10 million in 2015. In the first quarter of 2017, we prospectively adopted ASU 2016-09. We now record tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options
and other equity instruments within our tax provision, rather than within equity. Accordingly, we recognized a tax benefit of $22 million within our 2017
statement of income related to tax benefits upon the exercise of stock options and other equity instruments.
The effective tax rate on income/(loss) before income taxes differed from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate for the following reasons:
 December 30,
2017
(52 weeks)  December 31,
2016
(52 weeks)  January 3,
2016
(53 weeks)
U.S. federal statutory tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 %
Increase/(decrease) resulting from:      
Tax on income of foreign subsidiaries (4.7)% (3.6)% (11.8)%
Domestic manufacturing deduction (1.5)% (1.9)% (2.9)%
U.S. state and local income taxes, net of federal tax benefit 1.1 % 0.8 % (0.6)%
Earnings repatriation 0.4 % 0.4 % 21.9 %
Tax exempt income (0.7)% (3.3)% (10.9)%
Deferred tax effect of statutory tax rate changes 0.3 % (2.0)% (10.4)%
Audit settlements and changes in uncertain tax positions (0.1)% 1.8 % 6.2 %
Venezuela nondeductible devaluation loss — % 0.2 % 9.9 %
Impact of U.S. Tax Reform (127.3)% — % — %
Other (1.2)% 0.1 % (0.2)%
Effective tax rate (98.7)% 27.5 % 36.2 %
The provision for income taxes consists of provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes. We operate in an international environment; accordingly,
the consolidated effective tax rate is a composite rate reflecting the earnings in various locations and the applicable tax rates. Additionally, the calculation of
the percentage point impact of U.S. Tax Reform, domestic manufacturing deductions, tax exempt income, uncertain tax positions and other items on the
effective tax rate shown in the table above are affected by income/(loss) before income taxes. Fluctuations in the amount of income generated across
locations around the world could impact comparability of reconciling items between periods.
The tax provision for the 2017 tax year benefited from U.S. Tax Reform enacted on December 22, 2017. The related income tax benefit of 127.3% in 2017
primarily reflects adjustments to our deferred tax positions for the lower federal income tax rate, partially offset by our provision for the one-time toll charge.
Due to the 2015 Merger, the tax provision for 2016 reflected a much greater percentage of U.S. income, which unfavorably impacted the effective tax rate
compared to 2015. The tax provision for the 2015 tax year benefited from a favorable jurisdictional income mix and from impairment losses recorded in the
U.S.
The 2016 and 2015 tax years included a benefit related to the tax effect of statutory tax rate changes. Small movements in tax rates due to a change in tax law
or a change in tax rates that causes us to revalue our deferred tax balances produces volatility in our effective tax rate. In addition:
•The 2016 tax year included a benefit related to the impact on deferred taxes of a 10 basis point reduction in the state tax rate and a 100 basis point
statutory rate reduction in the United Kingdom.
•The 2015 tax year included a benefit related to the impact on deferred taxes of a 200 basis point statutory rate reduction in the United Kingdom.

The tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards that gave rise to deferred income tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following (in millions):
 December 30, 2017 December 31, 2016
Deferred income tax liabilities:    
Intangible assets, net $ 13,637 $ 20,946

Deferred income tax liabilities 14,571 22,513
Deferred income tax assets:    
Benefit plans (212) (1,025)
Other (428) (782)
Deferred income tax assets (640) (1,807)
Valuation allowance 80 89
Net deferred income tax liabilities $ 14,011 $ 20,795
The $9 million decrease in our valuation allowance in 2017 reflects the impact of releasing valuation allowances for foreign net operating losses and foreign
tax credits that we anticipate being able to utilize.
At December 30, 2017, foreign operating loss carryforwards totaled $336 million. Of that amount, $41 million expire between 2018 and 2037; the other $295
million do not expire. We have recorded $84 million of deferred tax assets related to these foreign operating loss carryforwards. Additionally, we have foreign
operating loss carryforwards of $1.0 billion for which the realization of a tax benefit is considered remote and, as a result, we have recorded a full valuation
allowance for the tax benefits. However, due to the remote likelihood of utilizing these losses, neither the deferred tax asset nor the offsetting valuation
allowance has been presented in the table above. Deferred tax assets of $39 million have been recorded for U.S. state and local operating loss carryforwards.
These losses expire between 2018 and 2037.
Deferred tax assets of $7 million have been recorded for U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards. These credit carryforwards expire between 2020 and 2025.
At December 30, 2017, our unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions were $408 million. If we had recognized all of these benefits, the impact on
our effective tax rate would have been $316 million. It is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by as much as $105 million in
the next 12 months primarily due to the progression of federal, state, and foreign audits in process. Our unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions
are included in income taxes payable (current liabilities) and other liabilities (long-term) on our consolidated balance sheets.
The changes in our unrecognized tax benefits were (in millions):

Decreases due to settlements with taxing authorities (59) (62) —
Decreases due to lapse of statute of limitations (24) (5) (9)
Balance at the end of the period $ 408 $ 389 $ 353
Our unrecognized tax benefits increased during 2017 as a result of evaluating tax positions taken or expected to be taken on our federal, state, and foreign
income tax returns. This increase was partially offset primarily as a result of audit settlements with federal, state and foreign taxing authorities and statute of
limitations expirations.
In the third quarter of 2016, we reached an agreement with the IRS resolving all Kraft open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 through
2014. This settlement reduced our reserves for uncertain tax positions and resulted in a non-cash tax benefit of $42 million.
70
The gross unrecognized tax balance increased substantially for the year ended January 3, 2016 as a result of the 2015 Merger purchase accounting.
We include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our tax provision. Our provision for/(benefit from) income taxes included a $24 million
benefit in 2017, $8 million expense in 2016, and $18 million expense in 2015 related to interest and penalties. Accrued interest and penalties were $57 million
as of December 30, 2017 and $81 million as of December 31, 2016.
In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as Australia,
Canada, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We have substantially concluded all national income tax matters through 2015 for
the Netherlands, through 2014 for the United States, through 2012 for the United Kingdom, through 2011 for Australia, and through 2010 for Canada and
Italy. We have substantially concluded all state income tax matters through 2007.
We have a tax sharing agreement with Mondelēz International, Inc. (“Mondelēz International”), which generally provides that (i) we are liable for U.S. state
income taxes and Canadian federal and provincial income taxes for Kraft periods prior to October 1, 2012 and (ii) Mondelēz International is responsible for
U.S. federal income taxes and substantially all non-U.S. income taxes, excluding Canadian income taxes, for Kraft periods prior to October 1, 2012.
Kraft's U.S. operations were included in Mondelēz International's U.S. federal consolidated income tax returns for tax periods through October 1, 2012. In
December 2016, Mondelēz International reached a final resolution on a U.S. federal income tax audit of the 2010-2012 tax years. As noted above, we are
indemnified for U.S. federal income taxes related to these periods.
Note 9. Employees’ Stock Incentive Plans
Stock Incentive Plans
We issued equity-based awards from the following plans in 2017, 2016, and 2015:
2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan:
In April 2016, our Board of Directors approved the 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (“2016 Omnibus Plan”), which authorized grants of options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), deferred stock, performance awards, investment rights, other stock-based awards, and cash-based awards.
This plan authorizes the issuance of up to 18 million shares of our common stock. We grant non-qualified stock options under the 2016 Omnibus Plan to
select employees with a five-year cliff vesting. Such options have a maximum exercise term of 10 years.
2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan:
In October 2013, our Board of Directors adopted the 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (“2013 Omnibus Plan”), which authorized the issuance of shares of capital
stock. Each Heinz stock option that was outstanding under the 2013 Omnibus Plan immediately prior to the completion of the 2015 Merger was converted
into 0.443332 of a Kraft Heinz stock option. Following this conversion, the 2013 Omnibus Plan authorized the issuance of up to 17,555,947 shares of our
common stock. All Heinz stock option amounts have been retrospectively adjusted for the Successor periods presented to give effect to this conversion. We
grant non-qualified stock options under the 2013 Omnibus Plan to select employees with a five-year cliff vesting. Such options have a maximum exercise
term of 10 years. If a participant is involuntarily terminated without cause, 20% of their options will vest, on an accelerated basis, for each full year of service
after the grant date.
Kraft 2012 Performance Incentive Plan:
Prior to the 2015 Merger, Kraft issued equity-based awards, including stock options and RSUs, under its 2012 Performance Incentive Plan. As a result of the
2015 Merger, each outstanding Kraft stock option was converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of our common stock based upon an option
adjustment ratio, and each outstanding Kraft RSU was converted into one Kraft Heinz RSU. These Kraft Heinz stock awards will continue to vest and
become exercisable in accordance with the terms and conditions that were applicable immediately prior to the completion of the 2015 Merger. These options
generally become exercisable in three annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the original grant date, and have a maximum exercise term of
10 years. RSUs generally cliff vest on the third anniversary of the original grant date. In accordance with the terms of the 2012 Performance Incentive Plan,
vesting generally accelerates for holders of Kraft awards who are terminated without cause within two years of the 2015 Merger Date.
In addition, prior to the 2015 Merger, Kraft issued performance based long-term incentive awards (“Performance Shares”), which vested based on varying
performance, market, and service conditions. In connection with the 2015 Merger, all outstanding Performance Shares were converted into cash awards,
payable in two installments: (i) a 2015 pro-rata payment based upon the portion of the Performance Share cycle completed prior to the 2015 Merger and (ii)
the remaining value of the award to be paid on the earlier of the first anniversary of the closing of the 2015 Merger and a participant's termination without
cause.
71
Stock Options
We use the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants. We used the Hull-White II Lattice (“Lattice”) model to estimate the fair
value of Kraft converted stock options. We believe the Lattice model provided an appropriate estimate of fair value of Kraft converted options as it took into
account each option’s distinct in-the-money level and remaining terms. The grant date fair value of options is amortized to expense over the vesting period.
Our weighted average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions were:
 December 30,
2017
(52 weeks)  December 31,
2016
(52 weeks)  January 3,
2016
(53 weeks)
Risk-free interest rate 2.25% 1.63% 1.70%
Expected term 7.5 years 7.5 years 6.3 years
Expected volatility 19.6% 22.0% 22.9%
Expected dividend yield 2.8% 3.1% 1.5%
Weighted average grant date fair value per share $ 14.24 $ 12.48 $ 9.60
The risk-free interest rate represented the constant maturity U.S. Treasury rate in effect at the grant date, with a remaining term equal to the expected life of
the options. The expected life is the period over which our employees are expected to hold their options. Due to the lack of historical data for 2017 and 2016,
we calculated expected life using the Safe Harbor method, which uses the weighted average vesting period and the contractual term of the options. In 2015,
the weighted average expected life of options was based on consideration of historical exercise patterns adjusted for changes in the contractual term and
exercise periods of the awards. In 2017 and 2016, volatility was estimated using a blended approach of implied volatility and peer volatility. Peer volatility
was calculated as the average of the term-matched, leverage-adjusted historical volatilities of Colgate-Palmolive Co., The Coca-Cola Company, Mondelēz
International, Altria Group, Inc., PepsiCo, Inc., and Unilever plc. In 2015, volatility was estimated based on a review of the equity volatilities of publicly-
traded peer companies for a period commensurate with the expected life of the options. In 2017 and 2016, the expected dividend yield was estimated using
the quarterly dividend divided by the three-month average stock price, annualized and continuously compounded. In 2015, dividend yield was estimated over
the expected life of the options based on our stated dividend policy.
Our Lattice model fair value assumptions for the Kraft converted options were:
 January 3,
2016
(53 weeks)
Risk-free interest rate 1.72%
Expected volatility 20.10%
Expected dividend yield 3.00%
Weighted average fair value on conversion date $ 35.65
The risk-free interest rate represented the constant maturity U.S. Treasury rate in effect at the conversion date, with a remaining term equal to the expected
life of the options. The expected volatility was calculated as the average leverage-adjusted historical volatility of several peer companies, matched to the
remaining term of each option. Dividend yield was estimated based on our stated dividend policy and conversion date stock price.

Restricted Stock Units
Restricted stock units represent a right to receive one share or the value of one share upon the terms and conditions set forth in the plan and the applicable
award agreement. Our RSUs include performance share units (“PSUs”) that are subject to achievement or satisfaction of performance conditions specified by
the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors.
We used the stock price on the grant date to estimate the fair value of our RSUs and PSUs. Additionally, the fair value of our PSUs is discounted based on the
dividend yield as they are not dividend eligible during the vesting period. The grant date fair value of RSUs and PSUs is amortized to expense over the
vesting period.
The weighted average grant date fair value per share of our RSUs and PSUs granted during the year was $85.03 in 2017, $77.53 in 2016, and $26.24 in 2015.
In 2017, our expected dividend yield was 2.7%. Dividend yield was estimated using the quarterly dividend divided by the three-month average stock price,
annualized and continuously compounded. There were no PSUs granted in 2016 or 2015; therefore there was no expected dividend yield for these periods.
Our RSU activity and related information was:

Note 10. Postemployment Benefits
We maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees. Current defined benefit pension plans are provided primarily for certain domestic
union and foreign employees. Local statutory requirements govern many of these plans. The pension benefits of our unionized workers are in accordance with
the applicable collective bargaining agreement covering their employment. Defined contribution plans are provided for certain domestic unionized, non-union
hourly, and salaried employees as well as certain employees in foreign locations.
We provide health care and other postretirement benefits to certain of our eligible retired employees and their eligible dependents. Certain of our U.S. and
Canadian employees may become eligible for such benefits. We may modify plan provisions or terminate plans at our discretion. The postretirement benefits
of our unionized workers are in accordance with the applicable collective bargaining agreement covering their employment.
Prior to the 2015 Merger, Kraft provided a range of benefits to its employees and retirees, including pension benefits and postretirement health care benefits.
As part of the 2015 Merger, we assumed the assets and liabilities associated with these plans.
We remeasure our postemployment benefit plans at least annually.

December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are included in the table above.
In 2016, we approved the wind up of our Canadian salaried and Canadian hourly defined benefit pension plans effective December 31, 2016. This action
resulted in an increase to our projected benefit obligations of approximately $85 million at December 31, 2016. This action had no impact on the
consolidated statements of income or consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2016.
In 2015, we recorded net settlement losses for the U.S. and non-U.S. plans primarily related to certain plan terminations. We also recorded net curtailment
gains for the U.S. and non-U.S. plans primarily related to certain plan freezes and work force reductions under our integration and restructuring activities.

Rate of compensation increase 4.1% 4.1% 4.0% 4.0% 3.4% 3.3%
Discount rates for our U.S. and non-U.S. plans were developed from a model portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments with durations that
match the expected future cash flows of the plans. We determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets' historical long-term
investment performance, target asset allocation, and estimates of future long-term returns by asset class.
Plan Assets:
The underlying basis of the investment strategy of our defined benefit plans is to ensure that pension funds are available to meet the plans’ benefit
obligations when they are due. Our investment objectives include: investing plan assets in a high-quality, diversified manner in order to maintain the security
of the funds; achieving an optimal return on plan assets within specified risk tolerances; and investing according to local regulations and requirements
specific to each country in which a defined benefit plan operates. The investment strategy expects equity investments to yield a higher return over the long
term than fixed-income securities, while fixed-income securities are expected to provide certain matching characteristics to the plans’ benefit payment cash
flow requirements. Our investment policy specifies the type of investment vehicles appropriate for the applicable plan, asset allocation guidelines, criteria for
the selection of investment managers, procedures to monitor overall investment performance as well as investment manager performance. It also provides
guidelines enabling the applicable plan fiduciaries to fulfill their responsibilities.
76
Our weighted average asset allocations were:

Cash and cash equivalents 11% 3% 4% 8%
Certain insurance contracts —% —% 24% 5%
Total 100% 100% 100% 100%
Our pension asset strategy for U.S. plans is designed to align our pension assets with our projected benefit obligation to reduce volatility by targeting an
investment of approximately 70% of our U.S. plan assets in fixed-income securities and approximately 30% in return-seeking assets, primarily equity
securities.
For pension plans outside the U.S., our investment strategy is subject to local regulations and the asset/liability profiles of the plans in each individual
country. In aggregate, the long-term asset allocation targets of our non-U.S. plans are broadly characterized as a mix of approximately 65% fixed-income
securities and annuity contracts, and approximately 35% in return-seeking assets, primarily equity securities and real estate.
The fair value of pension plan assets at December 30, 2017 was determined using the following fair value measurements (in millions):

The following section describes the valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of pension plan assets, including an indication of the level in the
fair value hierarchy in which each type of asset is generally classified.
Government Bonds. These securities consist of direct investments in publicly traded U.S. and non-U.S. fixed interest obligations (principally debentures).
Such investments are valued using quoted prices in active markets. These securities are principally included in Level 1.
Corporate Bonds and Other Fixed-Income Securities. These securities consist of publicly traded U.S. and non-U.S. fixed interest obligations (principally
corporate bonds). Such investments are valued through consultation and evaluation with brokers in the institutional market using quoted prices and other
observable market data. As such, these securities are included in Level 2.
Equity Securities. These securities consist of direct investments in the stock of publicly traded companies. Such investments are valued based on the closing
price reported in an active market on which the individual securities are traded. As such, the direct investments are classified as Level 1.
Real Estate. These holdings consist of real estate investments. Direct investments of real estate are valued by investment managers based on the most recent
financial information available, which typically represents significant unobservable data. As such, these investments are generally classified as Level 3.
Cash and Cash Equivalents. This consists of direct cash holdings and institutional short-term investment vehicles. Direct cash holdings are valued based on
cost, which approximates fair value and are classified as Level 1. Certain institutional short-term investment vehicles are valued daily and are classified as
Level 1. Other cash equivalents that are not traded on an active exchange, such as bank deposits, are classified as Level 2.
Certain Insurance Contracts. This category consists of group annuity contracts that have been purchased to cover a portion of the plan members. The fair
value of non-participating annuity buy-in contracts fluctuates based on fluctuations in the obligation associated with the covered plan members. The fair value
of certain participating annuity contracts are reported at contract value. These values have been classified as Level 3.
Investments Measured at Net Asset Value. This category consists of pooled funds, short-term investments and partnership/corporate feeder interests.
Pooled funds. The fair values of participation units held in collective trusts are based on their net asset values, as reported by the managers of the collective
trusts and as supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions occurring as of or close to the financial statement date. The fair value of
these investments measured at net asset value is excluded from the fair value hierarchy. Investments in the collective trusts can be redeemed on each business
day based upon the applicable net asset value per unit. Investments in the international large/mid cap equity collective trust can be redeemed on the last
business date of each month and at least one business day during the month.
78
The mutual fund investments are not traded on an exchange and a majority of these funds are held in a separate account managed by a fixed income
manager. The fair values of the mutual fund investments that are not traded on an exchange are based on their net asset values, as reported by the managers
and as supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions occurring as of or close to the financial statement date. The fair value of these
investments measured at net asset value is excluded from the fair value hierarchy. The objective of the account is to provide superior return with reasonable
risk, where performance is expected to exceed Barclays Long U.S. Credit Index. Investments in this account can be redeemed with a written notice to the
investment manager.
Short-term investments: Short-term investments largely consisted of a money market fund, the fair value of which is based on the net asset value reported by
the manager of the fund and supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions. The fair value of these investments measured at net asset
value is excluded from the fair value hierarchy. The money market fund is designed to provide safety of principal, daily liquidity, and a competitive yield by
investing in high quality money market instruments. The investment objective of the money market fund is to provide the highest possible level of current
income while still maintaining liquidity and preserving capital.
Partnership/corporate feeder interests: Fair value estimates of the equity partnership are based on their net asset values, as reported by the manager of the
partnership. The fair value of these investments measured at net asset value is excluded from the fair value hierarchy. Investments in the equity partnership
may be redeemed once per month upon 10 days’ prior written notice to the General Partner, subject to the discretion of the General Partner. The investment
objective of the equity partnership is to seek capital appreciation by investing primarily in equity securities.
The fair values of the corporate feeder are based upon the net asset values of the equity master fund in which it invests. The fair value of these investments
measured at net asset value is excluded from the fair value hierarchy. Investments in the corporate feeder can be redeemed quarterly with at least 90 days’
notice. The investment objective of the corporate feeder is to generate long-term returns by investing in large, liquid equity securities with attractive
fundamentals.

Employer Contributions:
In 2017, we contributed $300 million to our U.S. pension plans and $30 million to our non-U.S. pension plans. We estimate that 2018 pension contributions
will be approximately $50 million to our non-U.S. plans. We do not plan to contribute to our U.S. pension plans in 2018. Our actual contributions and plans
may change due to many factors, including the timing of regulatory approval for the windup of certain non-U.S. pension plans, changes in tax, employee
benefit, or other laws and regulations, tax deductibility, significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates, or
other factors.

We used the following weighted average assumptions to determine our postretirement benefit obligations:
 December 30, 2017 December 31, 2016
Discount rate 3.5% 3.8%
Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year 6.7% 6.3%
Ultimate trend rate 4.9% 4.9%
Discount rates for our plans were developed from a model portfolio of high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with durations that match the expected
future cash flows of the plans. Our expected health care cost trend rate is based on historical costs and our expectation for health care cost trend rates going
forward.
The year that the health care cost trend rate reaches the ultimate trend rate varies by plan and ranges between 2018 and 2030 as of December 30, 2017.
Assumed health care costs trend rates have a significant impact on the amounts reported for the postretirement benefit plans. A one-percentage-point change
in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects, increase/(decrease) in cost and obligation, as of December 30, 2017 (in millions):
 One-Percentage-Point
 Increase  (Decrease)
Effect on annual service and interest cost $ 4 $ (3)
Effect on postretirement benefit obligation 55 (47)
Plan Assets:
In December 2017, we made a cash contribution of approximately $1.2 billion to pre-fund a portion of our U.S. postretirement plan benefits following
enactment of U.S. Tax Reform on December 22, 2017. The underlying basis of the investment strategy of our U.S. postretirement plans is to ensure that funds
are available to meet the plans’ benefit obligations when they are due by investing plan assets in a high-quality, diversified manner in order to maintain the
security of the funds. The investment strategy expects equity investments to yield a higher return over the long term than fixed-income securities, while fixed-
income securities are expected to provide certain matching characteristics to the plans’ benefit payment cash flow requirements.
Our postretirement benefit plan asset allocation at December 30, 2017 was 100% short-term investments. Our postretirement benefit plan investment strategy
is subject to local regulations and the asset/liability profiles of the plans in each individual country. Our investment strategy is designed to align our
postretirement benefit plan assets with our postretirement benefit obligation to reduce volatility. In aggregate, our long-term asset allocation targets are
broadly characterized as a mix of approximately 70% in fixed-income securities and approximately 30% in return-seeking assets, primarily equity securities.
The fair value of our postretirement benefit plan assets, which were all classified as short-term investments, was $1.2 billion at December 30, 2017. There
were no postretirement benefit plan assets and no associated fair value at December 31, 2016.
Short-term investments consist of a money market mutual fund, the fair value of which is based on the closing price reported in an active market on which the
mutual fund is traded. As such, these investments are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. The money market mutual fund is designed to provide
safety of principal, daily liquidity, and a competitive yield by investing in high quality money market instruments. The investment objective of the money
market mutual fund is to provide the highest possible level of current income while still maintaining liquidity and preserving capital.

We capitalized a portion of net postretirement cost/(benefit) into inventory based on our production activities. The amounts capitalized into inventory as of
December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are included in the table above.
In 2017, we remeasured certain of our postretirement plans and recognized a curtailment gain of $177 million. The curtailment was triggered by the number
of cumulative headcount reductions after the closure of certain U.S. factories during the year. The resulting gain is attributed to accelerating a portion of the
previously deferred actuarial gains and prior service credits. The headcount reductions and factory closures were part of our ongoing Integration Program. See
Note 3, Integration and Restructuring Expenses, for additional information.
The amortization of prior service credits was primarily driven by the 2015 plan amendments. Amortization of prior service credits in 2017 and 2016 included
12 months of amortization related to the 2015 plan amendments, and 2015 included four months of such amortization.
We used the following weighted average assumptions to determine our net postretirement benefit plans cost:

Employer Contributions:
In 2017, we contributed $1.3 billion to our postretirement benefit plans. This amount includes certain benefit payments of $142 million which are paid as
incurred rather than pre-funded. We estimate that 2018 postretirement benefit plan contributions will be approximately $15 million. Our actual contributions
and plans may change due to many factors, including changes in tax, employee benefit, or other laws and regulations, tax deductibility, significant
differences between expected and actual postretirement plan asset performance or interest rates, or other factors.
Future Benefit Payments:
Our estimated future benefit payments for our postretirement plans at December 30, 2017 were (in millions):
2018 $ 147

2020 133
2021 126
2022 120
2023-2027 504
Other Costs
We sponsor and contribute to employee savings plans that cover eligible salaried, non-union, and union employees. Our contributions and costs are
determined by the matching of employee contributions, as defined by the plans. Amounts charged to expense for defined contribution plans totaled $78
million in 2017, $74 million in 2016, and $52 million in 2015.

Our derivative financial instruments are subject to master netting arrangements that allow for the offset of assets and liabilities in the event of default or early
termination of the contract. We elect to record the gross assets and liabilities of our derivative financial instruments on the consolidated balance sheets. If the
derivative financial instruments had been netted on the consolidated balance sheets, the asset and liability positions each would have been reduced by $23
million at December 30, 2017 and $67 million at December 31, 2016. No material amounts of collateral were received or posted on our derivative assets and
liabilities at December 30, 2017.
Level 1 financial assets and liabilities consist of commodity future and options contracts and are valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets and liabilities.
Level 2 financial assets and liabilities consist of commodity swaps, foreign exchange forwards and swaps, and cross-currency swaps. Commodity swaps are
valued using an income approach based on the observable market commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Foreign
exchange forwards and swaps are valued using an income approach based on observable market forward rates less the contract rate multiplied by the notional
amount. Cross-currency swaps are valued based on observable market spot and swap rates.
Our calculation of the fair value of financial instruments takes into consideration the risk of nonperformance, including counterparty credit risk.
There have been no transfers between Levels 1, 2, and 3 in any period presented.
84
The fair values of our derivative assets are recorded within other current assets and other assets. The fair values of our liability derivatives are recorded within
other current liabilities and other liabilities.
Net Investment Hedging:
At December 30, 2017, the principal amounts of foreign denominated debt designated as net investment hedges totaled €2,550 million and £400 million.
At December 30, 2017, our cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges consisted of:
Instrument  Notional
(local)
(in billions)  Notional
(USD)
(in billions)  Maturity
Cross-currency swap  £ 0.8 $ 1.4 October 2019
Cross-currency swap  C$ 1.8 $ 1.6 December 2019
We also periodically enter into shorter-dated foreign exchange contracts that are designated as net investment hedges. At December 30, 2017, we had Chinese
renminbi foreign exchange contracts with an aggregate USD notional amount of $213 million.
The component of the gains and losses on our net investment in these designated foreign operations, driven by changes in foreign exchange rates, are
economically offset by movements in the fair values of our cross-currency swap contracts and remeasurement of our foreign denominated debt.
Interest Rate Hedging:
In 2015, we de-designated all of our outstanding interest rate swaps (total notional amount of $7.9 billion) from hedging relationships in connection with the
repayment of the Term B-1 and Term B-2 loans. We determined that the related forecasted future cash flows were probable of not occurring, and as a result,
we reclassified $227 million of deferred losses initially reported in accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) to net income/(loss) as interest expense.
Hedge Coverage:
At December 30, 2017, we had entered into contracts designated as hedging instruments, which hedge transactions for the following durations:
•foreign exchange contracts for periods not exceeding the next 18 months; and
•cross-currency contracts for periods not exceeding the next 24 months.
At December 30, 2017, we had entered into contracts not designated as hedging instruments, which hedge economic risks for the following durations:
•commodity contracts for periods not exceeding the next 12 months; and
•foreign exchange contracts for periods not exceeding the next six months.
•cross-currency contracts for periods not exceeding the next 22 months.
Hedge Ineffectiveness:
We record pre-tax gains or losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) due to ineffectiveness for foreign exchange contracts
related to forecasted transactions in other expense/(income), net.
Deferred Hedging Gains and Losses:
Based on our valuation at December 30, 2017 and assuming market rates remain constant through contract maturities, we expect transfers to net income/(loss)
of unrealized losses for foreign currency cash flow hedges during the next 12 months to be $13 million. Additionally, we expect transfers to net income/(loss)
of unrealized losses for interest rate cash flow hedges during the next 12 months to be insignificant.
Concentration of Credit Risk:
Counterparties to our foreign exchange derivatives consist of major international financial institutions. We continually monitor our positions and the credit
ratings of the counterparties involved and, by policy, limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one party. While we may be exposed to potential losses
due to the credit risk of non-performance by these counterparties, losses are not anticipated. We closely monitor the credit risk associated with our
counterparties and customers and to date have not experienced material losses.
85
Economic Hedging:
We enter into certain derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments in accordance with our risk management strategy which have an economic
impact of largely mitigating commodity price risk and foreign currency exposures. Gains and losses are recorded in net income/(loss) as a component of cost
of products sold for our commodity contracts and other expense/(income), net for our cross currency and foreign exchange contracts.

Note 13. Venezuela - Foreign Currency and Inflation
We have a subsidiary in Venezuela that manufactures and sells a variety of products, primarily in the condiments and sauces and infant and nutrition
categories. We apply highly inflationary accounting to the results of our Venezuelan subsidiary and include these results in our consolidated financial
statements. Our results of operations in Venezuela reflect a controlled subsidiary. We continue to have sufficient currency liquidity and pricing flexibility to
control our operations. However, the continuing economic uncertainty, strict labor laws, and evolving government controls over imports, prices, currency
exchange, and payments present a challenging operating environment. Increased restrictions imposed by the Venezuelan government or further deterioration
of the economic environment could impact our ability to control our Venezuelan operations and could lead us to deconsolidate our Venezuelan subsidiary in
the future. We currently do not expect to make any new investments or contributions into Venezuela.
At December 30, 2017, there were two exchange rates legally available to us for converting Venezuelan bolivars to U.S. dollars, including:
•the official exchange rate of BsF10 per U.S. dollar available through the Sistema de Divisa Protegida (“DIPRO”) for purchases and sales of essential
items, including food products; and
•an alternative exchange rate available through the Sistema de Divisa Complementaria (“DICOM”) for all transactions not covered by DIPRO. The
published DICOM rate was BsF3,345 per U.S. dollar at December 30, 2017.
We have had no settlements at the DIPRO rate in 2017. At December 30, 2017, we had outstanding requests of $26 million for payment of invoices for the
purchase of ingredients and packaging materials for the years 2012 through 2015, all of which were requested for payment at BsF6.30 per U.S. dollar (the
official exchange rate until March 10, 2016).
We have had access to U.S. dollars at DICOM rates in 2017. However, since September 2017 the Venezuelan government has not held any auctions through
which we obtain U.S. dollars at DICOM rates. Accordingly, we did not have access to U.S. dollars at DICOM rates in the fourth quarter of 2017.
In addition to DIPRO and DICOM, there is an unofficial market for obtaining U.S. dollars with Venezuelan bolivars. The exact exchange rate is widely
debated but is generally accepted to be substantially higher than the latest published DICOM rate. We have not transacted at any unofficial market rates in
2017 and have no plans to transact at unofficial market rates in the foreseeable future.
Outside of accessing the DICOM market, our Venezuelan subsidiary obtains U.S. dollars through exports. These U.S. dollars are primarily used for purchases
of tomato paste and spare parts for manufacturing, as well as a limited amount of other operating costs. As of December 30, 2017, our Venezuelan subsidiary
has sufficient U.S. dollars to fund these operational needs in the foreseeable future. However, further deterioration of the economic environment or regulation
changes could jeopardize our export business. Our Venezuelan subsidiary has increasingly sourced production inputs locally, including tomato paste and
sugar, in order to reduce reliance on U.S. dollars, which we expect to continue in the foreseeable future.
As of December 30, 2017, we believe the DICOM rate is the most appropriate legally available rate at which to translate the results of our Venezuelan
subsidiary. We continue to monitor the DICOM rate, and the nonmonetary assets supported by the underlying operations in Venezuela, for impairment.
We remeasure the monetary assets and liabilities, as well as the operating results, of our Venezuelan subsidiary at DICOM rates. These remeasurements
resulted in a nonmonetary currency devaluation loss of $36 million in 2017, $24 million in 2016, and $234 million in 2015. These amounts were recorded in
other expense/(income), net, in the consolidated statements of income.
In the second quarter of 2016, we assessed the nonmonetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary for impairment, resulting in a $53 million loss to write down
property, plant and equipment, net, and prepaid spare parts, which was recorded within cost of products sold in the consolidated statement of income.
In the second quarter of 2015, we reevaluated the rate used to remeasure the monetary assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary and determined that
the DICOM rate was the most appropriate legally available rate. Prior to DICOM, we used the official exchange rate of BsF6.30 per U.S. dollar. This change
resulted in a nonmonetary currency devaluation loss of $234 million. Additionally, we assessed the nonmonetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary for
impairment, which resulted in a $49 million loss to write down inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value. This amount was recorded in cost of
products sold in the consolidated statement of income.

Note 14. Financing Arrangements
We utilize accounts receivable securitization and factoring programs (the “Programs”) globally for our working capital needs and to provide efficient
liquidity. We operate these Programs such that we generally utilize the majority of the available aggregate cash consideration limits. We account for transfers
of receivables pursuant to the Programs as a sale and remove them from our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Under the Programs, we generally
receive cash consideration up to a certain limit and record a non-cash exchange for sold receivables for the remainder of the purchase price. We maintain a
“beneficial interest,” or a right to collect cash, in the sold receivables. Cash receipts from the payments on sold receivables (which are cash receipts on the
underlying trade receivables that have already been securitized in these Programs) are classified as investing activities and presented as cash receipts on sold
receivables on our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.
At December 30, 2017, we had accounts receivable securitization and factoring programs in place in the U.S. and in various countries across the globe.
Generally, each of these programs automatically renews annually until terminated by either party, except our U.S. securitization program, which expires in
May 2018. Additionally, our U.S. securitization program utilizes a bankruptcy-remote special-purpose entity (“SPE”). The SPE is wholly-owned by a
subsidiary of Kraft Heinz and its sole business consists of the purchase or acceptance, through capital contributions of receivables and related assets, from a
Kraft Heinz subsidiary and subsequent transfer of such receivables and related assets to a bank. Although the SPE is included in our consolidated financial
statements, it is a separate legal entity with separate creditors who will be entitled, upon its liquidation, to be satisfied out of the SPE's assets prior to any
assets or value in the SPE becoming available to Kraft Heinz or its subsidiaries.
The carrying value of trade receivables removed from our condensed consolidated balance sheets in connection with the Programs was $1.0
billion at December 30, 2017 and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2016. In exchange for the sale of trade receivables, we received cash of $673 million at
December 30, 2017 and $904 million at December 31, 2016 and recorded sold receivables of $353 million at December 30, 2017 and $129
million at December 31, 2016. The carrying value of sold receivables approximated the fair value at December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.
We act as servicer for certain of the Programs and did not record any related servicing assets or liabilities as of December 30, 2017 or December 31,
2016 because they were not material to the financial statements.
Additionally, we enter into various structured payable arrangements to facilitate supply from our vendors. Balance sheet classification is based on the nature
of the agreements with our various vendors. For certain arrangements, we classify amounts outstanding within other current liabilities on our consolidated
balance sheets. We had approximately $188 million on our consolidated balance sheets at December 30, 2017 related to these arrangements. There were no
amounts related to these arrangements on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2016.

We are routinely involved in legal proceedings, claims, and governmental inquiries, inspections or investigations (“Legal Matters”) arising in the ordinary
course of our business. While we cannot predict with certainty the results of Legal Matters in which we are currently involved or may in the future be
involved, we do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve any of the Legal Matters that are currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition or results of operations.
Leases:
Rental expenses for leases of warehouse, production, and office facilities and equipment were $183 million in 2017, $149 million in 2016, and $160 million
in 2015.
Minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases in effect at December 30, 2017 were (in millions):
2018 $ 103
2019 91
2020 73
2021 54
2022 45
Thereafter 165
Total $ 531

Purchase Obligations:
We have purchase obligations for materials, supplies, property, plant and equipment, and co-packing, storage and distribution services based on projected
needs to be utilized in the normal course of business. Other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing, advertising, capital expenditures,
information technology, and professional services.
As of December 30, 2017, our take-or-pay purchase obligations were as follows (in millions):
2018 $ 1,558
2019 724
2020 527
2021 235
2022 211
Thereafter 439
Total $ 3,694
Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest:
In 2017, we commenced operations of a joint venture with a minority partner to manufacture, package, market, and distribute refrigerated soups and meal
sides. We control operations and include this business in our consolidated results. Our minority partner has put options that, if it chooses to exercise them,
would require us to purchase portions of its equity interest at a future date. These put options will become exercisable beginning in 2025 (on the eighth
anniversary of the product launch date) at a price to be determined at that time based upon an independent third party valuation. The minority partner’s put
options are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a redeemable noncontrolling interest. We accrete the redeemable noncontrolling interest to its
estimated redemption value over the term of the put options. As of December 30, 2017, we estimate the redemption value to be approximately $100 million.
Note 16. Debt
Borrowing Arrangements:
On July 6, 2015, together with Kraft Heinz Foods Company, our wholly owned operating subsidiary, we entered into a credit agreement (as amended, the
“Credit Agreement”), which provides for a $4.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Senior Credit Facility”), which matures on July 6,
2021.
No amounts were drawn on our Senior Credit Facility at December 30, 2017, at December 31, 2016, or during the years ended December 30, 2017,
December 31, 2016, and January 3, 2016.
The Senior Credit Facility includes a $1.0 billion sub-limit for borrowings in alternative currencies (i.e., euro, sterling, Canadian dollars, or other lawful
currencies readily available and freely transferable and convertible into U.S. dollars), as well as a letter of credit sub-facility of up to $300 million. Subject to
certain conditions, we may increase the amount of revolving commitments and/or add additional tranches of term loans in a combined aggregate amount of up
to $1.0 billion.
Any committed borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility bear interest at a variable annual rate based on LIBOR/EURIBOR/CDOR loans or an alternate
base rate/Canadian prime rate, in each case subject to an applicable margin based upon the long-term senior unsecured, non-credit enhanced debt rating
assigned to us. The borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility have interest rates based on, at our election, base rate, LIBOR, EURIBOR, CDOR, or
Canadian prime rate plus a spread ranging from 87.5-175 basis points for LIBOR, EURIBOR, and CDOR loans, and 0-75 basis points for base rate or
Canadian prime rate loans.
The Senior Credit Facility contains representations, warranties, and covenants that are typical for these types of facilities. Our Senior Credit Facility requires
us to maintain a minimum shareholders’ equity (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses)) of at least $35 billion. We were in compliance
with this covenant as of December 30, 2017.
The obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Kraft Heinz Foods Company in the case of indebtedness and other liabilities of any subsidiary
borrower and by Kraft Heinz in the case of indebtedness and other liabilities of any subsidiary borrower and Kraft Heinz Foods Company.
In August 2017, we repaid $600 million aggregate principal amount of our previously outstanding senior unsecured loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility”).
Accordingly, there were no amounts outstanding on the Term Loan Facility at December 30, 2017. At December 31, 2016, $600 million aggregate principal
amount of our Term Loan Facility was outstanding.
92
In 2017, we obtained funding through our U.S. and European commercial paper programs. At December 30, 2017 we had $448 million of commercial paper
outstanding, with a weighted average interest rate of 1.541%. At December 31, 2016, we had $642 million of commercial paper outstanding, with a weighted
average interest rate of 1.074%.
Long-Term Debt:
Our long-term debt consists of the following:

1  Priority of debt indicates the order which debt would be paid if all debt obligations were due on the same day. Senior secured debt takes priority over unsecured debt. Senior debt has greater
seniority than subordinated debt.
2  Floating interest rates are stated as of December 30, 2017.
(a)  The 4.875% Second Lien Senior Secured Notes due February 15, 2025 (the “2025 Notes”) are senior in right of payment of existing and future unsecured and subordinated indebtedness.
(b)  We fully and unconditionally guarantee these notes, which were issued by Kraft Heinz Foods Company.
(c)    Includes current year issuances (the “New Notes”) described below.
(d)
 Includes £125 million aggregate principal amount of 6.250% Pound Sterling Notes due February 18, 2030 (the “2030 Notes”) previously issued by H.J. Heinz Finance UK Plc and guaranteed by
Kraft Heinz Foods Company, which we became guarantor of in connection with the 2015 Merger.
(e)We repaid the Term Loan Facility in 2017; therefore, no amounts were outstanding, nor was there an applicable maturity date or interest rate, at December 30, 2017.
Our long-term debt contains customary representations, covenants, and events of default, and we were in compliance with all such covenants at December 30,
2017.
At December 30, 2017, aggregate principal maturities of our long-term debt excluding capital leases were (in millions):
2018 $ 2,697
2019 355
2020 3,042
2021 691
2022 3,507
Thereafter 20,273
Debt Issuances:
In the third quarter of 2017, Kraft Heinz Foods Company, our wholly owned operating subsidiary, issued New Notes, including $350 million aggregate
principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2019, $650 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2021, and $500 million
aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2022.
We used the net proceeds from the New Notes primarily to repay all amounts outstanding under our $600 million Term Loan Facility together with accrued
interest thereon, to refinance a portion of our commercial paper program, and for other general corporate purposes.
93
Debt Issuance Costs:
Debt issuance costs are reflected as a direct deduction of our long-term debt balance on the consolidated balance sheets. We incurred debt issuance costs of
$53 million in 2016 and $99 million in 2015. Debt issuance costs in 2017 were insignificant. Unamortized debt issuance costs were $114 million at December
30, 2017, $124 million at December 31, 2016, and $85 million at January 3, 2016. Amortization of debt issuance costs was $16 million in 2017, $14 million
in 2016, and $27 million in 2015.
Debt Premium:
Unamortized debt premiums are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a direct addition to the carrying amount of debt. Unamortized debt premium,
net was $505 million at December 30, 2017 and $585 million at December 31, 2016. Amortization of our debt premium, net was $81 million in 2017, $88
million in 2016, and $45 million in 2015.
Debt Repayments:
In June 2017, we repaid $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes that matured in the period. We funded these long-term debt repayments
primarily with cash on hand and our commercial paper programs. Additionally, we repaid our $600 million aggregate principal amount Term Loan Facility in
August 2017.
In 2015, we recorded a $341 million loss on extinguishment of debt, which was comprised of a write-off of debt issuance costs and unamortized debt
discounts of $236 million in interest expense as well as call premiums of $105 million in other expense/(income), net.
Fair Value of Debt:
At December 30, 2017, the aggregate fair value of our total debt was $33.0 billion as compared with a carrying value of $31.5 billion. At December 31, 2016,
the aggregate fair value of our total debt was $33.2 billion as compared with a carrying value of $32.4 billion. We determined the fair value of our long-term
debt using Level 2 inputs. Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments.
Note 17. Capital Stock
Preferred Stock and Warrants
Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 920,000 shares of preferred stock.
On June 7, 2016, we redeemed all 80,000 outstanding shares of our 9.00% cumulative compounding preferred stock, Series A (“Series A Preferred Stock”)
for $8.3 billion. We funded this redemption primarily through the issuance of long-term debt in May 2016, as well as other sources of liquidity, including our
commercial paper program, U.S. securitization program, and cash on hand. In connection with the redemption, all Series A Preferred Stock was canceled and
automatically retired.
The 80,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock were issued in connection with the 2013 Merger, along with warrants to purchase 46 million Heinz common
shares, at an exercise price of $0.01 per common share (the “Warrants”), for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 billion. We allocated the proceeds to the
Series A Preferred Stock ($7.6 billion) and the Warrants ($367 million) on a relative fair value basis. In June 2015, Berkshire Hathaway exercised the
Warrants to purchase the additional 46 million Heinz common shares, which were subsequently reclassified and changed into approximately 20 million shares
of Kraft Heinz common stock.
Common Stock
Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 5.0 billion shares of common stock.
Immediately prior to the consummation of the 2015 Merger, each share of Heinz issued and outstanding common stock was reclassified and changed into
0.443332 of a share of Kraft Heinz common stock. All share and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted for all historical periods presented prior
to the 2015 Merger Date to give effect to this conversion. In the 2015 Merger, all outstanding shares of Kraft common stock were converted into the right to
receive, on one-for-one basis, shares of Kraft Heinz common stock.

Shares of common stock issued, in treasury, and outstanding were (in millions of shares):
 Shares Issued Treasury Shares Shares

Note 18. Earnings Per Share
As a result of the stock conversion prior to the 2015 Merger, all per share data, numbers of shares, and numbers of equity awards outstanding were
retroactively adjusted for all historical periods presented prior to the 2015 Merger Date. See Note 1, Background and Basis of Presentation, for additional
information.
Our earnings per common share (“EPS”) were:
 December 30,
2017
(52 weeks)  December 31,
2016
(52 weeks)  January 3,
2016
(53 weeks)
 (in millions, except per share data)
Basic Earnings Per Common Share:      
Net income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders $ 10,999 $ 3,452 $ (266)
Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding 1,218 1,217 786
Net earnings/(loss) $ 9.03 $ 2.84 $ (0.34)
Diluted Earnings Per Common Share:      
Net income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders $ 10,999 $ 3,452 $ (266)
Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding 1,218 1,217 786
Effect of dilutive equity awards 10 9 —
Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding, including dilutive effect 1,228 1,226 786
Net earnings/(loss) $ 8.95 $ 2.81 $ (0.34)
We use the treasury stock method to calculate the dilutive effect of outstanding equity awards in the denominator for diluted EPS. Due to the net loss
attributable to common shareholders in 2015, the dilutive effects of equity awards and warrants were excluded because their inclusion would have had an
anti-dilutive effect on earnings per share. Anti-dilutive shares were 2 million in 2017, 3 million in 2016, and 17 million in 2015.
Note 19. Segment Reporting
We manufacture and market food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee,
and other grocery products, throughout the world.
We manage and report our operating results through four segments. We have three reportable segments defined by geographic region: United States, Canada,
and Europe. Our remaining businesses are combined and disclosed as “Rest of World”. Rest of World is comprised of two operating segments: Latin
America; and Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa (“AMEA”).
In the third quarter of 2017, we announced our plans to reorganize certain of our international businesses to better align our global geographies. These plans
include moving our Middle East and Africa businesses from the AMEA segment into the Europe segment, forming the Europe, Middle East, and Africa
(“EMEA”) segment. The remaining AMEA businesses will become the Asia Pacific (“APAC”) segment, which will remain in Rest of World. We expect these
changes to become effective in the first quarter of 2018. As a result, we expect to restate our Europe and Rest of World segments to reflect these changes for
historical periods presented in the first quarter of 2018.
95
Management evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including net sales and segment adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation,
and amortization (“Segment Adjusted EBITDA”). Management uses Segment Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of
certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations. These items include depreciation and amortization (excluding
integration and restructuring expenses; including amortization of postretirement benefit plans prior service credits), equity award compensation expense,
integration and restructuring expenses, merger costs, unrealized gains/(losses) on commodity hedges (the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in general
corporate expenses until realized; once realized, the gains and losses are recorded in the applicable segment’s operating results), impairment losses,
gains/(losses) on the sale of a business, and nonmonetary currency devaluation (e.g., remeasurement gains and losses). In addition, consistent with the manner
in which management evaluates segment performance and allocates resources, Segment Adjusted EBITDA includes the operating results of Kraft on a pro
forma basis, as if Kraft had been acquired as of December 30, 2013. There are no pro forma adjustments to any of the numbers disclosed in this note to the
consolidated financial statements except for the Segment Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation.
Management does not use assets by segment to evaluate performance or allocate resources. Therefore, we do not disclose assets by segment.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.
None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures, as of December 30, 2017, were effective and provided reasonable assurance that the information required to be
disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Remediation of Previously Disclosed Material Weakness
A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that
a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As previously disclosed
concurrently with the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, we concluded that we had a material weakness
in internal control over financial reporting related to the misapplication of Accounting Standards Update 2016-15. Specifically, we did not maintain effective
controls over the adoption of new accounting standards, including communication with the appropriate individuals in coming to our conclusions on the
application of new standards. Our management determined that the control deficiency constituted a material weakness.
During the fourth quarter of 2017, management implemented steps to improve the evaluation and documentation of new accounting standards’ impacts and
communication with the appropriate individuals. 
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with other members of management, evaluated the changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during the three months ended December 30, 2017. During the three months ended December 30, 2017, management implemented steps to improve
the evaluation and documentation of new accounting standards’ impacts and communication with the appropriate individuals. These changes have been
designed to ensure enhanced subject matter expert input in relation to new accounting standard pronouncements.
We determined that, except for the remediation activities described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during
the three months ended December 30, 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the
Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal
control over financial reporting includes those written policies and procedures that:
•pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets;
•provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles;
•provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with management and director authorization; and
•provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a
material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
109
Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2017. Management based this assessment on
criteria described in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO).
Based on this assessment, management determined that as of December 30, 2017, we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, who audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K, has also audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2017, as stated in their report
which appears herein under Item 8.

Exhibit 10.17
THE KRAFT HEINZ COMPANY
OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN
RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT
Unless defined in this award agreement (together with all exhibits and appendices attached thereto, this "Award Agreement"),
capitalized terms will have the same meanings ascribed to them in The Kraft Heinz Company 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (as may be
amended from time to time, the "Plan").
Subject to your acceptance of this Award Agreement, you are hereby being granted an award of Restricted Stock Units (the "RSUs") as
of the Grant Date set forth below (the "Grant Date"). Each RSU is a bookkeeping entry representing the right to receive one (1) share of The
Kraft Heinz Company's (the "Company") common stock on the following terms and subject to the provisions of the Plan, which is
incorporated herein by reference. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of the Plan and this Award Agreement, the provisions of the
Plan will govern.
Number of RSUs:        
Grant Date:        
Vesting Date:            
Termination Without Cause, death and Disability:
Dividend Equivalents:            
By agreeing to this Award Agreement, you agree that the RSUs are granted under and governed by the terms and conditions of this
Award Agreement (including, without limitation, the terms and conditions set forth on Exhibit A, the Restrictive Covenants Agreement
attached as Exhibit B and the terms and conditions set forth on Appendix I) and the Plan.
 THE KRAFT HEINZ COMPANY
EXHIBIT A
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE
RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS
Vesting
The RSUs will vest on the "Vesting Date" set forth in this Award Agreement subject to your continued Service (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, service as a consultant or advisor) with the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, except as otherwise set forth in the Plan or
this Award Agreement (including, without limitation, the section below titled "Termination"). Prior to the vesting and settlement of the RSUs,
you will not have any rights of a shareholder with respect to the RSUs or the Shares subject thereto.
Shares due to you upon vesting and settlement of the RSUs will be delivered in accordance with the provisions of the section below titled
"Settlement of Vested RSUs." However, no Shares will be delivered pursuant to the vesting of the RSUs prior to the fulfillment of all of the
following conditions: (i) you have complied with your obligations under this Award Agreement and the Plan, (ii) the vesting of the RSUs and
the delivery of such Shares complies with applicable law, (iii) full payment (or satisfactory provision therefor) of any Tax-Related Items (as
defined below), (iv) the admission of the Shares to listing on all stock exchanges on which the Shares are then listed, (v) the completion of any
registration or other qualification of the Shares under any state or federal law or under rulings or regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "Commission") or other governmental regulatory body, which the Committee shall, in its sole and absolute discretion, deem
necessary and advisable, or if the offering of the Shares is not so registered, a determination by the Company that the issuance of the Shares
would be exempt from any such registration or qualification requirements, (vi) the obtaining of any approval or other clearance from any state,
federal or foreign governmental agency that the Committee shall, in its absolute discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable and (vii) the
lapse of any such reasonable period of time following the date the RSUs become payable as the Committee may from time to time establish for
reasons of administrative convenience, subject to compliance with Section 409A of the Code.
Until such time as the Shares are delivered to you (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly
authorized transfer agent of the Company), you will have no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder with respect
to such Shares, notwithstanding the vesting of the RSUs.
Termination
Effect of a Termination of Service on Vesting
Other than as set forth below, upon a termination of your Service for any reason prior to the Vesting Date, you will forfeit the RSUs,
without any consideration due to you.
If prior to the Vesting Date, but more than three years after the Grant Date, the Company terminates your Service Without Cause (as
defined below) or your Service terminates by reason of your death, Retirement or Disability (as defined below), your RSUs shall be vested as if
30% of the RSUs had previously vested on the third anniversary of the Grant Date on which you were providing Service and 60% of the RSUs
has previously vested on the fourth anniversary of the Grant Date on which you were providing Service.
Settlement of Vested RSUs
To the extent the RSUs become vested pursuant to the terms of this Award Agreement, the Company will issue and deliver to you, or,
as applicable, your Beneficiary or the personal representative of your estate, the number of Shares equal to the number of vested RSUs. Such
delivery of Shares will occur within the settlement period set forth in the table below, which will vary depending on the applicable vesting
event.
Vesting Event Settlement Period
Vesting DateAs soon as practicable and no later than 60 days following the Vesting
Date
Termination of Service Without Cause Within 60 days of your termination date*
Retirement Within 60 days of your termination date*
Disability Within 60 days of your termination date*
Death Within 60 days of the date of death
*If you are subject to U.S. federal income tax and the RSUs constitute an item of non-qualified deferred compensation, within the meaning
of Section 409A of the Code, as determined by the Company ("Deferred Compensation"), settlement will occur within this period only if
your termination of Service constitutes a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code ("Separation from
Service"); otherwise, settlement will occur in accordance with the original vesting schedule (i.e., as soon as practicable and no later than
sixty (60) days following the Vesting Date).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are subject to U.S. federal income tax and the Company determines that you are a "specified
employee" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, any RSUs that are Deferred Compensation and are subject to settlement upon your
Separation from Service will instead be settled on the date that is the first business day following the six (6) month anniversary of such
Separation from Service, or, if earlier, upon your death, to the extent required pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.
Applicable Definitions
All capitalized terms used in this Agreement without definition shall have the meanings ascribed in the Plan. For purposes of this
Award Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
"Disability" means (i) a physical or mental condition entitling you to benefits under the long-term disability policy of the Company
covering you or (ii) in the absence of any such policy, a physical or mental condition rendering you unable to perform your duties for the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for a period of six (6) consecutive months or longer; provided that if you are a party to an
Employment Agreement at the time of termination of your Service and such Employment Agreement contains a different definition of
"disability" (or any derivation thereof), the definition in such Employment Agreement will control for purposes of this Award Agreement.
"Employment Agreement" means an individual written employment agreement between you and the Company or any of its Affiliates,
including an offer letter.
"Retirement" means a termination of Service by you on or after the later of (i) your 65th birthday and (ii) your completion of five (5)
years of Service with the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Affiliates.
"Without Cause" means (i) a termination of your Service by the Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates other than for Cause (as
defined in the Plan) and other than due to your death, Disability or Retirement or (ii) (A) if you are a party to an Employment Agreement, (B)
such Employment Agreement is in effect upon the date of your termination of Service and (C) such Employment Agreement defines "Good
Reason", then "Without Cause" shall also include resignation of your Service for "Good Reason" in accordance with such Employment
Agreement.
Special Termination Provisions
In the event that there is a conflict between the terms of this Award Agreement regarding the effect of a termination of your Service on
the RSUs and the terms of any Employment Agreement, the terms of this Award Agreement will govern.
If you are terminated Without Cause or due to your resignation and, within the twelve (12) month period subsequent to such
termination of your Service, the Company determines that your Service could have been terminated for Cause, subject to anything to the
contrary that may be contained in your Employment Agreement at the time of termination of your Service, your Service will, at the election of
the Company, be deemed to have been terminated for Cause for purposes of this Award Agreement and the Plan, effective as of the date the
events giving rise to Cause occurred and any consequences following from a termination for Cause shall be retroactively applied (including
your obligation to repay gains that would not have been realized had your Service been terminated for Cause).
Effect of a Change in Control
The treatment of the RSUs upon a Change in Control shall be governed by the Plan, provided, however, that to the extent that the RSUs
constitute Deferred Compensation, settlement of any portion of the RSUs that may vest in connection with a Change in Control will occur
within sixty (60) days following the Vesting Date. In the event that there is a conflict between the terms of this Award Agreement regarding the
effect of a Change in Control on the RSUs and the terms of any Employment Agreement, the terms of this Award Agreement will govern.
Restrictive Covenants
Your Service will provide you with specialized training and unique knowledge and access to confidential information and key business
relationships, which, if used in competition with the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or its Affiliates, would cause harm to such entities. As such,
in partial consideration of the RSUs granted under this Award Agreement, you agree to comply with the Company's Restrictive Covenants
Agreement, attached (and incorporated into this Award Agreement) as Exhibit B. The restrictions and obligations contained in the Restrictive
Covenants Agreement are in addition to any restrictions imposed by, or obligations you may have to, the Company, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
under any Employment Agreement or otherwise.
Taxes
You acknowledge that, regardless of any action the Company or your employer (the “Employer”) takes with respect to any or all
income tax, social security or insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding ("Tax-Related
Items"), the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by you is and remains your responsibility and that the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any
aspect of the RSU grant, including the grant, vesting or settlement of the RSUs, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such
settlement and the receipt of any dividends or Dividend Equivalents and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of
the RSUs to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items.
Prior to vesting of the RSUs, you will pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Committee to satisfy all Tax-Related
Items. In this regard, you authorize the withholding of all applicable Tax-Related Items legally payable by you from your wages or other cash
compensation paid to you by the Company and/or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or from proceeds of the sale of Shares. Alternatively, or in
addition, if permissible under local law, the Company may in its sole and absolute discretion (A) sell or arrange for the sale of Shares that you
acquire to meet the obligation for Tax-Related Items, and/or (B) withhold the amount of Shares necessary to satisfy the minimum withholding
amount, or to the extent permitted by applicable accounting principles, withhold Shares based on a rate of up to the maximum applicable
withholding rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are subject to the short-swing profit rules of Section 16(b) of the Act, you may elect the
form of withholding in advance of any Tax-Related Items withholding event, and in the absence of your election, the Company shall deduct the
number of Shares having an aggregate value equal to the amount of Tax-Related Items withholding due from the vesting of the RSUs, or the
Committee may determine that a particular method be used to satisfy any Tax Related Items withholding.
Further, the Company is authorized to satisfy the withholding for any or all Tax-Related Items arising from the granting, vesting, or
payment of the RSUs or sale of Shares issued in settlement of the RSUs, as the case may be, by deducting the number of Shares having an
aggregate value equal to the amount of the Tax-Related Items withholding due or otherwise becoming subject to current taxation. If the
Company satisfies the Tax-Related Items obligation by withholding a number of Shares as described herein, for tax purposes, you shall be
deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares due to you at vesting, notwithstanding that a number of Shares is held back solely for the
purpose of such Tax-Related Items withholding.
Furthermore, the Company and/or the Employer are authorized to satisfy the Tax-Related Items withholding arising from the granting,
vesting, or payment of this Performance Share Award, or sale of Shares issued pursuant to the Performance Share Award, as the case may be,
by withholding from the Participant’s wages, or other cash compensation paid to you by the Company and/or the Employer.
Finally, you will pay to the Company and/or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates may be required to withhold as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means
previously described. The Company may refuse to deliver the Shares if you fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-
Related Items as described in this section.
No Guarantee of Continued Service
You acknowledge and agree that the vesting of the RSUs on the Vesting Date (or such earlier date as set forth in the section above titled
"Termination") is earned only by performing continuing Service (not through the act of being hired or being granted this Award). You further
acknowledge and agree that this Award Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereunder and the Vesting Date shall not be construed as
giving you the right to be retained in the employ of, or to continue to provide Service to, the Company or its Subsidiaries. Further, the Company
or the applicable Subsidiary may at any time dismiss you, free from any liability, or any claim under the Plan, unless otherwise expressly
provided in any other agreement binding you, the Company or the applicable Subsidiary. The receipt of this Award is not intended to confer any
rights on you except as set forth in this Award Agreement.
Company's Right of Offset
If you become entitled to a distribution of benefits under this Award, and if at such time you have any outstanding debt, obligation, or
other liability representing an amount owing to the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its Affiliates, then the Company, its Subsidiaries or its
Affiliates, upon a determination by the Committee, and to the extent permitted by applicable law and it would not cause a violation of Section
409A of the Code, may offset such amount so owing against the amount of benefits otherwise distributable. Such determination shall be made
by the Committee.
Acknowledgment of Nature of Award
In accepting the RSUs, you understand, acknowledge and agree that:
(a)    the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and may be modified, amended, suspended or
terminated by the Company at any time, as provided in the Plan and this Award Agreement;
(b)    the award of the RSUs is voluntary, occasional and discretionary and does not create any contractual or other right to receive
future RSU awards, or benefits in lieu of RSUs even if RSUs have been awarded in the past;
(c)    all decisions with respect to future awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company, including, but not limited to, the
form and timing of the RSUs, the number of Shares subject to the RSUs, and the vesting provisions applicable to the RSUs;
(d)    your participation in the Plan is voluntary;
(e)    the RSUs are an extraordinary item that does not constitute compensation of any kind for services of any kind rendered to the
Company or its Subsidiaries;
(f)    the RSUs, any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income and value of same are not part of normal or expected compensation
or salary for purposes of calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service
awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments;
(g)    the future value of the underlying Shares is unknown, indeterminable, and cannot be predicted with certainty;
(h)    unless otherwise agreed with the Company in writing, the RSUs, any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income and value of
same, are not granted as consideration for, or in connection with, any Service you may provide as a director of a Subsidiary or Affiliate;
(i)    no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the RSU resulting from termination of your
Service (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you
provide Service or the terms of your Employment Agreement, if any), and in consideration of the grant of the RSU to which you are otherwise
not entitled, you irrevocably agree never to institute any claim against the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, waive your ability, if
any, to bring any such claim, and release the Company, and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates from any such claim; if, notwithstanding the
foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Plan, you shall be deemed irrevocably to
have agreed not to pursue such claim and agree to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claim;
and
(j)    the RSUs are subject to the terms of the Plan (including, without limitation, certain provisions regarding Adjustments,
Repurchases and Transfers).
Securities Laws
By accepting the RSUs, you acknowledge that U.S. federal, state or foreign securities laws and/or the Company's policies regarding
trading in its securities may limit or restrict your right to buy or sell Shares, including, without limitation, sales of Shares acquired in
connection with the RSUs. You agree to comply with such securities law requirements and Company policies, as such laws and policies are
amended from time to time.
Data Privacy
You hereby explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal
data as described in this Award Agreement by and among, as applicable, the Company, its Subsidiaries and its Affiliates or any third party
administrator as designated by the Committee or its designee in its sole and absolute discretion for the exclusive purpose of implementing,
administering and managing your participation in the Plan.
You understand that the Company, its Subsidiaries and its Affiliates and/or any other third party administrator as designated by the
Committee or its designee in its sole and absolute discretion may hold certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to,
your name, home address and telephone number, email address, date of birth, social insurance, passport or social security number or other
identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company, details of the RSUs or any
other entitlement to Shares awarded, canceled, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor ("Data"), for the purpose of implementing,
administering and managing the Plan. You understand that Data may be transferred to any third parties assisting in the implementation,
administration and management of the Plan, that these recipients may be located in your country, or elsewhere, and that the recipient's
country may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country. You understand that if you reside outside the United States,
you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting your local human resources
representative. You authorize the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the
purposes of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as
may be required to a broker, escrow agent or other third party with whom the Shares received upon settlement of the RSUs may be
deposited. You understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the
Plan. You understand that if you reside outside the United States you may, at any time, view Data, request information about the storage
and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by
contacting in writing your local human resources representative. You understand that refusal or withdrawal of consent may affect your
ability to participate in the Plan. Further, you understand that you are providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis.  If you do
not consent, or if you later seek to revoke your consent, your employment status or Service will not be affected; the only consequence of
refusing or withdrawing your consent is that the Company would not be able to grant you RSUs or other Awards or administer or maintain
such Awards. For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you understand that you may
contact your local human resources representative.
Limits on Transferability; Beneficiaries
The RSUs shall not be pledged, hypothecated or otherwise encumbered or subject to any lien, obligation or liability to any party, or
Transferred, otherwise than by your will or the laws of descent and distribution or to a Beneficiary upon your death. A Beneficiary or other
person claiming any rights under this Award Agreement shall be subject to all terms and conditions of the Plan and this Award Agreement,
except as otherwise determined by the Committee, and to any additional terms and conditions deemed necessary or appropriate by the
Committee.
No Transfer to any executor or administrator of your estate or to any Beneficiary by will or the laws of descent and distribution of any
rights in respect of the RSUs shall be effective to bind the Company unless the Committee shall have been furnished with (i) written notice
thereof and with a copy of the will and/or such evidence as the Committee may deem necessary to establish the validity of the Transfer and (ii)
the written agreement of the Transferee to comply with the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement, to the extent applicable, as
determined by the Company.
Repayment/Forfeiture
As an additional condition of receiving the RSUs and without prejudice to the terms of the Company's Restrictive Covenants
Agreement (attached as Exhibit B), you agree that the RSUs and any proceeds or other benefits you may receive hereunder shall be subject to
forfeiture and/or repayment to the Company to the extent required (i) under the terms of any policy adopted by the Company as may be
amended from time to time (and such requirements shall be deemed incorporated into this Award Agreement without your consent) or (ii) to
comply with any requirements imposed under applicable laws and/or the rules and regulations of the securities exchange or inter-dealer
quotation system on which the Shares are listed or quoted, including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Further, if you receive any amount in excess of what you should have received under the terms
of the RSUs for any reason (including without limitation by reason of a financial restatement, mistake in calculations or administrative error),
all as determined by the Committee, then you shall be required to promptly repay any such excess amount to the Company. Nothing in or about
this Agreement
prohibits you from: (i) filing and, as provided for under Section 21F of the Act, maintaining the confidentiality of a claim with the Commission,
(ii) providing the Commission with information that would otherwise violate the non-disclosure restrictions in this Agreement, to the extent
permitted by Section 21F of the Act; (iii) cooperating, participating or assisting in a Commission investigation or proceeding without notifying
the Company; or (iv) receiving a monetary award as set forth in Section 21F of the Act. Furthermore, you are advised that you shall not be held
criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of any Confidential Information (as defined in Exhibit
B) that constitutes a trade secret to which the Defend Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. Section 1833(b)) applies that is made (i) in confidence to a
federal, state or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, in each case, solely for the purpose of reporting or
investigating a suspected violation of law; or (ii) in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or proceeding, if such filings are made
under seal.
Section 409A
It is intended that the RSUs awarded pursuant to this Award Agreement be exempt from or compliant with Section 409A of the Code
("Section 409A") and the Award Agreement shall be interpreted, construed and operated to reflect this intent. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
this Award Agreement and the Plan may be amended at any time, without the consent of any party, to the extent that is necessary or desirable to
exempt the RSUs from Section 409A or satisfy any of the requirements under Section 409A, but the Company shall not be under any obligation
to make any such amendment. Further, the Company, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates do not make any representation to you that the RSUs
awarded pursuant to this Award Agreement shall be exempt from or satisfy the requirements of Section 409A, and the Company, its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall have no liability or other obligation to indemnify or hold harmless you or any Beneficiary, Transferee or other
party for any tax, additional tax, interest or penalties that you or any Beneficiary, Transferee or other party may incur in the event that any
provision of this Award Agreement, or any amendment or modification thereof or any other action taken with respect thereto, is deemed to
violate any of the requirements of Section 409A.
Entire Agreement; Modification
The Plan, this Award Agreement and, to the extent applicable, your Employment Agreement or any separation agreement constitute the
entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede in their entirety all prior undertakings, representations
and agreements (whether oral or written) of the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or Affiliates and you with respect to the subject matter hereof.
This Award Agreement may not be modified in a manner that adversely affects your rights heretofore granted under the Plan, except with your
consent or to comply with applicable law or to the extent permitted under other provisions of the Plan.
Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial
This Award Agreement (together with all exhibits and appendices attached thereto) is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware,
without regard to its principles of conflict of laws, and any disputes shall be settled in accordance with the Plan.
To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, each of the parties hereto waives any right it may have to trial by jury in respect of
any litigation based on, arising out of, under or in connection with this Award Agreement (together with all exhibits and appendices
attached thereto) or the Plan.
Electronic Signatures and Delivery and Acceptance
The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to current or future participation in the Plan,
including this Award Agreement, by electronic means or request your consent to participate in the Plan by electronic means. You hereby
consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agree to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established
and maintained by the Company or a third party designated by the Company. The Award Agreement if delivered by electronic means with
electronic signatures shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed document and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed versions thereof delivered in person.
Agreement Severable
This Award Agreement shall be enforceable to the fullest extent allowed by law. In the event that any provision of this Award
Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, then that
provision shall be reduced, modified or otherwise conformed to the relevant law, judgment or determination to the degree necessary to render it
valid and enforceable without affecting the validity, legality or enforceability of any other provision of this Award Agreement or the validity,
legality or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. Any provision of this Award Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable
in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be deemed severable from the remainder of this Award Agreement, and the remaining
provisions contained in this Award Agreement shall be construed to preserve to the maximum permissible extent the intent and purposes of this
Award Agreement.
Interpretation
The Committee shall have the right to resolve all questions that may arise in connection with the Award or this Award Agreement,
including whether you are actively employed. Any interpretation, determination or other action made or taken by the Committee regarding the
Plan or this Award Agreement shall be final, binding and conclusive. This Award Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
any successor or successors of the Company and any person or persons who shall acquire any rights hereunder in accordance with this Award
Agreement or the Plan.
Language
If you have received this Award Agreement or any other document related to the Plan translated into a language other than English and
if the meaning of the translated version is different than the English version, the English version will control.

EXHIBIT B
RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AGREEMENT
I understand that I am or will be an employee to or other service-provider of The Kraft Heinz Company and/or its Subsidiaries and/or
its Affiliates (collectively the "Company"), and will learn and have access to the Company's confidential, trade secret and proprietary
information and key business relationships. I understand that the products and services that the Company develops, provides and markets are
unique. Further, I know that my promises in this Restrictive Covenants Agreement (the "Agreement") are an important way for the Company to
protect its proprietary interests and that The Kraft Heinz Company would not have granted me RSUs or other equity grants unless I made such
promises.
In addition to other good and valuable consideration, I am expressly being given RSUs or other equity grants in exchange for my
agreeing to the terms of this Agreement. In consideration of the foregoing, I (the "Executive") agree as follows:
1.NON-DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. During the course of Executive's Service, Executive will have access to
Confidential Information. For purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" means all data, information, ideas, concepts,
discoveries, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable or reduced to practice), innovations, improvements, know-how,
developments, techniques, methods, processes, treatments, drawings, sketches, specifications, designs, plans, patterns, models, plans and
strategies, and all other confidential or proprietary information or trade secrets in any form or medium (whether merely remembered or
embodied in a tangible or intangible form or medium) whether now or hereafter existing, relating to or arising from the past, current or
potential business, activities and/or operations of the Company, including, without limitation, any such information relating to or
concerning finances, sales, marketing, advertising, transition, promotions, pricing, personnel, customers, suppliers, vendors, raw partners
and/or competitors of the Company. Executive agrees that Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, use, make available, sell, disclose or
otherwise communicate to any person, other than in the course of Executive's assigned duties and for the benefit of the Company, either
during the period of Executive's Service or at any time thereafter, any Confidential Information or other confidential or proprietary
information received from third parties subject to a duty on the Company's part to maintain the confidentiality of such information, and to
use such information only for certain limited purposes, in each case, which shall have been obtained by Executive during Executive's
Service. The foregoing shall not apply to information that (i) was known to the public prior to its disclosure to Executive; (ii) becomes
generally known to the public subsequent to disclosure to Executive through no wrongful act of Executive or any representative of
Executive; or (iii) Executive is required to disclose by applicable law, regulation or legal process (provided that, to the extent permitted by
law, Executive provides the Company with prior notice of the contemplated disclosure and cooperates with the Company at its expense in
seeking a protective order or other appropriate protection of such information).
Pursuant to the U.S. Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, Executive shall not be held criminally, or civilly, liable under any Federal or State
Trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made in confidence either directly or indirectly to a Federal, State, or local
government official, or an attorney, for the sole purpose of reporting, or investigating, a violation of law. Moreover, Executive may disclose
trade secrets in a complaint, or other document, filed in a lawsuit, or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. Finally, if
Executive files a lawsuit alleging retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of the law, Executive may disclose the
trade secret to Executive's attorney and use the trade secret in the court proceeding, if Executive files any document containing the trade
secret under seal and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.
No Company policies or practices, including this Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information provision, is intended to or shall limit,
prevent, impede or interfere in any way with Executive's right, without prior notice to the Company, to provide information to the
government, participate in investigations, testify in proceedings regarding the Company's past or future conduct, or engage in any activities
protected under whistle blower statutes.
2.NON-COMPETITION. Executive acknowledges that (i) Executive performs services of a unique nature for the Company that are
irreplaceable, and that Executive's performance of such services to a competing business will result in irreparable harm to the Company, (ii)
Executive has had and will continue to have access to Confidential Information which, if disclosed, would unfairly and inappropriately
assist in competition against the Company, (iii) in the course of Executive's employment by or service to a competitor, Executive would
inevitably use or disclose such Confidential Information, (iv) the Company has substantial relationships with its customers and Executive
has had and will continue to have access to these customers, (v) Executive has received and will receive specialized training from the
Company, and (vi) Executive has generated and will continue to generate goodwill for the Company in the course of Executive's Service.
Accordingly, during Executive's Service and for eighteen (18) months following a termination of Executive's Service for any reason (the
"Restricted Period"), Executive will not engage in any business activities, directly or indirectly (whether as an employee, consultant,
officer, director, partner, joint venturer, manager, member, principal, agent, or independent contractor, individually, in concert with others,
or in any other manner) within the same line or lines of business for which the Executive performed services for the Company and in a
capacity that is similar to the capacity in which the Executive was employed by the Company with any person or entity that competes with
the Company in the consumer packaged food and beverage industry ("Competitive Business") anywhere within the same geographic
territory(ies) for which the Executive performed services for the Company (the "Restricted Territory"). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing herein shall prohibit Executive from being a passive owner of not more than three percent (3%) of the equity securities of a
publicly traded corporation engaged in a business that is in competition with the Company, so long as Executive has no active participation
in the business of such corporation.
3.NON-SOLICITATION. During the Restricted Period, Executive agrees that Executive shall not, except in the furtherance of Executive's
duties to the Company, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation or other entity, solicit, aid,
induce, assist in the solicitation of, or accept any business (other than on behalf of the Company) from, any customer or potential customer
of the Company to purchase goods or services then sold by the Company from another person, firm, corporation or other entity or, directly
or indirectly, in any way request, suggest or advise any such customer to withdraw or cancel any of their business or refuse to continue to
do business with the Company. This restriction shall apply to customers or potential customers who, during the two (2) years immediately
preceding the Executive's termination, had been assigned to the Executive by the Company, or with which the Executive had contact on
behalf of the Company while an Executive of the Company, or about which the Executive had access to confidential information by virtue
of Executive's employment with the Company.
4.NON-INTERFERENCE. During the Restricted Period, Executive agrees that Executive shall not, except in the furtherance of Executive's
duties to the Company, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation or other entity, (A) solicit, aid
or induce any employee, representative or agent of the Company to leave such employment or retention or to accept employment with or
render services to or with any other person, firm, corporation or other entity unaffiliated with the Company or hire or retain any such
employee, representative or agent, or take any action to materially assist or aid any other person, firm, corporation or other entity in
identifying, hiring or soliciting any such employee, representative or agent, or (B) interfere, or aid or induce any other person or entity in
interfering, with the relationship between the Company and its vendors, suppliers or customers. As used herein, the term "solicit, aid or
induce" includes, but is not limited to, (i) initiating communications with a Company employee relating to possible employment, (ii)
offering bonuses or other compensation to encourage a Company employee to terminate his or her employment with the Company and
accept employment with any entity, (iii) recommending a Company employee to any entity, and (iv) aiding an entity in recruitment of a
Company employee. An employee, representative or agent shall be deemed covered by this Section 4 while so employed or retained and for
a period of six (6) months thereafter.
5.NON-DISPARAGEMENT. Executive agrees not to make negative comments or otherwise disparage the Company or its officers,
directors, employees, shareholders, agents or products or services. The foregoing shall not be violated by truthful statements made in (a)
response to legal process, required governmental testimony or filings, or administrative or arbitral proceedings (including, without
limitation, depositions in connection with such proceedings) or (b) the good faith performance of Executive's duties to the Company.
6.INVENTIONS.
a.Executive acknowledges and agrees that all ideas, methods, inventions, discoveries, improvements, work products, developments,
software, know-how, processes, techniques, methods, works of authorship and other work product ("Inventions"), whether
patentable or unpatentable, (A) that are reduced to practice, created, invented, designed, developed, contributed to, or improved
with the use of any Company resources and/or within the scope of Executive's work with the Company or that relate to the
business, operations or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the Company, and that are made or
conceived by Executive, solely or jointly with others, during Executive's Service, or (B) suggested by any work that Executive
performs in connection with the Company, either while performing Executive's duties with the Company or on Executive's own
time, but only insofar as the Inventions are related to Executive's work as an employee or other service provider to the Company,
shall belong exclusively to the Company (or its designee), whether or not patent or other applications for intellectual property
protection are filed thereon. Executive will keep full and complete written records (the "Records"), in the manner prescribed by the
Company, of all Inventions, and will promptly disclose all Inventions completely and in writing to the Company. The Records shall
be the sole and exclusive property of the Company, and Executive will surrender them upon the termination of Service, or upon the
Company's request. Executive irrevocably conveys, transfers and assigns to the Company the Inventions and all patents or other
intellectual property rights that may issue thereon in any and all countries, whether during or subsequent to Executive's Service,
together with the right to file, in Executive's name or in the name of the Company (or its designee), applications for patents and
equivalent rights (the "Applications"). Executive will, at any time during and subsequent to Executive's Service, make such
applications, sign such papers, take all rightful oaths, and perform all other acts as may be requested from time to time by the
Company to perfect, record, enforce, protect, patent or register the Company's rights in the Inventions, all without additional
compensation to Executive from the Company. Executive will also execute assignments to the Company (or its designee) of the
Applications, and give the Company and its attorneys all reasonable assistance (including the giving of testimony) to obtain the
Inventions for the Company's benefit, all without additional compensation to Executive from the Company, but entirely at the
Company's expense.
b.In addition, the Inventions will be deemed Work for Hire, as such term is defined under the copyright laws of the United States, on
behalf of the Company and Executive agrees that the Company will be the sole owner of the Inventions, and all underlying rights
therein, in all media now known or hereinafter devised, throughout the universe and in perpetuity without any further obligations to
Executive. If the Inventions, or any portion thereof, are deemed not to be Work for Hire, or the rights in such Inventions do not
otherwise automatically vest in the Company, Executive hereby irrevocably conveys, transfers and assigns to the Company, all
rights, in all media now known or hereinafter devised, throughout the universe and in perpetuity, in and to the Inventions,
including, without limitation, all of Executive's right, title and interest in the copyrights (and all renewals, revivals and extensions
thereof) to the Inventions, including, without limitation, all rights of any kind or any nature now or hereafter recognized, including,
without limitation, the unrestricted right to make modifications, adaptations and revisions to the Inventions, to exploit and allow
others to exploit the Inventions and all rights to sue at law or in equity for any infringement, or other unauthorized use or conduct
in derogation of the Inventions, known or unknown, prior to the date hereof, including, without limitation, the right to receive all
proceeds and damages therefrom. In addition, Executive hereby waives any so-called "moral rights" with respect to the Inventions.
To the extent that Executive has any rights in the results and proceeds of Executive's service to the Company that cannot be
assigned in the manner described herein, Executive agrees to unconditionally waive the enforcement of such rights. Executive
hereby waives any and all currently existing and future monetary rights in and to the Inventions and all patents and other
registrations for intellectual property that may issue thereon, including, without limitation, any rights that would otherwise accrue
to Executive's benefit by virtue of Executive being an employee of or other service provider to the Company.
7.RETURN OF COMPANY PROPERTY. On the date of Executive's termination of Service with the Company for any reason (or at any
time prior thereto at the Company's request), Executive shall return all property belonging to the Company (including, but not limited to,
any Company-provided laptops, computers, cell phones, wireless electronic mail devices or other equipment, or documents and property
belonging to the Company).
8.REASONABLENESS OF COVENANTS. In signing this Agreement, including by electronic means, Executive gives the Company
assurance that Executive has carefully read and considered all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the restraints
imposed by it. Executive agrees that these restraints are necessary for the reasonable and proper protection of the Company and its
Confidential Information and that each and every one of the restraints is reasonable in respect to subject matter, length of time and
geographic area, and that these restraints, individually or in the aggregate, will not prevent Executive from obtaining other suitable
employment during the period in which Executive is bound by the restraints. Executive acknowledges that each of these covenants has a
unique, very substantial and immeasurable value to the Company and that Executive has sufficient assets and skills to provide a livelihood
while such covenants remain in force. Executive further covenants that Executive will not challenge the reasonableness or enforceability of
any of the covenants set forth in this Agreement, and that Executive will reimburse the Company for all costs (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with any action to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement if either the Company prevails on
any material issue involved in such dispute or if Executive challenges the reasonableness or enforceability of any of the provisions of this
Agreement. It is also agreed that the "Company" as used in this Agreement refers to each of the Company's Subsidiaries and
Affiliates and that each of the Company's s Subsidiaries and Affiliates will have the right to enforce all of Executive's obligations to
that Subsidiary or Affiliate under this Agreement, as applicable, subject to any limitation or restriction on such rights of the
Subsidiary or Affiliate under applicable law.
9.REFORMATION. If it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in any state or country that any restriction in this Agreement is
excessive in duration or scope or is unreasonable or unenforceable under applicable law, it is the intention of the parties that such restriction
may be modified or amended by the court to render it enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by the laws of that state or country.
10.REMEDIES. Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Company's remedies at law for a breach or threatened breach of any of the
provisions of Agreement would be inadequate and, in recognition of this fact, Executive agrees that, in the event of such a breach or
threatened breach, in addition to any remedies at law, the Company, without posting any bond or other security, shall be entitled to obtain
equitable relief in the form of specific performance, a temporary restraining order, a temporary or permanent injunction or any other
equitable remedy which may then be available, without the necessity of showing actual monetary damages, in addition to any other
equitable relief (including without limitation an accounting and/or disgorgement) and/or any other damages as a matter of law.
11.REPURCHASE. Executive acknowledges and agrees that a breach of this Agreement would constitute a "Covenant Breach" as such term
is used in the Plan and therefore, in the event of a Covenant Breach, Executive's RSU and the Award Stock issued therefor (as such terms
are defined in the Plan) shall be subject to repurchase by The Kraft Heinz Company in accordance with the terms of the Plan.
12.TOLLING. In the event of any violation of the provisions of this Agreement, Executive acknowledges and agrees that the post-termination
restrictions contained in this Agreement shall be extended by a period of time equal to the period of such violation, it being the intention of
the parties hereto that the running of the applicable post-termination restriction period shall be tolled during any period of such violation.
13.SURVIVAL OF PROVISIONS. The obligations contained in this Agreement hereof shall survive the termination or expiration of the
Executive's Service with the Company and shall be fully enforceable thereafter.
14.VENUE, PERSONAL JURISDICTION, AND COVENANT NOT TO SUE. Executive expressly agrees to submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction and exclusive venue of courts located in the State of Delaware in connection with any litigation which may be brought with
respect to a dispute between the Company and Executive in relation to this Restrictive Covenants Agreement, regardless of where
Executive resides or where Executive performs services for the Company. Executive hereby irrevocably waives Executive's rights, if any, to
have any disputes between the Company and Executive related to this Restrictive Covenants Agreement decided in any jurisdiction or
venue other than a court in the State of Delaware. Executive hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection
which Executive now or hereafter may have to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding, and
Executive agrees not to plead or claim the same. Executive further irrevocably covenants not to sue the Company related to this Restrictive
Covenants Agreement in any jurisdiction or venue other than a court in the State of Delaware. All matters relating to the interpretation,
construction, application, validity, and enforcement of this Agreement, and any disputes or controversies arising hereunder, will be
governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule, whether of the State
of Delaware or any other jurisdiction, that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.
APPENDIX I
ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF
THE KRAFT HEINZ COMPANY
2016 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN
RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT FOR NON-U.S. PARTICIPANTS
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
This Appendix I includes additional terms and conditions that govern the RSUs granted to you under the Plan if you work or reside outside the
U.S. and/or in one of the countries listed below. These terms and conditions are in addition to, or if so indicated, in place of the terms and
conditions set forth in the Award Agreement. Certain capitalized terms used but not defined in this Appendix I have the meanings set forth in
the Plan and/or the Award Agreement.
If you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently working, transfer employment and/or residency to
another country after the RSUs are granted to you, or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the terms and
conditions contained herein may not be applicable to you, and the Company shall, in its discretion, determine to what extent the terms and
conditions contained herein shall apply to you.
NOTIFICATIONS
This Appendix I also includes information regarding exchange controls and certain other issues of which you should be aware with respect to
participation in the Plan. The information is based on the securities, exchange control, and other laws in effect in the respective countries as of
January 2017. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, the Company strongly recommends that you not rely on the
information in this Appendix I as the only source of information relating to the consequences of your participation in the Plan because the
information may be out of date at the time you vest in the RSUs or sell Shares acquired under the Plan.
In addition, the information contained herein is general in nature and may not apply to your particular situation, and the Company is not in a
position to assure you of a particular result. Accordingly, you should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in your
country may apply to your situation.
Finally, if you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently working, transfer employment and/or
residency after the RSUs are granted or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the notifications contained herein
may not be applicable to you in the same manner.
GENERAL NON-U.S. TERMS AND CONDITIONS
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
The following terms and conditions apply to you if you are located outside of the U.S.
Entire Agreement.
The following provisions supplement the entire Award Agreement, generally:
If you are located outside the U.S., in no event will any aspect of the RSUs be determined in accordance with your Employment Agreement (or
other Service contract). The terms and conditions of the RSUs will be solely determined in accordance with the provisions of the Plan and the
Award Agreement, including this Appendix I, which supersede and replace any prior agreement, either written or verbal (including your
Employment Agreement, if applicable) in relation to the RSUs.
Vesting.
If you are resident or employed outside of the United States, the Company may, in its sole discretion, settle the RSUs in the form of a cash
payment to the extent settlement in Shares: (i) is prohibited under local law, (ii) would require you, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to obtain the approval of any governmental or regulatory body in your country of residence (or your country of employment, if
different), (iii) would result in adverse tax consequences for you, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or (iv) is administratively
burdensome. Alternatively, the Company may, in its sole discretion settle the RSUs in the form of Shares but require you to sell such Shares
immediately or within a specified period following your termination of Service (in which case, this Award Agreement shall give the Company
the authority to issue sales instructions on your behalf).
Termination.
The following provisions supplement the Termination section of the Award Agreement, provided, however, that for purposes of the section of
the Award Agreement titled "Settlement of Vested RSUs," if you are subject to U.S. federal income tax and the RSUs constitute Deferred
Compensation, your termination of Service date will be the date of your Separation from Service:
For purposes of the RSU, your employment or Service relationship will be considered terminated as of the date you are no longer actively
providing Services to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (regardless of the reason for such termination and whether or not
later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you provide Service or the terms of your Employment
Agreement, if any), and unless otherwise expressly provided in this Award Agreement or determined by the Company, your right to vest in the
RSU under the Plan, if any, will terminate as of such date and will not be extended by any notice period (e.g., your period of Service would not
include any contractual notice period or any period of "garden leave" or similar period mandated under employment laws in the jurisdiction
where you provide Service or the terms of your Employment Agreement, if any); the Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to
determine when you are no longer actively providing Service for purposes of the RSUs (including whether you may still be considered to be
providing Service while on a leave of absence).
Notwithstanding the provisions governing the treatment of the RSUs upon termination due to Retirement set forth in the Termination section of
the Award Agreement, if the Company receives an opinion of counsel that there has been a legal judgment and/or legal development in a
particular jurisdiction that would likely result in the treatment in case of a termination due to Retirement as set forth in the Award Agreement
being deemed unlawful and/or discriminatory, then the Company will not apply the provisions for termination due to Retirement at the time you
cease to provide Service and the RSUs will be treated as it would under the rules that apply if your Service ends for resignation.
Termination for Cause.
The implications upon a termination for Cause as set forth in the Award Agreement and Plan shall only be enforced, to the extent deemed
permissible under applicable local law, as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee.
Taxes.
The following provisions supplement the Taxes section of the Award Agreement:
You acknowledge that your liability for Tax-Related Items may exceed the amount withheld by the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or its
Affiliates (as applicable).
If you have become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that the Company, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates may be
required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
Depending on the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum
statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates, in which case you may receive a
refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is
satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested RSUs,
notwithstanding that a number of Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of
your participation in the Plan.
Limits on Transferability; Beneficiaries.
The following provision supplements the Limits on Transferability; Beneficiaries section of the Award Agreement:
If you are located outside the U.S., the RSUs may not be Transferred to a designated Beneficiary and may only be Transferred upon your death
to your legal heirs in accordance with applicable laws of descent and distribution. In no case may the RSUs be Transferred to another individual
during your lifetime.
Acknowledgment of Nature of Award.
The following provisions supplement the Acknowledgment of Nature of Award section of the Award Agreement:
You acknowledge the following with respect to the RSUs:
(a)    The RSUs, any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income and value of same, are not intended to replace any pension rights
or compensation.
(b)    In no event should the RSUs, any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income and value of same, be considered as
compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Affiliate.
(c)    The RSU, any Shares acquired under the Plan and the income and value of same are not part of normal or expected compensation
or salary for any purpose.
(d)    Neither the Company, its Subsidiaries nor any Affiliate shall be liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between your local
currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the RSUs or of any amounts due to you pursuant to vesting of the RSUs or
the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired upon vesting.
Not a Public Offering in Non-U.S. Jurisdictions.
If you are resident or employed outside of the United States, neither the grant of the RSUs under the Plan nor the issuance of the underlying
Shares upon vesting of the RSUs is intended to be a public offering of securities in your country of residence (and country of employment, if
different). The Company has not submitted any registration statement, prospectus or other filings to the local securities authorities in
jurisdictions outside of the United States unless otherwise required under local law.
Language Consent.
If you are resident or employed outside of the United States, you acknowledge and agree that it is your express intent that this Award
Agreement, the Plan and all other documents, notices and legal proceedings entered into, given or instituted pursuant to the RSUs, be drawn up
in English.
Insider Trading and Market Abuse Laws.
Depending on your country, you may be subject to insider trading restrictions and/or market abuse laws, which may affect your ability to
acquire or sell Shares or rights to Shares under the Plan during such times as you are considered to have "inside information" regarding the
Company (as defined by the laws in your country). Any restrictions under these laws or regulations are separate from and in addition to any
restrictions that may be imposed under any applicable Company insider trading policy. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to comply
with any applicable restrictions, and you should speak to your personal advisor on this matter.
Foreign Asset/Account, Exchange Control and Tax Reporting.
You may be subject to foreign asset/account, exchange control and/or tax reporting requirements as a result of the acquisition, holding and/or
transfer of Shares or cash (including dividends, dividend equivalents and the proceeds arising from the sale of Shares) derived from your
participation in the Plan, to and/or from a brokerage/bank account or legal entity located outside your country. The applicable laws of your
country may require that you report such accounts, assets, the balances therein, the value thereof and/or the transactions related thereto to the
applicable authorities in such country. You acknowledge that you are responsible for ensuring compliance with any applicable foreign
asset/account, exchange control and tax reporting requirements and should consult your personal legal advisor on this matter.
No Advice Regarding Award.
The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding your
participation in the Plan, or your acquisition or sale of the underlying Shares. You are hereby advised to consult with your own personal tax,
legal and financial advisors regarding your participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan.
Imposition of Other Requirements.
The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on your participation in the Plan, on the RSUs and on any Shares purchased upon
vesting of the RSUs, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons, and to require you to
sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.
Waiver.
You acknowledge that a waiver by the Company or breach of any provision of the Award Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a
waiver of any other provision of the Award Agreement, or of any subsequent breach of the Award Agreement.

3.Payment.
(a) Form and Time of Payment.
(i) Vesting. The Performance Share Award will vest on the “Vesting Date” set forth in the Notice subject to your continued Service
with the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, except as otherwise set forth in the Omnibus Plan or this Award Agreement. Prior to
the vesting and settlement of the Performance Share Award, you will not have any rights of a shareholder with respect to the
Performance Share Award or the Shares subject thereto. No Shares will be delivered pursuant to the vesting of the Performance
Share Award unless (i) you have complied with your obligations under this Award Agreement and the Omnibus Plan and (ii) the
vesting of the Performance Share Award and the delivery of such Shares complies with applicable law. Until such time as the
Shares are delivered to you (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer
agent of the Company), you will have no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder with respect to such
Shares, notwithstanding the vesting of the Performance Share Award.
(ii) Performance Share Award Payment. Subject to the terms of the Omnibus Plan and this Agreement, any Performance Share Award
that becomes payable shall be made in whole Shares, which shall be issued in book-entry form, registered in the Participant’s name.
In the event the Performance Share Award Share Payout is to be made in Shares results in less than a whole number of Shares, the
Performance Share Award Share Payout shall be rounded up or down to the next whole Share (no fractional Shares shall be issued
in payment of a Performance Share Award). Any Shares issued in respect of a Performance Share Award Share Payout shall be
issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Omnibus Plan and shall reduce the number of Shares available for issuance
thereunder.
(iii) Dividends. Any cash dividend the Board declares with respect to the Shares during the Performance Period shall be treated in
accordance with the Notice.
(iv) Payment Timing. Except as otherwise provided in Section 21 hereof or in the Notice, as applicable, (A) the Performance Share
Award payment shall be made as soon as practicable following the Vesting Date, but in any event no later than March 15 of the
taxable year following such date and (B) a Performance Share Award that becomes payable due to a termination Without Cause, or
termination due to your Retirement, death or Disability, shall be paid no later than 60 days after the Vesting Date.
(v) Payout Upon Termination. The Notice shall set forth the effect of termination upon the Performance Share Award. If you are
terminated Without Cause or due to your resignation and, within the twelve (12) month period subsequent to such termination of
your Service, the Company determines that your Service could have been terminated for Cause, subject to anything to the contrary
that may be contained in the Notice at the time of termination of your Service, your Service will, at the election of the Company, be
deemed to have been terminated for Cause for purposes of this Award Agreement and the Omnibus Plan, effective as of the date the
events giving rise to Cause occurred and any consequences following from a termination for Cause shall be retroactively applied
(including your obligation to repay gains that would not have been realized had your Service been terminated for Cause).
(b) Conditions to Payment of Performance Share Award. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:
(i) The Performance Share Award shall not become payable to the Participant or his or her legal representative unless and until the
Participant or his or her legal representative shall have satisfied all applicable withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items (as
defined in Section 5 below), if any, in accordance with Section 5 hereof.
(ii) The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any Shares in payment of the Performance Share Award prior to the
fulfillment of all of the following conditions: (A) the admission of the Shares to listing on all stock exchanges on which the Shares
are then listed, (B) the completion of any registration or other qualification of the Shares under any state or federal law or under
rulings or regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) or other governmental regulatory body,
which the Committee shall, in its sole and absolute discretion, deem necessary and advisable, or if the offering of the Shares is not
so registered, a determination by the Company that the issuance of the Shares would be exempt from any such registration or
qualification requirements, (C) the obtaining of any approval or other clearance from any state, federal or foreign governmental
agency that the Committee shall, in its absolute discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable and (D) the lapse of any such
reasonable period of time following the date the Performance Share Award becomes payable as the Committee may from time to
time establish for reasons of administrative convenience, subject to compliance with Section 409A of the Code.
(c) Committee Discretion. Anything to the contrary in this Section 3 notwithstanding, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide for full
or partial payment of the Performance Share Award upon termination of a Participant’s active employment for any reason prior to the
completion of a Performance Period to which a Performance Share Award relates; provided that the Committee shall not exercise such
discretion if doing so would cause other Performance Share Awards that are intended to qualify as Qualified Performance-Based
Compensation not to qualify.
4.Withholding Taxes. Regardless of any action the Company or the Participant’s employer (the “Employer”) takes with respect to any or all income
tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to the Participant’s participation in the Omnibus Plan and
legally applicable to the Participant (“Tax-Related Items”), the Participant acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally
due by the Participant is and remains his or her responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer.
Furthermore, the Participant acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (a) make no representations or undertakings regarding the
treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Performance Share Award, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting,
or payment of this Performance Share Award or the subsequent sale of Shares issued in payment of the Performance Share Award; and (b) do not
commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant of the Performance Share Award or any aspect of the Participant’s
participation in the Omnibus Plan to reduce or eliminate his or her liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. If the
Participant becomes subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction between the date of grant and the date of any relevant taxable or tax
withholding event, as applicable, the Participant acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be
required to withhold or account for (including report) Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
The Company is authorized to satisfy the withholding for any or all Tax-Related Items arising from the granting, vesting, or payment of the
Performance Share Award or sale of Shares issued pursuant to the Performance Share Award, as the case may be, by deducting the number of Shares
having an aggregate value equal to the amount of Tax-Related Items withholding due from a Performance Share Award Share Payout or otherwise
becoming subject to current taxation. If the Company satisfies the Tax-Related Items obligation by withholding a number of Shares as described
herein, for tax purposes, the Participant shall be deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares due to the Participant at vesting,
notwithstanding that a number of Shares is held back solely for the purpose of such Tax-Related Items withholding.
The Company is also authorized to satisfy the actual Tax-Related Items withholding arising from the granting, vesting or payment of this
Performance Share Award, the sale of Shares issued pursuant to the Performance Share Award or hypothetical withholding tax amounts if the
Participant is covered under a Company tax equalization policy, as the case may be, by the remittance of the required amounts from any proceeds
realized upon the open-market sale of the Shares received in payment of the vested Performance Share Award by the Participant. Such open-market
sale is on the Participant’s behalf and at the Participant’s direction pursuant to this authorization.
Furthermore, the Company and/or the Employer are authorized to satisfy the Tax-Related Items withholding arising from the granting, vesting, or
payment of this Performance Share Award, or sale of Shares issued pursuant to the Performance Share Award, as the case may be, by withholding
from the Participant’s wages, or other cash compensation paid to the Participant by the Company and/or the Employer.
If the Participant is subject to the short-swing profit rules of Section 16(b) of the Act, the Participant may elect the form of withholding in advance of
any Tax-Related Items withholding event, and in the absence of the Participant’s election, the Company shall deduct the number of Shares having an
aggregate value equal to the amount of Tax-Related Items withholding due from the Performance Share Award Share Payout, or the Committee may
determine that a particular method be used to satisfy any Tax Related Items withholding.
Shares deducted from the payment of this Performance Share Award in satisfaction of Tax-Related Items withholding shall be valued at the Fair
Market Value of the Shares received in payment of the vested Performance Share Award on the date as of which the amount giving rise to the
withholding requirement first became includible in the gross income of the Participant under applicable tax laws. The Company may refuse to issue
or deliver the Shares if the Participant fails to comply with his or her Tax-Related Items obligations. To avoid negative accounting treatment, the
Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable
withholding rates.
The Participant shall pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to
withhold that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. If the Participant is covered by a Company tax equalization policy, the
Participant also agrees to pay to the Company any additional hypothetical tax obligation calculated and paid under the terms and conditions of such
tax equalization policy.
5.Nature of Grant. By participating in the Omnibus Plan and in exchange for receiving the Performance Share Award, the Participant acknowledges,
understands and agrees that:
(a) the Omnibus Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and it may be modified, amended, suspended or
terminated by the Company at any time, unless otherwise provided in the Omnibus Plan;
(b) the grant of the Performance Share Award is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future
grants of Performance Share Awards, or benefits in lieu of Performance Share Awards, even if Performance Share Awards have been
granted repeatedly in the past;
(c) all decisions with respect to future Performance Share Award grants, if any, shall be at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors of the
Company or the Committee;
(d) the Participant is voluntarily participating in the Omnibus Plan;
(e) the Performance Share Award and any Shares subject to the Performance Share Award are not part of or included in any calculation of
severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, dismissal, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension, retirement or
welfare benefits or similar payments and in no event should be considered as compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for
the Company, the Employer, or any Affiliate;
(f) the Performance Share Award grant shall not be interpreted to form an employment or service contract or relationship with the Company or
any Affiliate;
(g) the future value of the underlying Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty;
(h) the Performance Share Award and the benefits evidenced by this Agreement do not create any entitlement, not otherwise specifically
determined by the Company in its discretion, to have the Performance Share Award or any such benefits transferred to, or assumed by,
another company, or to be exchanged, cashed out or substituted for, in connection with any corporate transaction affecting the Shares; and
For Participants who reside outside the U.S., the following additional provisions shall apply:
(i) the Performance Share Award and the Shares subject to the Performance Share Award are not intended to replace any pension rights or
compensation;
(j) the Performance Share Award and the Shares subject to the Performance Share Award are extraordinary items that do not constitute
compensation of any kind for services of any kind rendered to the Company or the Employer, and are outside the scope of the Participant’s
employment or service contract, if any;
(k) the Performance Share Award and the Shares subject to the Performance Share Award are not part of normal compensation or salary from
the Employer and in no event should be considered as compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the Company, the
Employer or any Affiliate of the Company;
(l) no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Performance Share Award resulting from failure to
reach Performance Goals or termination of the Participant’s employment by the Company or the Employer (for any reason whatsoever and
whether or not in breach of any employment laws in the country where the Participant resides or later found to be invalid), and in
consideration of the grant of the Performance Share Award to which the Participant is otherwise not entitled, the Participant irrevocably
agrees never to institute any claim against the Company or the Employer, waives his or her ability, if any, to bring any such claim, and
releases the Company and the Employer from any such claim; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of
competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Omnibus Plan, the Participant shall be deemed irrevocably to have agreed not to pursue
such claim and agree to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claims; and
(m) neither the Company, the Employer nor any Affiliate shall be liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between the Participant’s local
currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the Performance Share Award, any Shares paid to the Participant or any
proceeds resulting from the Participant’s sale of such Shares.
6.Data Privacy. By participating in the Omnibus Plan and in exchange for receiving the Performance Share Award, the Participant hereby
explicitly and unambiguously consents to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of the Participant’s personal data as
described in this Agreement and any other Performance Share Award grant materials by and among, as applicable, the Employer, the Company
and its Affiliates for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Participant’s receipt of the Performance Share
Award.
The Participant understands that the Company and the Employer may hold certain personal information about the Participant, including, but
not limited to, the Participant’s name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other identification
number, salary, nationality, job title, any Shares of stock or directorships held in the Company, details of all Performance Share Awards or any
other entitlement to Shares of stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in the Participant’s favor, for the exclusive
purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Performance Share Award (“Data”).
The Participant understands that Data will be transferred to UBS Financial Services (“UBS”), or such other stock plan service provider as may
be selected by the Company in the future, which is assisting the Company with the implementation, administration and management of the
Performance Share Award. The Participant understands that the recipients of the Data may be located in the United States or elsewhere, and
that the recipients’ country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than the Participant’s country. If the
Participant resides outside the United States, the Participant understands that he or she may request a list with the names and addresses of any
potential recipients of the Data by contacting his or her local human resources representative. The Participant authorizes the Company, UBS
and any other possible recipients which may assist the Company (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering and managing the
Performance Share Award to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purpose of
implementing, administering and managing his or her participation in the Performance Share Award. The Participant understands that Data
will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage the Participant’s receipt of the Performance Share Award. If the
Participant resides outside the United States, the Participant understands that he or she may, at any time, view Data, request additional
information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in
any case without cost, by contacting in writing his or her local human resources representative. The Participant understands, however, that
refusing or withdrawing his or her consent may affect the Participant’s ability to receive the Performance Share Award. For more information
on the consequences of the Participant’s refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, the Participant understands that he or she may contact his
or her local human resources representative.
7.Nontransferability of Performance Share Award. The Performance Share Award or the interests or rights therein may not be transferred in any
manner other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and may not be assigned, hypothecated or otherwise pledged and shall not be
subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Upon any attempt to effect any such disposition, or upon the levy of any such process, in
violation of the provisions herein, the Performance Share Award shall immediately become null and void and any rights to receive a payment under
the Performance Share Award shall be forfeited.
8.Rights as Shareholder. Neither the Participant nor any person claiming under or through the Participant shall have any of the rights or privileges of a
shareholder of the Company in respect of any Shares issuable hereunder unless and until certificates representing such Shares (which may be in
uncertificated form) will have been issued and recorded on the books and records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to
the Participant (including through electronic delivery to a brokerage account). After such issuance, recordation and delivery, the Participant shall
have all the rights of a shareholder of the Company, including with respect to the right to vote the Shares and the right to receive any cash or Share
dividends or other distributions paid to or made with respect to the Shares.
9.Repayment/Forfeiture. The Award shall be canceled and forfeited, if, without the consent of the Company, while employed by or providing services
to the Company or any Subsidiary or after termination of such employment or service, Participant (i) violates a non-competition, non-solicitation or
non-disclosure covenant or agreement, (ii) otherwise engages in activity that is in conflict with or adverse to the interest of the Company or any
Subsidiary, including fraud or conduct contributing to any financial restatements or irregularities, as determined by the Committee in its sole
discretion. In addition, any payments or benefits the Participant may receive hereunder shall be subject to repayment or forfeiture as may be required
to comply with the requirements under the Securities Act, the Act, rules promulgated by the Commission or any other applicable law, including the
requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or any securities exchange on which the Shares are listed or
traded, as may be in effect from time to time as well as any policy relating to the repayment or forfeiture of compensation that the Company may
adopt from time-to-time. Further, if you receive any amount in excess of what you should have received under the terms of the Performance Share
Award for any reason (including without limitation by reason of a financial restatement, mistake in calculations or administrative error), all as
determined by the Committee, then you shall be required to promptly repay any such excess amount to the Company. Nothing in or about this
Agreement prohibits Participant from: (i) filing and, as provided for under Section 21F of the Act, maintaining the confidentiality of a claim with the
Commission, (ii) providing the Commission with information that would otherwise violate the non-disclosure restrictions in this Agreement, to the
extent permitted by Section 21F of the Act; (iii) cooperating, participating or assisting in a Commission investigation or proceeding without
notifying the Company; or (iv) receiving a monetary award as set forth in Section 21F of the Act. Furthermore, Participant is advised that Participant
shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of any Confidential Information (as defined
in Exhibit B) that constitutes a trade secret to which the Defend Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. Section 1833(b)) applies that is made (i) in confidence
to a federal, state or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, in each case, solely for the purpose of reporting or
investigating a suspected violation of law; or (ii) in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or proceeding, if such filings are made under
seal.
10.Restrictions on Resale. The Participant hereby agrees not to sell any Shares issued in payment of the Performance Share Award at a time when
applicable laws or Company policies prohibit a sale. This restriction shall apply as long as the Participant’s employment continues and for such
period of time after the termination of the Participant’s employment as the Company may specify.
11.Language. If you have received this Award Agreement or any other document related to the Omnibus Plan translated into a language other than
English and if the meaning of the translated version is different than the English version, the English version will control.
12.Effect of a Change in Control. The treatment of a Performance Share Award upon a Change in Control shall be governed by the Omnibus Plan,
provided, however, that to the extent that the Performance Share Award constitute Deferred Compensation, settlement of any portion of the
Performance Share Award that may vest in connection with a Change in Control will occur within sixty (60) days following the Vesting Date. In the
event that there is a conflict between the terms of this Award Agreement regarding the effect of a Change in Control on the Performance Share
Award and the terms of any Employment Agreement, the terms of this Award Agreement will govern.
13.Securities Laws and Clawback. By accepting a Performance Share Award, you acknowledge that U.S. federal, state or foreign securities laws and/or
the Company’s policies regarding trading in its securities may limit or restrict your right to buy or sell Shares, including, without limitation, sales of
Shares acquired in connection with the Performance Share Award. You agree to comply with such securities law requirements and Company
policies, as such laws and policies are amended from time to time. You also acknowledge that the Performance Share Award may be forfeited if you
engage in activity that is in conflict with or adverse to the interest of the Company or any Subsidiary, including fraud or conduct contributing to any
financial restatements or irregularities, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion or to the extent that you otherwise violate any policy
adopted by the Company relating to the recovery of compensation granted, paid, delivered, awarded or otherwise provided to you by the Company as
such policy is in effect on the date of grant of the applicable Award or, to the extent necessary to address the requirements of applicable law
(including Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as codified in Section 10D of the Act, Section
304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or any other applicable law), as may be amended from time to time.

VESTING OF THE PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARD PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT IS EARNED ONLY IF
THE PERFORMANCE GOALS ARE ATTAINED AND THE OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH HEREIN ARE SATISFIED
AND BY THE PARTICIPANT CONTINUING TO BE EMPLOYED (SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 3(b) HEREOF) AT THE
WILL OF THE COMPANY OR AN AFFILIATE (AND NOT THROUGH THE ACT OF BEING EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY OR AN
AFFILIATE, BEING GRANTED A PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARD, OR RECEIVING SHARES HEREUNDER). THE PARTICIPANT
FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER AND
THE RIGHT TO EARN A PAYMENT UNDER THE PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARD SET FORTH HEREIN DO NOT CONSTITUTE AN
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED PROMISE OF CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT DURING THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, FOR ANY PERIOD, OR AT
ALL, AND SHALL NOT INTERFERE WITH THE PARTICIPANT’S RIGHT OR THE RIGHT OF THE COMPANY OR AN AFFILIATE TO
TERMINATE THE PARTICIPANT’S EMPLOYMENT AT ANY TIME, WITH OR WITHOUT CAUSE, AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH
APPLICABLE EMPLOYMENT LAWS OF THE COUNTRY WHERE THE PARTICIPANT RESIDES.
16.Entire Agreement: Governing Law. The Notice, the Omnibus Plan and this Agreement, including any appendices, constitute the entire agreement of
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede in their entirety all prior undertakings and agreements of the Company and the
Participant with respect to the subject matter hereof, and may not be modified adversely to the Participant’s interest except as provided in the Notice,
the Omnibus Plan or this Agreement or by means of a writing signed by the Company and the Participant. Nothing in the Notice, the Omnibus Plan
and this Agreement (except as expressly provided therein) is intended to confer any rights or remedies on any persons other than the parties. The
Notice, the Omnibus Plan and this Agreement are to be construed in accordance with and governed by the substantive laws of Delaware, U.S.A.,
without giving effect to any choice of law rule that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the substantive laws of
Delaware to the rights and duties of the parties. Unless otherwise provided in the Notice, the Omnibus Plan or this Agreement, the Participant is
deemed to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of Delaware, U.S.A., and agrees that such litigation shall be conducted in the courts of Wilmington
County, Delaware, or the federal courts for the United States for the Eastern District of Delaware, where this grant is made and/or to be performed.
17.Conformity to Securities Laws. The Participant acknowledges that the Notice, the Omnibus Plan and this Agreement are intended to conform to the
extent necessary with all provisions of the Securities Act and the Act, and any and all regulations and rules promulgated thereunder by the
Commission, including, without limitation, Rule 16b-3. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Notice, the Omnibus Plan and this
Agreement shall be administered, and the Performance Share Award is granted, only in such a manner as to conform to such laws, rules and
regulations. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Notice, the Omnibus Plan and this Agreement shall be deemed amended to the extent
necessary to conform to such laws, rules and regulations.

binding upon the Participant and his or her heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assign.
22.Severability. Whenever feasible, each provision of the Notice, this Agreement, and the Omnibus Plan shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision in the Notice, Omnibus Plan or this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid
under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of the
Notice, the Omnibus Plan or this Agreement.
23.Code Section 409A. This Performance Share Award is intended to be exempt from or to comply with Section 409A of the Code and shall be
interpreted, operated and administered in a manner consistent with such intent. To the extent this Agreement provides for the Performance Share
Award to become vested and be settled upon the Participant’s termination of employment, the applicable Shares shall be transferred to the Participant
or his or her beneficiary upon the Participant’s “separation from service,” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code; provided that if the
Participant is a “specified employee,” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, then to the extent the Performance Share Award constitutes
nonqualified deferred compensation, within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, such Shares shall be transferred to the Participant or his or her
beneficiary upon the earlier to occur of (i) the six-month anniversary of such separation from service and (ii) the date of the Participant’s death.
This Agreement may be amended at any time, without the consent of any party, to avoid the application of Section 409A of the Code in a particular
circumstance or that is necessary or desirable to satisfy any of the requirements under Section 409A of the Code, but the Company shall not be under
any obligation to make any such amendment. Nothing in the Agreement shall provide a basis for any person to take action against the Company or
any Affiliate based on matters covered by Section 409A of the Code, including the tax treatment of any amount paid under the Performance Share
Award granted hereunder, and neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates shall under any circumstances have any liability to the Participant or his
estate or any other party for any taxes, penalties or interest due on amounts paid or payable under this Agreement, including taxes, penalties or
interest imposed under Section 409A of the Code.
24.No Advice Regarding Performance Share Award. The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any
recommendations regarding the Participant’s acquisition or sale of any Shares issued in payment of the Performance Share Award. The Participant is
hereby advised to consult with his or her own personal tax, legal and financial advisors before taking any action related to the Performance Share
Award.
25.Language. If the Participant has received this Agreement or any other document related to the Omnibus Plan translated into a language other than

the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or advisable in order to comply with laws in the country where the Participant resides
regarding the issuance of Shares, or to facilitate the administration of the Performance Share Award. Appendix I constitutes part of this Agreement.
27.Electronic Delivery and Acceptance. The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to current or future
Performance Share Awards by electronic means or to request the Participant’s consent to participate in the Omnibus Plan by electronic means. The
Participant hereby consents to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agrees to participate in the Omnibus Plan through an on-line or
electronic system established and maintained by the Company or a third party designated by the Company.
28.Imposition of Other Requirements. The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on the Participant’s participation in the Omnibus

to facilitate the administration of the Performance Share Award, and to require the Participant to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that
may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.

relationships. I understand that the products and services that the Company develops, provides and markets are unique. Further, I know that my promises in
this Restrictive Covenants Agreement (the "Agreement") are an important way for the Company to protect its proprietary interests and that The Kraft Heinz
Company would not have granted me Performance Share Units (“PSUs”) or other equity grants unless I made such promises.
In addition to other good and valuable consideration, I am expressly being given PSUs or other equity grants in exchange for my agreeing to the
terms of this Agreement. In consideration of the foregoing, I (the "Executive") agree as follows:
1.NON-DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. During the course of Executive's Service, Executive will have access to Confidential
Information. For purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" means all data, information, ideas, concepts, discoveries, trade secrets,
inventions (whether or not patentable or reduced to practice), innovations, improvements, know-how, developments, techniques, methods, processes,
treatments, drawings, sketches, specifications, designs, plans, patterns, models, plans and strategies, and all other confidential or proprietary information
or trade secrets in any form or medium (whether merely remembered or embodied in a tangible or intangible form or medium) whether now or hereafter
existing, relating to or arising from the past, current or potential business, activities and/or operations of the Company, including, without limitation, any
such information relating to or concerning finances, sales, marketing, advertising, transition, promotions, pricing, personnel, customers, suppliers,
vendors, raw partners and/or competitors of the Company. Executive agrees that Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, use, make available, sell,
disclose or otherwise communicate to any person, other than in the course of Executive's assigned duties and for the benefit of the Company, either
during the period of Executive's Service or at any time thereafter, any Confidential Information or other confidential or proprietary information received
from third parties subject to a duty on the Company's part to maintain the confidentiality of such information, and to use such information only for certain
limited purposes, in each case, which shall have been obtained by Executive during Executive's Service. The foregoing shall not apply to information that
(i) was known to the public prior to its disclosure to Executive; (ii) becomes generally known to the public subsequent to disclosure to Executive through
no wrongful act of Executive or any representative of Executive; or (iii) Executive is required to disclose by applicable law, regulation or legal process
(provided that, to the extent permitted by law, Executive provides the Company with prior notice of the contemplated disclosure and cooperates with the
Company at its expense in seeking a protective order or other appropriate protection of such information).
Pursuant to the U.S. Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, Executive shall not be held criminally, or civilly, liable under any Federal or State Trade secret
law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made in confidence either directly or indirectly to a Federal, State, or local government official, or an
attorney, for the sole purpose of reporting, or investigating, a violation of law. Moreover, Executive may disclose trade secrets in a complaint, or other
document, filed in a lawsuit, or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. Finally, if Executive files a lawsuit alleging retaliation by the
Company for reporting a suspected violation of the law, Executive may disclose the trade secret to Executive's attorney and use the trade secret in the
court proceeding, if Executive files any document containing the trade secret under seal and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court
order.
No Company policies or practices, including this Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information provision, is intended to or shall limit, prevent, impede or
interfere in any way with Executive's right, without prior notice to the Company, to provide information to the government, participate in investigations,
testify in proceedings regarding the Company's past or future conduct, or engage in any activities protected under whistle blower statutes.
2.NON-COMPETITION. Executive acknowledges that (i) Executive performs services of a unique nature for the Company that are irreplaceable, and
that Executive's performance of such services to a competing business will result in irreparable harm to the Company, (ii) Executive has had and will
continue to have access to Confidential Information which, if disclosed, would unfairly and inappropriately assist in competition against the Company,
(iii) in the course of Executive's employment by or service to a competitor, Executive would inevitably use or disclose such Confidential Information,
(iv) the Company has substantial relationships with its customers and Executive has had and will continue to have access to these customers, (v)
Executive has received and will receive specialized training from the Company, and (vi) Executive has generated and will continue to generate goodwill
for the Company in the course of Executive's Service. Accordingly, during Executive's Service and for eighteen (18) months following a termination of
Executive's Service for any reason (the "Restricted Period"), Executive will not engage in any business activities, directly or indirectly (whether as an
employee, consultant, officer, director, partner, joint venturer, manager, member, principal, agent, or independent contractor, individually, in concert with
others, or in any other manner) within the same line or lines of business for which the Executive performed services for the Company and in a capacity
that is similar to the capacity in which the Executive was employed by the Company with any person or entity that competes with the Company in the
consumer packaged food and beverage industry ("Competitive Business") anywhere within the same geographic territory(ies) for which the Executive
performed services for the Company (the "Restricted Territory"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prohibit Executive from being a
passive owner of not more than three percent (3%) of the equity securities of a publicly traded corporation engaged in a business that is in competition
with the Company, so long as Executive has no active participation in the business of such corporation.
3.NON-SOLICITATION. During the Restricted Period, Executive agrees that Executive shall not, except in the furtherance of Executive's duties to the
Company, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation or other entity, solicit, aid, induce, assist in the
solicitation of, or accept any business (other than on behalf of the Company) from, any customer or potential customer of the Company to purchase goods
or services then sold by the Company from another person, firm, corporation or other entity or, directly or indirectly, in any way request, suggest or
advise any such customer to withdraw or cancel any of their business or refuse to continue to do business with the Company. This restriction shall apply
to customers or potential customers who, during the two (2) years immediately preceding the Executive's termination, had been assigned to the Executive
by the Company, or with which the Executive had contact on behalf of the Company while an Executive of the Company, or about which the Executive
had access to confidential information by virtue of Executive's employment with the Company.
4.NON-INTERFERENCE. During the Restricted Period, Executive agrees that Executive shall not, except in the furtherance of Executive's duties to the
Company, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation or other entity, (A) solicit, aid or induce any employee,
representative or agent of the Company to leave such employment or retention or to accept employment with or render services to or with any other
person, firm, corporation or other entity unaffiliated with the Company or hire or retain any such employee, representative or agent, or take any action to
materially assist or aid any other person, firm, corporation or other entity in identifying, hiring or soliciting any such employee, representative or agent,
or (B) interfere, or aid or induce any other person or entity in interfering, with the relationship between the Company and its vendors, suppliers or
customers. As used herein, the term "solicit, aid or induce" includes, but is not limited to, (i) initiating communications with a Company employee
relating to possible employment, (ii) offering bonuses or other compensation to encourage a Company employee to terminate his or her employment with
the Company and accept employment with any entity, (iii) recommending a Company employee to any entity, and (iv) aiding an entity in recruitment of a
Company employee. An employee, representative or agent shall be deemed covered by this Section 4 while so employed or retained and for a period of
six (6) months thereafter.
5.NON-DISPARAGEMENT. Executive agrees not to make negative comments or otherwise disparage the Company or its officers, directors, employees,
shareholders, agents or products or services. The foregoing shall not be violated by truthful statements made in (a) response to legal process, required
governmental testimony or filings, or administrative or arbitral proceedings (including, without limitation, depositions in connection with such
proceedings) or (b) the good faith performance of Executive's duties to the Company.
6.INVENTIONS.
a.Executive acknowledges and agrees that all ideas, methods, inventions, discoveries, improvements, work products, developments, software,
know-how, processes, techniques, methods, works of authorship and other work product ("Inventions"), whether patentable or unpatentable, (A)
that are reduced to practice, created, invented, designed, developed, contributed to, or improved with the use of any Company resources and/or
within the scope of Executive's work with the Company or that relate to the business, operations or actual or demonstrably anticipated research
or development of the Company, and that are made or conceived by Executive, solely or jointly with others, during Executive's Service, or (B)
suggested by any work that Executive performs in connection with the Company, either while performing Executive's duties with the Company
or on Executive's own time, but only insofar as the Inventions are related to Executive's work as an employee or other service provider to the
Company, shall belong exclusively to the Company (or its designee), whether or not patent or other applications for intellectual property
protection are filed thereon. Executive will keep full and complete written records (the "Records"), in the manner prescribed by the Company,
of all Inventions, and will promptly disclose all Inventions completely and in writing to the Company. The Records shall be the sole and
exclusive property of the Company, and Executive will surrender them upon the termination of Service, or upon the Company's request.
Executive irrevocably conveys, transfers and assigns to the Company the Inventions and all patents or other intellectual property rights that may
issue thereon in any and all countries, whether during or subsequent to Executive's Service, together with the right to file, in Executive's name or
in the name of the Company (or its designee), applications for patents and equivalent rights (the "Applications").
Executive will, at any time during and subsequent to Executive's Service, make such applications, sign such papers, take all rightful oaths, and
perform all other acts as may be requested from time to time by the Company to perfect, record, enforce, protect, patent or register the
Company's rights in the Inventions, all without additional compensation to Executive from the Company. Executive will also execute
assignments to the Company (or its designee) of the Applications, and give the Company and its attorneys all reasonable assistance (including
the giving of testimony) to obtain the Inventions for the Company's benefit, all without additional compensation to Executive from the
Company, but entirely at the Company's expense.
b.In addition, the Inventions will be deemed Work for Hire, as such term is defined under the copyright laws of the United States, on behalf of the
Company and Executive agrees that the Company will be the sole owner of the Inventions, and all underlying rights therein, in all media now
known or hereinafter devised, throughout the universe and in perpetuity without any further obligations to Executive. If the Inventions, or any
portion thereof, are deemed not to be Work for Hire, or the rights in such Inventions do not otherwise automatically vest in the Company,
Executive hereby irrevocably conveys, transfers and assigns to the Company, all rights, in all media now known or hereinafter devised,
throughout the universe and in perpetuity, in and to the Inventions, including, without limitation, all of Executive's right, title and interest in the
copyrights (and all renewals, revivals and extensions thereof) to the Inventions, including, without limitation, all rights of any kind or any nature
now or hereafter recognized, including, without limitation, the unrestricted right to make modifications, adaptations and revisions to the
Inventions, to exploit and allow others to exploit the Inventions and all rights to sue at law or in equity for any infringement, or other
unauthorized use or conduct in derogation of the Inventions, known or unknown, prior to the date hereof, including, without limitation, the right
to receive all proceeds and damages therefrom. In addition, Executive hereby waives any so-called "moral rights" with respect to the Inventions.
To the extent that Executive has any rights in the results and proceeds of Executive's service to the Company that cannot be assigned in the
manner described herein, Executive agrees to unconditionally waive the enforcement of such rights. Executive hereby waives any and all
currently existing and future monetary rights in and to the Inventions and all patents and other registrations for intellectual property that may
issue thereon, including, without limitation, any rights that would otherwise accrue to Executive's benefit by virtue of Executive being an
employee of or other service provider to the Company.
7.RETURN OF COMPANY PROPERTY. On the date of Executive's termination of Service with the Company for any reason (or at any time prior
thereto at the Company's request), Executive shall return all property belonging to the Company (including, but not limited to, any Company-provided
laptops, computers, cell phones, wireless electronic mail devices or other equipment, or documents and property belonging to the Company).
8.REASONABLENESS OF COVENANTS. In signing this Agreement, including by electronic means, Executive gives the Company assurance that
Executive has carefully read and considered all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the restraints imposed by it. Executive agrees
that these restraints are necessary for the reasonable and proper protection of the Company and its Confidential Information and that each and every one
of the restraints is reasonable in respect to subject matter, length of time and geographic area, and that these restraints, individually or in the aggregate,
will not prevent Executive from obtaining other suitable employment during the period in which Executive is bound by the restraints. Executive
acknowledges that each of these covenants has a unique, very substantial and immeasurable value to the Company and that Executive has sufficient
assets and skills to provide a livelihood while such covenants remain in force. Executive further covenants that Executive will not challenge the
reasonableness or enforceability of any of the covenants set forth in this Agreement, and that Executive will reimburse the Company for all costs
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with any action to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement if either the Company
prevails on any material issue involved in such dispute or if Executive challenges the reasonableness or enforceability of any of the provisions of this
Agreement. It is also agreed that the "Company" as used in this Agreement refers to each of the Company's Subsidiaries and Affiliates and that
each of the Company's s Subsidiaries and Affiliates will have the right to enforce all of Executive's obligations to that Subsidiary or Affiliate
under this Agreement, as applicable, subject to any limitation or restriction on such rights of the Subsidiary or Affiliate under applicable law.
9.REFORMATION. If it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in any state or country that any restriction in this Agreement is excessive in
duration or scope or is unreasonable or unenforceable under applicable law, it is the intention of the parties that such restriction may be modified or
amended by the court to render it enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by the laws of that state or country.
10.REMEDIES. Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Company's remedies at law for a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of
Agreement would be inadequate and, in recognition of this fact, Executive agrees that, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, in addition to
any remedies at law, the Company, without posting any bond or other security, shall be entitled to obtain equitable relief in the form of specific
performance, a temporary restraining order, a temporary or permanent injunction or any other equitable remedy which may then be available, without the
necessity of showing actual monetary damages, in addition to any other equitable relief (including without limitation an accounting and/or disgorgement)
and/or any other damages as a matter of law.
11.REPURCHASE. Executive acknowledges and agrees that a breach of this Agreement would constitute a "Covenant Breach" as such term is used in the
Omnibus Plan and therefore, in the event of a Covenant Breach, Executive's PSUs and the Shares issued in payment thereof (as such terms are defined in
the Omnibus Plan) shall be subject to repurchase by The Kraft Heinz Company in accordance with the terms of the Omnibus Plan.
12.TOLLING. In the event of any violation of the provisions of this Agreement, Executive acknowledges and agrees that the post-termination restrictions
contained in this Agreement shall be extended by a period of time equal to the period of such violation, it being the intention of the parties hereto that the
running of the applicable post-termination restriction period shall be tolled during any period of such violation.
13.SURVIVAL OF PROVISIONS. The obligations contained in this Agreement hereof shall survive the termination or expiration of the Executive's
Service with the Company and shall be fully enforceable thereafter.
14.VENUE, PERSONAL JURISDICTION, AND COVENANT NOT TO SUE. Executive expressly agrees to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and
exclusive venue of courts located in the State of Delaware in connection with any litigation which may be brought with respect to a dispute between the
Company and Executive in relation to this Restrictive Covenants Agreement, regardless of where Executive resides or where Executive performs services
for the Company. Executive hereby irrevocably waives Executive's rights, if any, to have any disputes between the Company and Executive related to this
Restrictive Covenants Agreement decided in any jurisdiction or venue other than a court in the State of Delaware. Executive hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, any objection which Executive now or hereafter may have to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of any
such suit, action or proceeding, and Executive agrees not to plead or claim the same. Executive further irrevocably covenants not to sue the Company
related to this Restrictive Covenants Agreement in any jurisdiction or venue other than a court in the State of Delaware. All matters relating to the
interpretation, construction, application, validity, and enforcement of this Agreement, and any disputes or controversies arising hereunder, will be
governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule, whether of the State of Delaware or
any other jurisdiction, that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.
