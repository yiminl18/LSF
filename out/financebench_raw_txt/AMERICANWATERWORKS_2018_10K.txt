ITEM 1.
BUSINESS Our Company
With
 a history dating back to 1886 ,  American Water is the largest and most geographically diverse, publicly-traded water and wastewater utility companyin
 the United States, as measured by both operating revenues and population served. A holding company originally incorporated in Delaware in 1936 , we employ approximately 
7,100 professionals  who provide drinking water, wastewater and other related services to more than 14  million people  in 46 states and Ontario,Canada.
 We conduct the majority of our business through regulated utilities that provide water and wastewater services, collectively presented as our “ Regulated Businesses 
.”  We  also  operate  market-based  businesses  that  provide  a  broad  range  of  related  and  complementary  water,  wastewater  and  other  services.Individually,
 these businesses do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States(“GAAP”), and are collective
ly presented as our Market-Based Businesses , which is consistent with how managem ent assesses the results of these businesses.Throughout this Form
 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” and “American Water” mean AmericanWater Works Company, Inc. and i
ts subsidiaries, taken together as a whole. References to “parent company” mean American Water Works Company, Inc., withoutits subsidiaries.
Regulated Businesses
Our
 primary business involves the ownership of utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential, commercial, industrial, public authority,fire
 service  and  sale  for  resale  customers.  Our  utilities  operate  in  approximately 1,600 communities  in 16 states  in  the  United  States,  with  approximately 3.4 million 
active  customers to our water and wastewater networks. Services provided by our utilities are generally subject to economic regulation by certain stateutility commissions or other entities engaged in utility regulation, collectively referred to as Public Utility Commission
s (“PUCs” or “Regulators”). Certain federal,state and
 local governments also regulate environmental, health and safety, and water quality matters. We report the results of the services provided by our utilitiesin our 
Regulated Businesses segment. Operating revenues for our Regulated Businesses were $2,984 million for 2018 , $2,958 million for 2017 and $2,871 millionfor 
2016 , accounting for 87% , 88% and 87% , respectively, of the Company ’s total operating revenues for the same periods.The

Table of ContentsCustomers
Our 
Regulated Businesses have  a large and geographically diverse customer base. A customer is defined as a person, business, municipality or any otherentity
 that purchases our water or wastewater services as of the last business day of a reporting period. One single customer may purchase our services for use bymultiple individuals or bus
inesses, as is the case in many homes, apartment complexes, businesses and governmental entities.The vast majority
 of our regulated water customers are metered, which allows us to measure and bill for our customers’ water usage, typically on a monthlybasis.
 We employ a variety of methods of customer meter reading to monitor consumption. These methods range from meters with mechanical registers whereconsumption
 is manually recorded by meter readers, to meters with electronic registers capable of transmitting consumption data to proximity devices or via radiofrequency to mobile or f
ixed network data collectors. Our wastewater customers are billed either a flat rate or based upon their water consumption.Residential
 customers make up a substantial portion of our customer base in all of the states in which we operate. We also serve (i) commercial customers,such
 as food and beverage providers, commercial property developers and proprietors, and energy suppliers, (ii) fire service customers, where we supply waterthrough our distribution systems to public fire hy
drants for firefighting purposes and to private fire customers for use in fire suppression systems in office buildingsand
 other facilities, (iii) industrial customers, such as large-scale manufacturers, mining and production operations, (iv) public authorities, such as governmentbuildings
 and other public sector facilities, including schools and universities, and (v) other utilities and community water and wastewater systems in the form ofbulk contracts for the supply o
f water or the treatment of wastewater, for their own customers.The following chart depicts 
the allocation of our Regulated Businesses ’ operating revenue by type, including a breakout of the total water services revenuesby class of customer, for th
e year ended December 31, 2018 :

 growth  in  our Regulated  Businesses is  primarily  from  (i)  adding  new  customers  to  our  customer  base  through  acquisitions  of  water  and/orwastewater
 utility  systems,  (ii)  organic  population  growth in  our authorized  service  areas,  and (iii)  sale  of  water  to  other  water  utilities  and  community  watersystems.
Capital Investment
The
 aging water and wastewater infrastructure in the United States is in need of replacement and modernization. The American Society of Civil Engineerspublished
 its Report 
Card
for
America’s
Infrastructure
in  2017 and gave the drinking water industry a grade of “D,” and the wastewater infrastructure a grade of“D+,”
 primarily because much of the country’s infrastructure is nearing the end of its useful life. The report also stated that, on an annual basis, approximately 2 trillion 
gallons  of  treated  water  are  lost  in  the  United  States  through  more  than 240,000 main  breaks,  at  an  estimated  cost  of $2.6  billion .  This  representsapproximately 
20% of  all treated water in the country. In addition, approximately 900  billion gallons  of untreated sewage is discharged into the country’s riversand
 streams every year. As documented in the American Water Works Association’s Buried 
No
Longer:
Confronting
America’s
Water
Infrastructure
Challenge
, restoring
 the country’s existing water systems as they reach the end of their useful lives, and expanding them to serve a growing population, will cost at least $1trillion between 2011 and 2035, just 
to maintain the current levels of water service. In addition, increased regulation related to water quality and the management ofwater
 and wastewater  residual  discharges,  which began with the passage  of the Clean Water  Act in 1972 and the Safe Drinking Water  Act in 1974, is also aprimary driver for th
e need to modernize the country’s water and wastewater infrastructure.To
 address the growing infrastructure needs in the areas we serve, we plan to invest $7.3 billion over the  next five years, including $1.6 billion in 2019, for capital
 improvements to our Regulated Businesses’ water and wastewater infrastructure, largely for pipe replacement and upgrading aging water and wastewatertreatment
 facilities. We have proactively improved our pipe renewal rate from a 250-year replacement cycle to a 120-year replacement cycle, which we anticipatewill
 enable us to replace  nearly 2,000 miles of mains and collection  pipes between 2019 and 2023. In addition, during this same five-year  period, our capitalinvestment
 in treatment plants, storage tanks and other key, above-ground facilities has increased over 10%, further addressing infrastructure renewal, resiliency,water
 quality,  operational  efficiency,  technology  and  innovation,  and  emerging  regulatory  compliance  needs.  Additionally,  we  are  investing  significantly  inresiliency projects to addre
ss the impacts of climate and weather variability by hardening our assets.Economic Regulation and Rate Making
Our 
Regulated  Businesses operate  under  a  regulatory  compact  whereby,  in  exchange  for  exclusive  rights  to  provide  water  and  wastewater  services  indefined
 service territories, we have an obligation to serve customers within those territories requesting service, within reasonable limits. In return for agreeing toinvest
 capital into our water and wastewater systems, we are given the opportunity to recover our costs of doing business and earn a reasonable rate of return onour investments.
The
 operations of our Regulated  Businesses are  generally subject to economic regulation by PUCs in the state in which they operate, with the primaryresponsibility
 of the PUCs to promote the overall public interest by balancing the interest of customers and utility investors. Specific authority might differ fromstate
 to state, but in most states, PUCs review and approve rates charged to customers, accounting treatments, long-term financing programs and cost of capital,O&M
 expenses, capital expenditures, taxes, affiliated transactions and relationships, reorganizations and mergers and acquisitions, along with imposing certainpenalties or granting
 certain incentives. Regulatory policies vary from state to state and could potentially change over time. These policies will affect the timing, aswell as the extent, of re
covery of expenses and the realized return on invested capital.5

Table of ContentsThe
 process to obtain approval for a change in rates generally occurs by way of a rate case filed by the utility with the PUC on a periodic basis. The timingof
 rate case filings is typically determined by either periodic requirements in the regulatory jurisdiction or by the utility’s need to increase its revenue requirementto
 recover capital investment costs, changes in operating revenues, operating costs or other market conditions. Our rate case management program is guided by theprinciples
 of (i)  obtaining  timely  recovery  of capital  investment  costs, (ii)  recognizing  declining  sales  resulting  from  reduced  consumption,  and (iii)  obtainingappropriate recovery
 of utility O&M costs, including costs incurred for compliance with environmental regulations. The program attempts to minimize “regulatorylag,”
 which is the time between the occurrence of an event that triggers a change in the utility’s revenue requirement and its recognition in rates. For example,regulatory lag describes the time between when a capital investment is placed into service for the benefit of the customer and w
hen the Company can begin earninga
 return of and on that capital investment, through the ratemaking process. It also applies to the lag in the recognition in rate recovery of changes in expenses andrevenues.
Our 
Regulated Businesses support  regulatory practices at the PUCs and state legislatures that mitigate the adverse impact of regulatory lag. The followingtable provides examples o
f approved regulatory practices:Regulatory Practices
 Description  States Allowed Infrastructure replacement
surcharges
 Allows rates to change periodically, outside a general rate case proceeding, to reflect recovery of capital investments made toreplace infrastr
ucture necessary to sustain safe, reliable services for our customers. These mechanisms typically involve periodicfilings and reviews to ensure transparency.
 IA, IL, IN, MO, NJ,NY, PA, TN, VA, WV
Future test year
 A test period used for setting rates, which begins with the date new rates are effective. This allows current or projected revenues,expenses and capital investments to be collected on a t
imelier basis. CA, HI, IA, IL, IN,KY, NY, PA, TN, VA
Hybrid test year
 Allows an update to historical data for “known and measurable” changes that occur subsequent to the historical test year. MD, MO, NJ, WVUtility plant recovery
mechanisms
 Allows recovery of the full return on utility plant costs during the construction period, instead of capitalizing an allowance forfunds
 used during construction. In addition, some states allow the utility to seek pre-approval of certain capital projects andassociated costs. In this pre-approval process, the PUC may assess the prudency of such projects.
 CA, IL, KY, NY, PA,TN, VA
Expense mechanisms
 Allows  changes  in  certain  operating  expenses,  which  may  fluctuate  based  on  conditions  beyond  the  utility’s  control,  to  berecovered outside of a general rate case proceeding or deferred until the next general rate case proceeding.
 CA, IL, MD, MO, NJ,NY, PA, TN, VA
Revenue stability
mechanisms
 
Separates  a  utility’s  cost  recovery  from  the  amount  of  water  it  sells  to  recover  its  fixed  costs  and  ongoing  infrastructureinvestment
 needs. Such a mechanism adjusts rates periodically to ensure that a utility’s revenue will be sufficient to cover itscosts,
 regardless of sales volume, including recognition of declining sales resulting from reduced consumption, while providingan incentive for customers to use water more efficiently.
 CA, IL, NYConsolidated tariffs
 
Use of a unified rate structure for water systems owned and operated by a single utility, which may or may not be physicallyinterconnected.
 The  consolidated  tariff  pricing  structure  may  be  used  fully  or  partially  in  a  state,  and  is  generally  used  toprioritize capital investments and moderate the i
mpact of periodic fluctuations in local costs, while lowering administrative costsfor customers. Pennsylvania also permits a blending of water and wastewater revenue requirements.
 CA, IA, IL, IN, KY,MD, MO, NJ, NY, PA,
VA, WV
We
 pursue or seek enhancement to these regulatory practices to facilitate efficient recovery of our costs and capital investments in order to continue toprovide safe,
 clean, reliable and affordable services to our customers. The ability to seek regulatory treatment as described above does not guarantee that the PUCswill
 accept  our  proposal  in  the  context  of  a  particular  rate  case,  and  these  regulatory  practices  may  reduce,  but  not  eliminate,  regulatory  lag  associated  withtraditional rate 
making processes. It is also our strategy to expand their use in areas where they may not currently apply.Acquisitions and Strategic Growth

 U.S. water and wastewater industries include investor-owned systems as well as municipal systems that are owned and operated by local governmentsor governmental
 subdivisions. Both industries are highly fragmented. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), approximately 84% of the water
 market is served by municipal systems and approximately 98% of  the country’s wastewater systems are government owned. The EPA also estimates thatthere are approximately 
50,000 community water systems and approximately 15,000 community wastewater systems in  the United States, with approximately 80%of
 the community water systems serving a population of 3,000 or  less. This large number of relatively small, fragmented water and wastewater systems may resultin
 inefficiencies  in  the  marketplace,  since  such  utilities  may  not  have  the  operating  expertise,  financial  and  technological  capability  or  economies  of  scale  toprovide
 services or raise capital as efficiently as larger utilities. Larger utilities that have greater access to capital are generally more capable of making mandatedand
 other necessary infrastructure upgrades to their water and wastewater systems. In addition, water and wastewater utilities with large customer bases, spreadacross
 broad geographic regions, may more easily absorb the impact of significant variations in precipitation and temperatures, such as droughts, excessive rainand
 cool or warm temperatures in specific areas. Larger utilities generally are able to spread support services over a larger customer base, thereby reducing thecosts
 to serve each customer. Since many administrative and support activities can be efficiently centralized to gain economies of scale, companies that participatein
 industry  consolidation  have  the  potential  to  improve  operating  efficiencies,  lower  costs  per  unit  and  improve  service  at  the  same  time.  Larger  utilities  alsotypically have the expertise
 to operate systems more efficiently and can attract and retain employees needed to operate the utility over time.6

Table of ContentsA
 fundamental aspect of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions of small and medium water and/or wastewater systems of between 3,000 and 30,000customers,
 in geographic proximity to areas where we operate our Regulated  Businesses .  The proximity of acquisition opportunities to our regulated footprintallows
 us to integrate  and manage the acquired  systems and operations primarily using our existing management, although we typically  retain the majority ofemployees,
 and  to  achieve  operational  efficiencies  and  prioritize  capital  investment  needs.  Our  current  customer  mix  of 94% water  and 6% wastewater  alsopresents
 strategic  opportunities  for  wastewater  growth  and  systems  consolidation,  allowing  us  to  add  wastewater  customers  where  we  already  serve  watercustomers.
 We intend to continue to expand our regulated footprint  geographically  by acquiring  water and wastewater systems in our existing markets  and, ifappropriate,
 pursuing acquisition opportunities in certain domestic markets where we do not currently operate our Regulated  Businesses .  Before entering newregulated
 markets, we will evaluate the business and regulatory climates to ensure that we will have the opportunity to achieve an appropriate rate of return on ourinvestment
 while maintaining our high standards for providing safe, reliable and affordable services to our customers, as well as a line of sight to grow our basecustomers to attain efficiencies after
 entering the new domestic market.Increasingly
 stringent environmental, health and safety, and water quality regulations, the amount of infrastructure in need of significant capital investment,financial challenges and in
dustry legislation are several elements that may drive more municipalities to consider selling their water and wastewater assets.We are an
 experienced utility with proven access to capital and financial, technical, and managerial resources with public service commission oversight. Weare a solution provider
 and believe that many communities could benefit from receiving safe and reliable water and wastewater service.Industry Legislation
In
 2017, New Jersey enacted the Water Quality Accountability Act (the “WQAA”), which sets new operational standards for all water utilities  in NewJersey,
 including  municipal  and  investor-owned  utilities  with  more  than  500  service  connections.  This  law  imposes  new  requirements  in  areas  such  ascybersecurity,
 asset management, water quality reporting, remediation of notices of violation, and hydrant and valve maintenance. The WQAA requires the mostsenior
 water manager, or either the executive director for municipal utility authorities or the mayor or chief executive officer for municipally owned public watersystems, to certify
 that the system meets the requirements under the WQAA. On October 19, 2018, our New Jersey American Water subsidiary certified that it wasin compliance with all 
aspects of the Act.In 2018, similar legislation was passed in Indiana, which sets new o
perational standards and requirements for water and wastewater treatment plants in areassuch as capital asset mana
gement, cost-benefit analysis and cybersecurity.Also,
 in  2018,  President  Trump  signed  America’s  Water  Infrastructure  Act  of  2018.  The  legislation  includes  policies  intended  to  improve  water  andwastewater
 system management and authorization for states to assess options for consolidation for systems that do not comply with the federal Safe DrinkingWater
 Act and its rules and regulations. The legislation increases funding to water system funding programs, including the State Revolving Loan Fund programand the Water Infras
tructure Finance and Innovation Act.Our
 regulated  subsidiaries  in  California,  Illinois,  Indiana,  Iowa,  Maryland,  Missouri,  New  Jersey  and  Pennsylvania  have  access  to  fair  market  valuelegislation
 for  private  sector  investment  in  public  sector  systems.  We  support  full  optionality  for  municipalities,  including  state  legislation  that  enables  theconsolidation
 of  the  largely  fragmented  water  and  wastewater  industries  through  third-party  fair  market  valuations  of  purchased  property.  Fair  market  valueassessment
 of  water  and  wastewater  systems  is  an  alternative  to  the  traditional  depreciated  original  cost  method  of  valuation,  providing  municipalities  with  apurchase
 price that is reflective of the assets’ value, while the utility has increased assurance of recovering the purchase price over the life of the assets, subject tostate regulatory com
mission approval.Consolidated
 tariffs use a unified rate structure for systems owned and operated by a single utility, which may or may not be physically interconnected.Consolidated
 tariff pricing moderates the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs and promotes a more universal water infrastructure investment in the state.As
 a result, consolidated tariffs can make it easier to incorporate new systems into an existing utility and can ensure economies of scale for even the smallest ofsystems
 and  prioritize  capital  needs  across  the  state.  Overall,  this  brings  cost-effective,  higher  quality  services  to  a  larger  number  of  citizens.  Eleven  of  ourregulated
 subsidiaries currently have some form of consolidated tariff pricing, including Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, NewYork, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Vi
rginia.7

Table of ContentsIn
 2018,  legislation  was  passed  in  our  Missouri  and  California  subsidiaries  changing  the  public  vote  requirement  for  the  sale  of  water  or  wastewatersystems.
 In Missouri, the public vote requirement for the sale of a municipal water or wastewater system changed to a simple majority for more than 500 smalltowns.
 Historically, only larger communities required a simple majority, while smaller communities needed a two-thirds majority. This legislation increases theoptions
 for small towns, should they decide to address their water and sewer challenges through an asset sale. In California, the vote required to allow cities to sellsewer systems changed to a simp
le majority as compared to a two-thirds majority.Competition
In
 our Regulated  Businesses ,  we generally  do not face  direct  competition  in our existing  markets  because  (i)  we operate  in those  markets  pursuant  tofranchises,
 charters, certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations (collectively, “CPCNs”) issued by state PUCs, and (ii) the high costof
 constructing  a  new  water  and  wastewater  system  in  an  existing  market  creates  a  high  barrier  to  market  entry.  However,  our Regulated  Businesses do  facecompetition
 from governmental agencies, other investor-owned utilities, large industrial customers with the ability to provide their own water supply/treatmentprocess
 and  strategic  buyers  that  are  entering  new  markets  and/or  making  strategic  acquisitions.  When  pursuing  acquisitions,  our  largest  investor-ownedcompetitors,
 based on a comparison of operating revenues and population served, are Aqua America, Inc., Suez North America, American States Water Companyand California
 Water Service Group. From time to time, we also face competition from infrastructure funds, multi-utility companies and others, such as AlgonquinPower and Utilities Corp., Eversource En
ergy and Corix.Condemnation and Eminent Domain
All
 or portions of our Regulated  Businesses ’  utility assets could be acquired by state, municipal or other government entities through one or more of thefollowing
 methods: (i) eminent domain (also known as condemnation); (ii) the right of purchase given or reserved by a municipality or political subdivision whenthe
 original CPCN was granted; and (iii) the right of purchase given or reserved under the law of the state in which the utility subsidiary was incorporated or fromwhich
 it  received  its  CPCN.  The  acquisition  consideration  related  to  such  a  proceeding  initiated  by  a  local  government  may  be  determined  consistent  withapplicable eminent do
main law, or may be negotiated or fixed by appraisers as prescribed by the law of the state or in the particular CPCN.As
 such, we are periodically subject to condemnation proceedings in the ordinary course of business. For example, a citizens group in Monterey, Californiasuccessfully
 added “Measure J” to the November 6, 2018 election ballot asking voters to decide whether the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District (the“MPWMD”)
 should conduct a feasibility study concerning the potential purchase of our California subsidiary’s Monterey water service assets, and, if feasible, toproceed
 with a purchase of those assets without an additional public vote. This service territory represents approximately 40,000 customers. On November 27,2018,
 Measure J was certified to have passed. The MPWMD has until August 27, 2019 to complete a feasibility study and submit to its board a written plan foracquiring
 the system assets. If the MPWMD were to determine that such an acquisition is feasible, then the MPWMD would commence a multi-year eminentdomain
 proceeding against our California subsidiary to first establish the MPWMD’s right to take the system assets and, if such right is established, determine theamount of just compensation 
to be paid for the system assets.Also, five
 municipalities in the Chicago, Illinois area (approximately 30,300 customers in total) formed a water agency and filed an eminent domain lawsuitagainst
 our  Illinois  subsidiary  in  January  2013,  seeking  to  condemn  the  water  pipeline  that  serves  those  five  municipalities.  Before  filing  its  eminent  domainlawsuit,
 the water agency made an offer of $38 million for the pipeline. A jury trial will take place to establish the value of the pipeline. Although the date of thistrial has not current
ly been scheduled, it is likely to commence in the fourth quarter of 2019.Furthermore,
 the  law  in  certain  jurisdictions  in  which  our Regulated  Businesses operate  provides  for  eminent  domain  rights  allowing  private  propertyowners to file a lawsuit to seek just compensation against a public utilit
y, if a public utility’s infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of damageto that property. In these actions, the plaintiff would not have to prove that the p
ublic utility acted negligently. In California, most recently, lawsuits have been filedin connection
 with large-scale natural events such as wildfires. Some have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities triggered the natural event thatresulted in damage to the property. In some cases, the PU
C has allowed certain costs or losses incurred by the utility to be recovered from customers in rates, but inother
 cases such recovery in rates has been disallowed. Also, the utility may have obtained insurance that could respond to some or all of such losses, although theutility would be at risk for 
any losses not ultimately subject to rate or insurance recovery or losses that exceed the limits of such insurance.8

Table of ContentsWater Supply and Wastewater Services
Our 
Regulated Businesses generally  own the physical assets used to store, pump, treat and deliver water to our customers and collect, treat, transport andrecycle
 wastewater. Typically, we do not own the water itself, which is held in public trust and is allocated to us through contracts, permits and allocation rightsgranted
 by federal and state or multi-state agencies or through the ownership of water rights pursuant to local law. We are dependent on defined sources of watersupply
 and obtain our water supply from surface water sources such as reservoirs, lakes, rivers and streams; from groundwater sources, such as wells and aquifers;and
 water purchased from third-party water suppliers. The level of water treatment we apply varies significantly depending upon the quality of the water sourceand
 customer  stipulations.  Surface  water  sources  typically  generally  require  significant  treatment,  while  groundwater  sources  often  require  chemical  treatmentonly.
The following chart depicts ou
r sources of water supply as of December 31, 2018 : 
The following table provides pe
rcentages of water supply by source type for our top seven states for 2018 were as follows:  
Surface Water  Ground Water  Purchased Water New Jersey
71%  24%  5% Pennsylvania
91%  7%  2% Missouri
79%  20%  1% Illinois
53%  36%  11% California
—  64%  36% Indiana
44%  56%  — West Virginia
99%  —  1% Our
 ability  to  meet  the  existing  and  future  water  demands  of  our  customers  depends  on  an  adequate  water  supply.  Drought,  governmental  restrictions,overuse
 of sources of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats, contamination or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water.We
 employ a variety of measures in an effort to obtain adequate sources of water supply, both in the short-term and over the long-term. The geographic diversityof our
 service areas may mitigate some of the economic effects on the water supply associated with weather extremes we might encounter in any particular serviceterritory.
 For example, in any given summer, some areas may experience drier than average weather, which may reduce the amount of source water available,while other areas we serve 
may experience wetter than average weather.9

Table of ContentsIn
 our  long-term  planning,  we  evaluate  quality,  quantity,  growth  needs  and  alternate  sources  of  water  supply  as  well  as  transmission  and  distributioncapacity. Water supply 
is seasonal in nature and weather conditions can have a pronounced effect on supply. In order to ensure that we have adequate water supply,we use
 long-term planning processes and maintain contingency plans to minimize the potential impact on service caused by climate variability and a wide range ofweather
 fluctuations. In connection with supply planning for most surface or groundwater sources, we employ models to determine safe yields under differentrainfall
 and drought conditions. Surface and ground water levels are routinely monitored so that supply capacity deficits may, to the extent possible, be predictedand
 mitigated through demand management and additional supply development. An example of our use of long-term planning to ensure that we have adequatewater
 supply is our involvement in the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project (the “Water Supply Project”) in California. The Water Supply Project includesthe
 construction of a desalination plant, owned by our California subsidiary, and the construction of wells that would supply water to the desalination plant. Inaddition,
 the Water Supply Project also includes our California subsidiary’s purchase of water from a groundwater replenishment project between the MontereyRegional
 Water Pollution Control Agency (now known as Monterey One Water) and the MPWMD. The Water Supply Project is intended, among other things, tofulfill
 obligations of our California subsidiary to eliminate unauthorized diversions from the Carmel River as required under orders of the California State WaterResources Control Board (the “SWRCB”). For more 
information, see Item 3—Legal Proceedings —Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions.Wastewater
 services  involve  the  collection  of  wastewater  from  customers’  premises  through  sewer  lines.  The  wastewater  is  then  transported  through  asewer
 network to a treatment facility, where it is treated to meet required regulatory standards for wastewater before being returned to the environment. The solidwaste by-product of the tre
atment process is disposed of or recycled in accordance with applicable standards and regulations.Seasonality
Customer
 demand for our water service is affected by weather and tends to vary with temperature, rainfall levels and the frequency of rainfall. Customerdemand
 is generally greater during the warmer months, primarily due to increased water usage for irrigation systems and other outdoor water use. As such, wetypically
 expect  our  operating  revenues  to  be  the  highest  in  the  third  quarter  of  each  year.  Weather  that  is  hotter  and  drier  than  average  generally  increasesoperating revenues, whereas,
 weather that is cooler and/or wetter than average generally serves to suppress customer water demand and can reduce water operatingrevenues.
 Three  of  our  jurisdictions,  California,  Illinois  and  New  York,  have  adopted  revenue  stability  mechanisms  which  permit  us  to  collect  state  PUC-authorized
 revenue for a given period which is not tied to the volume of water sold during that period, thereby lessening the impact of weather variability. See “Economic Regulation and Rate Mak
ing ” for additional infor mation regarding revenue stability mechanisms.Market-Based Businesses
Through our 
Market-Based Businesses ,  we provide a broad range of related and complementary water and wastewater services primarily to residential andsmaller commerc
ial customers, the U.S. government on military installations and shale natural gas exploration and production companies, as well as municipalities,utilities
 and  industrial  customers.  These  businesses  are  not  subject  to  economic  regulation  by  state  PUCs  and  the  services  provided  generally  do  not  requiresignificant capital
 investment. Operating revenues for our Market-Based Businesses were $476 million for 2018 , $422 million for 2017 and $451 million for 2016, accounting for 
14% , 13% and 14% , respectively, of the Company ’s total operating revenues for the same periods.Our primary 
Market-Based Businesses include the following opera ting segments:•
Homeowner Services Group , which provides various warranty pro tection programs to residential and smaller commercial customers;•
Military  Services  Group ,  which  enters  into  long-term  contracts  with  the  U.S.  government  to  provide  water  and  wastewater  services  on  variousmilitary installations; and
•
Keystone  Clearwater  Solutions,  LLC  (“Keystone”),  which  provides  customized  water  transfer  services  for  shale  natural  gas  exploration  andproduction companies.
We
 also enter into contracts with municipal, commercial and industrial customers to operate and manage water and wastewater facilities and provide otherrelated
 services through our Contract  Services Group .  During 2018, we closed on the sale of the majority of our Contract  Services Group ’s  O&M contracts tosubsidiaries
 of  Veolia  Environnement  S.A.  See Note  4—Acquisitions  and  Divestitures in  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  additionalinformation.
 We will retain four of our Contract  Services Group ’s  O&M contracts due to their proximity to our existing service areas, and expect the majority ofthe remaining contra
cts to be sold to other parties, or expire within the next twelve months.10

Table of ContentsHomeowner Services Group
Our 
Homeowner  Services  Group ,  which  includes  our June  4,  2018 acquisition  of  Pivotal  Home  Solutions  (“Pivotal”),  provides  warranty  protectionprograms
 to residential and smaller commercial customers to protect against repair costs for interior and exterior water and sewer lines, interior gas and electriclines,
 heating  and  cooling  systems,  water  heaters  and  other  home  appliances,  as  well  as  power  surge  protection  and  other  related  services.  We  also  developpartnerships with
 municipalities, utilities and other organizations to offer our protection programs to customers serviced by, or affiliated with, those municipalities,utilities
 and organizations. The term of these partnership agreements is typically three to five years, with mutual optional renewals. As of December 31, 2018 , our Homeowner
 Services Group had  approximately 3  million customer  contracts in 43 states, and 26 partnership agreements with utilities, municipalities and otherorganizations.
Military Services Group
Our 
Military  Services  Group operates  on 14 military  installations  under  50-year  contracts  with  the  U.S.  government  as  part  of  its  Utility  PrivatizationProgram.
 The scope of these contracts generally includes the operation and maintenance of the installation’s water and wastewater systems and a capital programfocused
 on asset replacement  and, in certain  instances,  systems expansion. The replacement  of assets assumed when a contract  is awarded to the Company isfunded
 from the contract fee. At times, new assets are required to support the installation’s mission and the construction of these assets are funded by the U.S.government
 as separate modifications or amendments to the contract. The capital program historically has not used the Company’s equity or debt borrowings;rather,
 we have used limited working capital for short-term needs under these contracts. In April 2018, the U.S. Army instituted a requirement that a bidder mustoffer
 financing in its proposal for a new capital project. The Company is currently exploring strategies to address the U.S. Army’s revised requirements for newprojects on which it may seek 
to bid, including partnering with third parties for off-balance sheet financing.The
 contract price for nine of  our contracts with the U.S. government is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations, and everythree
 years  thereafter.  Price  redetermination  is  a  contract  mechanism  to  periodically  adjust  the  service  fee  in  the  next  period,  to  reflect  changes  in  contractobligations
 and anticipated market conditions. The remaining five contracts with the U.S. government are subject to annual price adjustments under a mechanismsimilar
 to price redetermination called “Economic Price Adjustment.” All of these contracts may be terminated, in whole or in part, prior to the end of the 50-yearterm
 for convenience of the U.S. government, or as a result of default or non-performance by the subsidiary performing the contract. In either event, pursuant totermination provisions app
licable to these contracts, we would be entitled to recover allowable costs that we may have incurred under the contract, plus the contractprofit
 margin on incurred costs. Our backlog of revenue associated with our contracts with the U.S. government is approximately $4.3  billion ,  with an averageremaining contract term of 
42 years.Keystone
In July 2015, we acquired a 
95% interest in  Water Solutions Holdings, LLC, including its wholly owned subsidiary, Keystone. During 2018, pursuant to theexercise of
 put options by the minority owners, we acquired the remaining 5% interest in Keystone, bringing our ownership interest to  100% . Keystone is a water service
 and management solutions company that serves shale natural gas exploration and production customers in the Appalachian Basin. During 2018, Keystoneexited
 its  construction  and  water  trucking  business  lines,  narrowing  the  scope  of  its  business  going  forward  to  customized  water  transfer  services.  Keystoneoperates
 under  master  service  agreements  that  are  generally  shorter  term  in  nature.  When  the  initial  term  of  these  agreements  expire,  they  typically  renewautomatically on an
 annual basis, and are generally cancelable by either party with 30 days prior notice. As of December 31, 2018 , Keystone serves approximate ly47 
customers.Competition
We
 face competition in our Market-Based Businesses from  a number of service providers, including HomeServe USA in our Homeowner  Services Group , and American States Water Company, Suez North America, and Veolia Environnement S.A. in our 
Military Services Group . Keystone currently faces competitionfrom
 water service providers that typically provide services to particular segments of the water management cycle, such as Select Energy Services, Inc., TETRATechnologies, Inc. and Baker Corp.

Table of ContentsEnvironmental, Health and Safety, and Water Quality Regulation
Our
 water  and  wastewater  operations,  including  the  services  provided  by  both  our Regulated  Businesses and Market-Based Businesses ,  are  subject  toextensive
 federal, state and local laws and regulations, and in the case of our Canadian operations, Canadian laws and regulations, governing the protection of theenvironment,
 health and safety, the provision of water and wastewater services, particularly with respect to the quality of water we deliver to our customers, andthe
 manner  in  which  we  collect,  treat,  discharge,  recycle  and  dispose  of  wastewater.  In  the  United  States,  these  regulations  are  developed  under  legislationincluding
 the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act. States also have the authority to develop theirstandards
 and requirements in these areas. We are subject to various federal, state, local and Canadian laws and regulations governing the storage of hazardousmaterials, the
 management and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes, discharges to air and water, the cleanup of contaminated sites, dam safety and other mattersrelating to the prote
ction of the environment and health and safety. PUCs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver.Environmental,
 health  and  safety,  and  water  quality  regulations  are  complex  and  change  frequently.  For  example,  while  the  EPA  has  issued  a  non-enforceable
 Health Advisory for the combined level of two perfluorinated compounds, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection has adopted amore
 stringent maximum contaminant level for a third compound, perfluorononanoic acid, or PFNA, and perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, and will be seeking toadopt
 similar standards for other perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. The overall trend has been that drinking water standards have becomeincreasingly
 more stringent over time. As newer or stricter standards are introduced, our capital and operating costs could increase. We incur substantial costsassociated
 with compliance with the environmental, health and safety, and water quality standards to which our operations are subject and we invest in technologysolutions
 for enhanced detection and monitoring. In the past, our Regulated  Businesses have  generally been able to recover the costs associated with compliance;however,
 this  recovery  is  affected  by  regulatory  lag  and  the  corresponding  uncertainties  surrounding  rate  recovery.  We  estimate  that  we  will  make  capitalexpenditures
 of $133  million and $120 million during 2019 and 2020 ,  respectively, for environmental control facilities, which we define for this purpose as anyproject
 (or portion thereof) that involves the preservation of air, water or land. We also maintain an environmental program that includes responsible businesspractices,
 compliance with environmental laws and regulations, and effective use of natural resources. We believe that our operations are materially in compliancewith, and in many cases surpass, min
imum standards required by applicable environmental laws and regulations.Our
 operations also involve the use, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. For example, our water and wastewater treatment facilitiesstore
 and use chlorine and other chemicals that generate wastes that require proper handling and disposal under applicable environmental requirements. We alsocould
 incur remedial costs in connection  with any contamination  relating  to our operations  or facilities  or our off-site disposal of wastes. The ComprehensiveEnvironmental
 Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), authorizes the EPA, and comparable state laws authorize state environmentalauthorities,
 to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions at any site that is determined topresent an actual or potential threat to human health or the environment because of an actual or threatened release of one or more hazardous substa
nces. Parties thatgenerated or transported hazardous substa
nces to such sites, as well as current and former owners and operators of such sites, may be deemed liable, without regardto
 fault,  under  CERCLA  or  comparable  state  laws.  Although  we  are  not  aware  of  any  material  cleanup  or  decontamination  obligations,  the  discovery  ofcontamination
 or the imposition of such obligations in the future could result in additional costs. Our facilities and operations are also subject to requirementsunder
 the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act and inspections thereunder. Certain of our subsidiaries are involved in pending legal proceedings relating toenvironmental matters. See 
Item 3—Legal Proceedings for additional information. Safe Drinking Water Act
The
 Safe Drinking Water Act and related regulations establish national quality standards for drinking water. The EPA has issued rules governing the levelsof numerous, naturally occu
rring and man-made chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water, and continues to propose newrules.
 These  rules  also  prescribe  testing  requirements  for  detecting  regulated  contaminants,  the  treatment  systems  that  may  be  used  for  removing  thosecontaminants,
 and other requirements. To date, the EPA has set standards for approximately 90 contaminants and indicators for drinking water, and there is aprocess in place to make 
a regulatory determination on at least five additional compounds every five years.To
 help  formulate  the  basis  for  future  regulations,  the  EPA  has  the  authority  to  require  monitoring  for  additional,  unregulated  contaminants  under  theUnregulated
 Contaminant  Monitoring  Rule  (the  “Monitoring  Rule”).  Our  facilities  have  participated  in  the  data  gathering  effort  for  the  Monitoring  Rule  inprevious rounds, which occurs every f
ive years, and are also a participant in the ongoing fourth round, which is scheduled for completion by the end of 2020. Thereare
 millions of other chemical compounds that are not regulated, many of which are lacking a testing methodology, occurrence data, health effects informationand/or
 treatment technology. The process of developing new drinking water standards is long and complex, but we actively participate with the EPA and otherwater industry groups by
 sharing research and water quality operational knowledge. See Item 1—Business—Research and Development—Emerging Containmentsfor additional information.

Table of ContentsTo
 effect the removal or inactivation of microbial organisms, the EPA has established various rules to improve the disinfection and filtration of drinkingwater and
 to reduce consumers’ exposure to disinfectants and by-products of the disinfection process. In 2006, the EPA issued the Long-Term 2 Enhanced SurfaceWater
 Treatment  Rule  and  the  Stage  2  Disinfectants  and  Disinfection  Byproduct  Rule  and  finalized  the  Ground  Water  Rule,  which  is  applicable  to  systemsproviding water from underground source
s. In 2016, the revised Total Coliform Rule implemented a “find and fix” process where exceeding bacterial trigger levelsrequires an
 assessment to correct any sanitary defects. We are within the EPA’s time frame for compliance with these standards, which includes sample collection,data
 analysis, engineering planning and system implementation. Recent monitoring under the Long-Term 2 Rule has resulted in the need for more than 30 of oursurface
 water systems to provide additional protection against cryptosporidium. In most cases, this will involve installing UV disinfection at an estimated costranging
 from $150  million to $250 million .  Further, the EPA is actively considering regulations for a number of contaminants, including strontium, hexavalentchromium,
 fluoride, nitrosamines, perchlorate, some pharmaceuticals and certain volatile organic compounds. We do not anticipate that any such regulations, ifenacted, will require 
implementation in 2019.Across the Company, we conduct over one
 million water quality tests each year at our laboratory facilities and plant operations, including continuous onlineinstrumentations
 such  as  monitoring  turbidity  levels,  disinfectant  residuals  and  adjustments  to  chemical  treatment  based  on  changes  in  incoming  water.  Weparticipate
 in the Partnership for Safe Water, the EPA’s voluntary program to meet more stringent goals for reducing microbial contaminants. With 69 of our 81 surface
 water treatment plants receiving the EPA program’s prestigious “Director” award, which recognizes utilities that (i) have completed a comprehensive self-assessment
 report, (ii) created an action plan for continuous improvement, and (iii) produced high-quality drinking water, we account for approximately one-thirdof the plants
 receiving such awards nationwide. In addition, 67 of our surface water treatment plants have received the “Five-Year Phase III” award, 62 plants havereceived
 the “Ten-Year Phase III” award, 58 plants have received the “Fifteen-Year Phase III” award, and 3 plants have received the “Twenty-Year Phase III”award;
 these awards recognize plants that have met the Director award status for five, 10, 15 and 20 years, respectively. Further, nine of  our surface water plantshave received the “Preside
nts” award, which recognizes treatment plants that achieve the Partnership’s rigorous individual filter effluent turbidity standards.Although
 it is difficult to project the ultimate costs of complying with the above or other pending or future requirements, we expect current requirementsunder the Safe Drinking Water Act
 and other similar laws to be recoverable through the regulatory process and therefore compliance costs are not expected to havea
 material impact on our operations or financial condition. In addition, capital expenditures and operating costs to comply with environmental mandates have beentraditionally
 recognized by PUCs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates. As a result, we expect to recover the operating and capital costs resulting fromthese pending or future requ
irements.Lead and Copper Rule and Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act

 the country, there is a renewed focus on the potential risk of lead in drinking water. In 1991, the EPA published the Lead and Copper Rule (“LCR”)to
 control lead and copper in drinking water and, since that time, has issued minor revisions in 2000, 2004 and 2007, enhancing monitoring, reporting and publiceducation
 requirements. In 2011, Congress enacted the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act regarding the use and introduction into commerce of lead pipes,plumbing
 fittings for fixtures, solder and flux. While these advances have made an impact in reducing lead exposure in drinking water, legacy lead plumbingmaterials,
 primarily in building plumbing, still remain in many communities. The EPA is currently working to develop long-term revisions to the LCR, with arevised
 draft  likely  in  2019.  It  is  currently  estimated  that  approximately  5%  of  our  service  lines  contain  lead  (“LSLs”).  We  have  reviewed  our  inventories  ofcompany
 owned service lines, our related practices and are working with stakeholders to develop feasible solutions to remove legacy lead from service lines inolder neighborhoods. Our goal is to rep
lace our LSLs in most areas over an approximate 10-year time frame, at an estimated cost ranging from $600 million to $1.2billion 
.  In cases where we are replacing an American Water owned LSL, our standard approach will be to replace the company-owned portion of the service line,and
 work with the customer to replace the customer-owned portion of the service line at the same time. Replacing the full service line is considered a best practiceas advised
 by the Lead Service Line Replacement Collaborative and the American Water Works Association. The Lead Service Line Replacement Collaborative isa
 diverse group of public health, water utility, environmental, labor, consumer, and housing organizations from across the country working together to encouragecommunities
 to  accelerate  the  full  replacement  of  LSLs  through  collaborative  efforts  at  the  local  level.  The  prioritization  of  this  work  will  depend  on  severalfactors,
 including our planned water main and service  line renewal projects,  adjacent projects  by municipalities  or other utilities,  LCR compliance  monitoringresults
 and cooperation with our customers with respect to the customer-owned portion of the service line. There is also a special focus placed on low-incomeneighborhoods.

Table of ContentsClean Water Act
The Clean Water Act regul
ates discharges from drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities into lakes, rivers, streams and groundwater. In addition torequirements applicable
 to our wastewater collection systems, our operations require discharge permits under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System(“NPDES”) permit program establishe
d under the Clean Water Act, which must be renewed every five years. Pursuant to the NPDES permit program, the EPA andimplementing
 states set maximum discharge limits for wastewater effluents and overflows from wastewater collection systems. Discharges that exceed the limitsspecified
 under NPDES permits can lead to the imposition of fines and penalties, and persistent non-compliance could lead to significant fines and penalties andother
 compliance costs. In addition, the difficulty of obtaining and complying with NPDES permits, and renewing expiring permits, may impose time and costburdens
 on our operations. From time to time, discharge violations occur at our facilities, some of which result in fines. We do not expect any such violations orfines to have a mater
ial impact on our results of operations or financial condition.Environmental, Social Responsibility and Governance
Integrating
 environmental, social responsibility and governance (“ESG”) policies and practices into our daily operations emphasizes our belief that the onlyway
 to do business is to do it responsibly, and that the “how” is just as important as the “what” for long-term financial sustainability. Being committed to ESGprinciples means striv
ing to:•
keep employees safe and in jury-free, and develop each person to his or her full potential;•
be a leader in environm ental sustainability, caring for the planet, and leading the nation in outstanding water safety and quality;•
deliver personalized customer service with empathy and care;•
make communities better because  we are there; and•
be transparent, access ible and well-governed for our shareholders and investors.This
 focus  is  derived  from  our  vision  statement,  “clean  water  for  life,”  and  our  core  values:  (i)  safety;  (ii)  trust;  (iii)  environmental  leadership;  (iv)teamwork;
 and (v) high performance, the principles by which we work and live. Our vision and values drive our company strategy, which is centered on fivecentral themes: 
•
Safety—The safety of our emp loyees and our customers is the number one focus for American Water.•
Customers—Our  customers are at the center of everything we do, helping us to shape our strategic priorities. We challenge ourselves so that if ourregulated utility cus
tomers had a choice of providers, we would want them to choose us.•
People—Maintaining  an environment which is open, transparent, diverse and inclusive, and where our people feel valued, included and accountable,is critical to our ab
ility to serve our customers every day.•
Operational Excellenc e—Our operational excellence strategy helps us to find better and more efficient ways to do business, and to provide safe, cleanand affordable water se
rvices for our customers.•
Growth—We  believe that when companies grow, they can invest more in creating stable jobs, training, benefits, infrastructure and our communities.Our growth benefits all of our st
akeholders, including our shareholders.In
 2017, we issued our fourth biennial Corporate Responsibility Report, covering our performance in 2015 to 2016. Our first report was issued in 2011,making
 us the first large water services company to measure its performance against the Global Reporting Index. In addition, our sustainability practices havesupported our inclusion
 in the Euronext Vigeo ® U.S. 50 index, FTSE4Good index series, 2018 Constituent MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes, NAACP Equity Inclusionand
 Empowerment  Index  and  the  most  recent  2019  Bloomberg  Gender-Equality  Index.  Highlights  of  our  commitment  to  our  ESG  policies  and  practices  aresummarized below:

Table of ContentsWe
 continue to leverage the Company’s expertise and collaborate with the EPA and state agencies to help establish effective environmental, health andsafety, and water quality s
tandards and regulation. This relationship includes the sharing of our research, such as our treatment and distribution system optimizationresearch
 and  our  national  water  quality  monitoring  data.  Our  engagement  with  the  EPA  provides  us  with  early  insight  into  emerging  regulatory  issues  andinitiatives,
 thereby allowing us to anticipate and to accommodate our future compliance requirements. We also frequently engage with the Centers for DiseaseControl and other state environmental agencies. We believe that continued R&
D activities are critical for providing safe, reliable and affordable services, as well asmaintaining
 our  leadership  position  in  the  industry,  which  provides  us  with  a  competitive  advantage  as  we  seek  additional  business  with  new  and  existingcustomers.
Emerging Contaminants
Emerging
 contaminants include chemicals such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pesticides, herbicides and endocrine disrupting compounds, aswell
 as some naturally occurring microbes, such as bacteria, viruses and parasites, which have been detected in drinking water supplies, for which the risk to thepublic’s
 health is not fully understood and/or has not been quantified. While these contaminants have been present in our drinking water for as long as they havebeen
 in use, technological advances have only recently made it possible to detect many of them. The ability to detect contaminants, even at trace levels, has raisedquestions among regulators and gov
ernment agencies, further affecting the public’s perception of drinking water quality.The
 Chemicals  Abstract  Service  Registry  contains  over  140  million  registered  chemicals,  with  a  new  substance  being  produced  approximately  every  3seconds
 from  chemical  breakdown  and  reformation.  There  are  over  1,400  microbes  which  can  affect  drinking  water.  We  are  continually  investigating  newsubstances
 and contaminants, employing a team of scientists, engineers and public health professionals to identify threats to our water supply, to act on emergingregulations
 and new health advisories, and to evaluate the benefits of alternative or advanced treatment technologies. We maintain state-of-the-art water qualitytesting
 equipment and implement new and emerging technologies to help predict and manage potential water supply contamination issues. Examples of our effortsinclude:
•
using  our research findings to communicate information to our customers on the actions they can take to manage Legionella (the Centers for DiseaseControl
 statistics  indicate  that  water-associated  disease  from  Legionella  is  on  the  rise,  with  exposure  typically  associated  with  customer-ownedplumbing systems in large bui
ldings);•
aerial  drone  testing  to  detect  harmful  algal  blooms  and  testing  ultrasonic  technology  to  help  prevent  taste  and  odor  events  and  to  eliminatecyanotoxins before they get 
to the water treatment plant;•
the  implementation of water  source assessment tools, including sensors and analytics, to  evaluate and track chemical storage and transport throughwatersheds and to detect sour
ce water contamination events; and•
the implementation of activated car bon and biofiltration for the control of emerging contaminants.Service Company and Security

RISK FACTORS We
 operate  in  a  market  and  regulatory  environment  that  involves  significant  risks,  many  of  which  are  beyond  our  control.  In  addition  to  the  otherinformation
 included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects.Any
 of the following risks, either alone or taken together, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flowsand liquidity.
Risks Related to Our Industry and Business Operations
Our
 utility  operations  are  subject  to  extensive  economic  regulation  by  state  PUCs  and  other  regulatory  agencies,  which  significantly  affects  our  business,financial
 condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our utility operations also may be subject to fines, penalties and other sanctions for the inability tomeet these regulatory requirem
ents.Our 
Regulated  Businesses provide  water and wastewater services to our customers through subsidiaries that are subject to economic regulation by statePUCs.
 Economic regulation affects the rates we charge our customers and has a significant impact on our business and results of operations. Generally, the statePUCs
 authorize us to charge rates that they determine are sufficient to recover our prudently incurred operating expenses, including, but not limited to, operatingand maintenance costs, dep
reciation, financing costs and taxes, and provide us the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on invested capital.18

Table of ContentsOur
 ability to successfully implement our business plan and strategy depends on the rates authorized by the various state PUCs. We periodically file rateincrease
 applications with state PUCs. The ensuing administrative process may be lengthy and costly. Our rate increase requests may or may not be approved, ormay be partially approv
ed, and any approval may not occur in a timely manner. Moreover, a PUC may not approve a rate request to an extent that is sufficient to:•
cover our expenses, including pur chased water and costs of chemicals, fuel and other commodities used in our operations;•
enable us to recover our inv estment; and•
provide us with an opportunity to ea rn an appropriate rate of return on our investment.Approval
 of the PUCs is also required in connection with other aspects of our utilities’ operations. Some state PUCs are empowered to impose financialpenalties,
 fines and other sanctions for non-compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Our utilities are also required to have numerous permits, approvalsand
 certificates from the PUCs that regulate their businesses and authorize acquisitions. Although we believe that each utility subsidiary has obtained or soughtrenewal
 of the material permits, approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations, we are unable to predict the impact that future regulatory activitiesmay have on our business.
In any of these
 cases, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected. Even if rates are sufficient,we
 face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on our invested capital to the extent permitted by state PUCs. This could occur if certain conditionsexist,
 including, but not limited to, if water usage is less than the level anticipated in establishing rates, or if our investments or expenses prove to be higher thanthe level estimat
ed in establishing rates.Our
 operations and the quality of water we supply are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent environmental, water quality and health and safety lawsand
 regulations, including with respect to emerging contaminants, compliance with which could impact our operating costs, and violations of which couldsubject us to substantial liabiliti
es and costs, as well as damage to our reputation.Our regulated
 water and wastewater operations and the operations of our Market-Based Businesses are  subject to extensive federal, state and local laws andregulations and,
 in the case of our Canadian operations, Canadian laws and regulations that govern the protection of the environment, health and safety, the qualityof
 the  water  we  deliver  to  our  customers,  water  allocation  rights,  and  the  manner  in  which  we  collect,  treat,  discharge  and  dispose  of  wastewater.  Theserequirements
 include  CERCLA,  the  Clean  Water  Act  and  the  Safe  Drinking  Water  Act,  EPA  requirements  and  similar  federal,  state  and  Canadian  laws  andregulations.
 For  example,  CERCLA  authorizes  the  EPA  to  issue  orders  and  bring  enforcement  actions  to  compel  responsible  parties  to  investigate  and  takeremedial
 actions  with  respect  to  actual  or  threatened  releases  of  hazardous  substances,  and  can  impose  joint  and  several  liability,  without  regard  to  fault,  onresponsible parties for 
the costs thereof. We are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations.In addition, state
 PUCs and environmental regulators also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver. If we deliver wateror
 wastewater services to our customers that do not comply with regulatory standards, or otherwise violate environmental laws, regulations or permits, or otherhealth
 and safety and water quality regulations, we could incur substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions or costs, as well as damage to our reputation. In themost
 serious cases, regulators could reduce requested rate increases or force us to discontinue operations and sell our operating assets to another utility or to amunicipality. Given the na
ture of our business which, in part, involves supplying water for human consumption, any potential non-compliance with, or violation of,environmental,
 water quality and health and safety laws or regulations would likely pose a more significant risk to us than to a company not similarly involved inthe water and wastewater indus
try.We
 incur  substantial  operating  and  capital  costs  on  an  ongoing  basis  to  comply  with  environmental,  water  quality  and  health  and  safety  laws  andregulations.
 These laws and regulations, and their enforcement, generally have become more stringent over time, and new or stricter requirements could increaseour
 costs. Although we may seek to recover ongoing compliance costs in our Regulated Businesses through customer rates, there can be no guarantee that thevarious
 state PUCs or similar regulatory bodies that govern our Regulated  Businesses would  approve rate increases that would enable us to recover such costs orthat such costs will not mat
erially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.We
 may  also  incur  liabilities  if,  under  environmental  laws  and  regulations,  we  are  required  to  investigate  and  clean  up  environmental  contamination,including
 potential spills of hazardous chemicals, such as chlorine, which we use to treat water, or at off-site locations where we have disposed of waste or causedan
 adverse  environmental  impact.  The  discovery  of  previously  unknown  conditions,  or  the  imposition  of  cleanup  obligations  in  the  future,  could  result  insignificant
 costs and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Such remediation costs may not be covered byinsurance and may make it
 difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future.19

Table of ContentsAttention
 is being given to emerging contaminants, including, without limitation, chemicals and other substances that currently do not have any regulatorystandard
 in  drinking  water  or  have  been  recently  created  or  discovered  (including  by  means  of  scientific  achievements  in  the  analysis  and  detection  of  traceamounts
 of  substances).  Examples  of  sources  of  emerging  contaminants  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  newly  created  chemical  compounds  (including,  forexample,
 manufactured nanomaterials); human and veterinary products; perfluorinated and polyfluorinated compounds, including PFNA, PFOA and other PFAS;bacteria,
 microbes,  viruses,  amoebae  and  other  pathogens;  and  residual  by-products  of  disinfection.  We  rely  upon  governmental  agencies  to  set  appropriateregulatory
 standards to protect the public from these and other contaminants, and our role is to provide service that meets these standards, if any. In some of ourstates,
 PUCs may disapprove of cost recovery, in whole or in part, for implementation of treatment infrastructure for an emerging contaminant in the absence of aregulatory
 standard. Furthermore, given the rapid pace at which emerging contaminants are being created and/or discovered, we may not be able to detect and/ormitigate
 all such substances in our drinking water system or supplies, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operationsand
 reputation.  In  addition,  we  believe  emerging  contaminants  may  form  the  basis  for  additional  or  increased  federal  or  state  regulatory  initiatives  andrequirements in the fu
ture, which could significantly increase the cost of our operations.Limitations on availability of water supplies or restrictions on our use of
 water supplies as a result of government regulation or action may adversely affect ouraccess to sources of water, our ability to suppl
y water to customers or the demand for our water services.Our ability to meet the existing and future demand of our customers depen
ds on the availability of an adequate supply of water. As a general rule, sources ofpublic
 water supply, including rivers, lakes, streams and groundwater aquifers, are held in the public trust and are not owned by private interests. As a result, wetypically
 do  not  own  the  water  that  we  use  in  our  operations,  and  the  availability  of  our  water  supply  is  established  through  allocation  rights  (determined  bylegislation
 or court decisions) and passing-flow requirements set by governmental entities. Passing-flow requirements set minimum volumes of water that mustpass through specified
 water sources, such as rivers and streams, in order to maintain environmental habitats and meet water allocation rights of downstream users.Allocation rights are
 imposed to ensure sustainability of major water sources and passing-flow requirements are most often imposed on source waters from smallerrivers,
 lakes and streams. These requirements, which can change from time to time, and vary by state or region, may adversely impact our water supply. Supplyissues,
 such as drought, overuse of sources of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats, contamination or other factors may limit the availability ofground and surface water.
For example, in
 our Monterey County, California operations, we are seeking to augment our sources of water supply, principally to comply with an October20,
 2009 cease and desist order (the “2009 Order”), as amended by an order in July 2016 (the “2016 Order”), of the SWRCB that requires California-AmericanWater
 Company, our wholly owned subsidiary (“Cal Am”), to significantly decrease its diversions from the Carmel River in accordance with a reduction schedulethat
 terminates on December 31, 2021 (the “2021 Deadline”). We are also required to augment our Monterey County sources of water supply to comply with therequirements
 of the Endangered Species Act. We cannot predict whether Cal Am will be able to secure alternative sources of water, or if Cal Am will be exposedto
 liabilities if it is unable to meet the 2021 Deadline under the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order. If Cal Am or any of our other subsidiaries are unable to secure analternative
 source of water, or if other adverse consequences result from the events described above, our business, financial condition, results of operations andcash flows could be adversely a
ffected. See Item 3—Legal Proceedings —Alternative Water Supply in Lieu  of Carmel River Diversions, which includes additionalinformation regarding 
this matter.The
 current regulatory rate setting process may result in a significant delay, also known as “regulatory lag,” from the time that we invest in infrastructureimprovements,
 incur increased operating expenses or experience declining water usage, to the time at which we can seek to address these events in rate caseapplications; our inability to mini
mize regulatory lag could adversely affect our business.There
 is typically a delay, known as “regulatory lag,” between the time one of our regulated subsidiaries makes a capital investment or incurs an operatingexpense
 increase and the time when those costs are reflected in rates. In addition, billings permitted by state PUCs typically are, to a considerable extent, based onthe
 volume of water usage in addition to a minimum base rate. Thus, we may experience regulatory lag between the time our revenues are affected by decliningusage
 and the time we are able to adjust the rate per gallon of usage to address declining usage. Our inability to reduce regulatory lag could have an adverse effecton our financial condition, 
results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.20

Table of ContentsWe
 endeavor  to  reduce  regulatory  lag  by  pursuing  constructive  regulatory  policies.  For  example,  three  of  our  states  have  approved  revenue  stabilitymechanisms
 that adjust rates periodically to ensure that a utility’s revenue will be sufficient to cover its costs regardless of sales volume, including recognition ofdeclining
 sales resulting from reduced consumption, while providing an incentive for customers to use water more efficiently. In addition, ten of our state PUCspermit
 rates to be adjusted outside of the general rate case application process through surcharges that address certain capital investments, such as replacement ofaging
 infrastructure.  These  surcharges  are  adjusted  periodically  based  on  factors  such  as  project  completion  or  future  budgeted  expenditures,  and  specificsurcharges are
 eliminated once the related capital investment is incorporated in new PUC approved rates. Furthermore, in setting rates, ten of our state PUCs allowus
 to use future test years, which extend beyond the date a rate request is filed to allow for current or projected revenues, expenses and investments to be reflectedin rates on a more timely basis. Other examples of such programs include states that allo
w us to increase rates for certain cost increases that are beyond our control,such
 as purchased water costs, property or other taxes, or power, conservation, chemical or other expenditures. These surcharge mechanisms enable us to adjustrates in less time a
fter costs have been incurred than would be the case under the general rate case application process.While
 these programs have reduced regulatory lag in several of our regulated states, we continue to seek expansion of programs to reduce regulatory lag inthose
 jurisdictions that have not approved such programs. Furthermore, PUCs may fail to adopt new surcharge programs and existing programs may not continuein
 their current form, or at all. Although we intend to continue our efforts to expand state PUC approval of surcharges to address issues of regulatory lag, ourefforts
 may not be successful, or even if successful they may not completely address our regulatory lag, in which case our business, financial condition, results ofoperations, cash flo
ws and liquidity may be materially and adversely affected.Changes in laws
 and regulations and changes in certain agreements can significantly affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flowsand liquidity.
New
 legislation, regulations, government policies or court decisions, including, without limitation with respect to federal and state income and other taxlaws,
 can  materially  affect  our  operations,  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows.  The  individuals  who  serve  as  regulators  are  elected  or  political  appointees.Therefore,
 elections which result in a change of political administration or new appointments may also result in changes in the individuals who serve as regulatorsand
 the policies of the regulatory agencies that they serve. New laws or regulations, new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, changes in agency policy,including
 those made in response to shifts in public opinion, or conditions imposed during the regulatory hearing process could have the following consequences,among others:
•
making it more diffi cult for us to increase our rates and, as a consequence, to recover our costs or earn our expected rates of return;•
changing the determina tion of the costs, or the amount of costs, that would be considered recoverable in rate cases;•
restricting  our  ability  to  terminate  our  services  to  customers  who  owe  us  money  for  services  previously  provided  or  limiting  our  bill  collectionefforts;
•
requiring us to provide water o r wastewater services at reduced rates to certain customers;•
limiting  or restricting our ability to acquire water or wastewater systems, purchase or dispose of assets or issue securities, or making it less cost-effective for us to do so;
•
negatively  impacting the deductibility of expenses under federal or state tax laws, the amount of tax credits or tax abatement benefits that may beavailable, the amount o
f taxes owed, or the ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards;•
changing regulations that affect the benefits we expected to receive when we began offering services in a particular area;•
increasing the costs assoc iated with complying with environmental, health, safety and water quality regulations to which our operations are subject;•
changing or placing addition al limitations on change in control requirements relating to any concentration of ownership of our common stock;•
making  it easier for governmental entities to convert our assets to public ownership via condemnation, eminent domain or other similar process, orfor governmental agenc
ies or private plaintiffs to assess liability against us for damages under these or similar processes;•
placing  limitations, prohibitions or other requirements with respect to the sharing of information and participation in transactions by or between aregulated subsidiary and us or ou
r other affiliates, including Service Company and any of our other subsidiaries;•
restricting or prohibiting  our extraction of water from rivers, streams, reservoirs or aquifers; and•
revoking or altering the terms of the CPCN issued to us by state PUCs.21

Table of ContentsAny of the foregoing consequences cou
ld have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.In
 addition, new Federal, state and local laws, changes in existing laws, rules or regulations, or administrative interpretations thereof, could impact us. OnDecember
 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law, which, among other things, enacted significant and complex changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, asamended
 (the “Code”), including a reduction in the maximum U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as of January 1, 2018, and certain otherprovisions related specifically to the public utility industry, including continuati
on of interest expense deductibility, the exclusion from utilizing bonus depreciationand the
 normalization of deferred income taxes. The enactment of the TCJA required re-measurement of our deferred income taxes, which materially impacted our2017
 results  of  operations  and  financial  position  and  had  a  lesser  impact  on  our  2018  results  of  operations  and  financial  position.  During  2018,  all  of  our  14jurisdictions
 subject to economic regulation opened formal proceedings related to the TCJA, and proceedings presently remain open in three of  them. Further, theregulatory treatment of the re-measured deferred
 income taxes remains open in a number of these jurisdictions. At this time, we cannot predict the impacts on us ofthe
 regulatory treatment of the TCJA in these open proceedings or matters, or of the enactment or adoption of any Related Interpretations, if and when issued.Moreover,
 we are unable to determine or predict the potential impacts, if any, of any other new or amended laws, rules or regulations, or interpretations thereof, tothe extent they may be ul
timately enacted, adopted or issued, on us or our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.Service
 disruptions caused by severe weather conditions, climate variability patterns or natural disasters may disrupt our operations or reduce the demand forour water services, which could adversely aff
ect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.Service
 interruptions  due  to  severe  weather,  climate  variability  patterns  and  other  natural  events  are  possible  across  all  our  businesses.  These  include,among
 other things, storms, freezing conditions, high wind conditions, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, landslides, drought, wildfires, coastal and intercoastalfloods
 or high water conditions, including those in or near designated flood plains, severe electrical storms and solar flares. Weather and other natural events suchas
 these  may  affect  the  condition  or  operability  of  our  facilities,  limiting  or  preventing  us  from  delivering  water  or  wastewater  services  to  our  customers,  orrequiring
 us to make substantial capital expenditures to repair any damage. Tariffs in place or cost recovery proceedings with respect to our Regulated Businessesmay not provide reimburse
ment to us, in whole or in part, for any of these impacts.Government
 restrictions on water use may also result in decreased use of water services, even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers,which
 may  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows.  Seasonal  drought  conditions  that  may  impact  our  water  services  arepossible
 across all of our service areas. Governmental restrictions imposed in response to a drought may apply to all systems within a region independent of thesupply
 adequacy of any individual system. As examples, drought conditions had persisted in California over a five-year period, and had been declared in NewJersey
 in 2016. In 2017, these droughts were declared concluded, but other droughts that may occur from time to time may result in the imposition of voluntary ormandatory
 water use targets, rationing restrictions, water conservation regulations, and requirements to minimize water system leaks. While expenses incurred inimplementing
 water conservation and rationing plans may generally be recoverable provided the relevant PUC determines they were reasonable and prudent, wecannot
 assure  that  any  such  expenses  incurred  will,  in  fact,  be  fully  recovered.  Moreover,  reductions  in  water  consumption,  including  those  resulting  frominstallation of
 equipment or changed consumer behavior, may persist even after drought restrictions are repealed and the drought has ended, which could adverselyaffect our business, finan
cial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Climate
 variability may cause increased volatility in weather and may impact water usage and related revenue or require additional expenditures, all of whichmay not be fully recoverable 
in rates or otherwise.The
 issue of climate variability is receiving increasing attention nationally and worldwide. Some scientific experts are predicting a worsening of weathervolatility in the
 future associated with climate variability. Many climate variability predictions, if true, present several potential challenges to water and wastewaterutilities, such as:
•
increased frequency and du ration of droughts;•
increased precipit ation and flooding;•
increased frequency and s everity of storms and other weather events;•
challenges associated wit h changes in temperature or increases in ocean levels;•
potential degradation o f water quality;•
decreases in availab le water supply and changes in water usage patterns;•
increases in disruptions in s ervice;22

Table of Contents•
increased costs to repair damaged facilities; or•
increased  costs to reduce risks associated with the increasing frequency of natural events, including to improve the resiliency and reliability of ourwater production and delive
ry facilities and systems.Because
 of the uncertainty of weather volatility related to climate variability, we cannot predict its potential impact on our business, financial condition,results
 of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Although some or all potential expenditures and costs with respect to our Regulated Businesses could be recoveredthrough
 rates, infrastructure replacement surcharges or other regulatory mechanisms, there can be no assurance that state PUCs would authorize rate increases toenable us to recover such exp
enditures and costs, in whole or in part.A
 loss  of  one  or  more  large  industrial  customers  could  have  a  material  adverse  impact  upon  the  results  of  operations  of  one  or  more  of  our  RegulatedBusinesses.
Adverse
 economic conditions or other factors can cause our customers, particularly industrial customers, to curtail operations. A curtailment of operationsby
 an industrial customer would typically result in reduced water usage by that customer. In more severe circumstances, the decline in usage could be permanent.Any decrease
 in demand resulting from difficult economic conditions affecting these industrial customers could adversely affect our financial condition and resultsof operations. Tariffs in p
lace with respect to our Regulated Businesses may not reimburse us, in whole or in part, for any of these impacts.Our 
Regulated  Businesses require  significant  capital  expenditures  and  may  suffer  if  we  fail  to  secure  appropriate  funding  to  make  investments,  or  if  weexperience delays in comple
ting major capital expenditure projects.The
 water and wastewater utility business is capital intensive. We invest significant amounts of capital to add, replace and maintain property, plant andequipment, and to
 improve aging infrastructure. In 2018 , we invested $1.5 billion in  net Company-funded capital improvements. The level of capital expendituresnecessary
 to maintain the integrity  of our systems will continue into the future and may increase. We expect to fund capital improvement projects  using cashgenerated
 from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper programs and issuances of long-term debt. We may not be able toaccess
 our revolving credit facility or the commercial paper, long-term debt and equity capital markets, when necessary or desirable to fund capital improvementson
 favorable terms or at all. If we are not able to obtain sufficient financing, we could be unable to maintain our existing property, plant and equipment, fund ourcapital
 investment  strategies,  meet  our  growth  targets  and  expand  our  rate  base  to  enable  us  to  earn  satisfactory  future  returns  on  our  investments.  Even  withadequate
 financial resources to make required capital expenditures, we face the additional risk that we will not complete our major capital projects on time, as aresult
 of construction delays, permitting delays, labor shortages or other disruptions, environmental restrictions, or other obstacles. Each of these outcomes couldadversely affect our 
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Seasonality could adversely affe
ct the volume of water sold and our revenues.The
 volume of water we sell during the warmer months, typically in the summer, is generally greater than during other months, due primarily to increasedwater usage for irriga
tion systems, swimming pools, cooling systems and other applications. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer months,the
 volume of water sold tends to vary with temperature, rainfall levels and rainfall frequency. In the event that temperatures during the typically warmer monthsare cooler than norma
l, or if there is more rainfall than normal, the amount of water we sell may decrease and adversely affect our revenues.Three
 of our jurisdictions, California, Illinois, and New York, have adopted revenue stability mechanisms that permit us to collect state PUC-authorizedrevenue for a
 given period, which is not tied to the volume of water sold during that period. Revenue stability mechanisms are designed to allow utilities to recoverthe fixed cost
 of operations while supporting water conservation goals. In those jurisdictions that have not adopted a revenue stability mechanism, operating resultscould continue to be affe
cted by seasonality.Regulatory and environmental risks associated with the co
llection, treatment and disposal of wastewater may impose significant costs.The
 wastewater collection, treatment and disposal operations of our subsidiaries are subject to substantial regulation and involve environmental risks. Ifcollection,
 treatment or disposal systems fail, overflow, or do not operate properly, untreated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby propertiesor
 into nearby streams and rivers, causing damage to persons or property, injury to aquatic life and economic damages. This risk is most acute during periods ofsubstantial
 rainfall  or  flooding,  which  are  the  main  causes  of  sewer  overflow  and  system  failure.  Liabilities  resulting  from  such  damage  could  adversely  andmaterially aff
ect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.23

Table of ContentsContamination
 of  water  supplies  or  our  water  service  provided  to  our  customers  could  result  in  service  limitations  and  interruptions  and  exposure  tosubstances
 not typically found in potable water supplies, and could subject us and our subsidiaries to reductions in usage and other responsive obligations,government enforcement actions, damage 
to our reputation and private litigation.The
 water  supplies  that  flow  into  our  treatment  plants  or  are  delivered  through  our  distribution  system,  or  the  water  service  that  is  provided  to  ourcustomers, may be subject 
to contamination, including, among other items, contamination from naturally-occurring compounds, chemicals in groundwater systems,pollution
 resulting from man-made sources (such as perchlorate, methyl tertiary butyl ether, lead and other materials, chemical spills or other accidents that resultin
 contaminants entering the water source), and possible terrorist attacks. In addition, new categories of these substances continue to emerge in the water industry.If
 one of our water supplies or the water service provided to our customers is contaminated, depending on the nature of the contamination, we may have to takeresponsive
 actions  that  could  include,  among  other  things  (1)  continuing  limited  use  of  the  water  supply  under  a  “Do  Not  Use”  protective  order  that  enablescontinuation
 of basic sanitation and essential fire protection, or (2) interrupting the use of that water supply. If service is disrupted, our financial condition, resultsof
 operations, cash flows, liquidity and reputation may be adversely affected. In addition, we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated sourcethrough
 the expansion of our current treatment facilities or the development of new sources of supply or new treatment methods. We may be unable to recovercosts
 associated with treating or decontaminating water supplies through insurance, customer rates, tariffs or contract terms. Any recovery of these costs that weare
 able to obtain through regulatory proceedings or otherwise may not occur in a timely manner. Moreover, we could be subject to claims for damages arisingfrom
 government enforcement actions or toxic tort or other lawsuits arising out of an interruption of service or human exposure to hazardous substances in ourdrinking water and water suppli
es.Since
 we  engage  in  the  business  of  providing  water  service  to  our  customers,  contamination  of  the  water  supply,  or  the  water  service  provided  to  ourcustomers,
 could result in substantial injury or damage to our customers, employees or others and we could be exposed to substantial claims and litigation. Suchclaims
 could relate to, among other things, personal injury, loss of life, business interruption, property damage, pollution, and environmental damage and may bebrought by
 our customers or third parties. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur, andwe
 may not be protected from these claims or negative impacts therefrom in whole or in part by tariffs or other contract terms. Negative impacts to our reputationmay
 occur even if we are not liable for any contamination or other environmental damage or the consequences arising out of human exposure to contamination orhazardous
 substances in the water or water supplies. In addition, insurance coverage may not cover all or a portion of these losses, and are subject to deductiblesand
 other limitations. Pending or future claims against us could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cashflows.
We may sustain losses that exceed or are ex
cluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are self-insured.We
 maintain  insurance  coverage  as  part  of  our  overall  legal  and  risk  management  strategy  to  minimize  potential  liabilities  arising  from  our  utilityoperations,
 as well as the operations of our Market-Based  Businesses .  Our insurance programs have varying coverage limits,  exclusions and maximums, andinsurance
 companies  may  seek  to  deny  claims  we  might  make.  Generally,  our  insurance  policies  cover  property  damage,  worker’s  compensation,  employer’sliability,
 general liability, cybersecurity, terrorism risks and automobile liability. Each policy includes deductibles or self-insured retentions and policy limits forcovered claims. As a resul
t, we may sustain losses that exceed or that are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are self-insured.Although
 in the past we have been generally able to obtain insurance coverage related to our business, there can be no assurance that we can secure allnecessary
 or appropriate insurance in the future, or that such insurance can be economically secured. For example, catastrophic events can result in decreasedcoverage limits, more limited co
verage, increased premium costs or deductibles.We
 are subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks, which make us vulnerable to negative customer perception and could lead to increased regulatoryoversight or sanctions.
Water
 and wastewater utilities, including our regulated subsidiaries and our Market-Based  Businesses ,  have a large direct and indirect customer base and,as
 a result, are exposed to public criticism regarding, among other things, the reliability of their water, wastewater and related or ancillary services, the quality ofwater
 provided, and the amount, timeliness, accuracy and format of bills that are provided for such services. Adverse publicity and negative consumer sentimentmay render legislatures and other governing bodies, state P
UCs and other regulatory authorities, and government officials less likely to view us in a favorable light,and
 may cause us to be susceptible to less favorable legislative, regulatory and economic outcomes, as well as increased regulatory or other oversight and morestringent
 regulatory or economic requirements. Unfavorable regulatory and economic outcomes may include the enactment of more stringent laws and regulationsgoverning
 our  operations  and  less  favorable  economic  terms  in  our  agreements  related  to  our Market-Based  Businesses ,  as  well  as  fines,  penalties  or  othersanctions or requiremen
ts. The imposition of any of the foregoing could have a material negative impact on us and our financial condition, results of operations andcash flows.

Table of ContentsNew
 York American Water Company, Inc. (“NYAW”) has been the subject of a New York State Public Service Commission (“NYSPSC”) investigationrelated
 to the unintentional provision of incorrect data to a taxing authority that resulted in an over-assessment of real property taxes. NYAW self-reported thisissue
 to the NYSPSC promptly after NYAW’s senior leadership became aware of it. Neither NYAW nor any of its employees received any financial benefit as aresult
 of this matter, as all customer overpayments were provided to the local taxing authorities. The NYSPSC investigation also related to the failure of a fewemployees
 working on NYAW’s 2016 general rate case to properly disclose these issues in that rate case. On September 11, 2018, the Supreme Court of the Stateof
 New  York,  Albany  County,  approved  a  settlement  of  these  matters,  and  NYAW  is  cooperating  with  the  NYSDPS  to  implement  its  terms.  As  part  of  thesettlement,
 NYAW agreed that it would provide up to $4.5 million to benefit NYAW customers through several different mechanisms, which amounts would notbe
 recoverable in rates. NYAW also agreed to accelerate the timing of the payment of approximately $6.4 million in aggregate customer credits. Finally, NYAWagreed
 to engage and cooperate with an independent monitor through September 30, 2021. While the settlement resolves the NYSPSC’s investigation involvingNYAW and those matters set forth above, there
 can be no assurance that NYAW will not be subject to additional federal, state or local proceedings regarding theseand
 other related matters, and these proceedings could result in increased oversight and civil, administrative and/or criminal sanctions, which may have a materialadverse effect upon our r
eputation and perception.Unfavorable
 regulatory and economic outcomes also may include the enactment of more stringent laws and regulations governing our operations and lessfavorable
 economic terms in our agreements related to our Market-Based Businesses, as well as fines, penalties or other sanctions or requirements. The impositionof any of the foregoing could hav
e a material negative impact on us and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The
 failure of, or the requirement to repair, upgrade or dismantle, any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cashflows and liquidity.
The
 properties of our Regulated  Businesses segment  include 80 dams, the majority of which are earthen dams, and the failure of any of which could resultin
 personal injury and property damage, including without limitation downstream property damage, for which we may be liable. The failure of a dam would alsoadversely
 affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Any
 losses or liabilities incurred due to a failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates, and such losses maymake it difficult for us to
 secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future.We
 also are required from time to time to decommission, repair or upgrade the dams that we own. The cost of such repairs or upgrades can be and has beenmaterial.
 The federal and state agencies that regulate our operations may adopt rules and regulations requiring us to dismantle our dams, which also could entailmaterial
 costs. Although in most cases, the PUC has permitted recovery of expenses and capital investment related to dam rehabilitation, we might not be able torecover
 costs of repairs, upgrades or dismantling through rates in the future. The inability to recover these costs or delayed recovery of the costs as a result ofregulatory lag can af
fect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.Any
 failure of our network of water and wastewater pipes and water reservoirs could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition andreputation.
Our
 operating subsidiaries distribute water and collect wastewater through an extensive network of pipes and storage systems located across the UnitedStates.
 A  failure  of  major  pipes  or  reservoirs  could  result  in  injuries,  property  and  other  damage  for  which  we  may  be  liable.  The  failure  of  major  pipes  andreservoirs
 may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our network in order to conduct repairs. Such failures and shutdowns may limit ourability
 to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water and wastewater delivery requirements prescribed by government regulators,including
 state PUCs with jurisdiction over our operations, and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and reputation.Any
 business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates, and such losses may make it difficult for us tosecure
 insurance at acceptable rates in the future. Moreover, to the extent such business interruptions or other losses are not covered by insurance, they may not berecovered through rate 
adjustments.An
 important  part  of  our  growth  strategy  is  the  acquisition  of  water  and  wastewater  systems,  which  involves  risks,  including  competition  for  acquisitionopportunities from other regulated utili
ties, governmental entities and other buyers, that may hinder or limit our ability to grow our business.An important element
 of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems in order to broaden our current, and move into new, serviceareas.
 We may not be able to acquire other systems or businesses if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities or reach mutually agreeable terms withacquisition
 candidates. Further, competition for acquisition opportunities from other regulated utilities, governmental entities, and other buyers may hinder ourability to expand our business.
25

Table of ContentsThe
 negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired systems or businesses with our existing operations could require us to incursignificant costs and caus
e diversion of our management’s time and resources. Future acquisitions by us could result in, among other things:•
incurrence  or assumption of debt, contingent liabilities and environmental liabilities of or with respect to an acquired business, including liabilitiesthat were unknown at the time o
f acquisition;•
failure to recover acquisition premiums;•
unanticipated capit al expenditures;•
failure to maintain effective internal c ontrol over financial reporting;•
recording goodwill and other in tangible assets at values that ultimately may be subject to impairment charges;•
fluctuations in quarte rly results;•
unanticipated acquisi tion-related expenses;•
failure to reali ze anticipated benefits, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements; and•
difficulties in assi milating personnel, benefits, services and systems.Some
 or all of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business. The systems and businesses we acquire in the future may not achieveanticipated
 sales and profitability or other perceived synergies, and any difficulties we encounter in the integration process could interfere with our operations,reduce our operating ma
rgins and adversely affect our internal control over financial reporting.We
 compete with governmental entities, other regulated utilities, and strategic and financial buyers for acquisition opportunities. If consolidation becomesmore
 prevalent in the water and wastewater industries and competition for acquisitions increases, the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase andlimit our ability to 
expand through acquisitions.Our 
Regulated  Businesses are  subject  to  condemnation  and  other  proceedings  through  eminent  domain  or  other  similar  authorized  process,  which  couldmaterially and adversely af
fect their results of operations and financial condition.Municipalities
 and other government subdivisions have historically been involved in the provision of water and wastewater services in the United States,and
 organized efforts may arise from time to time in one or more of the service areas in which our Regulated  Businesses operate  to convert our assets to publicownership
 and  operation  through  exercise  of  the  governmental  power  of  eminent  domain,  or  another  similar  authorized  process.  If  a  municipality  or  othergovernment
 subdivision or a citizen group seeks to acquire our assets through eminent domain or such other process, either directly or indirectly as a result of acitizen petition, we m
ay resist the acquisition.For example, on November 27, 2018, M
onterey, California ballot Measure J was certified as having been approved by a public vote, requiring the MPWMDto
 conduct a feasibility study and submit a written plan concerning the feasibility of a potential purchase of our California subsidiary’s Monterey water serviceassets
 without an additional public vote. Also, five municipalities in the Chicago, Illinois area formed a water agency that filed an eminent domain lawsuit againstour
 Illinois subsidiary in January 2013, seeking to condemn a water pipeline that serves those five municipalities. See Item 1—Business—Regulated Businesses— Condemnation and Eminent Domain 
, which includes additional in formation regarding these matters.Furthermore,
 the  law  in  certain  jurisdictions  in  which  our Regulated  Businesses operate  provides  for  eminent  domain  rights  allowing  private  propertyowners
 to file a lawsuit to seek just compensation against a public utility, if the public utility’s infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause ofdamage
 to that property. In these actions, the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently. In California, most recently, lawsuits havebeen filed
 in connection with large-scale natural events such as wildfires. Some have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities triggered the naturalevent
 that resulted in damage to the property. In some cases, the PUC has disallowed recovery in rates of losses incurred by these utilities as a result of suchlawsuits.
Contesting an
 exercise of condemnation, eminent domain or other similar process, or responding to a citizen petition, may result in costly legal proceedingsand
 may divert the attention of management. Moreover, our efforts to resist the condemnation, eminent domain or other process may not be successful, which mayrequire
 us to sell the operations at issue in a condemnation proceeding or to pay a private property owner compensation for the property damage suffered. If amunicipality
 or  other  government  subdivision  succeeds  in  acquiring  the  assets  of  one  or  more  of  our Regulated  Businesses through  eminent  domain  or  otherprocess,
 there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for the business, that we will not be able to keep the compensation, or that we will not beable
 to divest the business without incurring significant charges. Any of these outcomes may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,financial condition, c
ash flows and liquidity.26

Table of ContentsWe
 rely on technology systems to facilitate the management of our business and customer and supplier relationships, and a disruption of these systems couldadversely affect our business.
Our
 technology systems are an integral part of our business, and any disruption of these systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operateour
 business efficiently, which, in turn, could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and adversely affect our results of operations. For example, wedepend
 on  these  systems  to  bill  customers,  process  orders,  provide  customer  service,  manage  certain  plant  operations  and  construction  projects,  manage  ourfinancial
 records, track assets, remotely monitor certain of our plants and facilities and manage human resources, supply chain, inventory and accounts receivablecollections.
Although
 we do not believe that these systems are at a materially greater risk of failure than other similar organizations, our technology systems remainvulnerable to damage or 
interruption from:•
power loss, computer systems fa ilures, and internet, telecommunications or data network failures;•
operator error or imp roper operation by, the negligent or improper supervision of, or the intentional acts of, employees and contractors;•
physical and electroni c loss of customer or employee data due to security breaches, cyber attacks, hacking, denial of services action, misappropriationof data or other property 
and similar events;•
computer viruses; and •
severe weather and other events, including without limitation, hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, floods, earthquakes and other disasters.These
 events may result in physical and electronic loss of customer, employee or financial data, security breaches, misappropriation of property and otheradverse consequences. In
 addition, a lack of or inadequate levels of redundancy for certain of these systems, including billing systems, could exacerbate the impactof
 any of these events on us. We may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our business, andwe
 might lack sufficient resources  to make the necessary upgrades or replacements  of outdated existing technology to enable us to continue to operate  at ourcurrent
 level of efficiency. Any or all of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cashflows.
We may be subject to physical and/or c
yber attacks.As
 operators of critical  infrastructure,  we may face a heightened risk of physical and/or cyber attacks from internal or external sources. Our water andwastewater
 systems may be vulnerable to disability or failures as a result of physical or cyber attacks, acts of war or terrorism, vandalism or other causes. Ouroperational
 technology and IT systems throughout our businesses may be vulnerable to unauthorized external or internal access, due to hacking, viruses, acts ofwar
 or terrorism, and other causes. Unauthorized access to confidential information located or stored on these systems could negatively and materially impact ourcustomers,
 employees, suppliers and other third parties. Further, third parties, including vendors, suppliers and contractors, who perform certain services for us oradminister
 and maintain our sensitive information, could also be targets of cyber attacks and unauthorized access. While we have instituted safeguards to protectour
 operational technology and IT systems, those safeguards may not always be effective due to the evolving nature of cyber attacks and cyber vulnerabilities. Wecannot guarantee that su
ch protections will be completely successful in the event of a cyber attack.If,
 despite our security measures, a significant physical attack or cyber breach occurred, our operations could be disrupted, property damaged, and customerand
 other confidential information lost or stolen; experience substantial loss of revenues, response costs and other financial loss; suffer a loss of management time,attention
 and resources from our regular business operations; and be subject to increased regulation, litigation, and damage to our reputation, any of which couldhave
 a negative impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows. Experiencing a cyber security incident could also cause us to be non-compliant withapplicable
 laws and regulations or contracts that require us to securely maintain confidential data, causing us to incur costs related to legal claims or proceedingsand regulatory fines or pen
alties. These types of events, either impacting our facilities or the industry in general, could also cause us to incur additional security andinsurance related costs.
In
 addition,  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business,  we  collect  and  retain  sensitive  information,  including  personally  identifiable  information,  about  ourcustomers
 and employees. In many cases, we outsource administration of certain functions to vendors that could be targets of cyber attacks. Any theft, loss and/orfraudulent
 use  of  customer,  employee  or  proprietary  data  as  a  result  of  a  cyber  attack  could  subject  us  to  significant  litigation,  liability  and  costs,  as  well  asadversely impact our r
eputation with customers and regulators, among others.27

Table of ContentsWe
 have obtained cyber insurance to provide coverage for a portion of the losses and damages that may result from a security breach of our IT systems, butsuch
 insurance is subject to a number of exclusions and may not cover the total loss or damage caused by a breach. The market for cybersecurity insurance isrelatively
 new and coverage available for cybersecurity events may evolve as the industry matures. In the future, adequate insurance may not be available at ratesthat we believe are r
easonable, and the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident may not be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates.Our inability to efficientl
y upgrade and improve our operational technology and IT systems, or implement new systems, could result in higher than expectedcosts or otherwise adversely impac
t our internal controls environment, operations and profitability.Upgrades
 and improvements to computer systems and networks, or the implementation of new systems, may require substantial amounts of management’stime
 and financial resources to complete, and may also result in system or network defects or operational errors due to multiple factors, including employees’ability to effect
ively use the new or upgraded system. We continue to implement technology to improve our business processes and customer interactions, and haveinstalled
 new, and upgraded existing, technology systems. These efforts support our broader strategic initiatives and are intended to improve our operations andenhance
 our customer service capabilities. Any technical or other difficulties in upgrading and improving existing or implementing new technology systems mayincrease
 costs beyond those anticipated and have an adverse or disruptive effect on our operations and reporting processes, including our internal control overfinancial
 reporting. We may also experience difficulties integrating current systems with new or upgraded systems, which may impact our ability to serve ourcustomers
 effectively or efficiently. Although we make efforts to minimize any adverse impact on our controls, business and operations, we cannot assure that allsuch impacts
 have been or will be mitigated, and any such impacts could harm our business (individually or collectively) and have a material adverse effect on ourresults of operations, fin
ancial condition and cash flows.Our
 business has inherently dangerous workplaces. If we fail to maintain safe work sites, we may experience workforce injuries or loss of life, and be exposedto financial losses, including penalties and other l
iabilities.Our
 safety record is critical to our reputation. We maintain health and safety standards to protect our employees, customers, contractors, vendors and thepublic.
 Although we intend to adhere to such health and safety standards and aim for zero injuries, it is extremely difficult to avoid all accidents or other safetyincidents at all times.
Our
 business sites, including construction and maintenance sites, often put our employees, contractors and others in close proximity with large pieces ofequipment,
 moving vehicles, pressurized water, underground trenches and vaults, chemicals and other regulated materials. On many sites we are responsible forsafety
 and, accordingly, must implement safety procedures. If we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective or are notfollowed
 by our employees or others, our employees, contractors and others may be injured or die. Unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employeeturnover,
 expose us to litigation and raise our operating costs. Any of the foregoing could result in financial losses, which could have a material adverse impact onour business, financial condi
tion, results of operations and cash flows.In
 addition,  our  operations  can  involve  the  delivery,  handling  and  storage  of  hazardous  chemicals,  which,  if  improperly  delivered,  handled,  stored  ordisposed of, could result in serious injury, death or
 property damage, and could subject us to penalties or other liabilities. We are also subject to regulations dealingwith
 occupational health and safety. Although we maintain functional employee groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health, safety,and
 environmental work procedures throughout our organization, including construction sites and maintenance sites, the failure to comply with such regulations orprocedures could subject us to 
liability.Work stoppages and other labor relations matters could adv
ersely affect our results of operations.As of 
December  31, 2018 , approximately 49% of  our workforce was represented by unions, and we had 70 collective bargaining agreements in place with15 
different unions representing our unionized employees. These collective bargaining agreements, including 20 which expired in 2018 , and 18 which will expireduring 
2019 , are  subject to periodic renewal and renegotiation. We may not be able to successfully renew or renegotiate these labor contracts on terms that are fairto
 us. Any negotiations or dispute resolution processes undertaken in connection with our labor contracts could be delayed or affected by labor actions or workstoppages.
 Labor  actions,  work  stoppages  or  the  threat  of  work  stoppages,  and  our  failure  to  obtain  favorable  labor  contract  terms  during  renegotiations,  maydisrupt
 our operations and result in higher labor costs, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Whilewe
 have developed contingency plans to be implemented as necessary if a work stoppage or strike does occur, a strike or work stoppage may have a materialadverse impact on our fin
ancial position, results of operations and cash flows.28

Table of ContentsOur continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utiliz
e qualified personnel.The
 success  of our business is dependent upon our ability  to hire, retain,  and utilize  qualified  personnel, including engineers,  licensed  operators,  waterquality
 and other operating and craft personnel, and management professionals who have the required experience and expertise. From time to time, it may bedifficult
 to  attract  and  retain  qualified  individuals  with  the  expertise  and  in  the  timeframe  demanded  for  our  business  needs.  In  certain  geographic  areas,  forexample, we may not be able 
to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel.In
 addition, as some of our key personnel approach retirement age, we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implementsuch plans. If we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate successi
on plans, it could have a material adverse impact on ourbusiness, financial condit
ion, results of operations and cash flows.Financial and Market-Related Risks
Our indebtedness could affect
 our business adversely and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business, and we may be unable to generatesufficient cash flows to satisfy our liquid
ity needs.As
 of December  31, 2018 ,  our aggregate long-term and short-term debt balance (including preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements) was$8.6
 billion ,  and  our  working  capital  (defined  as  current  assets  less  current  liabilities)  was  in  a  deficit  position.  Our  indebtedness  could  have  importantconsequences, including:
•
limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital requirements or capital expenditures;•
exposing us to interest rat e risk with respect to the portion of our indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates;•
limiting our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or make payments in connection with our other obligations;•
impairing our access to the capital markets for debt and equity;•
requiring  that an increasing portion of our cash flows from operations be dedicated to the payment of the principal and interest on our debt, therebyreducing funds available 
for future operations, dividends on our common stock or capital expenditures;•
limiting  our ability to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and to react to changes in market orindustry conditions; and
•
placing us at a competi tive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that have less debt.In
 order to meet our capital expenditure needs, we may be required to make additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility or issue new short-term
 and long-term  debt securities.  Moreover, additional  borrowings may be required  to refinance  outstanding indebtedness.  Debt maturities  and sinking fundpayments in 
2019 , 2020 and 2021 will be $72 million , $32 million and $303 million , respectively. We can provide no assurance that we  will be able to access thedebt
 capital markets on favorable terms, if at all. Moreover, if new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks we now face could intensify, limitingour ability to refinan
ce existing debt on favorable terms.In an attempt to manage our exposure to interest rate risk associated with our issua
nce of variable and fixed rate debt, we have entered into, and in the futuremay
 enter  into,  financial  derivative  instruments,  including  without  limitation,  interest  rate  swaps,  forward  starting  swaps,  swaptions  and  U.S.  Treasury  lockagreements. See 
Item 7A—Quantitative and  Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk . However,  these efforts may not be effective to fully mitigate interest raterisk,
 and  may  expose  us  to  other  risks  and  uncertainties,  including  quarterly  “mark  to  market”  valuation  risk  associated  with  these  instruments,  that  couldnegatively and mater
ially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We
 will depend primarily on cash flows from operations to fund our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt. Therefore, ourability
 to pay our expenses and satisfy our debt service obligations depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic,competitive, legisl
ative (including tax initiatives and reforms, and other similar legislation or regulation), regulatory and other factors largely beyond our control. Ifwe
 do not have sufficient cash flows to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt,reduce
 capital investments, sell assets, borrow additional funds or sell additional equity. In addition, if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows fromoperations,
 or if we are unable to incur indebtedness sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, we may be unable to plan for or respond to changes in ourbusiness, which could cause our finan
cial condition, operating results and prospects to be affected adversely.29

Table of ContentsOur
 inability to access the capital or financial markets or other events could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability tomeet long-term commi
tments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.In
 addition to cash from operations, we rely primarily on our revolving credit facility, commercial paper programs, and the capital markets to satisfy ourliquidity needs. In this reg
ard, our principal external sources of short-term liquidity are our $2.10 billion commercial paper p rogram and our $2.25 billion revolving credit
 facility.  Our  revolving  credit  facility  expires  in  accordance  with  its  terms  in  March  2023.  We  regularly  use  our  commercial  paper  program  under  thisrevolving
 credit facility as a principal source of short-term borrowing due to the generally more attractive rates we generally can obtain in the commercial papermarket.
 As of December  31, 2018 ,  American Water Capital Corp. (“AWCC”), our wholly owned financing subsidiary, had no outstanding borrowings under therevolving
 credit facility, and had $954  million of  commercial paper outstanding and $81  million in  outstanding letters of credit. There can be no assurance thatAWCC
 will be able  to continue  to access  its commercial  paper  program  or its revolving  credit  facility,  when, as and if desired,  or that  the amount  of capitalavailable thereunder will be
 sufficient to meet all of our liquidity needs at a reasonable, or any, cost.Under
 the terms of our revolving credit facility, our consolidated debt cannot exceed 70% of our consolidated capitalization, as determined under the termsof the credit facility. If our equity were to decline or debt were to increase to a level that caused our debt to exceed this limit, len
ders under the credit facility wouldbe entitled to
 refuse any further extension of credit and to declare all of the outstanding debt under the credit facility immediately due and payable. To avoid such adefault, a waiver or ren
egotiation of this covenant would be required, which would likely increase funding costs and could result in additional covenants that wouldrestrict our operational and
 financing flexibility.Our
 ability to comply with this and other covenants contained in the revolving credit facility and our other consolidated indebtedness is subject to variousrisks
 and uncertainties, including events beyond our control. For example, events that could cause a reduction in equity include, without limitation, a significantwrite-down
 of our goodwill. Even if we are able to comply with this or other covenants, the limitations on our operational and financial flexibility could harm ourbusiness
 by, among other things, limiting our ability to incur indebtedness or reduce equity in connection with financings or other corporate opportunities that wemay believe would be in our best 
interests or the interests of our shareholders to complete.Disruptions in
 the capital markets or changes in our credit ratings could also limit our ability to access capital on terms favorable to us or at all. On January2018, Moody’s Investors Service
 changed its rating outlook from stable to negative for 24 regulated utilities and utility holding companies, including us. While thelending
 banks that participate in our revolving credit facility have met all of their obligations, disruptions in the credit markets, changes in our credit ratings, ordeterioration
 of the banking industry’s financial condition could discourage or prevent lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments, extending theterms
 of such commitments, or agreeing to new commitments. These or other occurrences may cause our lenders to not meet their existing commitments, and wemay
 not be able to access the commercial paper or loan or debt markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all. Furthermore, our inability to maintain,renew or replace commitments
 under this facility could materially increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations andliquidity.
 Longer-term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, including as a result of changes in U.S. tax and other laws, reducedfinancing
 alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our business. Any significantdisruption
 in the capital, debt or credit markets, or financial institution failures could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the market stabilizes oruntil
 alternative financing can be arranged. Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures, reducing or suspending dividend payments, and reducingother discretionary exp
enditures.Any
 of the foregoing events that impede our access to the capital markets, or the failure of any of our lenders to meet their commitments that result fromfinancial market disruptions, could expose us to increased interest expense, req
uire us to institute cash conservation measures or otherwise adversely and materiallyaffect our business, finan
cial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.American
 Water may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable topay upstream dividends or repay funds to American Water.
American
 Water is a holding company and, as such, American Water has no substantive operations of its own. Substantially all of our consolidated assetsare
 held by subsidiaries. American Water’s ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the netincome
 and cash flows of its subsidiaries and their ability to pay upstream dividends to American Water or repay indebtedness to American Water. Prior to payingdividends
 to American Water, American Water’s regulated subsidiaries must comply with applicable regulatory restrictions and financial obligations, including,for
 example, debt service and preferred and preference stock dividends, as well as applicable corporate, tax and other laws and regulations and agreements, andcovenants and other a
greements made or entered into by American Water and its subsidiaries. American Water’s subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have noobligation
 to pay dividends to American Water. A failure or inability of any of these subsidiaries to pay such dividends or repay intercompany obligations couldhave a material adv
erse impact on American Water’s liquidity and its ability to pay dividends on its common stock and meet its other obligations.30

Table of ContentsWe may not be able to fully util
ize our U.S. and state net operating loss carryforwards.As
 of December  31,  2018 ,  we  had  U.S.  federal  and  state  NOL  carryforwards  of  approximately $707  million and $547  million ,  respectively,  andmanagement
 believes it is more likely than not that these NOL carryforwards will be recovered in the future. With the enactment of the TCJA, the Companyanalyzed the impacts o
f the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% on the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities, includingits NOL carryforwards, and as a resu
lt, remeasured those NOL carryforwards as of the date of enactment of the TCJA based on this tax rate change.Our federal
 NOL carryforwards will begin to expire in 2028 ,  and our state NOL carryforwards began to expire in 2019 and will continue to expire through2037.
 We expect to fully utilize our federal NOL balance before it expires, and our ability to do so is primarily dependent upon our ability to generate sufficienttaxable
 income. We have, in the past, been unable to utilize certain of our state NOL carryforwards, and the establishment or increase of a valuation allowance inthe future would reduce our de
ferred income tax assets and our net income.Our
 actual results may differ from those estimated by management in making its assessment as to our ability to use the NOL carryforwards. Moreover,adoption of Related Interpretations with respect to the TCJ
A and other changes in income tax laws, the economy and the general business environment could affectthe
 future utilization  of our NOL carryforwards. If we are unable to fully utilize our NOL carryforwards to offset taxable income generated in the future, ourfinancial position, resu
lts of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill, and we ma
y never realize the full value of our intangible assets, causing us to record impairments that maynegatively affect our results o
f operations.Our
 total assets include $1.6 billion of goodwill at December 31, 2018 .  The goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisition of American Water by anaffiliate
 of our previous owner in 2003, the acquisition of E’town Corporation by a predecessor to our previous owner in 2001, the acquisition of Pivotal in 2018and,
 to a lesser extent, the acquisition of Keystone in 2015. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price the purchaser paid over the fair value of the nettangible
 and  other  intangible  assets  acquired.  Goodwill  is  recorded  at  fair  value  on  the  date  of  an  acquisition  and  is  reviewed  annually  or  more  frequently  ifchanges
 in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. As required by the applicable accounting rules, we have taken significant non-cashcharges to operating resu
lts for goodwill impairments in the past.We
 may  be  required  to  recognize  an  impairment  of  goodwill  in  the  future  due  to  market  conditions  or  other  factors  related  to  our  performance  or  theperformance
 of an acquired business. These market conditions could include a decline over a period of time of our stock price, a decline over a period of time invaluation
 multiples of comparable water utilities, market price performance of our common stock that compares unfavorably to our peer companies, decreases incontrol premiums,
 or, with respect to Keystone, fluctuations in the level of exploration and production activities in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions served byKeystone, a
 prolonged depression of natural gas prices or other factors that negatively impact our current or future forecasts of operating results, cash flows or keyassumptions.
 In this regard, in the third quarter of 2018, we strategically narrowed the scope of the Keystone business solely to water transfer services due tooperational and
 financial challenges in the other businesses of Keystone. As a result of this strategic change, we recorded a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of$57 million 
in the  third quarter of 2018 related to Keystone. See Note 8—Goodwill and  Other Intangible Assets in the  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statementsfor further information.
A
 decline in the results forecasted in our business plan due to events such as changes in rate case results, capital investment budgets or interest rates, couldalso
 result in an impairment charge. Recognition of impairments of goodwill would result in a charge to income in the period in which the impairment occurred,which
 may negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and total capitalization. The effects of any such impairment could be material and couldmake
 it more difficult to maintain our credit ratings, secure financing on attractive terms, maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet the expectations ofour regulators.
Market
 conditions may impact the value of benefit plan assets and liabilities, as well as assumptions related to the benefit plans, which may require us toprovide significant additional funding.
The
 performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy significant future obligations under our pension andpostretirement
 benefit plans. The value of these assets is subject to market fluctuations, which may cause investment returns to fall below our projected returnrates.
 A  decline  in  the  market  value  of  the  pension  and  postretirement  benefit  plan  assets  can  increase  the  funding  requirements  under  our  pension  andpostretirement
 benefit plans. Additionally, our pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. If interest rates decrease,our
 liabilities  would  increase,  potentially  increasing  benefit  expense  and  funding  requirements.  Further,  changes  in  demographics,  such  as  increases  in  lifeexpectancy assumptions and in
creasing trends in health care costs may also increase our funding requirements. Future increases in pension and other postretirementcosts
 as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable in rates, in which case our results of operations and financial position could be negativelyaffected.
31

Table of ContentsIn
 addition, market factors can affect assumptions we use in determining funding requirements with respect to our pension and postretirement plans. Forexample,
 a relatively modest change in our assumptions regarding discount rates can materially affect our calculation of funding requirements. To the extent thatmarket data
 compels us to reduce the discount rate used in our assumptions, our benefit obligations could be materially increased, which could adversely affect ourfinancial position, resu
lts of operations and cash flows.New
 accounting  standards  or  changes  to  existing  accounting  standards  could  materially  impact  how  we  report  our  results  of  operations,  cash  flow  andfinancial condition.
Our
 Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other authoritativebodies
 or  governmental  entities  may  issue  new  pronouncements  or  new  interpretations  of  existing  accounting  standards  that  may  require  us  to  change  ouraccounting
 policies. These changes are beyond our control, can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how we report our results of operations, cashflow
 and financial condition. We could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cashflow and financial condit
ion.Undetected errors in internal controls and information repor
ting could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and noncompliant disclosure.Our
 internal controls, accounting policies and practices and internal information systems are designed to enable us to capture and process transactions andinformation
 in  a  timely  and  accurate  manner  in  compliance  with  GAAP,  taxation  requirements,  federal  securities  laws  and  regulations  and  other  laws  andregulations
 applicable  to  us.  Such  compliance  permits  us  to,  among  other  things,  disclose  and  report  financial  and  other  information  in  connection  with  therecovery of our costs and with th
e reporting requirements under federal securities, tax and other laws and regulations.We
 have implemented corporate governance, internal control and accounting policies and procedures in connection with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002(the
 “Sarbanes-Oxley  Act”)  and  relevant  SEC  rules,  as  well  as  other  applicable  regulations.  Such  internal  controls  and  policies  have  been  and  continue  to  beclosely
 monitored  by  our  management  and  Board  of  Directors  to  ensure  continued  compliance  with  these  laws,  rules  and  regulations.  Management  is  alsoresponsible
 for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting and is required to assess annually the effectiveness of these controls. Whilewe
 believe these controls, policies, practices and systems are adequate to verify data integrity, unanticipated and unauthorized actions of employees or temporarylapses in
 internal controls due to shortfalls in oversight or resource constraints could lead to undetected errors that could result in the disallowance of cost recoveryand
 noncompliant disclosure and reporting. The consequences of these events could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.The
 inability of management to certify as to the effectiveness of these controls due to the identification of one or more material weaknesses in these controls couldalso increase financ
ing costs or could also adversely affect our or AWCC’s ability to access the capital markets.Additional Risks Related to Our 
Market-Based Businesses We
 (excluding our regulated subsidiaries) provide performance guarantees with respect to certain obligations of our Market-Based  Businesses ,  includingfinancial
 guarantees or deposits, to our public-sector and public clients, and these clients may seek to enforce the guarantees if our Market-Based Businesses do not satisfy these obligations.
Under
 the terms of some of our agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities with municipalities, other governmental entitiesand
 other  customers,  American  Water  (excluding  our  regulated  subsidiaries)  provides  guarantees  of  specified  performance  obligations  of  our Market-Based Businesses 
, including financial guarantees or deposits, primarily related to Military Service Group. In the event our Market-Based Businesses fail to perform these obligations,
 the  entity  holding  the  guarantees  may  seek  to  enforce  the  performance  commitments  against  us  or  proceed  against  the  deposit.  In  that  event,  ourfinancial condition, r
esults of operations, cash flows, and liquidity could be adversely affected.At 
December  31,  2018 ,  we  had  remaining  performance  commitments  as  measured  by  remaining  contract  revenue  totaling  approximately $4.3  billionrelated
 to our Military Services Group contracts, and this amount is likely to increase if our Market-Based Businesses expand. The  presence of these commitmentsmay adversely affect our fina
ncial condition and make it more difficult for us to secure financing on attractive terms.32

Table of ContentsOur
 Market-Based  Businesses’  operations  under  our  Military  Services  Group  are  subject  to  various  risks  associated  with  doing  business  with  the  U.S.government.
We
 enter into contracts with the U.S. government for the operation and maintenance of water and wastewater systems, which contracts may be terminated,in
 whole or in part, prior to the end of the 50-year term for convenience of the U.S. government or as a result of default or non-performance by the subsidiaryperforming the
 contract. In addition, the contract price for each of these military contracts is typically subject to redetermination two years after commencement ofoperations and every three years thereafter.
 Price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changesin
 contract obligations and anticipated market conditions. Any early contract termination or unfavorable price redetermination could adversely affect our financialcondition, results of opera
tions and cash flows.Moreover, entering
 into contracts with the U.S. government subjects us to a number of operational and compliance risks, including dependence on the levelof
 government  spending  and  compliance  with  and  changes  in  governmental  procurement  and  security  regulations.  We  are  subject  to  potential  governmentinvestigations
 of our business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations, which are complex, and compliance with theseregulations
 can be expensive and burdensome. If we were charged with wrongdoing as a result of an investigation, we could be suspended or barred from biddingon or
 receiving awards of new contracts with the U.S. government or our existing contracts could be terminated, which could have a material adverse effect on ourresults of operations and c

 Market-Based Businesses under the Contract Services Group operate a limited number of water and wastewater systems under long-term O&M contractsand
 face the risk that the owners of those systems may fail to provide capital to properly maintain those systems, which may negatively affect the ContractServices Group as the operator of the systems, and we may 
incur costs in excess of payments received.The
 Contract Services Group operates a limited number of water and wastewater systems under O&M contracts. Pursuant to these contracts, the ContractServices
 Group operates the system according to the standards set forth in the applicable contract, and it is generally the responsibility of the owner of the systemto
 undertake capital improvements. In some cases, the Contract Services Group may not be able to convince the owner to make needed improvements in order tomaintain
 compliance with applicable regulations. Although violations and fines incurred by water and wastewater systems may be the responsibility of the ownerof
 the system under these contracts, those non-compliance events may reflect poorly on the Contract Services Group as the operator of the system and us, anddamage our reputation, and 
in some cases, may result in liability to us to the same extent as if we were the owner.In
 addition, the Contract Services Group has entered into long-term contracts under which they agree to operate and maintain a municipality’s or otherparty’s
 water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities, which includes specified major maintenance for some of those facilities, in exchange for an annualfee.
 The Contract Services Group is generally subject to the risk that costs associated with operating and maintaining the facilities, including production costs suchas
 purchased water, electricity, fuel and chemicals used in water treatment, may exceed the fees received from the municipality or other contracting party. Lossesunder these contracts or gu
arantees may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.Keystone’s operations may expose us to substantial cos
ts and liabilities with respect to environmental laws and matters.Keystone’s
 operations,  and  the  operation  generally  of  natural  gas  and  oil  exploration  and  production  facilities  by  Keystone’s  customers,  are  subject  tostringent
 federal,  state  and  local  laws,  rules,  regulations  and  ordinances  governing  the  release  of  materials  into  the  environment  or  otherwise  relating  toenvironmental
 protection. These provisions may require the acquisition by Keystone of permits or licenses before providing its services to customers, prohibit therelease
 of substances defined thereunder as hazardous in connection with these activities, and impose substantial liabilities for the violation thereof that may resultfrom
 these operations. Failure to comply with these laws, rules, regulations and ordinances may result in substantial environmental remediation and other costs toKeystone,
 the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties or the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting certain activities. Under existingenvironmental
 laws  and  regulations,  Keystone  could  be  held  strictly  liable  for  the  removal  or  remediation  of  previously  released  materials  or  propertycontamination
 regardless of whether the release resulted from its operations, or whether its operations were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time theywere
 performed. While we have structured and maintained our ownership and control of Keystone’s operations in such a way that we believe should insulate theCompany,
 its  regulated  subsidiaries  and  its  other Market-Based  Businesses from  any  liabilities  associated  with  Keystone’s  operations,  including  liabilities  forenvironmental matters, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be sufficient to prevent the Compan

 that result in more stringent or costly water or wastewater handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require Keystone to makesignificant
 expenditures  to  maintain  compliance  with such requirements,  may harm  Keystone’s  business and  results  of operations  by reducing  the demand  forKeystone’s

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Dive
rsionsCompliance with SWRCB Orders to Reduce Carmel River Diversions
Under the 2009 Order, Cal Am is
 required, among other things, to decrease significantly its yearly diversions of water from the Carmel River according to aset
 reduction schedule. The 2009 Order responded to claims that Cal Am had not sufficiently implemented actions to terminate its unpermitted diversions of waterfrom
 the Carmel River as required by a 1995 order of the SWRCB. In July 2016, at the request of Cal Am and several Monterey County government agencies, theSWRCB issued the 2016 Order approving a five-ye
ar extension of the deadline to comply with the 2009 Order, to December 31, 2021.34

Table of ContentsThe
 2009 Order includes a condition prohibiting Cal Am from diverting water from the Carmel River for new service connections or for any increased useof water at existing service
 addresses resulting from a change in zoning or use. In 2011, the California Public Utilities Commission (the “CPUC”) issued a decisiondirecting
 modifications in Cal Am’s tariffs to recognize the moratorium mandated by the 2009 Order, and directing Cal Am to seek written guidance from theSWRCB
 with respect to any unresolved issues of interpretation or implementation of this condition. In 2012, the Deputy Director of the SWRCB sent a letter toCal
 Am providing an interpretation as to the calculation of a baseline to determine increases in use of water at existing service addresses. On March 19, 2018, theMPWMD adopted a
 resolution directing Cal Am to interpret the baseline in a manner that conflicts with the SWRCB’s written interpretation. On May 4, 2018, CalAm
 notified the MPWMD and the SWRCB that it intends to seek declaratory relief concerning the conflicting regulatory interpretations under the 2009 Order. Inan
 attempt to resolve these conflicting interpretations prior to seeking judicial intervention, Cal Am met with the MPWMD and the SWRCB several times. TheSWRCB
 has  circulated  revisions  to  its  2012  interpretive  letter,  which  are  being  reviewed  and  discussed  by  the  parties.  Any  failure  to  follow  the  MPWMD’sresolution
 or the SWRCB’s written interpretation, despite these conflicting interpretations, could potentially result in fines, penalties and other actions against CalAm.
The
 2016 Order provides that if the CPUC authorizes Cal Am to acquire more than 1,000 acre-feet per year of water from a source other than the WaterSupply Project, proponents of
 the alternative water source could submit revised milestones to the SWRCB for consideration. On May 8, 2018, certain parties to theWater Supply Project proceeding submitted a petition to
 the SWRCB to add parallel milestones to the 2009 Order for 2019, 2020, and 2021, based on the proposedexpansion
 of the Pure Water Monterey project, another groundwater replenishment project under construction on the Monterey peninsula. Petitioners claim thatcompliance
 with the alternate milestones would still provide for cessation of Cal Am’s unauthorized diversions from the Carmel River by 2021. A preliminaryreport
 on feasibility concluded that the expanded Pure Water Monterey project could provide an additional 2,250 acre-feet of water per year. Cal Am believes that(i)
 the petition is premature, (ii) the expanded Pure Water Monterey project is not yet a sufficiently certain or reliable water supply and, even if construction issuccessfully
 completed,  would  provide  an  insufficient  quantity  of  water  to  allow  full  compliance  with  the  2009  Order,  and  (iii)  the  imposition  of  parallelmilestones would distract 
from completion of the Water Supply Project. This petition remains pending.Regional Desalination Project Litigation
Review
of
CPUC-Approved
Settlement
Agreement
The
 Regional Desalination Project (the “RDP”) involved the construction of a desalination facility in the City of Marina, north of Monterey. The RDP wasintended
 to,  among  other  things,  eliminate  unauthorized  diversions  from  the  Carmel  River  as  required  under  the  2009  Order.  In  December  2010,  the  CPUCapproved
 the RDP, which was to be implemented  through a Water  Purchase  Agreement  and ancillary  agreements  (collectively,  the  “Agreements”)  among theMarina
 Coast  Water  District  (“MCWD”),  the  Monterey  County  Water  Resources  Agency  (“MCWRA”)  and  Cal  Am.  In  2011,  due  to  a  conflict  of  interestconcerning
 a  former  member  of  MCWRA’s  Board  of  Directors,  MCWRA  stated  that  the  Agreements  were  void,  and,  as  a  result,  Cal  Am  terminated  theAgreements. In
 April 2015, the CPUC approved a settlement agreement among Cal Am, MCWRA and the County of Monterey to resolve these matters among theparties
 signing the agreement. In March 2016, the Supreme Court of California granted MCWD’s petition for review of the CPUC approval, and following thecourt’s
 disposition of a related issue in another case, MCWD’s petition for review of the CPUC-approved settlement agreement was remanded to the CPUC, andremains pending.
Cal
Am’s
Action
for
Damages
Following
RDP
Termination
In
 October 2012, Cal Am filed a Complaint for Declaratory Relief against MCWRA and MCWD, which was ultimately transferred to the San FranciscoCounty Superior Court, seeking a
 determination as to whether the Agreements are void as a result of the alleged conflict of interest. In June 2015, the court entereda
 final judgment agreeing with Cal Am’s position that four of the five Agreements are void, and one, the credit line agreement, is not void. In November 2016, theSupreme
 Court  of  California  denied  MCWD’s  final  appeal  of  this  judgment,  which  allows  further  proceedings,  discussed  below,  to  determine  the  amount  ofdamages that may be award
ed in the proceeding.In
 July  2015,  Cal  Am  and  MCWRA  filed  a  Complaint  in  San  Francisco  County  Superior  Court  against  MCWD  and  RMC  Water  and  Environment(“RMC”), a
 private engineering consulting firm, seeking to recover compensatory damages in excess of $10 million associated with the failure of the RDP, as wellas
 punitive and treble damages, statutory penalties and attorneys’ fees. Shortly thereafter, complaints seeking similar damages were filed in the same court byMCWD and RMC
 against Cal Am and MCWRA in excess of $19 million in the aggregate. In December 2015, the court consolidated all of these complaints into asingle action. Trial in 
the consolidated action currently remains set for March 25, 2019 in San Francisco County Superior Court.35

Table of ContentsMonterey Peninsula Water Supply Project
CPUC
Final
Approval
of
Water
Supply
Project
The
 Water Supply Project is intended to reduce water diversions from the Carmel River and involves construction of a desalination plant, owned by CalAm,
 and purchase of water by Cal Am from a groundwater replenishment project (the “GWR Project”) between the Monterey Regional Water Pollution ControlAgency and
 the MPWMD. Cal Am’s ability to move forward on the Water Supply Project is and has been subject to extensive administrative review by the CPUCand
 other government agencies, obtaining necessary permits, and intervention from other parties. In September 2016, the CPUC unanimously approved a decisionto
 authorize Cal Am to enter into a water purchase agreement for the GWR Project and to construct a pipeline and pump station facilities and recover up to $50million in associated 
costs, subject to meeting certain criteria. If construction costs exceed $50 million, Cal Am would be allowed to seek additional cost recovery.On
 August 13, 2018, the CPUC issued its proposed decision granting Cal Am’s request for a CPCN for a 6.4 million gallons per day desalination plant,certifying
 the  final  Environmental  Impact  Report/Environmental  Impact  Statement  (“EIR/EIS”)  and  denying  all  other  outstanding  motions.  On  September  13,2018,
 the CPUC unanimously adopted a final decision (i) finding that the Water Supply Project meets the CPUC’s requirements for a CPCN, and (ii) finding that(a)
 the issuance of the final decision should not be delayed, and (b) an additional procedural phase was not necessary to consider alternative projects. The CPUC’sdecision
 directs Cal Am to enter into negotiations regarding expansion of the GWR Project between the Monterey Regional Water Pollution Control Agency andthe
 MPWMD and to indicate whether Cal Am plans to file an application for approval of an agreement to purchase additional water from the GWR Project. Thedecision
 notes, however, that the CPUC will only consider such an application if the Water Supply Project is delayed such that Cal Am would not be able to meetthe
 December 31, 2021 deadline to comply with the 2009 Order. The decision accepts Cal Am’s estimates of future water demand in Monterey and concludes thatthe
 Water Supply Project is the best project to address those needs, and adopts Cal Am’s most recent cost estimates. The decision also allows Cal Am to earn anallowance
 for funds used during construction, or AFUDC, at a rate representative of its actual financing costs. The final decision adopted frameworks as to costcaps, O&M costs, financing, rat
emaking and contingency matters.In
 addition,  the  CPUC  final  decision  imposes  numerous  reporting  and  filing  requirements  to  ensure  the  expenditures  for  the  Water  Supply  Project  arereasonable, including that
 the financing is the lowest cost and most beneficial for ratepayers, and that construction is progressing in a timely manner and within theauthorized
 cost caps. The reasonableness of Water Supply Project costs will be reviewed in the first general rate case filed by Cal Am after the Water SupplyProject
 becomes operational. Cal Am is also required to implement mitigation measures to avoid, minimize or offset significant environmental impacts from theconstruction
 and operation of the Water Supply Project and comply with a mitigation monitoring and reporting program, a reimbursement agreement for CPUCcosts associated with that p
rogram, and reporting requirements on plant operations following placement of the Water Supply Project in service. Consistent with thatdecision,
 on  December  31,  2018,  Cal  Am  sought  adjustments  to  certain  financing  and  ratemaking  provisions,  including  the  timing  and  amount  of  surchargerecovery, and addresse
d related implementation issues.On
 October 19, 2018, MCWD and the City of Marina filed applications for rehearing before the CPUC. Cal Am filed its response to the applications forrehearing on November 5, 2018. On January 31, 2019, th
e CPUC denied these applications for rehearing.On October 12, 2018, MCWD and the City of Marina
 filed petitions for writ of review in the Supreme Court of California challenging the sufficiency of thefinal
 EIR/EIS.  On  December  12,  2018,  the  Supreme  Court  of  California  denied  the  petitions  for  writ  of  review  without  prejudice  to  the  filing  of  renewedsubmissions
 upon completion of the rehearing proceedings pending before the CPUC. The City of Marina and MCWD filed their renewed petitions for writ ofreview on January 16, 2019 and January 17, 2019, resp
ectively.Coastal
Development
Permit
Application
On
 June 22, 2018, Cal Am submitted a coastal development permit application to the City of Marina for those project components of the Water SupplyProject
 located within the City of Marina’s coastal zone. Members of the City’s Planning Commission, as well as City councilpersons, have publicly expressedopposition
 to the Water Supply Project. On August 9, 2018, the City deemed Cal Am’s application incomplete pending certification and submission of the finalenvironmental
 impact report, and stated that the City could not rule on the permit until certification. As noted above, the CPUC certified the final EIR/EIS for theWater
 Supply Project on September 13, 2018. A public hearing before the Planning Commission on Cal Am’s application was held on February 14, 2019, and thePlanning
 Commission voted to direct staff to prepare findings supporting a denial of the application. The Planning Commission continued the hearing until March7, 2019, at which time it is expe
cted to take formal action on the application.36

lsOn
 August 30, 2018, the City circulated a public review draft of proposed amendments to its local coastal program and zoning ordinance, and placed thematter
 for consideration on the Planning Commission’s agenda for its September 13, 2018 meeting. The proposed amendments would change zoning at the Cemexsite
 to open space and restrict future uses, including with respect to Cal Am’s planned use of the site for the slant wells for the Water Supply Project. Any changeto
 the  City's  local  coastal  program  must  ultimately  be  approved  by  the  California  Coastal  Commission  (the  “Coastal  Commission”).  Cal  Am,  Cemex  and  theCoastal
 Commission each submitted letters opposing the proposed amendments. At its November 8, 2018 meeting, the Planning Commission adopted a resolutionrecommending that the M
arina City Council consider approving the amendments.On December
 4, 2018, the Marina City Council considered the proposed amendments. Cal Am, Cemex and the Coastal Commission again submitted lettersopposing
 the  proposed  changes,  but  the  City  Council  unanimously  adopted  a  resolution  amending  its  local  coastal  plan  and  a  draft  amendment  to  its  zoningordinance. Changes
 to the ordinance require a second reading before becoming final, which occurred at the City’s December 18, 2018 meeting. The changes to thelocal coastal plan mus
t be submitted to the Coastal Commission for approval and are not effective until such approval is obtained.Test
Slant
Well
Permitting
A
 preliminary step to building the Water Supply Project desalination plant is the construction and operation of a test slant well to confirm the suitability ofthe
 property  on  which  intake  wells  will  be  located  to  draw  water  from  under  Monterey  Bay.  In  November  2014,  the  Coastal  Commission  approved  coastaldevelopment
 permits  for  the  test  slant  well,  enabling  Cal  Am  to  construct  and  operate  the  test  slant  well.  The  Coastal  Commission  has  approved  permitamendments
 to allow the test slant well to remain and place and be maintained until February 28, 2020. A required lease obtained from the California State LandsCommission,
 as  amended,  will  expire  on  December  16,  2019.  Effective  February  28,  2018,  test  slant  well  pumping  ceased,  except  for  minimal  maintenancepumping activities, in a
ccordance with Cal Am’s coastal development permits.In
 November 2015, MCWD filed a Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief in Santa Cruz County Superior Courtagainst
 the Coastal Commission and Cal Am challenging the amendment of the coastal development permits and seeking an injunction against further test wellpumping.
 In orders issued in September 2016 and October 2017, the court denied MCWD’s challenges. On January 12, 2018, MCWD filed a notice of appeal ofthe court’s judgment. On March 13, 2018, Ca
l Am filed a motion to dismiss MCWD’s appeal, which was denied on June 25, 2018. The appeal remains pending.In
 July 2017, the Coastal Commission adopted a consent agreement and cease and desist order requiring sand mining operations on the property on whichintake
 wells will be located to cease by the end of 2020 and the property to be sold to either a non-profit or governmental entity. The consent agreement strictlylimits future use of th
e property but preserves Cal Am’s existing property rights and allows uses consistent with existing easements and other rights of record.Based on
 all of the foregoing, Cal Am estimates that the earliest date by which the Water Supply Project desalination plant could be completed is sometimein
 2021. There can be no assurance that the Water Supply Project will be completed on a timely basis, if ever. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that Cal Amwill
 be able to comply with the diversion reduction requirements and other remaining requirements under the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order, or that any suchcompliance will not resu
lt in material additional costs or obligations to Cal Am or the Company.West Virginia Elk River Freedom Industries Chemical Spill

erein by reference.In
 April  2017,  the  Lincoln  County  (West  Virginia)  Commission  (the  “LCC”)  filed  a  complaint  in  Lincoln  County  state  court  against  West  Virginia-American
 Water Company (“WVAWC”) and certain other defendants not affiliated with the Company, which in June 2017 was transferred to the West VirginiaMass
 Litigation Panel, alleging that the Freedom Industries chemical spill caused a public nuisance in Lincoln County under an ordinance enacted by the LCC inMarch
 2017, more than three years after the Freedom Industries chemical spill occurred. The complaint sought an injunction against WVAWC that would haverequired
 the creation of various databases and public repositories of documents related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill, as well as further study and riskassessments regarding the 
alleged exposure of Lincoln County residents to the released chemicals. On July 31, 2018, WVAWC filed a motion to dismiss the LCC’scomplaint.
 On December 12, 2018, the Mass Litigation Panel granted WVAWC’s motion to dismiss on several grounds, including being barred by the applicablestatute of limitations, failure
 to allege a nuisance under applicable law, lack of standing, improper retroactive application of the nuisance ordinance and violation ofWVAWC’s due process. The LCC declined to appea

Table of ContentsDunbar, West Virginia Water Main Break Class Action Litigation
On
 the evening of June 23, 2015, a 36-inch pre-stressed concrete transmission water main, installed in the early 1970s, failed. The water main is part ofWVAWC’s
 West Relay pumping station located in the City of Dunbar. The failure of the main caused water outages and low pressure to up to approximately25,000
 WVAWC customers. In the early morning hours of June 25, 2015, crews completed a repair, but that same day, the repair developed a leak. On June 26,2015,
 a second repair was completed and service was restored that day to approximately 80% of the impacted customers, and to the remaining approximately 20%by
 the  next  morning.  The  second  repair  showed  signs  of  leaking  but  the  water  main  was  usable  until  June  29,  2015  to  allow  tanks  to  refill.  The  system  wasreconfigured
 to maintain service to all but approximately 3,000 customers while a final repair was completed safely on June 30, 2015. Water service was fullyrestored on July 1, 2015 to all custo
mers affected by this event.On
 June 2, 2017, a class action complaint was filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in Kanawha County against WVAWC on behalf of a purported class ofresidents
 and business owners who lost water service or pressure as a result of the Dunbar main break. The complaint alleges breach of contract by WVAWC forfailure
 to supply water, violation of West Virginia law regarding the sufficiency of WVAWC’s facilities and negligence by WVAWC in the design, maintenanceand operation of
 the water system. The plaintiffs seek unspecified alleged damages on behalf of the class for lost profits, annoyance and inconvenience, and loss ofuse, as well as punitive damag
es for willful, reckless and wanton behavior in not addressing the risk of pipe failure and a large outage.In
 October 2017, WVAWC filed with the court a motion seeking to dismiss all of the plaintiffs’ counts alleging statutory and common law tort claims.Furthermore,
 WVAWC  asserted  that  the  Public  Service  Commission  of  West  Virginia,  and  not  the  court,  has  primary  jurisdiction  over  allegations  involvingviolations
 of  the  applicable  tariff,  the  public  utility  code  and  related  rules.  On  May  30,  2018,  the  court,  at  a  hearing,  denied  WVAWC’s  motion  to  apply  theprimary
 jurisdiction doctrine, and on October 11, 2018, the court issued a written order to that effect. The court has not yet issued a written order on WVAWC’smotion
 to dismiss plaintiffs’ tort claims. The court has requested the parties submit a scheduling order with a trial date of August 26, 2019, and WVAWC hassought to prevent further dis
covery while its motion to dismiss is pending.The
 Company and WVAWC believe that WVAWC has valid, meritorious defenses to the claims raised in this class action complaint and WVAWC willcontinue to vigorously defend i
tself against these allegations.Contract Services Group 
-- East Palo Alto Water System Voluntary Report In
 April 2017, AWE, the parent entity of the Company’s Contract  Services Group ,  voluntarily reported to the Division of Drinking Water of the SWRCBpotential
 violations  of  the  California  Safe  Drinking  Water  Act  (the  “CSDWA”)  in  connection  with  AWE’s  operation  of  the  City  of  East  Palo  Alto’s  waterdistribution
 system.  Upon  the  resignation  of  the  system’s  general  manager  in  March  2017,  AWE  discovered  that  it  may  have  operated  the  system  without  aproperly
 certified operator for two years, the triennial LCR sampling was not completed, and the 2015 Consumer Confidence Report improperly reported data forlead
 and copper samples from the system’s upstream water provider. Promptly after discovering these issues, AWE engaged an outside law firm to conduct aninternal investigat
ion and reported the results of that investigation to the SWRCB.On
 June 15, 2017, the SWRCB issued to AWE a citation that required AWE to, among other things: comply with regulations related to water operatorcertifications,
 lead and copper tap sampling requirements and the publishing of a Consumer Confidence Report; provide public notification of the LCR violation;and
 prepare  a  corrective  action  plan  to  evaluate  the  causes  leading  to  these  incidents  and  measures  to  be  taken  to  prevent  recurrence  of  future  incidents.  Thecitation did not impose on AWE any 
monetary penalties, but the SWRCB reserved the right to take additional enforcement action.In
 October 2017, the SWRCB advised AWE that it is in compliance with all of the directives and relevant statutory and administrative provisions specifiedin the SWRCB’s June 2017 citation. While
 AWE has completed all required compliance activities with respect to the citation, the SWRCB has previously reservedthe
 right to take additional enforcement action. In February 2018, the SWRCB referred this matter to the San Mateo County, California District Attorney’s officefor
 further investigation. AWE continues to cooperate with the SWRCB, the City of East Palo Alto and the San Mateo County District Attorney regarding thismatter. Proven violations o
f the CSDWA may result in civil and criminal penalties.General
Periodically,
 the Company is involved in other proceedings or litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Other than those proceedings describedin this

Overview
American
 Water is the largest and most geographically diverse, publicly-traded water and wastewater utility company in the United States, as measured byboth
 operating revenues and population served. We employ approximately 7,100 professionals  who provide drinking water, wastewater and other related servicesto
 more than 14  million people  in 46 states  and  Ontario,  Canada.  Our  primary  business  involves  the  ownership  of  utilities  that  provide  water  and  wastewaterservices
 to residential, commercial, industrial, public authority, fire service and sale for resale customers, collectively presented as our “ Regulated  Businesses .” Our
 utilities  operate  in approximately 1,600 communities  in 16 states  in  the  United  States,  with  approximately 3.4  million active  customers  to  our water  andwastewater
 networks. Services provided by our utilities are generally subject to economic regulation by certain state utility commissions or other entities engagedin
 utility regulation. We also operate market-based businesses which provide a broad range of related and complementary water, wastewater and other services toresidential and smaller commercial customers, the U.S. government on military installations and shale natural gas explorati
on and production companies, as well asmunicipalities, utilities and i
ndustrial customers, collectively presented as our Market-Based Businesses . See Item 1—Business for additional information. Financial Results

Table of ContentsFor
 the year ended December  31, 2018 ,  diluted earnings per share (GAAP) were $3.15 ,  an increase of $0.77 per  diluted share, or 32.4% compared  to theprior year, which includes th
e net adjustments presented in the table above and discussed in greater detail in the “ Adjustments to GAAP ” section below. Excluding
 the net adjustments presented in the table above, adjusted  diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP) were $3.30 for  the year ended December 31, 2018 
, an increase of $0.27 per diluted share, or 8.9% compared to the prior year. These results were
 driven by continued growth in our Regulated Businesses from infrastructure investment,  acquisitions and organic growth, combined withstrong
 results in our Market-Based  Businesses ,  primarily  in our Homeowner  Services  Group with the  mid-year  acquisition  of Pivotal .  These  increases  werepartially
 offset  by  higher  O&M  and  depreciation  expenses  from  the  growth  of  the  business  and  a  lower  tax  shield  on  interest  expense  at  the  parent  companyresulting from the TCJA.
For
 the year ended December  31, 2017 ,  diluted earnings per share (GAAP) were $2.38 per  diluted share, a decrease of $0.24 per  diluted share, or 9.2% compared to
 the prior year, which includes the net adjustments presented in the table above and discussed in greater detail in the “ Adjustments to GAAP ” section below.
Excluding
 the net adjustments presented in the table above, adjusted diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP) were $3.03 for  the year ended December 31, 2017 
, an increase of $0.19 per diluted share, or 6.7% compared to the prior year. These results were
 driven by continued growth in our Regulated Businesses from infrastructure investment,  acquisitions and organic growth, combined withgrowth in our 
Market-Based Businesses from our Homeowner Services Group and Keystone. These increases were partially offset  by lower water services dem andin our 
Regulated Businesses and lower capital upgrades in our Military Services Group.Adjustments to GAAP
Adjusted
 diluted earnings per share represents a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated as GAAP diluted earnings per share, excluding the impactof
 one or more of the following events: (i) a gain in the third quarter of 2018 on the sale of the majority of our Contract  Services Group ’s  O&M contracts; (ii) agoodwill
 and intangible impairment charge in the third quarter of 2018 resulting from narrowing the scope of the Keystone business; (iii) insurance settlementsreceived
 in  the  third  quarter  of  2017  and  the  second  quarter  of  2018  related  to  the  Freedom  Industries  chemical  spill  in  West  Virginia;  (iv)  non-cash  re-measurement
 charges recorded in the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2018 resulting from the impact of the change in the federal corporate income tax rate on theCompany’s
 deferred income taxes from the enactment of the TCJA; (v) an early extinguishment of debt charge at the parent company in the third quarter of 2017;and (vi) a charge in the 
fourth quarter of 2016 related to the binding global agreement in principle to settle claims related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill.We
 believe that this non-GAAP measure provides investors with useful information by excluding certain matters that may not be indicative of our ongoingoperating
 results,  and  that  providing  this  non-GAAP  measure  will  allow  investors  to  understand  better  our  businesses’  operating  performance  and  facilitate  ameaningful year-to-year
 comparison of our results of operations. Although management uses this non-GAAP financial measure internally to evaluate our results ofoperations,
 we do not intend results excluding the adjustments to represent results as defined by GAAP, and the reader should not consider them as indicators ofperformance.
 This non-GAAP financial measure is derived from our consolidated financial information and it should be considered in addition to, and not as asubstitute
 for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this non-GAAP financial measure as defined and used abovemay not be comparable to s
imilarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies, and, accordingly, it may have significant limitations on its use.Achievements and Strategic Focus
We believe our success has, 
and will continue to be, guided by the following strategic philosophies:•
Purpose Driven—“We keep life flowing” is  our trademark purpose, for our customers and our communities, because we provide the most precious oflife’s critical needs. 
•
People Powered—A company is its people. Peopl e who have a safe place to work, both physically and emotionally. •
Customer Obsessed—Without custome rs, we don’t exist. They are why we are here. •
Trusted Source of Everything Wa ter— Best in class, ensuring we have safe, reliable and affordable water.43

Table of ContentsOur strategy, which is driven by our vis
ion and values, will continue to be anchored on our five central themes:•
Safety—Safety is both a stra tegy and a value at American Water. We put safety first in everything that we do.•
In 2018 , we: •
finished  the year with fewer employee injuries than the prior year, improving both our Occupational Safety and Health AdministrationRecordable Incident Rate 
(“ORIR”) and Days Away, Restricted or Transferred (“DART”) injury severity rate;•
continued  to strengthen  our safety culture as measured by employee  responses to safety-related  questions in the Company’s culturesurvey, and feedback from our 
in-person, labor-management conferences;•
initiated  a  frontline  safety  leadership  strategic  action  group,  developed  to  provide  recommendations  to  improve  safety  leadershiptraining, tools, and engagem
ent; and•
championed,  through our safety council which consists of management and labor employees, our annual Safety Day, the CEO SafetyAward and other recognition progr
ams.•
Looking forward, we will: •
strive toward zero workplac e incidents and eliminate hazards to reduce the potential for incidents;•
continue our  focus on “near miss reporting” and promoting continuous learning and corrective action regarding potential safety hazardsbefore incidents can occur;
•
improve toward the achiev ement of our ORIR and DART targets;•
continue  our focus on requiring contractors that perform work for the Company be held to the same safety standards as our employees;and
•
continue  to promote the Company’s employee Stop Work Authority, where every employee is empowered to stop any work he or sheperceives as unsafe, and to 
initiate a review to resolve concerns and to eliminate safety hazards.•
Customer—Our customers are a t the center of everything we plan and do. Customer input, their ideas and experiences will drive how we improve ourprocesses and systems. We want to b
e the best, and if our customers have a choice as to who serves them, we want it to be us.•
In 2018 , we: •
achieved a customer sa tisfaction rating in the top quartile among our industry peer group;•
expanded  our customer experience initiative, designed to make it easier for customers to do business with us, and enhanced our qualityof service through imple
mentation and upgrades of technology tools; and•
continued  to make needed infrastructure investments while implementing operational efficiency improvements to keep customer billsaffordable.
•
Looking forward, we will: •
aim  to  achieve  customer  satisfaction  and  service  quality  ratings  in  the  top  quartile  of  service  industries  beyond  the  water  andwastewater industry.
 We are implementing a multi-year plan to enhance technology and innovation in our customer experience through(i)
 leveraging secure artificial intelligence to better serve our customers, (ii) using online customer communities for immediate inputand
 reactions before implementing programs, and (iii) mapping our most frequent customer interactions and re-working our internalprocesses to how customers want serv
ices; and•
aim for top quartile ratings for drinking water quality and being an industry leader in system resiliency and environmental stewardship.•
People—We  are building an inclusive, diverse, fully-engaged, high performance workforce and culture, creating an environment where our peoplefeel valued, included and 
accountable.•
In 2018 , we: •
continued to  demonstrate our commitment to employees by expanding training and development across the Company, with virtually allemployees completing a
t least 20 hours of formal training during 2018 ; 
44
Table of Contents•
expanded  the executive leadership team to include key operational leaders across the Company to enable a broader operational focusand stronger communicat
ion throughout the organization;•
reached  a new, five -year  national benefits agreement with approximately 3,200 of  our union-represented employees, including theirparticipation
 in the Company’s annual performance plan, which will align Company goals across all employees, as well as providingadditional medical p
lan options for our employees and their families; and•
simplified  our  performance  management  process  to  foster  meaningful  feedback  conversations  and  ensure  feedback  is  the  focus  ofperformance management.
•
Looking forward, we will: •
implement  a strategic workforce plan which will address the changing requirements of our business and our jobs, largely driven by ourcustomer’s expectat
ions and new technologies;•
continue  to improve inclusion and diversity of our overall employee population, ensuring our workforce is reflective of the customersand communities we serve;
•
implement  a  new  and  more  frequent  culture  survey  focused  on  employee  insights  into  how  American  Water  can  become  a  bettercompany
 to work for, and to implement recommendations with the goal of increasing employees’ likelihood to recommend AmericanWater as a place to work
; and•
leverage  technology to ensure our employees have the tools and resources they need to keep the customer at the center of everythingthat we plan and do.
•
Growth—We  expect to continue to grow our businesses, with the majority of our growth to be achieved in our Regulated  Businesses through  (i)continued
 capital investment in our infrastructure to provide safe, clean, reliable and affordable water and wastewater services to our customers, and(ii)
 regulated  acquisitions  to  expand  our  services  to  new  customers.  We  also  expect  to  continue  to  grow  our Market-Based  Businesses ,  whichleverage our core water an
d wastewater competencies.•
In 2018 , we invested $2.0 billion in our Regulated Businesses and Market-Based Businesses . Regulated Businesses 
Growth •
$1.5 billion capital investment in our Regulated Businesses , the majority for inf rastructure improvements and replacements.•
$33 million to fund acquisitions in our Regulated Businesses , which added approximately 14,000 water and wastewater custom ers.•
Entered into agreemen ts as of January 31, 2019 for pending acquisitions to add approximately 61,000 customers including: •
On May  30,  2018 ,  our  Pennsylvania  subsidiary  entered  into  an  agreement  to  acquire  the  wastewater  assets  of  ExeterTownship, Pennsylvania, for approximat
ely $96 million . This system currently serv es approximately 9,000 customers. We are expecting to close this a
cquisition during the third quarter of 2019, pending regulatory approval.•
On April 13, 2018 , our Illinois subsidiary entered into an agreement to acquire the City of Alton, Illinois’ regional wastewater system
 for  approximately $54  million .  This  system  currently  represents  approximately 23,000 customers,  comprised  ofapproximately 
11,000 customers  in Alton and an additional 12,000 customers  under bulk contracts in the nearby communitiesof
 Bethalto  and  Godfrey.  In  connection  with  the  execution  of  the  purchase  agreement,  our  Illinois  subsidiary  made  a $5 million 
non-escrowed  deposit to the seller during January 2019. We are expecting to close this acquisition during the secondquarter of 2019, pending regula
tory approval.Market-Based Businesses 
Growth and Optimization •
We invested $365 million to acquire  Pivotal, a leading provider of home warranty protection products and services for gas, electric andother
 service lines inside and around a home, heating and cooling systems, and home appliances. Pivotal, which joins our Homeowner Services Group 
, operates in 18 states with approximately 1.2 million customer contracts at the time of acquisition.45

Table of Contents•
Our Military Services Group was  awarded a contract for ownership, operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems atFort
 Leonard Wood in Missouri, effective  October  1, 2018 .  Designated as the U.S. Army’s Maneuver Support Center of Excellenceand
 the home to three U.S. Army schools, Fort Leonard Wood directly and indirectly supports 36,400 jobs across  the state of Missouri.The contract award
 includes estimated revenues of approximately  $591 million  over a  50 -year period, subject to an annual economicprice adjustment.
•
On July 5, 2018 ,  we entered into an agreement for the sale of 22 of our Contract  Services Group ’s 33 O&M contracts to subsidiariesof
 Veolia Environnement S.A. for $27  million .  We closed on the sale of 20 of the 22 contracts during the third quarter of 2018, andexpect
 to close on the sale of the remaining two contracts, subject to customer consents, in the first half of 2019. We will retain four of our
 O&M contracts due to their proximity to our existing service areas, and expect the majority of our remaining O&M contracts to besold to other parties, or exp
ire within the next year.•
As  a result of operational and financial challenges encountered in the construction business of Keystone, the Company decided to exitthis
 business line during the third quarter of 2018. This action, along with the exit of the water trucking business line during the firsthalf
 of 2018, narrowed the scope of the Keystone business going forward, focusing solely on providing water transfer services. Thesefactors
 prompted  the  impairment  testing  of  Keystone’s  goodwill  and  customer  relationship  intangible  asset  at  September  30,  2018,resulting
 in a non-cash, after-tax, impairment charge of  $40 million ,  net of noncontrolling interest. See  Note  8—Goodwill and OtherIntangible Assets 
 in the Notes to the Consolidated Finan cial Statements for additional information.•
Looking  forward, we expect to invest between $8.0  billion to $8.6 billion from  2019 to 2023, including a range of $1.7  billion to $1.8 billionin 
2019 . Our expected future invest ment includes:•
capital  investment for infrastructure improvements in our Regulated  Businesses of $7.3 billion over  the next five years, including $1.6 billion 
expected in 2019 ; •
growth  from acquisitions in our Regulated  Businesses to  expand our water and wastewater customer base of between $600  million to $1.2 billion 
over the next five years, including a range of $120 million to $240 million expected in 2019 ; and •
strategic  capital investments of approximately $100  million over  the next five years, which consists primarily of intellectual propertydevelopment and strateg
ic growth opportunities in our Market-Based Businesses . The
 following  chart  depicts  the  estimated  allocation  of  our  expected  capital  investment  for  infrastructure  improvements  in  our Regulated Businesses 
over the next five years, by pu rpose:

Table of Contents•
Operational Excellenc e—We continue to strive for industry-leading operational efficiency, driven largely by technology. Our technology investmentsare aimed at enhancing our
 customer experience and operational efficiency.•
In 2018 : •
our Regulated  Businesses achieved  an  adjusted  O&M  efficiency  ratio  (a  non-GAAP  measure)  of 35.6% for  the  year  endedDecember 31, 2018 
, compared to 35.3% and 36.6% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The unfavor abilityin our
 adjusted O&M efficiency ratio in 2018 , when compared to 2017 , was  primarily due to a settlement agreement in our New Yorksubsidiary
 and higher expenses incurred from the colder weather experienced during the first quarter of 2018. The improvement in ouradjusted
 O&M efficiency ratio in 2017 ,  when compared to 2016 ,  was attributable to both an increase in operating revenues and adecrease in O&M expenses;
•
we  worked  to  decrease  costs  and  deploy  capital  efficiently,  including  using  trenchless  technologies  for  pipeline  rehabilitation  andleveraging our buying power and str
ategic sourcing to drive cost savings;•
we  continued our commitment to water quality and the environment by leveraging new technologies; we now have advanced waterquality sensors at all of ou
r major drinking water intake sites and we are automating our reporting and compliance systems; and•
we  implemented  other  technology  tools  that  will  enhance  communication,  collaboration  and  mobility  to  help  our  employees  worksafely and efficien
tly, and enhance the customer experience.•
Looking forward, we will focus on technology and efficiency to:•
be  the leader in optimizing technology deployment across the water and wastewater industry, with a keen focus on specific, innovativeprojects
 that will set us apart from other utilities; aiding us in serving our customers with greater ease, making us safer and helping usoperate more efficiently; and
•
achieve our goal of an adjus ted O&M efficiency ratio of 31.5% by 2023. Our
 adjusted O&M efficiency ratio is defined as the operation and maintenance expenses from our  Regulated Businesses ,  divided by the proforma
 operating revenues from our  Regulated  Businesses ,  where both operation and maintenance expenses and pro forma operating revenues wereadjusted
 to eliminate purchased water expense. Additionally, from operation and maintenance expenses, we excluded the allocable portion of non-operation
 and maintenance support services costs, mainly depreciation and general taxes, that are reflected in our Regulated Businesses segment asoperation
 and maintenance expenses, but for consolidated financial reporting purposes, are categorized within other line items in the accompanyingConsolidated Statements of Oper
ations.In
 addition to the adjustments discussed above, for period-to-period comparability purposes, we have presented the estimated impact of theTCJA
 on operating revenues for our  Regulated  Businesses  on  a pro forma basis for all periods presented prior to January 1, 2018, as if the lowerfederal
 corporate  income  tax  rate  was  in  effect  for  these  periods  (see   Note  7—Regulatory  Assets  and  Liabilities  in  the  Notes  to  ConsolidatedFinancial
 Statements for additional information). We also made the following adjustments to our O&M efficiency ratio: (i) excluded from operationand
 maintenance expenses, the impact of certain Freedom Industries chemical spill settlement activities recognized in 2016, 2017 and 2018; and (ii)excluded
 from operation and maintenance expenses, the impact of the Company’s January 1, 2018 adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2017-07,

 See Note  2—Significant Accounting Policies in  the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We excludedthe
 items discussed above from the calculation as we believe such items are not reflective of management’s ability to increase the efficiency of ourRegulated Businesses 
. We
 evaluate  our  operating  performance  using  this  ratio  because  we  believe  it  directly  measures  improvement  in  the  efficiency  of  ourRegulated Businesses 
. This information is intend ed to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of our operating performance. Our adjusted O&Mefficiency
 ratio is not an accounting measure that is based on GAAP, may not be comparable to other companies’ operating measures and should notbe used in place of the GAAP informat
ion provided elsewhere in this Form 10-K.47

Table of ContentsWith
 respect  to  our  adjusted  O&M  efficiency  ratio  goal  for  2023,  we  are  unable  to  provide  without  unreasonable  efforts  a  quantitativereconciliation
 of each component of this ratio to the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. In calculating thecomponents
 of the ratio, certain items that may ultimately be excluded would be reflective of events that cannot be reasonably predicted at this time.The
 unavailable  information  would include,  among other  things, the impact  of items currently  excluded from  the calculation  of the components,adjustments
 for  weather  conditions  that  exceed  a  certain  threshold  of  variability  and  adjustments  for  events  or  circumstances  that  may  not  bereflective of ongoing ope
rating results. The probable significance of these items is also presently unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated.The

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
On 
December 22, 2017 ,  the TCJA was signed into law, which, among other things, enacted significant and complex changes to the Internal Revenue Codeof
 1986, including a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as  of January 1, 2018, and certain other provisions related specifically tothe
 public  utility  industry,  including  continuation  of  interest  expense  deductibility,  the  exclusion  from  utilizing  bonus  depreciation  and  the  normalization  ofdeferred
 income tax. The enactment of the TCJA required a re-measurement of our deferred income taxes that materially impacted our 2017 results of operationsand
 financial position. The portion of this re-measurement related to our Regulated Businesses was  substantially offset by a regulatory liability, as we believe it isprobable
 that  the  deferred  income  tax  excesses  created  by  the  TCJA  will  benefit  our  regulated  customers  in  future  rates.  The  remaining  portion  of  this  re-measurement
 of the net deferred income tax liability was recorded as a non-cash charge to earnings during the fourth quarter of 2017. During 2018, we continuedto
 gather,  assess  and  evaluate  additional  guidance  and  regulations  related  to  the  changes  related  to  the  TCJA.  As  a  result  of  this  process,  we  have  recordedadditional
 adjustments  to  finalize  our  initial  2017  estimates.  See Note  14—Income  Taxes in  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  additionalinformation.
50

Table of ContentsDuring 2018, the Company’s 
14 regulatory jurisdictions began to consider the impacts of the TCJA. The Company has adjusted customer rates to reflect thelower income tax rate in 
10 states. In one of those 10 states, a portion of the tax savings is being used to reduce certain regulatory assets. In one additional state, weare
 using the tax savings to offset additional capital investment and to reduce a regulatory asset. Proceedings in the other three jurisdictions  remain pending. With respect
 to excess accumulated deferred income taxes, regulators in the eight states  that have considered the issue have agreed with our overall timeline of passingthe
 excess back to customers beginning no earlier than 2019, when the Company is able to produce the normalization schedule using the average rate assumptionmethod. In 
one of those states, we will use the amortization of the excess accumulated deferred income taxes to offset future infrastructure investments.On March 23, 2018, President Trump signed the Consol
idated Appropriations Act of 2018 (the “CAA”). The CAA corrects and clarifies some aspects of theTCJA
 related to bonus depreciation eligibility. Specifically, property that was acquired, or the construction began, prior to September 27, 2017, is eligible forbonus
 depreciation. This clarification allowed the Company to benefit from additional bonus depreciation deductions on the 2017 tax return, and as a result, webelieve
 that we will likely begin paying federal income taxes towards the end of 2019, when we expect our federal NOL carryforwards balance will be fully used,and
 expect to be a full year cash taxpayer by 2020, although this timing could be impacted by any significant changes in our future results of operations and theoutcome of pending regulato
ry proceedings regarding the TCJA.On
 November 26, 2018, the U.S. Department of the Treasury released proposed regulations concerning interest expense limitation rules. The TCJA revisedand
 broadened  the  existing  interest  expense  limitation  regulations.  The  Company  has  considered  all  the  rules  set  forth  in  the  proposed  regulation  includingallocated
 interest expense and interest income based on the relative amounts of the Company’s adjusted basis in the assets used in its excepted and non-exceptedtrades or
 business, or our Regulated Businesses and Market-Based Businesses . Based  on our interpretation of the new guidance, the Company reasonably believesthe deductibility of i
ts interest expense will not be limited under the new regulations.Other Tax Matters
On
 June 1, 2018, the State of Missouri enacted legislation that decreased the state income tax rate on our taxable income attributable to Missouri from6.25%
 to 4.00%, beginning in the 2020 tax year. As a result, we were required to re-measure our cumulative deferred income tax balances using the lower stateincome
 tax rate in the second quarter of 2018. This resulted in a decrease to the Company’s unitary deferred income tax liability of $12 million, and an increase toa regulatory liabil
ity of $13 million, as we believe it is probable of refund in future rates.On
 May 30, 2018, the State of Iowa enacted legislation that decreased the state income tax rate on our taxable income attributable to Iowa from 12.0% to9.8%,
 beginning in the 2021 tax year. The deferred income tax liability for our Iowa subsidiary was reduced by $1 million, and offset by a regulatory liability, aswe believe this liabil
ity is probable of refund in future rates.On
 April 13, 2018, the State of Kentucky enacted legislation that decreased the state income tax rate on our taxable income attributable to Kentucky from6%
 to  5%,  beginning  in  the  2018  tax  year.  In  addition,  beginning  in  the  2019  tax  year,  a  consolidated  return,  including  all  affiliated  group  members,  will  berequired.
 As a result, we were required to record a deferred income tax liability of $7 million for our Kentucky unitary filing group, and the existing deferredincome
 tax liability related to our Kentucky subsidiary was reduced by $1 million, offset by a regulatory liability, as we believe this liability is probable of refundin future rates.
The
 Company  performed  its  annual  review  of  the  apportionment  rates  in  all  of  its  unitary  filing  jurisdictions  and  implemented  changes  to  reflectconsiderations for histor
ical results and future business outlooks in each of the jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2018 , we recorded a non-cash, cumul ative chargeto earnings of 
$12 million , resulting from the leg islative changes described above and the adjustments made through various state income tax apportionment rates.On
 July 1, 2018, the State of New Jersey enacted legislation that increased the corporate business tax rate from 9.0% to 11.5% for the 2018 and 2019 taxyears,
 and to 10.5% for the 2020 and 2021 tax years. The tax rate will revert back to 9.0% for tax year 2022 and beyond. Additionally, the new legislation statesthat
 for the year beginning on and after January 1, 2019, a unitary group will be required to file a combined unitary New Jersey tax return. The legislation allows adeduction
 over  a  10-year  period,  commencing  five  years  after  the  enactment  of  unitary  combined  reporting,  if  the  combined  reporting  provisions  result  in  anaggregate
 increase to the net deferred income tax liability or an aggregate decrease to the net deferred income tax asset. Thus, the deferred income tax liabilityresulting
 from the unitary filing requirement would be completely offset by the deferred income tax asset derived from this deduction. There are no underlyingimpacts to the Company’s ea
rnings as a result of the new filing requirement. On October 4, 2018, New Jersey’s governor signed a technical correction bill into law.The
 correction bill provides an exclusion for water and wastewater utility companies whose rates are regulated from the combined reporting requirement. TheCompany’s tax credit grant
ed by the State of New Jersey will not be impacted by the law changes mentioned above.51

Table of ContentsLegislative Updates
During 2018, our regulatory jurisdi
ctions enacted legislation as follows:•
House  File  2307  in  Iowa  and  House  Bill  1566  in  Maryland  allow  a  fair  market  value  methodology  to  be  included  in  rate  base  with  respect  toprospective acquisitions.
•
Senate  Enrolled Act 362 in Indiana, which, similar to the Water Quality Accountability Act enacted in New Jersey in 2017, sets new operationalstandards
 and  requirements  for  water  and  wastewater  treatment  plants  in  areas  such  as  capital  asset  management,  cost-benefit  analysis  andcybersecurity.
•
Senate Bill  705 in Missouri allows the Missouri Public Service Commission to approve a revenue stability mechanism (“RSM”) for water utilities. Inan
 effort  to  encourage  conservation,  a  RSM  adjusts  rates  periodically  to  ensure  that  a  utility’s  revenue  will  be  sufficient  to  cover  its  costs,  andcustomers will not overpay fo
r service. •
Senate Bill 592 in Missouri changes the  public vote requirement for the sale of a municipal water or wastewater system to a simple majority for morethan
 500  small  towns.  Historically,  only  larger  communities  required  a  simple  majority,  while  smaller  communities  needed  a  two-thirdsmajority. This legisla
tion increases the options for small towns, should they decide to address their water and sewer challenges through an asset sale.•
Legislation  was passed in Iowa that allows private water utilities to use a future test year approach in rate cases, decreasing potential regulatory lagand helping to spread out the t
ime between rate cases.•
In  California, Assembly Bill 2179 changed the vote required to allow cities to sell sewer systems to a simple majority as compared to a two-thirdsmajority, and Assembly Bill 2339 a
llowed certain cities to sell water systems without an election.•
Act  58 of 2018 in Pennsylvania allows public utilities to implement alternative rates and rate mechanisms in rate base proceedings. These alternativerates
 and rate mechanisms include, but are not limited to the following: revenue stability mechanisms, performance-based rates, formula rates, multi-year
 rate plans, or a combination of those mechanisms or other mechanisms. Petitions to establish alternative rate mechanisms are subject to PUCreview and approval and can only b
e filed by a utility in a rate base proceeding.•
On  October 17, 2018, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed legislation that allows an investor-owned water utility to include the replacementcosts for customer-owned LSLs and customer-o
wned damaged wastewater laterals in rate base when replaced as part of a Pennsylvania Public UtilityCommission
 approved  program.  The  law  became  effective  December  23,  2018.  Prior  to  the  new  law,  our  Pennsylvania  subsidiary  sought  theapproval
 of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission to revise the Company’s rules to permit it to replace customer-owned LSLs and to recoverassociated
 costs. Our Pennsylvania subsidiary’s proposed replacement of customer-owned LSL program is being reviewed under the provisions ofthe new law.
•
On  October 23, 2018, President Trump signed America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018. The legislation includes policies intended to improvewater
 and wastewater system management and authorization for states to assess options for consolidation for systems that do not comply with thefederal
 Safe Drinking Water Act and its rules and regulations. The legislation increases funding to water system funding programs, including theState Revolving Loan Fund program and the 
Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act.52

 acquisitions and organic growth and growth in the  Market-Based  Businesses ,  mainly from our  Homeowner  Services Group  due  to the mid-yearacquisition
 of Pivotal. These increases were partially offset by higher O&M and depreciation expenses across the Company due to growth of the business and theasset impairment ch

2017 ,  net income attributable to common shareholders decreased $42  million ,  or 9.0 percent ,  as compared to the same period in 2016. This decreasewas
 due to a $125  million non-cash  charge in 2017 related to the implementation of TCJA resulting from the re-measurement of deferred taxes primarily at theparent
 company from the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% .  Partially offsetting this non-cash charge was continued growth inthe
  Regulated Businesses  driven  mainly by infrastructure investment, acquisitions and organic growth, combined with growth in the  Market-Based Businesses  mainly from the 
Homeowner Services Group and Keystone. Segment Results of Operations
Our operating segments are comprised of the revenue-generating components of the business for which separate financial informatio
n is internally producedand
 regularly used by management to make operating decisions, assess performance and allocate resources. The Company operates its business primarily throughone 
reportable segment, the Regulated  Businesses segment.  We also operate several market-based businesses within operating segments that individually do notmeet
 the  criteria  of  a  reportable  segment  in  accordance  with  GAAP. These  non-reportable  operating  segments  are  collectively  presented  as  our Market-Based Businesses 
, which is consistent with how managem ent assesses the results of these businesses.53

Supplies
and
Services
In 
2018 ,  operating supplies and services increased $18  million ,  or 8.6% ,  primarily due to a $17  million increase  in contracted services from higher costsfor
 various  legal  matters  including  a  settlement  agreement  in  our  New  York  subsidiary  and  costs  associated  with  condemnation  proceedings  in  Monterey,California,
 higher costs from temporary workers as a result of restructuring initiatives in our technology support services, as well as an increase in other operatingexpenses.
In 
2017 ,  operating supplies and services decreased $3  million ,  or 1.4% ,  primarily due to a decrease in charges recorded in 2016, including a $5 millionwrite-off
 of timekeeping system costs that were previously capitalized and a $7 million judgment in litigation, partially offset by an increase in office supplies andservices from higher e
mployee relocation, telecommunication and office supplies costs.Maintenance

iesIn 
2018 , maintenance mate rials and supplies increased $11 million , or 15.7% , from a higher volume of  main breaks and paving costs, driven by the colderweather
 experienced during the first quarter of 2018, as well as higher tank painting costs in our New Jersey subsidiary and various maintenance projects in ourPennsylvania, Missouri and Indiana subs
idiaries.In 
2017 , maintenance mate rials and supplies decreased $3 million , or 4.1% , from lower tank painting costs in our  New Jersey subsidiary and the timing ofmaintenance activities.
Customer

In 
2018 ,  customer  billing  and  accounting increased $9  million ,  or 17.6% ,  from  an  increase  in  customer  uncollectible  expense,  primarily  in  ourPennsylvania, Missouri and New York subsidiari
es, and higher call volumes experienced at our customer service centers.

Table of ContentsIn 
2017 ,  customer billing and accounting decreased $3  million or 5.6% ,  from lower customer  uncollectible  expense attributable  to focused collectionefforts.
Other
(Operation
and
Maintenance)
In 
2018 ,  other (operation and maintenance) increased $10  million ,  or 58.8% ,  primarily due to higher casualty insurance claims in 2018, and a $3 millioncharge
 from a regulatory authorization allowing a portion of the income tax savings resulting from the TCJA to be used to reduce certain regulatory assets. During2018,
 we recorded a $20 million benefit resulting from an insurance settlement with one of our general liability insurance carriers associated with the FreedomIndustries chemical sp
ill in West Virginia.In 
2017 ,  other (operation and maintenance) decreased $90  million ,  or 84.1% ,  primarily due to a $65 million net charge recorded in 2016, resulting fromthe
 binding  global  agreement  in  principle  to  settle  claims  associated  with  the  Freedom  Industries  chemical  spill  in  West  Virginia,  and  a  $22  million  benefitrecorded
 in 2017, resulting from a related insurance settlement with one of our general liability insurance carriers, as well as a decrease in casualty insuranceexpense attributable 
to a lower claims experience in 2017.Depreciation and Amortization
In
  2018 and 2017 ,  depreciation and amortization increased   $38 million and $22 million ,  or 8.2% and 5.0% ,  respectively. The increase for both periodswas primarily due to addit
ional utility plant placed in service.General Taxes
In
  2018 and 2017 ,  general taxes  increased $17  million and $2 million ,  or 7.0% and 0.8% ,  respectively. The increase in 2018 was primarily due toincremental proper
ty taxes in several of our subsidiaries, including in Missouri and New York.(Gain) on Asset Dispositions and Purchases
In
  2018 and 2017 ,  (gain) on asset dispositions and purchases increased $9  million ,  or 56.3% ,  and decreased $9  million ,  or 128.6% ,  respectively. Thedecrease
 in  2018  was  primarily  due  to  higher  gains  recognized  in  2017,  including  a  $7  million  gain  on  a  land  sale  in  our  Kentucky  subsidiary,  along  withacquisition
 and land sale gains in our Pennsylvania, Missouri and California subsidiaries, partially offset by gains recognized in 2018 for the sale of a treatmentplant in our Illinois subsidi
ary and a building in our New Jersey subsidiary.Interest, net
In 
2018 and 2017 ,  interest,  net  increased $12  million and $12 million ,  respectively.  The  increase  in  interest  expense  during  2018  was  driven  by  theissuance
 of incremental long-term debt in the third quarter of 2018 to support growth of the business, and higher levels of short-term borrowings during 2018,coupled
 with an increase in the average short-term borrowing rate in the current year. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the increase in interest expense wasdriven by the issuance of inc
remental long-term debt in 2017 to support growth of the business.Other Income (Expenses)
In 
2018 ,  other income (expenses) increased $19  million ,  or 7.1% ,  primarily due to a reduction in the non-service cost components of pension and otherpostretirement
 benefits expense resulting from favorable actuarial performance, and an increase in allowance for funds used during construction attributable tohigher
 capital investment in 2018, partially offset by an increase in interest expense as discussed above. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the increase inother income (expenses) was p
rimarily due to an increase in interest expense as discussed above.Provision for Income Taxes
For
 the year ended  December  31, 2018 ,  our provision for income taxes decreased primarily due to the reduction in the federal corporate income tax ratefrom
 35% to 21% as of January 1, 2018, resulting from the enactment of the TCJA. We expect the reduced tax rate will benefit our customers through establishedratemaking,
 tax and regulatory normalization provisions. During 2018, we continued assessing the impacts of the TCJA as allowed by Staff Accounting Bulletin118
 (“SAB 118”), and as a result we recorded adjustments to federal and state income tax TCJA estimates. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our provisionfor income taxes incr
eased primarily due to higher pretax income in 2017 compared to 2016.57

Table of ContentsProvision for Income Taxes
In 
2018 and 2017 ,  provision for income taxes  decreased $17  million ,  or 60.7% ,  and increased $2  million ,  or 7.7% ,  respectively. The decrease in 2018 was primarily due to t
he reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as of January 1, 2018, resulting fro m the enactment of the TCJA.Liquidity and Capital Resources
We
 regularly  evaluate  and  monitor  our  cash  requirements  for  capital  investments,  acquisitions,  operations,  commitments,  debt  maturities,  interest  anddividends.
 Our business is capital intensive, with a majority of this capital funded by cash flows from operations. When necessary, we also obtain funds fromexternal sources, primarily in the
 debt markets and through short-term commercial paper borrowings. We also have access to equity capital markets, if needed. Ouraccess
 to  external  financing  on  reasonable  terms  depends  on  our  credit  ratings  and  current  business  conditions,  including  that  of  the  utility  and  water  utilityindustry
 in  general,  as  well  as  conditions  in  the  debt  or  equity  capital  markets,  and  the  national  and  international  economic  and  geopolitical  arenas.  If  thesebusiness,
 market, financial and other conditions deteriorate to the extent that we no longer are able to access the capital markets on reasonable terms, we haveaccess to an unsecured revo
lving credit facility with aggregate bank commitments of $2.25 billion , with an expiration date of Jun e 2023 (subject to extension by usfor
 up to two one-year periods). We rely on this revolving credit facility and the capital markets to fulfill our short-term liquidity needs, to issue letters of creditand
 to  support  our $2.10  billion commercial  paper  program.  Disruptions  in  the  credit  markets  may  discourage  lenders  from  extending  the  terms  of  suchcommitments
 or agreeing to new commitments. Market disruptions may also limit our ability to issue debt and equity securities in the capital markets. See “CreditFacilities and Short-Ter
m Debt” section below for additional information.In order to
 meet our short-term liquidity needs, we, through AWCC, our wholly owned financing subsidiary, issue commercial paper, which is supported bythe
 revolving credit facility. As of December  31, 2018 ,  AWCC had no outstanding borrowings and $81 million of  outstanding letters of credit under its revolvingcredit
 facility,  with $2.25  billion available  to  fulfill  our  short-term  liquidity  needs  and  to  issue  letters  of  credit,  which  supported $954  million in  outstandingcommercial paper. We believe
 that our ability to access the capital markets, our revolving credit facility and our cash flows from operations will generate sufficientcash
 to fund our short-term requirements. We have no plans to issue equity under normal operating conditions in the foreseeable future with the limited exceptionof
 privately  or  investor-owned  acquisitions  whose  sellers  require  equity  to  complete  the  acquisition  or  other  opportunistic  acquisitions.  We  believe  we  havesufficient
 liquidity  and  the  ability  to  manage  our  expenditures,  should  there  be  a  disruption  of  the  capital  and  credit  markets.  However,  we  can  provide  noassurances
 that the lenders will meet their existing commitments to AWCC under the revolving credit facility or that we will be able to access the commercialpaper or loan markets in 
the future on terms acceptable to us or at all.In
 addition, our Regulated  Businesses receive  advances and contributions from customers, home builders and real estate developers to fund constructionnecessary to extend service to new areas. Advances for construction are refun
dable for limited periods, which vary according to state regulations, as new customersbegin
 to  receive  service  or  other  contractual  obligations  are  fulfilled.  Amounts  which  are  no  longer  refundable  are  reclassified  to  contributions  in  aid  ofconstruction.
 Utility  plant  funded  by  advances  and  contributions  is  excluded  from  our Regulated  Businesses rate  base.  Generally,  we  depreciate  contributedproperty
 and amortize contributions in aid of construction at the composite rate of the related property. Some of our subsidiaries do not depreciate contributedproperty,
 based upon regulatory  guidelines. The taxability of advances and contributions in aid of construction  was changed with the enactment of the TCJA.Previously,
 the majority of advances and contributions that we collected were not taxable; however, with the enactment of the TCJA, they are now treated astaxable
 income. Regulatory treatment for advances and contributions under the TCJA has been resolved by most of our regulatory jurisdictions in a manner thatpasses the
 tax consequences of the change in law to the customer making the advance or contribution, or allows the utility to pass those consequences onto a largerbase of customers. We ar
e working with the remaining regulatory jurisdictions to determine impacts to the Company and our customers.We
 use our capital resources, including cash, primarily to (i) fund operating and capital requirements, (ii) pay interest and meet debt maturities, (iii) paydividends, (iv)
 fund acquisitions, (v) fund pension and postretirement benefit obligations, and (vi) we estimate beginning at the end of 2019, to pay federal incometaxes.
 We invest a significant amount of cash on regulated capital projects where we expect to earn a long-term return on investment. Additionally, we operate inrate
 regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited, and where such recovery generally takes place over an extendedperiod
 of time, and certain capital recovery is also subject to regulatory lag. See Item  1—Business — Regulated Businesses — Economic Regulation and RateMaking 
for  additional information. We expect to fund future maturities of long-term debt through a combination of external debt and, to the extent available, cashflows
 from operations. Since we expect our capital investments over the next few years to be greater than our cash flows from operating activities, we have noplans
 to reduce debt significantly. If necessary, we may delay certain capital investments or other funding requirements, or pursue financing from other sources topreserve
 liquidity.  In  this  event,  we  believe  we  can  rely  upon  cash  flows  from  operations  to  meet  our  obligations  and  fund  our  minimum  required  capitalinvestments for an extend
ed period of time.60

Table of ContentsWith
 the enactment of the TCJA and the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% ,  we anticipate a decrease in futurerevenue
 authorizations associated with our Regulated  Businesses ,  initially leading to lower cash flows. We expect this cash flow impact to decline over time, asour 
Regulated Businesses ’  rate base grows, the result of lower deferred income tax liabilities, which offset rate base. The lower deferred income tax liabilities aremainly
 due to (i) a lower U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, (ii) the normalization (refunding to customers) of the re-measured deferred income tax liabilitiesover the remaining li
fe of the associated assets, and (iii) the loss of future bonus depreciation deductions on capital projects that began after September 27, 2017.The Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2014 (“WIFIA”) establis
hed the WIFIA program, a federal credit program administered by the EPAfor
 eligible water and wastewater infrastructure projects. The WIFIA program accelerates investment in our nation’s water infrastructure by providing long-term,low-cost
 supplemental loans for regionally and nationally significant projects. Our letters of interest have been approved by the EPA, and we have begun the fullapplication process for 
two WIFIA loans totaling $187 million for two separate projec ts in our Missouri subsidiary.Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities
Cash
 flows  provided  by  operating  activities  primarily  result  from  the  sale  of  water  and  wastewater  services  and, due  to the  seasonality  of  demand,  aregenerally
 greater  during  the  warmer  months.  Our  future  cash  flows  provided  by  operating  activities  will  be  affected  by,  among  other  things;  economic  utilityregulation
 inflation; compliance with environmental, health and safety standards; production costs; maintenance costs; customer growth; declining customer usageof water; employee-r
elated costs, including pension funding; weather and seasonality; taxes; and overall economic conditions.We
 expect that the enactment of the TCJA to be accretive to our consolidated earnings over time through (i) growth in rate base for the same level ofexpected
 capital expenditures due to the impact of the lower U.S. federal corporate income tax rate and the re-measurement of our deferred income tax assets andliabilities,
 (ii) increased earnings in our Market-Based  Businesses due  to the lower U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, all partially offset by (iii) the lower taxshield
 on  interest  expense  at the  parent,  as well  as increased  debt levels  from  lower cash  flows from  operations  as  we pass the  lower tax  rate  benefits  to ourregulated
 customers. We believe that we will likely begin paying federal income taxes towards the end of 2019, when we expect our federal NOL carryforwardsbalance
 will be fully used, and expect to be a full year cash taxpayer by 2020, although this timing could be impacted by any significant changes in our futureresults of operations and th
e outcome of regulatory proceedings regarding the TCJA.Cash
 flows provided by operating activities have been a reliable, steady source of funding, sufficient to meet operating requirements and fund the majorityof
 our capital investments. We expect to seek access to debt capital markets to meet the balance of our capital investment, if any, and fund our dividend payments,as
 needed. We also have access to equity capital markets, if needed. We do not foresee the need to access equity markets over the next five years under normaloperating
 conditions. Operating cash flows can be negatively affected by changes in our rate regulated environments, changes in our Market-Based  Businesses , changes
 in the economy, interest rates, the timing of tax payments, and our customers’ ability to pay for service in a timely manner, among other items. We canprovide no
 assurance that our customers’ historical payment pattern will continue in the future. Sometimes our current liabilities exceed current assets mainly fromdebt
 maturities due within one year and the periodic use of short-term debt as a funding source, primarily to meet scheduled maturities of long-term debt, fundacquisitions
 and  construction  projects,  as  well  as  cash  needs  which  can  fluctuate  significantly  due  to  the  seasonality  of  the  business.  We  address  cash  timingdifferences through the 
aforementioned liquidity funding mechanisms.61

Changes in working capital include changes to receivables and unbilled revenues, accounts payable and accrued l iabilities, and other current assets and liabilities, net.In 
2018 ,  cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $63  million ,  primarily due to lower revenues as a result of the enactment of the TCJA andchanges
 in  working  capital.  These  decreases  are  partially  offset  by  an  increase  in  net  income.  The  main  factors  contributing  to  the  net  income  increase  aredescribed in this section und
er “Consolidated Results of Operations” and included higher operating revenue and a lower provision for income taxes.In 
2017 ,  cash flows provided by operations increased $160  million ,  primarily due to an increase in net income after non-cash adjustments, including theimpact of the enactment of the TCJA, and an increase in cash flows from workin
g capital. The main factors contributing to the net income increase are described inthe
 “Consolidated  Results  of  Operations”  section  and  include  higher  operating  revenues,  partially  offset  by  higher  income  taxes  due  to  a $125  million re- measurement
 charge resulting from the impact of the change in the federal tax rate on the Company’s deferred income taxes from the enactment of the TCJA. Theincrease
 in  non-cash  activities  was  mainly  attributable  to  the  increase  in  deferred  income  taxes,  as  mentioned  above,  and  an  increase  in  depreciation  andamortization
 due to additional utility plant placed in service. The change in working capital was principally due to (i) the timing of accounts payable and accruedliabilities,
 including  the  accrual  recorded  during  2016  for  the  binding  global  agreement  in  principle  to  settle  claims  associated  with  the  Freedom  Industrieschemical
 spill in West Virginia, (ii) a decrease in unbilled revenues as a result of our Military  Services Group achieving  significant capital project milestonesduring
 2016,  and  (iii)  a  change  in  other  current  assets  and  liabilities,  including  the  decrease  in  other  current  assets  associated  with  the  termination  ofour four forward starting swap ag
reements and timing of payments clearing our cash accounts.The Company expects
 to make pension contributions to the plan trusts of up to $31 million in 2019 . In  addition, we estimate that contributions will amountto 
$32 million , $29 million , $29 million and $29 million in 2020 , 2021 , 2022 and 2023 ,  respectively. Actual amounts contributed could change materially fromthese estimates as a 
result of changes in assumptions and actual investment returns, among other factors.Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities

Table of ContentsIn 
2018 and 2017 ,  cash flows used in investing activities increased primarily due to an increase in our regulated capital expenditures, principally fromincremental
 investments associated with the replacement and renewal of our transmission and distribution infrastructure in our Regulated  Businesses ,  as well asacquisitions in both our 
Regulated Businesses and Market-Based Businesses , as discussed below. Our
 infrastructure  investment  plan  consists  of  both  infrastructure  renewal  programs,  where  we  replace  infrastructure,  as  needed,  and  major  capitalinvestment
 projects, where we construct new water and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities to meet new customer growth and water quality regulations.Our projected capital 
expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors.The following table provides a su

$ 1,586  $1,434  $1,311 In 
2018 ,  our capital expenditures increased $152  million ,  or 10.6% ,  primarily due to investment across the majority of our infrastructure categories. In2017 
, our capital expenditur es increased $123 million , or 9.4% , primarily due to invest ment in our general structure and equipment and wastewater categories.We
 also grow our business primarily through acquisitions of water and wastewater systems, as well as other water-related services. These acquisitions arecomplementary
 to  our  existing  business  and  support  continued  geographical  diversification  and  growth  of  our  operations.  Generally,  acquisitions  are  fundedinitially with short-t
erm debt, and later refinanced with the proceeds from long-term debt.The following is a summary of th
e acquisitions and dispositions affecting our cash flows from investing activities:2018 
: •
The majority of cash paid for acquisitions pertained to the $365 million purchase of Pivotal within our Homeowner Services Group . •
Paid $33 million for 15 water and wastewater systems, representing approximately 14,000 customers. •
Received $35  million for  the sale of assets, including $27  million for  the sale of the majority of the O&M contracts in our Contract  Services Groupduring the third quarter o
f 2018.2017 
: •
The  majority of cash paid for acquisitions pertained to the $159  million purchase  of the wastewater collection and treatment system assets of theMunicipal
 Authority of the City of McKeesport, Pennsylvania (the “McKeesport system”), excluding a $5  million non-escrowed  deposit made in2016.

Includes  proceeds  from  issuances  of  common  stock  under  various  employee  stock  plans  and  our  dividend  reinvestment  plan,  net  of  taxes  paid,  advances  and  contributions  forconstruction, net of refunds, and debt issuance costs and make-whole premium on early debt redemption.
In
 2018, cash flows provided by financing activities increased $519  million ,  primarily due to the issuance of common stock to finance a portion of thepurchase
 price  of  the  Pivotal  acquisition  and  a  decrease  in  cash  used  for  short-term  borrowings.  Short-term  borrowings  were  used  to  fund  the  growth  of  ourRegulated Businesses 
, finance approximate ly 50% of the Pivotal acquisition, pay dividends and repay long-term debt, offset by the use of the  $1.325 billion  long- term debt issuance to suppor
t growth of the business and repay short-term borrowings.Our
 financing  activities,  primarily  focused  on  funding  regulated  infrastructure  expenditures,  regulated  and  market-based  acquisitions  and  payment  ofdividends.
 These  activities  included  the  issuance  of  long-term  and  short-term  debt,  primarily  through  AWCC  and  in  2018,  included  an  equity  issuance  forapproximately
 50% of the Pivotal acquisition. In addition, new infrastructure may be funded with customer advances and contributions in aid of construction, netof
 refunds, which amounted to $21  million , $28 million and $16 million for  the years ended December  31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 ,  respectively. Based on theneeds
 of our Regulated  Businesses and  the Company, AWCC may borrow funds or issue its debt in the capital markets and then, through intercompany loans,provide
 those  borrowings  to  the Regulated  Businesses and  the parent  company.  The Regulated  Businesses and  the  parent  company  are  obligated  to  pay  theirportion
 of the respective principal and interest to AWCC, in the amount necessary to enable AWCC to meet its debt service obligations. The parent company’sborrowings
 are not a source of capital for the Regulated  Businesses ,  therefore, the parent company is not able to recover the interest charges on its debt throughregulated
 water  and  wastewater  rates.  As  of December  31,  2018 ,  AWCC  has  made  long-term  fixed  rate  loans  and  commercial  paper  loans  to  our Regulated Businesses 
amounting  to $4.4  billion and $392 million ,  respectively. Additionally, as of December  31, 2018 ,  AWCC has made long-term fixed rate loans andcommercial
 paper loans to the parent company amounting $1.7  billion and $533 million ,  respectively. As of December  31, 2018 ,  the parent company has madelong-term fixed rat
e loans to our Market-Based Businesses amounting to $183 million related to the acquis ition of Pivotal on June 4, 2018 . On
  August  9,  2018 ,  AWCC  completed  a   $1.325  billion  debt  offering  which  included  the  sale  of   $625  million  aggregate  principal  amount  of  itsunsecured
  3.75%  Senior  Notes due in 2028, and  $700  million  aggregate  principal amount of its unsecured  4.20%  Senior  Notes due in 2048. At the closing ofthe
 offering, AWCC received, after deduction of underwriting discounts and before deduction of offering expenses, net proceeds of approximately $1.3  billion . AWCC
 used proceeds from the offering to (i) lend funds to American Water and its regulated operating subsidiaries, (ii) repay $191  million principal  amount ofAWCC’s 
5.62% Senior Notes due 2018 upon maturity on Dece mber 21, 2018, (iii) prepay $100 million aggregate principal amount of AWCC’s outstanding 5.62% Series
 E Senior Notes due March 29, 2019 (the “Series E Notes”) and $100  million aggregate  principal amount of AWCC’s outstanding 5.77% Series  F SeniorNotes due
 March 29, 2022 (the “Series F Notes,” and, together with the Series E Notes, the “Series Notes”), and (iv) repay AWCC’s commercial paper obligationsand for general corpora
te purposes.As
 a result of AWCC’s prepayment of the Series Notes, a make-whole premium of $10  million was  paid to the holders thereof on September 11, 2018.Substantially
 all of the early debt extinguishment costs were allocable to our utility subsidiaries and recorded as regulatory assets, as we believe they are probableof recovery in future rates.

Table of ContentsOn 
August 6, 2018 ,  the Company terminated four forward starting swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of  $400  million ,  realizing a netgain of  
$9 million , to be amortized through in terest, net over 10 - and  30 -year periods, in correlation with the terms of the new debt issued on August 9, 2018 . On 
August 17, 2018 ,  we entered into two forward starting swap agreements, each with a notional amount of  $80 million ,  to reduce interest rate exposureon
 debt  expected  to  be  issued  in  2019.  These  forward  starting  swap  agreements  terminate  in August  2019 and  have  an  average  fixed  rate  of   2.98% .  OnOctober 11, 2018 
, we entered into two additiona l forward starting swap agreements, each with a notional amount of  $100 million , to reduce interest r ate exposureon
 debt expected to be issued in 2019. These forward starting swap agreements terminate in December  2019 ,  and have an average fixed rate of  3.31% .  OnJanuary 8, 2019 
, we  entered into an additional forward starting swap agreement, with a notional amount of  $150 million , to  reduce interest rate exposure on debtexpected
 to be issued in 2019. This forward starting swap agreement terminates in December 2019 ,  and has an average fixed rate of  2.76% . We have designated these forward starting
 swap agreements as cash flow hedges, with their fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss. Upon termination, thecumulative gain or loss r
ecorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss will be amortized through interest, net over the term of the new debt.One
 of  the  principal  market  risks  to  which  the  Company  is  exposed  is  changes  in  interest  rates.  In  order  to  manage  the  exposure,  we  follow  riskmanagement policies
 and procedures, including the use of derivative contracts such as swaps. We reduce exposure to interest rates by managing commercial paperand
 debt maturities. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and do not use leveraged instruments. The derivative contracts entered intoare
 for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures. The Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meettheir
 contractual  obligations.  We  minimize  the  counterparty  credit  risk  on  these  transactions  by  only  dealing  with  leading,  credit-worthy  financial  institutions,having long-term credi
t ratings of “A” or better.On 
April 11, 2018 ,  we effected an equity forward transaction by entering into a forward sale agreement with each of two forward purchasers in connectionwith a public offering of 
2,320,000 shares of our common stock. In th e equity forward transaction, the forward purchasers, or an affiliate, borrowed an aggregate of2,320,000 
shares  of our common stock from third  parties  and sold them  to the underwriters  in the public  offering.  On June  7, 2018 ,  we elected  to fully  andphysically
 settle both forward sale agreements, resulting in the issuance of a total of 2,320,000 shares  of our common stock at a price of $79.01 per  share, foraggregate
 net proceeds of $183 million .  The net proceeds of the transaction were used to pay a portion of the purchase price of the Pivotal acquisition on June 4, 2018 
. In
 May 2018, the parent company and AWCC filed with the SEC a universal shelf registration statement that enables us to meet our capital needs throughthe
 offer and sale to the public from time to time of an unlimited amount of various types of securities, including American Water common stock, preferred stock,and
 other equity and hybrid securities, and AWCC debt securities, all subject to market conditions and demand, general economic conditions, and as applicable,rating
 status.  The  shelf  registration  statement  will  expire  in  May  2021.  During 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , $1.325  billion , $1.350  billion and $550  million , respectively,
 of debt securities were issued pursuant to this and predecessor registration statements. Additionally, during 2018 under this registration statement, weissued 
2,320,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $79.01 per share, for aggregat e net proceeds of $183 million . The following table provides th

From
 time to time and as market conditions warrant, we may engage in long-term debt retirements through tender offers, open market repurchases or otherviable alternatives to strengt
hen our balance sheets.In
 February 2015, our Board of Directors authorized an anti-dilutive, common stock repurchase program to mitigate the effect of shares issued through ourdividend
 reinvestment, employee stock purchase and executive compensation activities. The program allows the Company to purchase up to 10  million shares of its
 outstanding common stock, over an unrestricted period of time, in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The program is conducted inaccordance
 with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, and to facilitate the repurchases, we have also entered into Rule 10b5-1 share repurchase plans with a third-party
 broker, which allows us to repurchase shares at times when we may otherwise be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed
 trading blackout periods. Subject to applicable regulations, we may elect to amend or cancel this repurchase program or the share repurchase parametersat our discretion. As of 
December 31, 2018 , we have repurchased an aggreg ate of 4,510,000 shares of common stock under th is program.Credit Facilities and Short-Term Debt
We
 have an unsecured revolving credit facility of $2.25 billion that  expires in June 2023. In March 2018, AWCC and its lenders amended and restated thecredit
 agreement with respect to AWCC’s revolving credit facility to increase the maximum commitments under the facility from $1.75  billion to $2.25 billion , and
 to extend the expiration date of the facility from June 2020 to March 2023. All other terms, conditions and covenants with respect to the existing facilityremained unchanged. Subject to satisfying certain
 conditions, the credit agreement also permits AWCC to increase the maximum commitment under the facility byup to an aggregate of  
$500 million , and to request extensions of i ts expiration date for up to two, one-year periods.  Interest rates on advan
ces under the facility are based on a credit spread to the LIBOR rate or base rate in accordance with Moody Investors Service’s andStandard & Poor’s Financial Servi
ces’ then applicable credit rating on AWCC’s senior unsecured, non-credit enhanced debt. The facility is used principally tosupport AWCC’s commercial pape
r program and to provide up to $150 million in letters of credi t. Indebtedness under the facility is considered “debt” for purposesof a support agreement be
tween the Company and AWCC, which serves as a functional equivalent of a guarantee by the Company of AWCC’s paymentobligations under the cred
it facility.AWCC
 also has an outstanding commercial paper program that is backed by the revolving credit facility, the maximum aggregate outstanding amount ofwhich was increased in March 2018, f
rom $1.60 billion to $2.10 billion . The

Our
 debt agreements contain financial and non-financial covenants. To the extent that we are not in compliance with these covenants, an event of defaultmay
 occur under one or more debt agreements and we or our subsidiaries may be restricted in our ability to pay dividends, issue new debt or access our revolvingcredit
 facility. Our long-term debt indentures contain a number of covenants that, among other things, prohibit or restrict the Company from issuing debt securedby the Company’s assets, subject to 
certain exceptions. Our failure to comply with any of these covenants could accelerate repayment obligations.Covenants
 in certain long-term notes and the revolving credit facility require us to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization (asdefined in
 the relevant documents) of not more than 0.70 to 1.00. On December 31, 2018 , our ratio was 0.59 to 1.00 and  therefore we were in compliance with thecovenants.
Security Ratings
Our
 access to the capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and respective financing costs in those markets, may be directly affected by oursecurities
 ratings.  We  primarily  access  the  debt  capital  markets,  including  the  commercial  paper  market,  through  AWCC.  However,  we  have  also  issued  debtthrough our regulated subsidia
ries, primarily in the form of tax exempt securities or borrowings under state revolving funds, to lower our overall cost of debt.The following table provides our 
long-term and short-term credit rating and rating outlook as of February 19, 2019 : Securities

 P-2  A-1 On
 June 11, 2018, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Service affirmed the Company’s long-term ‘A’ and short-term ‘A-1’ credit ratings, with a stable outlookremaining unchanged.
On January 19,
 2018, Moody’s Investors Service changed its rating outlook to negative, from stable, for 24 regulated utilities and utility holding companies,including the Company, all of which we
re primarily impacted by the enactment of the TCJA.A
 security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning ratingagency,
 and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Security ratings are highly dependent upon our ability to generate cash flows in anamount
 sufficient to service our debt and meet our investment plans. We can provide no assurances that our ability to generate cash flows is sufficient to maintainour
 existing  ratings.  None  of  our  borrowings  are  subject  to  default  or  prepayment  as  a  result  of  the  downgrading  of  these  security  ratings,  although  such  adowngrading could increase fe
es and interest charges under our credit facility.68

Table of ContentsAs
 part of the normal course of business, we routinely enter into contracts for the purchase and sale of water, energy, chemicals and other services. Thesecontracts
 either  contain express provisions or otherwise permit  us and our counterparties  to demand adequate  assurance  of future performance  when there arereasonable
 grounds for doing so. In accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law, if we are downgraded by a credit rating agency, especially if suchdowngrade
 is to a level below investment grade, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand foradequate
 assurance  of  future  performance,  which  could  include  a  demand  that  we  provide  collateral  to  secure  our  obligations.  We  do  not  expect  to  post  anycollateral which will h
ave a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Dividends and Regulatory Restrictions
For
 discussion  of  our  dividends,  dividend  restrictions  and  dividend  policy,  see Note  9—Shareholders'  Equity in  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  FinancialStatements for addition
al information.Insurance Coverage
We
 carry various property, casualty and financial insurance policies with limits, deductibles and exclusions that we believe are consistent with industrystandards.
 However, insurance coverage may not be adequate or available to cover unanticipated losses or claims. Additionally, annual policy renewals can beimpacted
 by claims experience which in turn can impact coverage terms and conditions on a going-forward basis. We are self-insured to the extent that losses arewithin
 the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. Such losses could have a material  adverse effect on our short-term and long-termfinancial condition and ou
r results of operations and cash flows.Contractual Obligations and Commitments
We

Table of ContentsPublic-Private
Partnerships
WVAWC
 has  entered  into  a  series  of  agreements  with  various  public  entities,  which  we  refer  to  as  the  Partners,  to  establish  certain  joint  ventures,commonly
 referred to as “public-private partnerships.” Under the public-private partnerships, WVAWC constructed utility plant, financed by WVAWC, and thePartners
 constructed  utility  plant  (connected  to  WVAWC’s  property),  financed  by  the  Partners.  WVAWC  agreed  to  transfer  and  convey  some  of  its  real  andpersonal
 property  to  the  Partners  in  exchange  for  an  equal  principal  amount  of  Industrial  Development  Bonds,  commonly  referred  to  as  IDBs,  issued  by  thePartners
 under a state Industrial Development Bond and Commercial Development Act. WVAWC leased back the total facilities, including portions funded byboth WVAWC and the Partners, under leas
es for a period of 40 years.The
 leases have payments that approximate the payments required by the terms of the IDBs. These payments are considered “PILOT payments” whichrepresent
 payments that WVAWC otherwise would pay as property taxes on the properties. We have presented the transaction on a net basis on the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements.
 The carrying value of the transferred facilities, which is presented in property, plant and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, wasapproximately 
$147 million as of December 31, 2018 . Performance

We
 have entered into agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the United States military, municipalities and othercustomers.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of finan
cial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates, assumptions andjudgments
 that could affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Actual results could differ from these estimates, assumptionsand
 judgments. Management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimatesand
 assumptions  in  matters  that  are  inherently  uncertain  and  that  may  change  in  subsequent  periods.  Accordingly,  changes  in  the  estimates,  assumptions  andjudgments
 applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as reflected in ourConsolidated
 Financial  Statements.  Management  has  reviewed  the  critical  accounting  polices  described  below  with  our  Audit,  Finance  and  Risk  Committee,including
 the  estimates,  assumptions  and  judgments  used  in  their  application.  Additional  discussion  regarding  these  critical  accounting  policies  and  theirapplication can be found in 
Note 2—Significant Accounting Polic ies in the Notes to Consolidated Financi al Statements.Regulation and Regulatory Accounting
Our regulated utilities are generally subject to economic regulation by PUCs and
, as such, we follow the authoritative accounting principles required for rateregulated
 utilities,  which  requires  us  to  reflect  the  effects  of  rate  regulation  in  our  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  Use  of  this  authoritative  guidance  isapplicable
 to utility operations that meet the following criteria: (i) third-party regulation of rates; (ii) cost-based rates; and (iii) a reasonable assumption that rateswill
 be set to recover the estimated costs of providing service, plus a return on net investment, or rate base. As of December  31, 2018 ,  we concluded that theoperations of our utilitie
s met the criteria.Application of this authori
tative guidance has a further effect on our financial statements as it pertains to allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. Wemake
 significant assumptions and estimates to quantify amounts recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities. Such judgments include, but are not limited to, assetsand
 liabilities  related  to  regulated  acquisitions,  pension  and  postretirement  benefits,  depreciation  rates  and  taxes.  Due  to  timing  and  other  differences  in  thecollection
 of  revenues,  these  authoritative  accounting  principles  allow  a  cost  that  would  otherwise  be  charged  as  an  expense  by  a  non-regulated  entity,  to  bedeferred
 as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates. Conversely, the principles require the creation of a regulatoryliability
 for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future, or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable tocustomers. Regulators may a
lso impose certain fines or penalties.For
 each regulatory jurisdiction where we conduct business, we assess, at the end of each reporting period, whether the regulatory assets and liabilitiescontinue to
 meet the criteria for probable, future recovery or settlement. This assessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in applicable regulatoryenvironments;
 recent rate orders on recovery of a specific or similar incurred cost to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction and the status of any pendingor
 potential legislation that could impact the ability to recover costs through regulated rates. If subsequent events indicate that the regulatory assets or liabilities nolonger
 meet the criteria for probable, future recovery or settlement, our Consolidated Statements of Operations and financial position could be materially affected.In
 addition,  if  we  conclude  in  a  future  period  that  a  separable  portion  of  the  business  no  longer  meets  the  criteria,  we  are  required  to  eliminate  the  financialstatement effec
ts of regulation for that part of the business, which would include the elimination of any or all regulatory assets and liabilities that had been recordedin the Consolidated Financial St
atements. Failure to meet the criteria of this authoritative guidance could materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements.70

Table of ContentsOn 
December 22, 2017 ,  the TCJA was signed into law, which, among other things, enacted significant and complex changes to the Internal Revenue Codeof
 1986, including a reduction in the maximum U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as  of January 1, 2018. The TCJA created significantexcess
 deferred income taxes that we and our regulatory jurisdictions believe should be refunded to customers. As such, we recorded these amounts as regulatoryliabilities.
As
 of December  31, 2018 and 2017 ,  our regulatory asset balance was $1.2  billion and $1.1 billion ,  respectively, and our regulatory liability balance was$1.9 billion 
and $1.7 billion , respectively. See Note 7—Regulatory Assets and Liabili ties in the Notes to Consolidated Financi al Statements for further informationregarding our significan
t regulatory assets and liabilities.Goodwill
As
 of December  31, 2018 and 2017 ,  our goodwill balances were $1.6  billion and $1.4 billion ,  respectively. In accordance with GAAP, goodwill must beallocated
 at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below, and tested for impairment at least annually. We perform ourannual impairment
 testing of goodwill as of November 30 of  each year, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely thannot, reduce the fair value
 of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Adverse industry or economic trends, lower projections of profitability, or a sustained declinein
 our market capitalization, among other things, may be indicators of potential goodwill impairment issues, requiring further testing of a reporting unit’s carryingvalue.
Entities
 testing goodwill for impairment have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether quantitative testing is necessary.In
 performing a qualitative assessment, we assess and make judgments, among other things, around macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions,overall
 financial  performance,  cost  factors  and  entity  specific  events.  These  factors  require  significant  judgment  and  estimates,  and  application  of  alternativeassumptions could
 produce significantly different results. If it is determined, based upon qualitative factors, that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is morelikely
 than not, greater than its carrying value, no further testing is required. If we bypass the qualitative assessment, or perform the qualitative assessment anddetermine that
 the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying value, a quantitative, fair value-based test is performed. Thisquantitative
 test  compares  the  estimated  fair  value  of  the  reporting  unit  to  its  respective  net  carrying  value,  including  goodwill,  on  the  measurement  date.  Animpairment
 loss will be recognized in the amount equal to the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value compared to its estimated fair value, limited to the totalamount of goodwill allocat
ed to that reporting unit.Application
 of goodwill impairment testing requires management judgment, including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value ofreporting
 units. We estimate fair value using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market multiples analysis. Significant assumptions used inthese
 fair value analyses include, but are not limited to, forecasts of future operating results, discount and growth rates, capital expenditures, tax rates, workingcapital,
 weighted  average  cost  of  capital  and  projected  terminal  values. Changes  in  estimates  or  the  application  of  alternative  assumptions  could  producesignificantly
 different results. See Note 8—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in  the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional informationregarding our goodwill.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived
 assets  include  property,  plant  and  equipment,  goodwill,  intangible  assets  and  long-term  investments.  We  evaluate  our  long-lived  assets  forimpairment when circumstances indicate the
 carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significantdecrease
 in the market value of the asset, a change in the asset’s expected useful life or physical condition, a history of operating or cash flow losses associatedwith
 the use of the asset or a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or is planned to be used. When such indicators arise, weestimate
 the fair value of the long-lived asset from future cash flows expected to result from its use and, if applicable, the eventual disposition of the asset, andcompare
 the estimated value fair to the carrying value of the asset. An impairment loss will be recognized in the amount equal to the excess of the long-livedasset’s
 carrying value compared to its estimated fair value. Key variables that must be estimated include assumptions regarding sales volume, rates, operatingcosts,
 labor  and  other  benefit  costs,  capital  additions,  assumed  discount  rates  and  other  economic  factors.  These  variables  require  management  judgment  andinclude
 inherent  uncertainties,  since  they  are  forecasting  future  events.  A  variation  in  the  assumptions  used  could  lead  to  a  different  conclusion  regarding  therealizability of 
a long-lived asset and, thus, could have a significant effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.The long-lived
 assets of our Regulated Businesses are  grouped on a separate entity basis for impairment testing, as they are integrated state-wide operationsthat
 do not have the option to curtail service and generally have uniform tariffs. A regulatory asset is charged to earnings if and when future recovery in rates ofthat asset is no longer probab
le.The Company holds other investments in
 privately held companies and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method. The estimated fair value of thelong-term
 investments are dependent on the financial performance and solvency of the entities in which the Company invests, as well as volatility inherent in theexternal
 markets.  If  such  long-term  investments  are  considered  impaired,  an  impairment  loss  will  be  recognized  in  the  amount  equal  to  the  excess  of  theinvestment’s carrying v
alue compared to its estimated fair value.71

Table of ContentsThe
 Company believes the assumptions and other considerations used to value long-lived assets to be appropriate, however, if actual experience differsfrom the assumptions and
 considerations used in its estimates, the resulting change could have a material adverse impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.Revenue Recognition
Revenue
 from the Company’s Regulated Businesses is generated  primarily  from water and wastewater  services  delivered  to customers.  These contractscontain
 a single performance obligation, the delivery of water or wastewater services, as the promise to transfer the individual good or service is not separatelyidentifiable
 from  other  promises  within  the  contracts  and,  therefore,  is  not  distinct.  Revenues  are  recognized  over  time,  as  services  are  provided.  There  aregenerally
 no significant financing components or variable consideration. Revenues include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis, and unbilled amountscalculated
 based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill, to the end of the accounting period. The amountsthat
 the Company has a right to invoice are determined by each customer’s actual usage, an indicator that the invoice amount corresponds directly to the valuetransferred to the customer.
Increases
 or decreases  in the volumes  delivered  to  customers  and rate  mix due  to changes  in usage patterns  in customer  classes  in the  period  could besignificant to the ca
lculation of unbilled revenue. In addition, changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled foreach
 meter reading date would also have an effect on the unbilled revenue calculation. Unbilled revenue for our regulated utilities as of December  31, 2018 and 2017 
was $144 million and $152 million , respectively. The
 Company also recognizes revenue when it is probable that future recovery of previously incurred costs or future refunds that are to be credited tocustomers will occur through 
the ratemaking process.Revenue
 from the Company’s Homeowner  Services Group is  generated  through various  protection  programs  in which the Company provides fixed  feeservices
 to domestic homeowners and smaller commercial customers to protect against repair costs for interior and external water and sewer lines, interior electricand
 gas lines, heating and cooling systems, water heaters, power surge protection and other related services. Most of the contracts have a one-year term and eachservice
 is a separate performance obligation, satisfied over time, as the customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided from the service.Customers
 are obligated to pay for the protection programs ratably over 12 months or via a one-time, annual fee, with revenues recognized ratably over time forthese services. Adva
nces from customers are deferred until the performance obligation is satisfied.The
 Company also has long-term, fixed fee contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater facilities with the U.S. government on various militarybases and
 facilities owned by municipal and industrial customers, as well as shorter-term contracts that provide customized water transfer services for shale naturalgas
 companies and customers. Billing and revenue recognition for the fixed fee revenues occurs ratably over the term of the contract, as customers simultaneouslyreceive
 and  consume  the  benefits  provided  by  the  Company.  Additionally,  these  contracts  allow  the  Company  to  make  capital  improvements  to  underlyinginfrastructure, which are initiated
 through separate modifications or amendments to the original contract, whereby stand-alone, fixed pricing is separately stated foreach
 improvement. The Company has determined that these capital improvements are separate performance obligations, with revenue recognized over time basedon
 performance completed at the end of each reporting period. Losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the losses first become probable andestimable.
 Revenues  recognized  during  the  period  in  excess  of  billings  on  construction  contracts  are  recorded  as  unbilled  revenues,  with  billings  in  excess  ofrevenues recorded as other
 current liabilities until the recognition criteria are met. Changes in contract performance and related estimated contract profitability mayresult
 in revisions to costs and revenues, and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined. Unbilled revenue for our Market-Based Businesses as of 
December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $42 million and $60 million , respectively. Accounting for Income Taxes
Significant
 management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken,as well as deferred tax 
assets and liabilities, valuation allowances and the utilization of NOL carryforwards.In
 accordance  with  applicable  authoritative  guidance,  we account  for uncertain  income  tax positions  using a benefit  recognition  model  with a two-stepapproach,
 including a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50%likely
 of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not more-likely-than-not that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits, nobenefit
 is  recorded.  Uncertain  tax  positions  that  relate  only  to  timing  of  when  an  item  is  included  on  a  tax  return  are  considered  to  have  met  the  recognitionthreshold.
 Management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position, assuming the position will beexamined
 by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition thresholdhas been met and, if so, the app
ropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefit to be recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements.72

Table of ContentsWe
 evaluate  the  probability  of  realizing  deferred  tax  assets  quarterly  by  reviewing  a  forecast  of  future  taxable  income  and  our  intent  and  ability  toimplement
 tax planning strategies, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. We also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form ofcarryforwards,
 for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. We record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when weconclude it is more-l
ikely-than-not such benefit will not be realized in future periods.Under
 GAAP,  specifically  Accounting  Standards  Codification  Topic  740, Income 
Taxes
(“ASC  740”),  the  tax  effects  of  changes  in  tax  laws  must  berecognized
 in the period in which the law is enacted. ASC 740 also requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected toapply
 when temporary differences are to be realized or settled. Thus, at the date of enactment of the TCJA, the Company’s deferred taxes were re-measured basedupon the
 new tax rate. For our regulated entities, the change in deferred taxes are recorded as either an offset to a regulatory asset or liability and may be subject torefund to customers. For our unregu
lated operations, the change in deferred taxes are recorded as a non-cash re-measurement adjustment to earnings.The staff of the
 SEC has recognized the complexity of reflecting the impacts of changes in tax law, more specifically the TCJA, and on December 22, 2017,issued
 guidance in SAB 118 which clarifies accounting for income taxes under ASC 740 if information is not yet available or complete and provides for up to aone
 year period in which to complete the required analyses and accounting. SAB 118 describes three scenarios or buckets associated with a company’s status ofaccounting
 for the TCJA: (i) a company is complete with its accounting for certain effects of tax reform; (ii) a company is able to determine a reasonable estimatefor
 certain effects of tax reform and records that estimate as a provisional amount; or (iii) a company is not able to determine a reasonable estimate and thereforecontinues
 to apply ASC 740, based on the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to the TCJA being enacted. The significant assumptionsconsidered and evaluated by 
the Company relating to accounting for the TCJA, include, but are not limited to, the:•
recording  of regulatory liabilities from the re-measurement of the Company’s deferred income taxes, and the uncertainty of regulatory treatment invarious jurisdictions in which 
the Company currently operates;•
allocation to our subsidia ries of interest deductibility at the parent;•
bonus  depreciation deductions for assets constructed and placed in service during the period from September 28, 2017 through December 31, 2017;and
•
normalization periods for our re-measured deferred taxes.Actual
 income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, our forecastedfinancial
 condition and results of operations, failure to successfully implement tax planning strategies and recovery of taxes through the regulatory process for ourRegulated
 Businesses ,  as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities. While we believe the resulting tax balances as ofDecember
 31, 2018 and 2017 are  appropriately accounted for in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance, the ultimate outcome of tax matters couldresult
 in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our Consolidated Financial Statements and such adjustments could be material. See Note  14—Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financia
l Statements for additional information regarding income taxes.Accounting for Pension and Postretirement Benefits
We
 maintain noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of our regulated utility and shared service operations. See Note 15 —Employee
 Benefits in  the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the description of and accounting for the definedbenefit pension plans and postr
etirement benefit plans.The Company’s pension and postretirement
 benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions providedby
 the Company to its actuaries, including the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Material changes in the Company’s pension andpostretirement
 benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets. The assumptions are selected torepresent
 the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overalleconomy.
 These differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the Company recognizes. The primary assumptionsare:
•
Discount Rate—The  discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which are based on projections of benefit payments to be madein
 the future. The objective in selecting the discount rate is to measure the single amount that, if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio ofhigh-quality debt instrum
ents, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due.•
Expected  Return  on  Plan  Assets  (“EROA”)—Management  projects  the  future  return  on  plan  assets  considering  prior  performance,  but  primarilybased
 upon the plans’ mix of assets and expectations for the long-term returns on those asset classes. These projected returns reduce the net benefitcosts we record currently.
•
Rate  of  Compensation  Increase—Management  projects  employees’  pay  increases,  which  are  used  to  project  employees’  pension  benefits  atretirement.
73

Table of Contents•
Health Care Cost Trend Rate—Manage ment projects the expected increases in the cost of health care.•
Mortality—Management  retained the Society of Actuaries RP-2014 mortality base table, which provides rates of mortality in 2006, but adopted thenew MP-2018 mortality improvem
ent scale to gradually adjust future mortality rates downward due to increased longevity in each year after 2006.The discount rate assumption, which is
 determined for the pension and postretirement benefit plans independently, is subject to change each year, consistentwith
 changes in applicable high-quality, long-term corporate bond indices. We use an approach that approximates the process of settlement of obligations tailoredto the
 plans’ expected cash flows by matching the plans’ cash flows to the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds. For each plan, thediscount
 rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would yield the same present value as using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments.The
 discount rate for determining pension benefit obligations was 4.38% , 3.75% and 4.28% at December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 ,  respectively. The discountrate for determin
ing other postretirement benefit obligations was 4.32% , 3.73% and 4.26% at December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. In
 selecting an EROA, we considered tax implications, past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans. The long-term
 EROA assumption used in calculating pension cost was 5.95% for 2018 , 6.49% for 2017 ,  and 7.02% for 2016 .  The weighted average EROA assumptionused in calculating othe
r postretirement benefit costs was 4.77% for 2018 , 5.09% for 2017 and 5.37% for 2016 . The following table provides th
e allocations of the pension plan assets by asset category:

t trusts (“REITs”) 2 % 1 % 2 %Total
 100 % 100 % 100 %During
 2017, the Company reduced the risk of its investments in the pension plan by reducing its exposure to equities from 60% to 50%, and increasing itslong
 duration fixed-income allocation from 40% to 50%. This structure is designed to reduce the plan’s funded status volatility. It is also intended to reduce thepension
 plan’s  exposure  to  interest  rates  since  a  higher  proportion  of  long  duration  fixed-income  securities  that  have  a  duration  similar  to  that  of  the  pensionliabilities should reduce i
nterest rate risk associated with the plan’s liabilities.Postretirement
Medical
Bargain
ing
Plan
ChangesOn 
July 31, 2018 ,  a new, five -year national benefits agreement was ratified, covering approximately 3,200 of  our union-represented employees. Most ofthe
 benefits under this new agreement will become effective on January 1, 2019, and include, among other things, union-represented employees’ participation inthe
 Company’s cash-based annual performance plan, additional medical plan options and changes to certain retiree medical benefits, which required the Companyto remeasure its othe
r postretirement benefit plan obligation during the third quarter of 2018.For
 those eligible union retirees and dependents over age 65, the current supplemental retiree medical plan will be replaced with a Health ReimbursementArrangement
 (“HRA”) similar to the cap currently in place for non-union retirees. The Company is providing a subsidy allowing the post-65 retirees to purchase aMedicare
 supplemental plan on a private exchange network. The pre-65 coverage plan was also amended to provide a cap on future employer costs designed tolimit
 the employer costs to 2018 levels. For pre-65 union members retiring early in 2019-2021 a supplemental benefit will be provided to alleviate the effect of thecap.
On
  August  31, 2018 ,  the Postretirement Medical Benefit Plan was remeasured to reflect this plan change. The plan change resulted in a  $175  millionreduction
 in future benefits payable to plan participants, and, in combination with other experience reflected as of the remeasurement date, resulted in a  $227 million 
 reduction  to the net accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. The plan amendment will be amortized over  10.2 years,  the average future workinglifetime to full eligibility age for
 all plan participants.After
 the remeasurement, the Retirement and Benefit Plans Investment Committee (the “Investment Committee”), which is responsible for overseeing theinvestment
 of the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans’ assets, determined that the funded status of the Postretirement Medical BargainingPlan was in excess of that needed 
to pay current and future benefits. 74

Table of ContentsGiven
 the change in funded status, the Investment Committee commissioned a new asset-liability study for the Postretirement Medical Bargaining Plan.This
 study concluded that it was prudent to decrease the risk in the plan and to remove its equity exposure. The study also recommended reducing its exposure tochanges
 in interest rates by matching the assets of the plan to the projected cash flows for future benefit payments of the liability. The Investment Committeeagreed with the recomm
endations and approved the investment of the Postretirement Medical Bargaining Plan assets in fixed-income securities.The restructuring of the plan was initiated toward year-end. Once fully completed, the plan’s as
sets will be invested in fixed-income securities. The majorityof
 the securities will be used to match the projected cash flows for future benefit payments of the liability. Plan assets in excess of those securities designed tomatch the long-term 
liabilities will be invested in shorter duration securities with a duration of about three years.The following table provides th
e allocations of the other postretirement benefit plan assets by asset category:

The
 investments of the pension and postretirement welfare plan trusts include debt and equity securities held either directly or through commingled funds.The
 trustee for the Company’s defined benefit pension and postretirement  welfare plans uses an independent valuation firm to calculate the fair value of planassets.
 Additionally, the Company independently verifies the assets’ values. Approximately 88% of  the assets are valued using the quoted market price for theassets in an active market at
 the measurement date, while 12% of the assets are valued us ing other inputs.In
 selecting a rate of compensation increase, we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates. Our rate of compensation increase was3% 
for 2018 , 3.02% for 2017 and 3.07% for 2016 . In
 selecting health care cost trend rates, we consider past performance and forecasts of increases in health care costs. As of January 1, 2017, our health carecost
 trend rate assumption used to calculate the periodic cost was 7% in 2018 gradually  declining to 4.5% in 2026 and  thereafter. As of December  31, 2018 , the Company is projecting that m
edical inflation will be 6.75% in 2019 and, it will ultimately trend down to 5%, but not until 2026.  We
 will use a discount rate and EROA of 4.38% and 6.2% ,  respectively, for estimating our 2019 pension  costs. Additionally, we will use a discount rateand
 expected blended return based on weighted assets of 4.32% and 3.56% , respectively,  for estimating our 2019 other postretirement  benefit costs. A decrease inthe discount
 rate or the EROA would increase our pension expense. Our 2018 and 2017 pension and  postretirement benefit costs were $21 million and $56 million,
 respectively. The Company expects to make pension and postretirement benefit contributions to the plan trusts up to $31 million in 2019 , and $32 million , $29million 
, $29 million and $29 million in 2020 , 2021 , 2022 and 2023 ,  respectively. Actual amounts contributed could change significantly from these estimates.The
 assumptions are reviewed annually and at any interim re-measurement of the plan obligations. The impact of assumption changes is reflected in the recordedpension
 and postretirement benefit amounts as they occur, or over a period of time if allowed under applicable accounting standards. As these assumptions changefrom period to period, re
corded pension and postretirement benefit amounts and funding requirements could also change.Accounting for Contingencies
We record
 loss contingencies when management determines that the outcome of future events is probable of occurring and when the amount of the loss or arange
 of losses can be reasonably estimated. The determination of a loss contingency is based on management’s judgment and estimates about the likely outcomeof
 the matter, which may include an analysis of different scenarios. Liabilities are recorded or adjusted when events or circumstances cause these judgments orestimates
 to change. In assessing whether a loss is reasonably possible, management considers many factors, which include, but are not limed to: the nature of thelitigation,
 claim or assessment, review of applicable law, opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisors, and the experience gained from similar cases orsituations.
 We provide disclosures for material contingencies when management deems there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may beincurred.
 We provide estimates of reasonably possible losses when such estimates may be reasonably determined, either as a single amount or within a reasonablerange.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCL OSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe
 are exposed to market risk associated with changes in commodity prices, equity prices and interest rates. We are exposed to risks from changes ininterest
 rates as a result of our issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper. We manage our interest rate exposure by limiting our variable rateexposure
 and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. We also have the ability to enter into financial derivative instruments, which couldinclude
 instruments such as, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, forward starting swaps, swaptions and U.S. Treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigateinterest
 rate risk exposure. As of December  31, 2018 ,  a hypothetical increase of interest rates by 1% associated with our short-term borrowings would result in a$10 million 
increase in short-te rm interest expense.As
 of December  31, 2018 ,  the Company had four forward starting swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $360 million to reduce interestrate
 exposure on debt expected to be issued in 2019. The forward starting swap agreements terminate in 2019 and have an average fixed rate of 3.16% .  Whenentering
 into forward starting interest rate swaps, the Company is subject to market risk with respect to changes in the underlying benchmark interest rate thatimpacts
 the fair value of the forward starting interest rate swaps. We manage market risk by matching terms of the swaps with the critical terms of the expecteddebt
 issuance. The fair value of the forward starting swaps at December  31, 2018 was  in a loss position of $14  million .  A hypothetical 1% adverse change ininterest rates would resu
lt in a decrease in the fair value of our forward starting swaps of approximately $66 million at December 31, 2018 . On 
January 8, 2019 ,  we  entered  into  an  additional  forward  starting  swap  agreement,  with  a  notional  amount  of   $150  million ,  to reduce interest rateexposure on debt expected to be 
issued in 2019. This forward starting swap agreement terminates in December 2019 , and has an average fixed r ate of  2.76% . Our
 risks associated with price increases for chemicals, electricity and other commodities are reduced through contractual arrangements and the expectedability
 to  recover  price  increases  through  rates,  in  the  next  general  rate  case  proceeding  or  other  regulatory  mechanism,  as  authorized  by  each  regulatoryjurisdiction. Non-perform
ance by these commodity suppliers could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.The
 market price of our common stock may experience fluctuations, which may be unrelated to our operating performance. In particular, our stock pricemay be affected by gene
ral market movements as well as developments specifically related to the water and wastewater industry. These could include, among otherthings,
 interest rate movements, quarterly variations or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and governmental or regulatory actions. This volatilitymay
 make it difficult for us to access the capital markets in the future through additional offerings of our common stock, regardless of our financial performance,and such difficulty may pr
eclude us from being able to take advantage of certain business opportunities or meet business obligations.We
 are exposed to credit risk through our water, wastewater and other water-related  services provided by our Regulated  Businesses and Market-BasedBusinesses 
.  Our Regulated  Businesses serve  residential,  commercial,  industrial  and  other  customers  while  our Market-Based  Businesses engage  in  businessactivities
 with developers, government entities and other customers. Our primary credit risk is exposure to customer default on contractual obligations and theassociated
 loss that may be incurred due to the non-payment of customer accounts receivable balances. Our credit risk is managed through established credit andcollection
 policies  which  are  in  compliance  with  applicable  regulatory  requirements  and  involve  monitoring  of  customer  exposure  and  the  use  of  credit  riskmitigation
 measures  such  as  letters  of  credit  or  prepayment  arrangements.  Our  credit  portfolio  is  diversified  with  no  significant  customer  or  industryconcentrations.
 In  addition,  our Regulated  Businesses are  generally  able  to  recover  all  prudently  incurred  costs  including  uncollectible  customer  accountsreceivable expenses and 
collection costs through rates.The Company’s retirement trust assets are
 exposed to the market prices of debt and equity securities. Changes to the retirement trust asset values can impactthe
 Company’s  pension  and  other  benefits  expense,  funded  status  and  future  minimum  funding  requirements.  Changes  in  interest  rates  can  impact  retirementliabilities.
 We aim to reduce risk through asset diversification and by investing in long duration fixed-income securities that have a duration similar to that of ourpension
 liabilities, seeking to hedge some of the interest rate sensitivity of our liabilities. That way, if interest rates fall and liabilities increase, we expect that thefixed-income assets in ou
r retirement trust will also increase in value. We also expect our risk to be reduced through our ability to recover pension and other benefitcosts through rates.
76

Table of ContentsWe are
 also exposed to a potential national economic recession or deterioration in local economic conditions in the markets in which we operate. The creditquality
 of our customer accounts receivable is dependent on the economy and the ability of our customers to manage through unfavorable economic cycles andother
 market  changes.  In  addition,  there  can  be  no  assurances  that  regulators  will  grant  sufficient  rate  authorizations.  Therefore,  our  ability  to  fully  recoveroperating expense, recove
r our investment and provide an appropriate return on invested capital made in our Regulated Businesses may be adversely impacted. 77

any, Inc.Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Report
ingWe
 have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of  American  Water  Works  Company,  Inc.  and  its  subsidiaries (the  “Company”)  as  ofDecember
 31, 2018 and 2017 , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in shareholders’ equity foreach of the
 three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 , including the related notes (collectively  referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also
 have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December  31, 2018 ,  based on criteria established in Internal 
Control
-
IntegratedFramework
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Org anizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).In
 our opinion, the consolidated financial  statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as ofDecember 31, 2018 
and 2017 , and the results of its operations and its cash  flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 in conformity with
 accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effectiveinternal
 control over financial reporting as of December  31, 2018 ,  based on criteria established in Internal 
Control
-
Integrated
Framework
(2013) issued  by theCOSO.
Basis for Opinions
The
 Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,and
 for  its  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  Management's  Report  on  Internal  Control  over  FinancialReporting
 appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial  statements and on the Company's internalcontrol
 over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (UnitedStates)
 (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules andregulations of the Securi
ties and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We
 conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonableassurance
 about whether the consolidated financial  statements  are  free  of  material  misstatement,  whether  due  to  error  or  fraud,  and  whether  effective  internalcontrol over financial reporti
ng was maintained in all material respects.Our audits
 of the consolidated financial statements  included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
 whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidenceregarding
 the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial  statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significantestimates
 made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial  statements. Our audit of internal control over financialreporting
 included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists,  and  testing  andevaluating
 the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as weconsidered necessary in th
e circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.As described
 in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Pivotal Home Solutions from its assessment of internal
 control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2018. Wehave also excluded Pivotal Home Solution
s from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Pivotal Home Solutions is a wholly-owned subsidiary whosetotal
 assets  and  total  revenues  excluded  from  management’s  assessment  and  our  audit  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  represent  less  than 1% andapproximately 
2% , respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financia
l ReportingA
 company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reportingand
 the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control overfinancial
 reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions
 and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation offinancial
 statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made  only  inaccordance
 with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, us
e, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.79

Table of ContentsBecause
 of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness
 to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

 the  United  States  and  Ontario,  Canada.  The  Company’s  primary  business  involves  the  ownership  of  regulated  utilities  that  provide  water  andwastewater services in 
16 states in the United States, collectively referred to as the “ Regulated Businesses .” The  Company also operates market-based businessesthat
 provide a broad range of related and complementary water and wastewater services within non-reportable operating segments, collectively referred to as the “Market-Based
 Businesses .”  The  Company’s  primary Market-Based  Businesses include  the Homeowner  Services  Group ,  which  provides  warranty  protectionprograms to residential
 and smaller commercial customers; the Military Services Group , which  provides water and wastewater services to the U.S. government onmilitary installations; and Keystone Clearwater
 Solutions, LLC, which provides water transfer services for shale natural gas exploration and production companies.Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The
 accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of American Water and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest ismaintained
 after the elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. The Company uses the equity method to report its investments in joint ventures whereit holds up to a 
50% voting interest and cannot  exercise control over the operations and policies of the investments. Under the equity method, the Company recordsits interests as an inves
tment and its percentage share of the investee’s earnings as income or losses.In
 July  2015,  the  Company  acquired  a 95% interest  in  Water  Solutions  Holdings,  LLC,  including  its  wholly  owned  subsidiary,  Keystone  ClearwaterSolutions,
 LLC (collectively referred to as “Keystone”). During the fourth quarter of 2018, pursuant to the exercise of put options by the minority owners, theCompany
 acquired the remaining 5% interest in Keystone, bringing its ownership interest to  100% .  The former minority owners’ interest was recognized asredeemable
 noncontrolling  interest  and  was  included  in  Other  long-term  liabilities  on  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  There  was  no  remaining  redeemablenoncontrolling interest 
as of December 31, 2018 , and $7 million of redeemable noncontro lling interest as of December 31, 2017 . Use of Estimates
The
 preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  (“GAAP”)  requires  thatmanagement
 make estimates, assumptions and judgments that could affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Actual resultscould
 differ from these estimates, assumptions and judgments. The Company considers its critical accounting estimates to include (i) the application of regulatoryaccounting
 principles and the related determination and estimation of regulatory assets and liabilities, (ii) assumptions used in impairment testing of goodwill andlong-lived
 assets, including regulatory assets, (iii) revenue recognition and the estimates used in the calculation of unbilled revenue, (iv) accounting for incometaxes
 and  the  enacted  Tax  Cuts  and  Jobs  Act  (the  “TCJA”),  (v)  benefit  plan  assumptions  and  (vi)  the  estimates  and  judgments  used  in  determining  losscontingencies. The Company’s critical
 accounting estimates that are particularly sensitive to change in the near term are amounts reported for regulatory assets andliabilities, goodwill, in
come taxes, benefit plan assumptions and contingency-related obligations.Regulation
The
 Company’s  regulated  utilities  are  generally  subject  to  economic  regulation  by  certain  state  utility  commissions  or  other  entities  engaged  in  utilityregulation,
 collectively referred to as Public Utility Commissions (“PUCs” or “Regulators”). As such, the Company follows authoritative accounting principlesrequired
 for  rate  regulated  utilities,  which  requires  the  effects  of  rate  regulation  to  be  reflected  in  the  Company’s  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  PUCsgenerally
 authorize revenue at levels intended to recover the estimated costs of providing service, plus a return on net investments, or rate base. Regulators mayalso
 approve accounting treatments, long-term financing programs and cost of capital, operation and maintenance (“O&M”) expenses, capital expenditures, taxes,affiliated
 transactions and relationships, reorganizations, mergers, and acquisitions, along with imposing certain penalties or granting certain incentives. Due totiming
 and  other  differences  in  the  collection  of  a  regulated  utility’s  revenues,  these  authoritative  accounting  principles  allow  a  cost  that  would  otherwise  becharged
 as an expense by a non-regulated entity, to be deferred as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates. Conversely,these
 principles also require the creation of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future, or amountscollected in excess of 
costs incurred and are refundable to customers. See Note 7—Regulatory Assets and Liabili ties for additional information. 87

Table of ContentsProperty, Plant and Equipment
Property,
 plant and equipment consists primarily of utility plant utilized by the Company’s regulated utilities. Additions to utility plant and replacement ofretirement
 units of utility plant are capitalized and include costs such as materials, direct labor, payroll taxes and benefits, indirect items such as engineering andsupervision, transportation
 and an allowance for funds used during construction (“AFUDC”). Costs for repair, maintenance and minor replacements are charged toO&M expense as incurred.
The cost of utility pla
nt is depreciated using the straight-line average remaining life, group method. The Company’s regulated utilities record depreciation inconformity
 with amounts approved by PUCs, after regulatory review of the information the Company submits to support its estimates of the assets’ remaininguseful lives.
Nonutility
 property consists primarily of buildings and equipment utilized by the Company’s Market-Based  Businesses and  for internal operations. Thisproperty is stated at cos
t, net of accumulated depreciation, which is calculated using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets.When
 units of property, plant and equipment are replaced, retired or abandoned, the carrying value is credited against the asset and charged to accumulateddepreciation.
 To the extent the Company recovers cost of removal or other retirement costs through rates after the retirement costs are incurred, a regulatory assetis
 recorded. In some cases, the Company recovers retirement costs through rates during the life of the associated asset and before the costs are incurred. Theseamounts
 result in a regulatory liability being reported based on the amounts previously recovered through customer rates, until the costs to retire those assets areincurred.
The
 costs incurred to acquire and internally develop computer software for internal use are capitalized as a unit of property. The carrying value of thesecosts amounted to 
$336 million and $346 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Cash and Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Funds
Substantially
 all cash is invested in interest-bearing accounts. All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased areconsidered to be cash equiva
lents.Restricted
 funds consists primarily of proceeds from financings for the construction and capital improvement of facilities, and deposits for future servicesunder O&M
 projects. Proceeds are held in escrow or interest-bearing accounts until the designated expenditures are incurred. Restricted funds are classified on theConsolidated Balance Sheets as e
ither current or long-term based upon the intended use of the funds.The
 following table provides a reconciliation of the Cash and cash equivalents and Restricted funds amounts as presented on the Consolidated BalanceSheets, to the sum of such amounts pr
esented on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31 :

Accounts receivable
 include regulated utility customer accounts receivable, which represent amounts billed to water and wastewater customers generally ona
 monthly basis. Credit is extended based on the guidelines of the applicable PUCs and collateral is generally not required. Also included are market-based tradeaccounts
 receivable and nonutility customer receivables of the regulated subsidiaries. Unbilled revenues are accrued when service has been provided but has notbeen billed to customers 
and when costs exceed billings on market-based construction contracts.Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts
Allowances
 for  uncollectible  accounts  are  maintained  for  estimated  probable  losses  resulting  from  the  Company’s  inability  to  collect  receivables  fromcustomers.
 Accounts that are outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due. A number of factors are considered in determining the allowancefor
 uncollectible accounts, including the length of time receivables are past due and previous loss history. The Company generally writes off accounts when theybecome uncollectibl
e or are over a certain number of days outstanding. See Note 6—Allowance for Uncollectib le Accounts for additional information.

Goodwill
 represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of abusiness.
 Goodwill is not amortized and must be allocated at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below, and tested forimpairment
 at least annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reportingunit below its carrying valu
e.The
 Company’s goodwill is primarily associated with (i) the acquisition of American Water by an affiliate of the Company’s previous owner in 2003, (ii)the
 acquisition of E’town Corporation by a predecessor to the Company’s previous owner in 2001, (iii) the acquisition of Pivotal Home Solutions (“Pivotal”) in2018, and (iv)
 the acquisition of Keystone in 2015; and has been allocated to reporting units based on the fair values at the date of the acquisitions. For purposes oftesting goodwill
 for impairment, the reporting units in the Regulated Businesses segment are  aggregated into a single reporting unit. The Market-Based Businesses is comprised of the 
Homeowner Services Group reporting unit, the Military Services Group reporting unit and the Keystone reporting unit.The
 Company’s annual impairment testing is performed as of November  30 of  each year, in conjunction with the completion of the Company’s annualbusiness
 plan. The Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether quantitative testing is necessary. If it is determined, based upon qualitative factors,that
 the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not, greater than its carrying value, no further testing is required. If the Company bypasses thequalitative
 assessment, or performs the qualitative assessment and determines that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not, less than itscarrying
 value, a quantitative, fair value-based test is performed. This quantitative testing compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its respectivenet
 carrying value, including goodwill, on the measurement date. An impairment loss will be recognized in the amount equal to the excess of the reporting unit’scarrying value compared to
 its estimated fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.Application
 of goodwill impairment testing requires management judgment, including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value ofreporting
 units. Management estimates fair value using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market multiples analysis. Significant assumptionsused
 in these fair value estimations include, but are not limited to, forecasts of future operating results, discount and growth rates, capital expenditures, tax rates,working capital, wei
ghted average cost of capital and projected terminal values.The
 Company believes the assumptions and other considerations used to value goodwill to be appropriate, however, if actual experience differs from theassumptions and
 considerations used in its analysis, the resulting change could have a material adverse impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 8—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
for additional information. Intangible Assets
Intangible
 assets  consist  primarily  of  finite-lived  customer  relationships  associated  with  the  acquisition  of  Pivotal  and  Keystone.  Finite-lived  intangibleassets
 are initially measured at their estimated fair values, and are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the economic benefitsof the intangible assets 
are consumed or otherwise used. See Note 8—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for additional information. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived
 assets include property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets and long-term investments. The Company evaluates long-lived assetsfor
 impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. When such indicators arise, the Company estimates the fairvalue of
 the long-lived asset from future cash flows expected to result from its use and, if applicable, the eventual disposition of the asset, comparing the estimatedvalue
 fair to the carrying value of the asset. An impairment loss will be recognized in the amount equal to the excess of the long-lived asset’s carrying valuecompared to its estim
ated fair value.The
 long-lived assets of the Company’s regulated utilities are grouped on a separate entity basis for impairment testing, as they are integrated state-wideoperations that
 do not have the option to curtail service and generally have uniform tariffs. A regulatory asset is charged to earnings if and when future recovery inrates of that asset is no 
longer probable.89

Table of ContentsThe Company holds other long-term
 investments in privately held companies and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method, and are classified asother
 Long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The estimated fair value of the long-term investments are dependent on the financial performance andsolvency of the entities in
 which the Company invests, as well as volatility inherent in the external markets. If such long-term investments are considered impaired,an impairment loss will b
e recognized in the amount equal to the excess of the investment’s carrying value compared to its estimated fair value.The
 Company believes the assumptions and other considerations used to value long-lived assets to be appropriate, however, if actual experience differsfrom the assumptions and
 considerations used in its estimates, the resulting change could have a material adverse impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.Advances for Construction and Contributions in Aid of Construction
Regulated
 utility subsidiaries may receive advances for construction and contributions in aid of construction from customers, home builders and real estatedevelopers to fund construct
ion necessary to extend service to new areas.Advances
 are refundable for limited periods of time as new customers begin to receive service or other contractual obligations are fulfilled. Included inOther current liabil
ities as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 on the Consolidated Balance  Sheets are estimated refunds of $23 million and $23 million , respectively. Those amounts represent expe
cted refunds during the next 12-month period.Advances
 that are no longer refundable are reclassified to contributions. Contributions are permanent collections of plant assets or cash for a particularconstruction
 project. For ratemaking purposes, the amount of such contributions generally serves as a rate base reduction since the contributions represent non-investor supplied funds.
Generally,
 the Company depreciates utility plant funded by contributions and amortizes its contributions balance as a reduction to depreciation expense,producing
 a result which is functionally equivalent to reducing the original cost of the utility plant for the contributions. In accordance with applicable regulatoryguidelines,
 some of  the Company’s utility  subsidiaries  do  not amortize  contributions,  and any  contribution  received  remains  on the  balance  sheet  indefinitely.Amortization
 of contributions in aid of construction was $28  million , $27 million and $27 million for  the years ended December  31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
Revenue Recognition
On
 January  1,  2018,  the  Company  adopted  Accounting  Standards  Codification  Topic  606, Revenue 
From
Contracts
With
Customers,
and all  relatedamendments
 (collectively, “ASC 606”) ,
 using the modified retrospective approach, applied to contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Underthis approach, periods prior 
to the adoption date have not been restated and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.Under ASC
 606, a performance obligation is a promise within a contract to transfer a distinct good or service, or a series of distinct goods and services, to acustomer.
 Revenue  is  recognized  when  performance  obligations  are  satisfied  and  the  customer  obtains  control  of  promised  goods  or  services.  The  amount  ofrevenue
 recognized  reflects  the  consideration  to  which  the  Company  expects  to  be  entitled  to  receive  in  exchange  for  goods  or  services.  Under  ASC  606,  acontract’s
 transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that the Company determinesare
 within  the  scope  of  ASC  606,  the  Company  performs  the  following  five  steps:  (i)  identifies  the  contracts  with  a  customer;  (ii)  identifies  the  performanceobligations
 within  the  contract,  including  whether  any  performance  obligations  are  distinct  and  capable  of  being  distinct  in  the  context  of  the  contract;  (iii)determines
 the transaction price; (iv) allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognizes revenue when, or as, theCompany satisfies each per
formance obligation.The
 Company’s revenues from contracts with customers are discussed below. Customer payments for contracts are generally due within 30 days of billingand
 none of the contracts with customers have payment terms that exceed one year; therefore, the Company elected to apply the significant financing componentpractical expedien
t and no amount of consideration has been allocated as a financing component.90

Table of ContentsRegulated
Businesses
Revenue
Revenue
 from the Company’s Regulated Businesses is generated  primarily  from water and wastewater  services  delivered  to customers.  These contractscontain a
 single performance obligation, the delivery of water and/or wastewater services, as the promise to transfer the individual good or service is not separatelyidentifiable
 from  other  promises  within  the  contracts  and,  therefore,  is  not  distinct.  Revenues  are  recognized  over  time,  as  services  are  provided.  There  aregenerally
 no significant financing components or variable consideration. Revenues include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis and unbilled amountscalculated
 based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill, to the end of the accounting period. The amountsthat
 the Company has a right to invoice are determined by each customer’s actual usage, an indicator that the invoice amount corresponds directly to the valuetransferred to the customer. The
 Company also recognizes revenue when it is probable that future recovery of previously incurred costs or future refunds that are tobe credited to custome
rs will occur through the ratemaking process.Market-Based
Businesses
Revenue
Through various
 warranty protection programs, the Company provides fixed fee services to residential and smaller commercial customers to protect againstrepair
 costs for interior and exterior water and sewer lines, interior electric and gas lines, heating and cooling systems, water heaters and other home appliances, aswell
 as  power  surge  protection  and  other  related  services.  Most  of  the  contracts  have  a  one-year  term  and  each  service  is  a  separate  performance  obligation,satisfied
 over time, as the customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided from the service. Customers are obligated to pay for the protectionprograms
 ratably  over 12 months  or  via  a  one-time,  annual  fee,  with  revenues  recognized  ratably  over  time  for  these  services.  Advances  from  customers  aredeferred until the performance 
obligation is satisfied.The
 Company also has long-term, fixed fee contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems for the U.S. government on various militaryinstallations
 and facilities owned by municipal and industrial customers, as well as shorter-term contracts that provide customized water transfer services for shalenatural
 gas  companies  and  customers.  Billing  and  revenue  recognition  for  the  fixed  fee  revenues  occurs  ratably  over  the  term  of  the  contract,  as  customerssimultaneously
 receive and consume the benefits provided by the Company. Additionally, these contracts allow the Company to make capital improvements tounderlying
 infrastructure,  which  are  initiated  through  separate  modifications  or  amendments  to  the  original  contract,  whereby  stand-alone,  fixed  pricing  isseparately
 stated  for  each  improvement.  The  Company  has  determined  that  these  capital  improvements  are  separate  performance  obligations,  with  revenuerecognized over time based on
 performance completed at the end of each reporting period. Losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the lossesfirst
 become probable and estimable. Revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded as unbilled revenues, withbillings
 in excess of revenues recorded as other current liabilities until the recognition criteria are met. Changes in contract performance and related estimatedcontract
 profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues, and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined. See Note  3—RevenueRecognition 
for additional information. Income Taxes
The
 Company and its subsidiaries participate in a consolidated federal income tax return for U.S. tax purposes. Members of the consolidated group arecharged with the amou
nt of federal income tax expense determined as if they filed separate returns.Certain
 income and expense items are accounted for in different time periods for financial reporting than for income tax reporting purposes. The Companyprovides
 deferred  income  taxes  on  the  difference  between  the  tax  basis  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  the  amounts  at  which  they  are  carried  in  the  financialstatements.
 These deferred income taxes are based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these temporary differences are projected to reverse. Inaddition,
 the  regulated  utility  subsidiaries  recognize  regulatory  assets  and  liabilities  for  the  effect  on  revenues  expected  to  be  realized  as  the  tax  effects  oftemporary differen
ces, previously flowed through to customers, reverse.Investment tax
 credits have been deferred by the regulated utility subsidiaries and are being amortized to income over the average estimated service lives ofthe related assets.
The
 Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions as a component of income tax expense and accounts for sales tax collectedfrom customers and rem
itted to taxing authorities on a net basis. See Note 14—Income Taxes for additional information. 91

Table of ContentsAllowance for Funds Used During Construction
AFUDC
 is a non-cash credit to income with a corresponding charge to utility plant that represents the cost of borrowed funds or a return on equity fundsdevoted
 to plant under construction. The regulated utility subsidiaries record AFUDC to the extent permitted by the PUCs. The portion of AFUDC attributable toborrowed
 funds is shown as a reduction of Interest, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Any portion of AFUDC attributable to equity funds wouldbe included in Other, net on the Consol
idated Statements of Operations. AFUDC is provided in the following table for the years ended  December 31 :

truction13  8  6 Environmental Costs
The
 Company’s water and wastewater operations and the operations of its Market-Based  Businesses are  subject to U.S. federal, state, local and foreignrequirements
 relating  to  environmental  protection,  and  as  such,  the  Company  periodically  becomes  subject  to  environmental  claims  in  the  normal  course  ofbusiness. Environmental expenditures that
 relate to current operations or provide a future benefit are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Remediation costs thatrelate
 to an existing condition caused by past operations are accrued, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that these costs will be incurred and can bereasonably
 estimated. A conservation agreement entered into by a subsidiary of the Company with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in 2010and
 amended in 2017 required the subsidiary to, among other provisions, implement certain measures to protect the steelhead trout and its habitat in the CarmelRiver
 watershed in the State of California. The subsidiary agreed to pay $1  million annually  commencing in 2010 with the final payment being made in 2021.Remediation costs accru
ed amounted to $4 million and $6 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company uses derivative fin
ancial instruments for purposes of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates. These derivative contracts are enteredinto
 for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The Company does not enter intoderivative contrac
ts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments.All
 derivatives  are  recognized  on  the  balance  sheet  at  fair  value.  On  the  date  the  derivative  contract  is  entered  into,  the  Company  may  designate  thederivative as a hedge of the fair
 value of a recognized asset or liability (fair-value hedge) or a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows tobe received or paid related t
o a recognized asset or liability (cash-flow hedge).Changes in the fair value of a fair-value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the underlyi
ng hedged item, are recorded in current-period earnings. The gainsand
 losses on the effective portion of cash-flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows.Any ineffective portion of d
esignated cash-flow hedges is recognized in current-period earnings.Cash
 flows from derivative contracts are included in Net cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. See Note 11 —Long-Term Debt 
for additional information. 92

Revenue from
Contracts with
Customers
 
Changes the criteria for recognizing revenue from a contract with acustomer. Replaces existing guidance on revenue recognition,
including most industry-specific guidance. The objective is to provide
a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts
with customers to improve comparability within industries, across
industries and across capital markets. The underlying principle is that
an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods and
services to customers at an amount the entity expects to be ent
itled toin exchange for those goods or services. The guidance also requires a
number of disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and
uncertainty of revenue and the related cash flows.

Impairment
 
Updated authoritative guidance to simplify the subsequentmeasurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill
impairment test. Under the amendments in the update, an ent
ity shouldperform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing
the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An
impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the
carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value; however, the
loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill
allocated to that reporting unit. An entity sti
ll has the option toperform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if
the quantitative impairment test 
is necessary. August 31,2018

 Description  Date ofAdoption
 Application  Estimated Effect on the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements
Accounting for
Leases
 
Updated the accounting and disclosure guidance for leasingarrangements. Under this guidance, a lessee will be required to
recognize the following for all leases, excluding short-term leases, at
the commencement date: (i) a lease liabili
ty, which is a lessee’sobligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a
discounted basis; and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that
represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified
asset for the lease term. Under the guidance, lessor accounting is
largely unchanged. A package of optional transition practical
expedients allows an entity not to reassess under the new guidance (i)
whether any existing contracts are or contain leases (ii) lease
classification, and (iii) initial direct costs. Addi
tional optionaltransition practical expedients are available which allow an enti
ty notto evaluate existing land easements if the easements were not
previously accounted for as leases, and to apply the new lease
standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect
adjustment in the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of
adoption.

Modified retrospective 
The adoption will result in recording operatinglease right-of-use assets of approximately $118
million and operating lease liabili
ties ofapproximately $116 million on the Consolida

between the operating lease right-of-use assets
and operating lease liabilities will be recorded as
an adjustment to retained earnings. The
Company has defined a process and
implemented internal controls and software to
meet the accounting and reporting requirements
of the guidance and did not elect early adoption
for the standard. The Company will elect all
practical expedients available under the new
lease accounting and disclosure guidance. The
practical expedient related to land easements
allowed the Company to carry forward
accounting treatment for existing land
easements, which is to record easements as land
and land rights in utility plant.
Targeted
Improvements to
Accounting for
Hedging Activities
 
Updated the accounting and disclosure guidance for hedging activities,which allows for more financial and nonfinancial hedging strategies to
be eligible for hedge accounting. Under this guidance, a qualitative
effectiveness assessment is permitted for certain hedges if an entity
can reasonably support an expectation of high effectiveness

Updated the accounting guidance on reporting credit losses forfinancial assets held at amortized cost basis and available-for-sale debt
securities. Under this guidance, expected credit losses are required to
be measured based on historical experience, current conditions and
reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of
the reported amount of financial assets. Also, this guidance requires
that credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities be presented as
an allowance rather than as a direct write-down.

Contract Balances
Contract
 assets and contract liabilities are the result of timing differences between revenue recognition, billings and cash collections. In the Company’sMarket-Based
 Businesses, certain contracts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals or uponachievement
 of  contractual  milestones.  Contract  assets  are  recorded  when  billing  occurs  subsequent  to  revenue  recognition,  and  are  reclassified  to  accountsreceivable
 when  billed  and  the  right  to  consideration  becomes  unconditional.  Contract  liabilities  are  recorded  when  the  Company  receives  advances  fromcustomers
 prior to satisfying contractual performance obligations, particularly for construction contracts and home warranty protection program contracts, and arerecognized
 as revenue  when the associated  performance  obligations  are  satisfied.  Contract  assets  are  included  in Unbilled  revenues  and  contract  liabilities  areincluded in Other current 
liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2018 . 95

 enters into agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the United States military, municipalities and other customers.As
 of December  31, 2018 ,  the Company’s operation and maintenance and capital improvement contracts in the Market-Based Businesses have RPOs. Contractswith
 the U.S. government for work on various military installations expire between 2051 and 2069 and  have RPOs of $4.4  billion as  of December  31, 2018 , as measured
 by  estimated  remaining  contract  revenue.  Such  contracts  are  subject  to  customary  termination  provisions  held  by  the  U.S.  government,  prior  to  theagreed-upon
 contract expiration. Contracts with municipalities and commercial customers expire between 2019 and 2038 and  have RPOs of $596  million as  ofDecember
 31, 2018 ,  as measured by estimated remaining contract revenue. Some of the Company’s long-term contracts to operate and maintain a municipality’s,the
 federal government’s or other party’s water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities include responsibility for certain maintenance for some of thosefacilities,
 in exchange for an annual fee. Unless specifically required to perform certain maintenance activities, the maintenance costs are recognized when themaintenance
 is performed. Approximately $61  million of  RPOs were eliminated in conjunction with the sale of 20 of the Contract  Services Group ’s  contracts tosubsidiaries of Veolia Environn

Pivotal
Acquisition
On 
June 4, 2018 ,  the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary American Water Enterprises, LLC, completed the acquisition of Pivotal for a totalpurchase
 price of $365 million ,  net of cash received and including $9 million in  working capital. Pivotal is headquartered in Naperville, Illinois, and is a providerof

 Company’s deferred pension expense includes a portion of the underfunded status that is probable of recovery through rates in future periods of $352 million 
and $270 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The rem aining portion is the pension expense in excess of the amount contributed to thepension plans which is deferred by 
certain subsidiaries and will be recovered in future service rates as contributions are made to the pension plan.Removal costs recoverabl
e through rates represent costs incurred for removal of property, plant and equipment or other retirement costs.Regulatory
 balancing  accounts  accumulate  differences  between  revenues  recognized  and  authorized  revenue  requirements  until  they  are  collected  fromcustomers or are refund
ed. Regulatory balancing accounts include low income programs and purchased power and water accounts.San Clemente
 Dam project costs represent costs incurred and deferred by the Company’s utility subsidiary in California pursuant to its efforts to investigatealternatives
 and remove the dam due to potential earthquake and flood safety concerns. In June 2012, the California Public Utilities Commission (“CPUC”) issueda
 decision authorizing implementation of a project to reroute the Carmel River and remove the San Clemente Dam. The project includes the Company’s utilitysubsidiary in
 California, the California State Conservancy and the National Marine Fisheries Services. Under the order’s terms, the CPUC has authorized recoveryfor pre-construction
 costs, interim dam safety measures and environmental costs and construction costs. The authorized costs were being recovered via a surchargeover a 
twenty -year period which began  in October 2012. The unrecovered balance of project costs incurred, including cost of capital, net of surcharges totaled $85 million 
and $89 million as  of December  31, 2018 and 2017 ,  respectively. Surcharges collected were $8  million and $7 million for  the years ended December 31, 2018 
and 2017 ,  respectively. Pursuant to the general rate case approved in December 2018, approval was granted to reset the twenty -year  amortization period tobegin January 1, 2018 and to establish 
an annual revenue requirement of $8 million to be recovered through base rates.Debt
 expense is amortized over the lives of the respective issues. Call premiums on the redemption of long-term debt, as well as unamortized debt expense,are deferred and amo
rtized to the extent they will be recovered through future service rates.Purchase
 premium recoverable through rates is primarily the recovery of the acquisition premiums related to an asset acquisition by the Company’s utilitysubsidiary in California
 during 2002, and acquisitions in 2007 by the Company’s utility subsidiary in New Jersey. As authorized for recovery by the California andNew Jersey PUCs, these costs are being amor
tized to depreciation and amortization on the Consolidated Statements of Operations through November 2048.Tank
 painting  costs  are  generally  deferred  and  amortized  to  operations  and  maintenance  expense  on  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations  on  astraight-line basis ove
r periods ranging from five to fifteen years, as authorized b y the regulatory authorities in their determination of rates charged for service.100

Table of ContentsAs a result of the prepayment by American Water Capital Corp., the Company’s wholly owne
d finance subsidiary (“AWCC”), of the 5.62% Series C Senior Notes due upon maturity on December
 21, 2018 (the “Series C Notes”), 5.62% Series E Senior Notes due March 29, 2019  (the “Series E Notes”) and 5.77% Series F
 Senior Notes due December 21, 2022 (the “Series F Notes,” and together with the Series E Notes, the “Series Notes”), a make-whole premium of $10 million was
 paid to the holders of the Series Notes on September 11, 2018. Substantially all of these early debt extinguishment costs were allocable to the Company’sutility subsidiaries and 
recorded as regulatory assets, as the Company believes they are probable of recovery in future rates.Other
 regulatory  assets  include  certain  construction  costs  for  treatment  facilities,  property  tax  stabilization,  employee-related  costs,  deferred  otherpostretirement
 benefit expense, business services project expenses, coastal water project costs, rate case expenditures and environmental remediation costs amongothers. These costs are def
erred because the amounts are being recovered in rates or are probable of recovery through rates in future periods.Regulatory Liabilities
Regulatory
 liabilities generally represent amounts that are probable of being credited or refunded to customers through the rate-making process. Also, ifcosts
 expected to be incurred in the future are currently being recovered through rates, the Company records those expected future costs as regulatory liabilities.The following table provides th

 taxes recovered through rates relate to deferred taxes that will likely be refunded to the Company’s customers. On December  22, 2017 ,  the TCJAwas
 signed into law, which, among other things, enacted significant and complex changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including a reduction in themaximum
 U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as  of January 1, 2018. The TCJA created significant excess deferred income taxes that theCompany
 and its regulatory  jurisdictions  believe  should be refunded  to customers.  Since these  are significant  refundable  amounts, the Company believes  it isprobable these amounts will b
e refunded to customers through future rates, and as such the amounts have been recorded to a regulatory liability.Removal
 costs recovered through rates are estimated costs to retire assets at the end of their expected useful life that are recovered through customer ratesover
 the life  of  the associated  assets.  In  December  2008,  the  Company’s utility  subsidiary  in New Jersey,  at the  direction  of  the New Jersey  Board of  PublicUtilities,
 began to depreciate $48 million of  the total balance into depreciation and amortization expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations via straightline amortization 
through November 2048.On  
August 31, 2018 , the  Postretirement Medical Benefit Plan was remeasured to reflect an announced plan amendment which changed benefits for certainunion
 and non-union plan participants. As a result of the remeasurement, the Company recorded a  $227  million  reduction  to the net accumulated postretirementbenefit obligation, with a 
corresponding regulatory liability. See Note 15—Employee Benefits  for additional information. Pension
 and  other  postretirement  benefit  balancing  accounts  represent  the  difference  between  costs  incurred  and  costs  authorized  by  the  PUCs that  areexpected to be refunded to 
customers.During 2018, the Company’s 
14 regulatory jurisdictions began to consider the impacts of the TCJA. The Company has adjusted customer rates to reflect thelower income tax rate in 
10 states. In one of those 10 states, a portion of the tax savings is being used to reduce certain regulatory assets. In one additional state, theCompany
 is  using  the  tax  savings  to  offset  additional  capital  investment  and  to  reduce  a  regulatory  asset.  Proceedings  in  the  other three jurisdictions  remainpending. 
With  respect to excess accumulated deferred income taxes, regulators in the eight states  that have considered the issue have agreed with the Company’soverall timeline o
f passing the excess back to customers beginning no earlier than 2019, when the Company is able to produce the normalization schedule using theaverage
 rate assumption method. In one of those states, the Company will use the amortization of the excess accumulated deferred income taxes to offset futureinfrastructure investments.

Table of ContentsThe
 Company generally expects its regulated customers to benefit from the tax savings resulting from the TCJA. As a result, the Company has recorded a$54 million 
reserve on  revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018 ,  for the estimated tax savings resulting from the TCJA, with a corresponding regulatoryliability,
 of  which  the  current  portion  is $18  million and  is  recorded  in  other  current  liabilities,  and  the  long-term  portion  is $36  million and  is  recorded  inregulatory liabilities.
 The Company cannot predict how each jurisdiction may calculate the amount of credits due to customers. If any of the Company’s regulatoryjurisdictions
 determines the credits due to customers are higher than the expected reduction to income tax expense, this would result in an adverse impact to theCompany’s results of operations 
and cash flows.Other regulatory liabi
lities include legal settlement proceeds, deferred gains and various regulatory balancing accounts.Note 8: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

 business going forward, focusing solely on providing water transfer services. Based on these factors, the Company concluded there were indicators thatthe
 Keystone reporting unit may be impaired. Accordingly, impairment testing was performed as part of the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated FinancialStatements during the thi
rd quarter of 2018.In
 terms of the process followed, the Company first completed an impairment test of the Keystone reporting unit’s customer relationship intangible asset asof
 September 30, 2018. The results of this impairment test showed the fair value of the intangible asset was lower than its carrying value, resulting in a non-cash,pre-tax impairment charge of 
$4 million . The
 Company then completed an interim goodwill impairment test of the Keystone reporting unit as of September 30, 2018. The results of this impairmenttest
 showed the fair value of the Keystone reporting unit was lower than its carrying value, resulting in a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of $53 million . The Company
 estimated the fair value of the Keystone reporting unit using an income approach valuation technique which estimates the amount and timing of futurediscounted
 cash flows from operations of the Keystone reporting unit, relying on multiple projected scenarios. Significant assumptions used in estimating the fairvalue
 included, but was not limited to, forecasts of future operating results, including revenue and revenue growth, profit margins, and weighted average cost ofcapital.
In aggregate, a
 non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of $57 million was recorded in Impairment charge on the  Consolidated Statement of Operations for theyear
 ended December  31, 2018 ,  of which, $54  million was  attributable to the Company, after adjustment for noncontrolling interest. See Note  18—Fair Value ofFinancial Information 
for further information. 102

for additional information. The
 Company completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill as of November  30 , 2018 ,  which included qualitative assessments of its Regulated Businesses 
, Homeowner Services Group , Military Services Group and  Keystone reporting units. Based on these assessments, the Company determined that therewere
 no factors present that would indicate that the fair value of these reporting units was less than their respective carrying values and, as such, quantitative, fairvalue-based testing was not ne
cessary for these reporting units as of November 30 , 2018 . There
 can be no assurances that the Company will not be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or otherfactors
 related to the performance of the Company’s reporting units. These market events could include a decline over a period of time of the Company’s stockprice,
 a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities and reporting unit companies, the lack of an increase in the Company’smarket price
 consistent with its peer companies, decreases in control premiums, or continued downward pressure on commodity prices. A decline in the forecastedresults
 in the Company’s business plan, such as changes in rate case results, capital investment budgets or interest rates, could also result in an impairment ofgoodwill.
 In regards to the Keystone reporting unit’s goodwill, adverse developments in market conditions, including prolonged depression of natural gas or oilprices
 or  other  factors  that  negatively  impact  the  Company’s  forecasted  operating  results,  cash  flows  or  key  assumptions,  could  result  in  an  impairment  of  aportion, or all, of Keystone’s goodwil

Table of ContentsDividends
The
 Company’s Board of Directors authorizes the payment of dividends. The Company’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock is subject to havingaccess
 to sufficient sources of liquidity, net income and cash flows of the Company’s subsidiaries, the receipt of dividends and repayments of indebtedness fromthe
 Company’s subsidiaries, compliance with Delaware corporate and other laws, compliance with the contractual provisions of debt and other agreements, andother
 factors. The Company’s dividend rate on its common stock is determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and takes into consideration, amongother
 factors, current and possible future developments that may affect the Company’s income and cash flows. When dividends on common stock are declared,they are typically pa
id in March, June, September and December. Historically, dividends have been paid quarterly to holders of record less than 30 days prior to thedistribution date. Since th
e dividends on the Company’s common stock are not cumulative, only declared dividends are paid.During 
2018 , 2017 and 2016 ,  the  Company  paid $319  million , $289 million and $261 million in  cash  dividends,  respectively.  The  following  tableprovides the per share cash d

these agreements on June 7, 2018 . Regulatory Restrictions
The
 issuance of long-term debt or equity securities by the Company or American Water Capital Corp. (“AWCC”), the Company’s wholly owned financingsubsidiary,
 does not require authorization of any state PUC if no guarantee or pledge of the regulated subsidiaries is utilized. However, state PUC authorization isrequired to
 issue long-term debt at most of the Company’s regulated subsidiaries. The Company’s regulated subsidiaries normally obtain the required approvals ona periodic basis to cover 
their anticipated financing needs for a period of time or in connection with a specific financing.Under
 applicable law, the Company’s subsidiaries can pay dividends only from retained, undistributed or current earnings. A significant loss recorded at asubsidiary
 may limit the dividends that the subsidiary can distribute to American Water. Furthermore, the ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to pay upstreamdividends
 or  repay  indebtedness  to  American  Water  is  subject  to  compliance  with  applicable  regulatory  restrictions  and  financial  obligations,  including,  forexample,
 debt service and preferred and preference stock dividends, as well as applicable corporate, tax and other laws and regulations, and other agreements orcovenants made or enter
ed into by the Company and its subsidiaries.Note 10: Stock Based Compensation
The Company
 has granted stock options, stock units and dividend equivalents to non-employee directors, officers and other key employees of the Companypursuant
 to the terms of its 2007 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the “2007 Plan”). Stock units under the 2007 Plan generally vest based on (i) continuedemployment
 with the Company (“RSUs”), or (ii) continued employment with the Company where distribution of the shares is subject to the satisfaction in wholeor
 in part of stated performance-based goals (“PSUs”). The total aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2007 Plan is 15.5 million 
.  As of December  31, 2018 , 7.5 million shares  were available for issuance under the 2007 Plan. The 2007 Plan has been replaced by the 2017 OmnibusPlan,
 as defined below, and no additional awards may be granted under the 2007 Plan. However, shares may still be issued under the 2007 Plan pursuant to theterms of awards previously issu
ed under that plan prior to May 12, 2017.105

Table of ContentsIn
 May  2017,  the  Company’s  shareholders  approved  the  American  Water  Works  Company,  Inc.  2017  Omnibus  Equity  Compensation  Plan  (the  “2017Omnibus
 Plan”). The Company has granted stock units, including RSUs and PSUs, stock awards and dividend equivalents to non-employee directors, officers andemployees under
 the 2017 Omnibus Plan. A total of  7.2 million shares of  common stock may be issued under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. As of December 31, 2018 , 6.9
 million shares  were available for grant under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. The 2017 Omnibus Plan provides that grants of awards may be in any of the followingforms:
 incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock units, stock awards, other stock-based awards and dividend equivalents.Dividend equivalents may be gr
anted only on stock units or other stock-based awards.The
 cost of services received from employees in exchange for the issuance of stock options and restricted stock awards is measured based on the grant datefair
 value of the awards issued. The value of stock options and stock unit awards at the date of the grant is amortized through expense over the three -year service period.
 All awards granted in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 are  classified as equity. The Company recognizes compensation expense for stock awards over the vestingperiod of
 the award. The Company stratified its grant populations and used historic employee turnover rates to estimate employee forfeitures. The estimated rate iscompared to
 the actual forfeitures at the end of the reporting period and adjusted as necessary. The following table provides the stock-based compensation expenserecorded in operation and

 Company receives a tax deduction based on the intrinsic value of the award at the exercise date for stock options and the distribution date for stockunits.
 For each award, throughout the requisite service period, the Company recognizes the tax benefits, which have been included in deferred income tax assets,related
 to  compensation  costs.  The  tax  deductions  in  excess  of  the  benefits  recorded  throughout  the  requisite  service  period  are  recorded  to  the  ConsolidatedStatements of Operations and 
are presented in the financing section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.Stock Options
There
 were no grants of stock options to employees in 2018 and 2017 .  In 2016 ,  the Company granted non-qualified stock options to certain employeesunder
 the 2007 Plan. The stock options vest ratably over the three -year  service period beginning on January 1 of the year of the grant and have no performancevesting conditions. Expense is re
cognized using the straight-line method and is amortized over the requisite service period.The

Table of ContentsThe
 Company used the actual historical experience of exercises or expirations of the 2009 grant to determine the expected stock option life. The Companybegan
 granting stock options at the time of its initial public offering in April 2008. Expected volatility is based on a weighted average of historic volatilities oftraded
 common  stock  of  peer  companies  (regulated  water  companies)  over  the  expected  term  of  the  stock  options  and  historic  volatilities  of  the  Company’scommon
 stock during the period it has been publicly traded. The dividend yield is based on the Company’s expected dividend payments and the stock price on thedate
 of grant. The risk-free interest rate is the market yield on U.S. Treasury strips with maturities similar to the expected term of the stock options. The exerciseprice
 of the stock options is equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of option grant. Stock options vest over periods ranging from one tothree 
years and have a maximum term of seven years from the effe ctive date of the grant.The following table provides sto

During 
2018 , 2017 and 2016 ,  the  Company  granted  RSUs  to  certain  employees  under  the  2007  Plan  and  2017  Omnibus  Plan,  as  applicable.  RSUsgenerally vest based on cont
inued employment with the Company over periods ranging from one to three years. During 
2018 and 2017 ,  the Company granted stock units to non-employee directors under the 2017 Omnibus Plan, and during 2016 ,  these awards weregranted
 under the 2007 Plan. The stock units were vested in full on the date of grant; however, distribution of the shares will be made within 30 days of the earlierof
 (i)  15 months after the grant date, subject to any deferral election by the director, or (ii) the participant’s separation from service. Because these stock unitsvested on the grant date, th
e total grant date fair value was recorded in operation and maintenance expense on the grant date.The RSUs are valued at the market value of the closing price of the Com
pany’s common stock on the date of the grant and the majority vest ratably over thethree

Table of ContentsIf
 dividends are paid with respect to shares of the Company’s common stock before the RSUs and PSUs are distributed, the Company credits a liability forthe value
 of the dividends that would have been paid if the RSUs and PSUs were shares of Company common stock. When the RSUs and PSUs are distributed, theCompany
 pays  the  participant  a  lump  sum  cash  payment  equal  to  the  value  of  the  dividend  equivalents  accrued.  The  Company  accrued  dividend  equivalentstotaling 
$1  million , less than $1 million and $1 million to  accumulated deficit in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders’ Equityfor the years ended 
December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The
 Company maintains a nonqualified employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) through which employee participants may use payroll deductions toacquire
 Company common stock at a discount. Prior to February 5, 2019, the purchase price of common stock acquired under the ESPP was the lesser of 90% of the fair market va
lue of the common stock at either the beginning or the end of a three -month purchase period. On July 27, 2018, the ESPP was amend ed, effectiveFebruary
 5, 2019, to permit employee participants to acquire Company common stock at 85% of  the fair market value of the common stock at the end of thepurchase
 period.  As  of December  31,  2018 ,  there  were 1.9  million shares  of  common  stock  reserved  for  issuance  under  the  ESPP.  The  ESPP  is  consideredcompensatory. During
 the years ended December  31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 ,  the Company issued 95 thousand , 93 thousand and 93 thousand shares, respectively, under the ESPP.

August 9, 2018 ,  AWCC completed a  $1.325 billion  debt  offering which included the sale of  $625 million  aggregate  principal amount of its  3.75%  Senior Notes
 due in 2028, and  $700 million  aggregate  principal amount of its  4.20%  Senior  Notes due in 2048. At the closing of the offering, AWCC received,after
 deduction of underwriting discounts and before deduction of offering expenses, net proceeds of approximately $1.3  billion .  AWCC used proceeds from theoffering
 to (i) lend funds to American Water and its regulated operating subsidiaries, (ii) repay $191  million principal  amount of AWCC’s Series C Notes uponmaturity on December 21, 2018, (
iii) prepay $100 million aggregate principal amount of AWCC’s outstanding Series E Notes and $100 million aggregate principal amount of AWCC’s outstanding Series F Notes, and (
iv) repay AWCC’s commercial paper obligations and for general corporate purposes.As
 a result of AWCC’s prepayment of the Series Notes, a make-whole premium of $10  million was  paid to the holders thereof on September 11, 2018.Substantially
 all of these early debt extinguishment costs were allocable to the Company’s utility subsidiaries and recorded as regulatory assets, as the Companybelieves they are probable
 of recovery in future rates.Interest, net includes intere
st income of approximately $11 million , $14 million and $14 million in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. 110

Table of ContentsOne
 of the principal market risks to which the Company is exposed is changes in interest rates. In order to manage the exposure, the Company follows riskmanagement
 policies  and  procedures,  including  the  use  of  derivative  contracts  such  as  swaps.  The  Company  reduces  exposure  to  interest  rates  by  managingcommercial
 paper and debt maturities. The Company also does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments.The
 derivative contracts entered into are for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures. The Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties toderivative
 contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations and minimizes this risk by dealing only with leading, credit-worthy financial institutions havinglong-term credit r
atings of “A” or better.On 
August 6, 2018 ,  the Company terminated four forward  starting swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of  $400  million ,  realizing a netgain of  
$9 million , to be amortized through in terest, net over 10 - and  30 -year periods, in correlation with the terms of the new debt issued on August 9, 2018 . On 
August 17, 2018 , the  Company entered into two forward starting swap agreements, each with a notional amount of  $80 million ,  to reduce interest rateexposure on
 debt expected to be issued in 2019. These forward starting swap agreements terminate in August 2019 , and have  an average fixed rate of  2.98% . On October
 11, 2018 ,  the Company entered into two additional forward starting swap agreements, each with a notional amount of  $100  million ,  to reduce interestrate
 exposure on debt expected to be issued in 2019. These forward starting swap agreements terminate in December  2019 ,  and have an average fixed rate of 3.31% 
. On January 8, 2019 , the  Company entered into an additional forward starting swap agreement, with a notional amount of  $150 million , to reduce interest rate exposure on debt expected to be issued in 2019. This forward starting swap agreement terminates in 
December 2019 , and has an average fixed r ate of  2.76% . The Company
 has designated these forward starting swap agreements as cash flow hedges, with their fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gainor
 loss. Upon termination, the cumulative gain or loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss will be amortized through interest, net over theterm of the new debt.
The Company
 has employed interest rate swaps to fix the interest cost on a portion of its variable-rate debt with an aggregate notional amount of $3 million .

Short-term
 debt consists of commercial paper and credit facility borrowings totaling $964  million and $905 million as  of December  31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively.
 On March 21, 2018, AWCC increased the maximum aggregate principal amount of borrowings authorized for issuance under its commercial paperprogram
 from $1.60  billion to $2.10 billion .  The weighted average interest rate on AWCC short-term borrowings was approximately 2.28% and 1.24% for  theyear ended 
December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. As of December 31, 2018 there were no borrowings outstanding with maturities greater than three months.On March
 21, 2018, AWCC and certain lenders amended and restated the credit agreement with respect to AWCC’s revolving credit facility to increase themaximum commitments
 under the facility from $1.75 billion to $2.25 billion ,  and to extend the expiration date of the facility from June 2020 to March 2023. Thefacility is used princ
ipally to support AWCC’s commercial paper program and to provide a sub-limit of up to $150 million for letters of cred it. Subject to satisfyingcertain conditions, the credit agreement also permits AWCC to increase the maximum commitment under the facility by up to an aggregate of 
$500 million , and to request
 extensions of its expiration date for up to two one-year periods. As of December 31, 2018, AWCC had no outstanding borrowings and $81  million of outstanding letters of c
redit under the revolving credit facility, with $2.17 billion available to fulfill the  Company’s short-term liquidity needs and to issue letters ofcredit.
 Letters of credit are non-debt instruments maintained to provide credit support for certain transactions as requested by third parties. The financial covenants with
 respect  to  the  facility  remained  unchanged  from  the  credit  agreement  in  effect  on  December  31,  2017.  Issuance  costs  related  to  the  increased  lendingcommitments
 will  be  amortized  over  the  remaining  life  of  the  credit  facility  and  is  included  in  interest,  net  in  the  accompanying  Consolidated  Statements  ofOperations.
 Interest rates on advances under the facility are based on a credit spread to the LIBOR rate or base rate in accordance with Moody Investors Service’sand Standard & Poor’s Financial Serv
ices’ then applicable credit rating on AWCC’s senior unsecured, non-credit enhanced debt.111

 Company to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization of not more than 0.70 to 1.00 . The ratio as of December 31, 2018 
was 0.59 to 1.00 . None
 of the Company’s borrowings are subject to default or prepayment as a result of a downgrading of securities, although such a downgrading couldincrease fees and int
erest charges under the Company’s credit facility.As
 part of the normal course of business, the Company routinely enters contracts for the purchase and sale of water, energy, fuels and other services. Thesecontracts
 either contain express provisions or otherwise permit the Company and its counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance whenthere
 are reasonable grounds for doing so. In accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law, if the Company is downgraded by a credit rating agency,especially
 if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis formaking
 a demand for adequate assurance of future performance. Depending on the Company’s net position with the counterparty, the demand could be for theposting of collateral. In the absence of expressly agreed provision
s that specify the collateral that must be provided, the obligation to supply the collateral requestedwill
 be a function of the facts and circumstances of the Company’s situation at the time of the demand. If the Company can reasonably claim that it is willing andfinancially
 able to perform its obligations, it may be possible that no collateral would need to be posted or that only an amount equal to two or three months of future
 payments should be sufficient. The Company does not expect to post any collateral which will have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results ofoperations, financial pos
ition or cash flows.Note 13: General Taxes

December 22, 2017 , President Trump signed into law th e TCJA. Substantially all of the provisions of the TCJA are effective for taxable years beginningafter
 December 31, 2017. The TCJA includes significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including amendments which significantly change thetaxation
 of individuals and business entities, and includes specific provisions related to regulated public utilities. The more significant changes that impact theCompany
 included in the TCJA are reductions in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% ,  and several technical provisions including, amongothers,
 limiting the utilization of net operating losses (“NOLs”) arising after December 31, 2017 to 80% of  taxable income with an indefinite carryforward. Thespecific
 provisions  related  to  regulated  public  utilities  in  the  TCJA  generally  allow  for  the  continued  deductibility  of  interest  expense,  the  elimination  of  fullexpensing for
 tax purposes of certain property acquired after September 27, 2017 and continue certain rate normalization requirements for accelerated depreciationbenefits. Non-regulated seg
ments of the Company’s business may be able to take advantage of the full expensing provisions of the TCJA.Changes in the Code from the TCJA had a mat
erial impact on the Company’s financial statements in 2017. Under GAAP, specifically Accounting StandardsCodification
 Topic 740, Income
Taxes
 (“ASC  740”), the tax effects of changes in tax laws must be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted. ASC 740also
 requires deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when temporary differences are to be realized orsettled. Thus,
 at the date of enactment, the Company’s deferred income taxes were re-measured based upon the new tax rate. For the Company’s regulated entities,substantially
 all  of  the  change  in  deferred  income  taxes  are  recorded  as  either  an  offset  to  a  regulatory  asset  or  liability  because  changes  are  expected  to  berecovered
 by or refunded to customers. For the Company’s unregulated operations, the change in deferred income taxes is recorded as a non-cash re-measurementadjustment to earnings.
The
 staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission recognized the complexity of reflecting the impacts of the TCJA, and on December 22, 2017issued
 guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (“SAB 118”) which clarifies accounting for income taxes under ASC 740 if information is not yet available orcomplete
 and provides for up to a one year period in which to complete the required analyses and accounting. The Company made a reasonable estimate for themeasurement
 and accounting of certain effects of the TCJA which were reflected in the financial statements as of December 31, 2017. The re-measurement ofdeferred
 income  taxes  at  the  new  federal  tax  rate  increased  the  2017  deferred  income  tax  provision  by $125  million for  the  year  ending  December  31,  2017.Additionally,
 the accumulated deferred income tax liability decreased by $1.39  billion and  regulatory liabilities increased by $1.51  billion ,  respectively, as ofDecember 31, 2017.

Table of ContentsAs
 of December  31, 2018 ,  the Company has recorded all its reasonable estimates resulting from the TCJA under SAB 118. These estimates, however, arestill
 subject to changes due to the future impacts of various items, including further changes in income tax laws, forecasted financial conditions and the actual taxreturn filings with the t
ax authorities.ASC
 740 requires the re-measurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax laws or rates to be presented in net income.Adjusting
 temporary  differences  originally  recorded  to  AOCI  through  the  income  statement  result  in  disproportionate  tax  effects  remaining  in  AOCI.  As  ofDecember 31, 2018, the Company adopted Accoun

which  allows  companies  to  reclassify  the  income  tax  effects  of  TCJA  on  items  within  AOCI  to  retained  earnings.  As  a  result  of  the  TCJA  tax  ratereduction,
 there were income tax effects related to the Company’s hedge and pension positions of $2  million and $22 million ,  respectively, remaining in theCompany’s
 accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss  balance.  The  Company  reclassified  these  tax  effects  from  accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss  toaccumulated deficit as of 
December 31, 2018 . During
 2018, the Company continued to assess the impacts of the TCJA and filed its 2017 federal and state income tax returns. As of December 31, 2018,the
 Company completed its analysis of the estimated impact of TCJA on its federal and state income taxes based on information available to date, and recordedadjustments to its provision
al estimates under SAB 118 in the amount of $12 million . These estimates may be revised  in the future for changes in income tax laws,additional regulatory gui

 the federal NOL carryforwards are more likely than not to be recovered and require no valuation allowance. The Company’s federal NOL carryforwardswill begin to expire in 
2028 . As
 of December  31, 2018 and 2017 ,  the Company had state NOLs of $547  million and $322 million ,  respectively, a portion of which are offset by avaluation
 allowance because the Company does not believe these NOLs are more likely than not to be realized. The  state NOL carryforwards began to expire in2018 through 2037

 Company’s tax positions relate primarily to the deductions claimed for repair and maintenance costs on its utility plant. The gross liability was reducedprimarily
 as a result of the Section 481(a) adjustment allocated for the current year related to the accounting method change the Company filed with its 2015 taxreturn.
 The  Company  does  not  anticipate  material  changes  to  its  unrecognized  tax  benefits  within  the  next  year.  However,  the  Company  expects  to  utilize  asignificant
 portion of the remaining NOLs in 2019 and fully utilize its NOLs in 2020, as a result, a balance sheet reclassification between the unrecognized taxbenefits
 and deferred income tax asset is anticipated due to the lack of available NOLs to offset. If the Company sustains all of its positions as of December 31, 2018 
,  an  unrecognized  tax  benefit  of $10  million ,  excluding  interest  and  penalties,  would  impact  the  Company’s  effective  tax  rate.  The  Company  had  aninsignificant amount of

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits
The
 Company maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of its regulated utility and shared services operations.Benefits
 under the plans are based on the employee’s years of service and compensation. The pension plans have been closed for all new employees. The pensionplans
 were closed for most employees hired on or after January 1, 2006. Union employees hired on or after January 1, 2001, except for specific eligible groupsspecified in
 the plan, had their accrued benefit frozen and will be able to receive this benefit as a lump sum upon termination or retirement. Union employees hiredon
 or after January 1, 2001 and non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2006 are provided with a 5.25% of  base pay defined contribution plan. TheCompany
 does not participate in a multi-employer plan. The Company also has unfunded noncontributory supplemental non-qualified pension plans that provideadditional retirement benefits to
 certain employees.The Company’s pension
 funding practice is to contribute at least the greater of the minimum amount required by the Employee Retirement Income SecurityAct
 of 1974 or the normal cost. Further, the Company will consider additional contributions if needed to avoid “at risk” status and benefit restrictions under thePension
 Protection Act of 2006 (“PPA”). The Company may also consider increased contributions, based on other financial requirements and the plans’ fundedposition.
 Pension expense in excess of the amount contributed to the pension plans is deferred by certain regulated subsidiaries pending future recovery in ratescharged
 for utility services as contributions are made to the plans. See Note  7—Regulatory Assets and Liabilities for  additional information. Pension plan assetsare invested in a number o
f actively managed, commingled funds, and limited partnerships including equities, fixed income securities, guaranteed annuity contractswith insurance companies, r
eal estate funds and real estate investment trusts (“REITs”).115

Table of ContentsThe
 Company maintains other postretirement benefit plans providing varying levels of medical and life insurance to eligible retirees. The retiree welfareplans are closed for union employees hired on or after January 1, 20
06. The plans had previously closed for non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2002.The
 Company’s policy is to fund other postretirement benefit costs up to the amount recoverable through rates. Assets of the plans are invested in a number ofactively managed and co
mmingled funds including equities and fixed income securities.The
 investment policy guideline of the pension plan is focused on diversification, improving returns and reducing the volatility of the funded status over along-term
 horizon. The investment policy guidelines of the postretirement plans focus on the appropriate strategy given the funded status of the plans. None of theCompany’s securities are 
included in pension or other postretirement benefit plan assets.The
 Company  uses  fair  value  for  all  classes  of  assets  in  the  calculation  of  market-related  value  of  plan  assets.  As  of  2017,  the  fair  values  and  assetallocations of
 the pension plan assets include the American Water Pension Plan, the New York Water Service Corporation Pension Plan, and the Shorelands WaterCompany, Inc. Pension Plan.

 Company’s postretirement benefit plans have different levels of funded status and the assets are held under various trusts. The investments and riskmitigation
 strategies  for  the  plans  are  tailored  specifically  for  each  trust.  In  setting  new  strategic  asset  mixes,  consideration  is  given  to  the  likelihood  that  theselected
 asset allocation will effectively fund the projected plan liabilities and meet the risk tolerance criteria of the Company. The Company periodically updatesthe
 long-term,  strategic  asset  allocations  for  these  plans  through  asset  liability  studies  and  uses  various  analytics  to  determine  the  optimal  asset  allocation.Considerations include plan l
iability characteristics, liquidity needs, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns.In
 2012,  the  Company  implemented  a  de-risking  strategy  for  the  American  Water  Pension  Plan  after  conducting  an  asset-liability  study  to  reduce  thevolatility
 of the funded status of the plan. As part of the de-risking strategy, the Company revised the asset allocations to increase the matching characteristics offixed-income
 assets  relative  to  liabilities.  The  fixed  income  portion  of  the  portfolio  was  designed  to  match  the  bond-like  and  long-dated  nature  of  thepostretirement
 liabilities. In 2017, the Company further increased its exposure to liability-driven investing and increased its fixed-income allocation to 50% , up from 
40% , in an effort to furthe r decrease the funded status volatility of the plan and hedge the portfolio from movements in interest rates.117

Table of ContentsIn
 2012, the Company also implemented a de-risking strategy for the medical bargaining trust within the plan to minimize volatility. In 2017, the Companyconducted
 a new asset-liability study that indicated medical trend inflation that outpaced the Consumer Price Index by more than 2% for the last 20 years. Givencontinuously
 rising medical costs, the Company decided to increase the equity exposure of the portfolio to 30% ,  up from 20% ,  while reducing the fixed-incomeportion of the portfolio f
rom 80% to 70% . The Company also conducted an asset -liability study for the Postretirement Non-Bargaining Medical Plan. Its allocationwas
 adjusted to make it more conservative, reducing the equity allocation from 70% to 60% and  increasing the fixed-income allocation from 30% to 40% . The Postretirement
 Medical Non-Bargaining plan’s equity allocation was reduced due to the cap on benefits for some non-union participants and resultant reduction inthe plan’s liabilities.
In
 2018, the Company announced plan design changes to the medical bargaining benefit plan, which resulted in a cap on future benefits and an over fundedpostretirement
 medical  benefits  bargaining  plan. Given the change in funded status,  the Retirement  and Benefit  Plans Investment  Committee  (the  “InvestmentCommittee”),
 which is responsible for overseeing the investment of the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans’ assets, commissioned a newasset-liability
 study for the postretirement medical bargaining plan. This study concluded that it was prudent to decrease the risk in the plan and to remove itsequity
 exposure. The study also recommended reducing its exposure to changes in interest rates by matching the assets of the plan to the projected cash flows forfuture
 benefit payments of the liability. The Investment Committee agreed with the recommendations and voted to invest the postretirement medical bargainingplan assets in fixed-inco
me securities.The
 restructuring of the plan was initiated towards the end of 2018. Once fully completed, the plans assets will be invested in fixed-income securities. Themajority
 of  the  securities  will  be  used  to  match  the  projected  cash  flows  for  future  benefit  payments  of  the  liability.  Plan  assets  in  excess  of  those  securitiesdesigned to match the long-
term liabilities will be invested in shorter duration securities with a duration of about three years . The
 Company engages third-party investment managers for all invested assets. Managers are not permitted to invest outside of the asset class (e.g. fixedincome,
 equity,  alternatives)  or  strategy  for  which  they  have  been  appointed.  Investment  management  agreements  and  recurring  performance  and  attributionanalysis
 are used as tools to ensure investment managers invest solely within the investment strategy they have been provided. Futures and options may be used toadjust portfolio duration 
to align with a plan’s targeted investment policy.In
 order to minimize asset volatility relative to the liabilities, a portion of plan assets is allocated to fixed income investments that are exposed to interestrate
 risk.  Increases  in  interest  rates  generally  will  result  in  a  decline  in  the  value  of  fixed  income  assets  while  reducing  the  present  value  of  the  liabilities.Conversely,
 rate  decreases  will  increase  fixed  income  assets,  partially  offsetting  the  related  increase  in  the  liabilities.  Within  equities,  risk  is  mitigated  byconstructing a
 portfolio that is broadly diversified by geography, market capitalization, manager mandate size, investment style and process. For the postretirementmedical
 bargaining plan, all of its assets are in fixed-income securities and the asset structure is designed to meet the cash flows of the liabilities. This designreduces the plan’s exposure 
to changes in interest rates.Actual
 allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy updates, market value fluctuations, the length of timeit
 takes to fully implement investment allocations, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. The asset allocation is rebalanced on a quarterly basis, ifnecessary.

Cash—Cash
 and investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased, including certain short-term fixed-income securities, are consideredcash and are included in th
e recurring fair value measurements hierarchy as Level 1.Equity
 securities—For  equity  securities,  the  trustees  obtain  prices  from  pricing  services,  whose  prices  are  obtained  from  direct  feeds  from  marketexchanges,
 that the Company is able to independently corroborate. Equity securities are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and categorized as Level1. Certain equities, such as international securities held in the pensio
n plan are invested in commingled funds and/or limited partnerships. These funds are valued toreflect
 the plan fund’s interest in the fund based on the reported year-end net asset value. Since net asset value is not directly observable or not available on anationally recognized securities exchange for the commingled funds
, they are categorized as Level 2. For limited partnerships, the assets as a whole are categorizedas
 Level 3 due to the fact that the partnership provides the pricing and the pricing inputs are less readily observable. In addition, the limited partnership vehiclecannot be readily traded.
120

Table of ContentsFixed-income
 securities—The majority of U.S. Treasury securities and government bonds have been categorized as Level 1 because they trade in highly-liquid
 and transparent markets and their prices can be corroborated. The fair values of corporate bonds, mortgage backed securities, and certain government bondsare
 based on prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information of similar securities. They are categorized as Level 2 because thevaluations are calculated using models which utilize actively traded market data that the Company can corroborate. Exchange-tra
ded options and futures, for whichmarket
 quotations are readily available, are valued at the last reported sale price or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which they aretraded and are classi
fied as Level 1.Real estate fund—Real est
ate fund is categorized as Level 3 as the fund uses significant unobservable inputs for fair value measurement and the vehicle is inthe form of a limit

 are invested in commingled funds. Commingled funds are valued to reflect the plan fund’s interest in the fund based on the reported year-end net asset value. Since th
e net asset value is not directly observable for the commingled funds, they are categorized as Level 2.Guaranteed annuity contracts—Guara
nteed annuity contracts are categorized as Level 3 because the investments are not publicly quoted. Since these marketvalues
 are  determined  by  the provider,  they are  not highly  observable  and  have been  categorized  as  Level  3.  Exchange-traded  future  and option  positions  arereported in accordance wit

 July 31, 2016, the other postretirement benefit plan was re-measured to reflect a plan amendment, which capped benefits for certain non-union planparticipants.
 The re-measurement included a $156  million reduction  in future benefits payable to plan participants, and resulted in an $89  million reduction  to thenet
 accrued postretirement benefit obligation. The plan amendment will be amortized over 10.2 years, the  average future working lifetime to full eligibility age forall plan participants.
On
  August  31,  2018 ,  the  Postretirement  Medical  Benefit  Plan  was  remeasured  to  reflect  a  plan  change.  The  plan  change  resulted  in  a   $175  millionreduction
 in future benefits payable to plan participants, and, in combination with other experience reflected as of the remeasurement date, resulted in a  $227 million

In
 August 2006, the PPA was signed into law in the U.S. The PPA replaces the funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans by requiring thatdefined benefit plans
 contribute to 100% of the current liability funding target over seven years. Defined benefit plans with a funding status of less than 80% of thecurrent liability 
are defined as being “at risk” and additional funding requirements and benefit restrictions may apply. The PPA was effective for the 2008 plan yearwith
 short-term phase-in provisions for both the funding target and at-risk determination. The Company’s qualified defined benefit plan is currently funded abovethe
 at-risk threshold, and therefore the Company expects that the plans will not be subject to the “at risk” funding requirements of the PPA. The Company isproactively monitoring 
the plan’s funded status and projected contributions under the law to appropriately manage the potential impact on cash requirements.Minimum
 funding  requirements  for  the  qualified  defined  benefit  pension  plan  are  determined  by  government  regulations  and  not  by  accountingpronouncements.
 The Company plans to contribute amounts at least equal to or greater than the minimum required contributions or the normal cost in 2019 to the qualified pension plans. The Company p
lans to contribute to its 2019 other postretiremen t benefit cost for rate-making purposes.122

634  136  6 Because the above amounts ar
e net benefits, plan participants’ contributions have been excluded from the expected benefits.Accounting
 for pensions and other postretirement benefits requires an extensive use of assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets,the rate of future compensation increases received by the Company’s employees, mortality, turno
ver and medical costs. Each assumption is reviewed annually. Theassumptions
 are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capitalmarkets and the overal
l economy. These differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the Company recognizes.The following table provides th

Table of ContentsThe
 discount rate assumption was determined for the pension and postretirement benefit plans independently. At year-end 2011, the Company began usingan
 approach that approximates the process of settlement of obligations tailored to the plans’ expected cash flows by matching the plans’ cash flows to the couponsand
 expected maturity values of individually selected bonds. Historically, for each plan, the discount rate was developed at the level equivalent rate that wouldproduce the same present v
alue as that using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments.The
 expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return, prior to administrative and investment managementfees,
 for current and planned asset classes in the plans’ investment portfolios. Assumed projected rates of return for each of the plans’ projected asset classes wereselected
 after analyzing historical experience and future expectations of the returns and volatility of the various asset classes. Based on the target asset allocationfor
 each  asset  class,  the  overall  expected  rate  of  return  for  the  portfolio  was  developed,  adjusted  for  historical  and  expected  experience  of  active  portfoliomanagement results
 compared to the benchmark returns. The Company’s pension expense increases as the expected return on assets decreases. The Company usedan
 expected  return  on  plan  assets  of 5.95% to  estimate  its  2018  pension  benefit  costs,  and  an  expected  blended  return  based  on  weighted  assets  of 4.77% to estimate its 2018 other 
postretirement benefit costs.In
 the determination of year end 2014 projected benefit plan obligations, the Company adopted a new table based on the Society of Actuaries RP 2014mortality
 table including a generational BB-2D projection scale. The adoption resulted in a significant increase to pension and other postretirement benefit plans’projected benefit obl
igations. In 2015, a new MP 2015 Projection Scale was issued, but not adopted by the Company since all of the experience upon which the MP2015
 Projection  Scale  is  based  was  considered  by  the  Company  in  selecting  its  2014  assumptions.  For  year-end  2017,  the  Company  retained  the  Society  ofActuaries
 RP-2014 mortality table as its base mortality table but adopted the new MP-2017 generational projection scale to project mortality improvements after2006. In 2018, the Company adopted the new MP-2018 mort
ality improvement scale to gradually adjust future mortality rates downward.The following table provides th

The
 Company maintains 401(k) savings plans that allow employees to save for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. Employees can make contributions thatare
 invested at their direction in one or more funds. The Company makes matching contributions based on a percentage of an employee’s contribution, subject tocertain
 limitations. Due to the Company’s discontinuing new entrants into the defined benefit pension plan, on January 1, 2006, the Company began providing anadditional 
5.25% of  base  pay  defined  contribution  benefit  for  union  employees  hired  on  or  after  January  1,  2001  and  non-union  employees  hired  on  or  afterJanuary
 1, 2006. Plan expenses totaled $12  million , $13 million and $9 million for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 ,  respectively. All of the Company’s contributions areinvested in one or more funds a
t the direction of the employees.Note 16: Commitments and Contingencies

 June 8, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia granted final approval of a settlement class and global class actionsettlement
 (the  “Settlement”)  for  all  claims  and  potential  claims  by  all  putative  class  members  (collectively,  the  “Plaintiffs”)  arising  out  of  the  January  2014Freedom Industries, Inc. che
mical spill in West Virginia. The effective date of the Settlement is July 16, 2018.Under
 the terms and conditions of the Settlement, West Virginia-American Water Company (“WVAWC”) and certain other Company affiliated entities(collectively,
 the “American Water Defendants”) did not admit, and will not admit, any fault or liability for any of the allegations made by the Plaintiffs in any ofthe
 actions that were resolved. Under federal class action rules, claimants had the right, until December 8, 2017, to elect to opt out of the final Settlement. Lessthan
  100  of the  225,000  estimated  putative class members elected to opt out from the Settlement, and these claimants will not receive any benefit from or bebound by the terms of the Settl
ement.125

Table of ContentsIn June
 2018, the Company and its remaining non-participating general liability insurance carrier settled for a payment to the Company of  $20 million , out of a
 maximum of  $25 million  in  potential coverage under the terms of the relevant policy, in exchange for a full release by the American Water Defendants of allclaims against the insurance
 carrier related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill.As
 a result, the aggregate pre-tax amount to be contributed by WVAWC of the  $126  million  Settlement  with respect to the Company, net of insurancerecoveries,
 is  $23  million .  As of  December  31, 2018 , $40 million of  the aggregate  settlement  amount of  $126  million ,  reflecting  payments  made  by theCompany
 under the terms of the Settlement, is reflected in Accrued liabilities, and the offsetting insurance receivables are reflected in Other current assets on theConsolidated Balance Sheet. The Company h
as funded WVAWC’s contributions to the Settlement through existing sources of liquidity.In
 April 2017, the Lincoln County (West Virginia) Commission (the “LCC”) filed a complaint in Lincoln County state court against WVAWC and certainother
 defendants  not  affiliated  with  the  Company,  which  in  June  2017  was  transferred  to  the  West  Virginia  Mass  Litigation  Panel,  alleging  that  the  FreedomIndustries
 chemical  spill caused a public nuisance in Lincoln County under an ordinance  enacted  by the LCC in March 2017, more than three years after  theFreedom
 Industries chemical spill occurred. The complaint sought an injunction against WVAWC that would have required the creation of various databases andpublic
 repositories of documents related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill, as well as further study and risk assessments regarding the alleged exposure ofLincoln
 County residents to the released chemicals. On July 31, 2018, WVAWC filed a motion to dismiss the LCC’s complaint. On December 12, 2018, the MassLitigation
 Panel  granted  WVAWC’s  motion  to  dismiss  on  several  grounds,  including  being  barred  by  the  applicable  statute  of  limitations,  failure  to  allege  anuisance
 under applicable law, lack of standing, improper retroactive application of the nuisance ordinance and violation of WVAWC’s due process. The LCCvoted not to appeal this dec

ction
LitigationOn
 the evening of June 23, 2015, a 36-inch pre-stressed concrete transmission water main, installed in the early 1970s, failed. The water main is part ofWVAWC’s
 West Relay pumping station located in the City of Dunbar. The failure of the main caused water outages and low pressure to up to approximately25,000 
WVAWC  customers. In the early morning hours of June 25, 2015, crews completed a repair, but that same day, the repair developed a leak. On June 26,2015, a
 second repair was completed and service was restored that day to approximately 80% of  the impacted customers, and to the remaining approximately 20% by
 the  next  morning.  The  second  repair  showed  signs  of  leaking  but  the  water  main  was  usable  until  June  29,  2015  to  allow  tanks  to  refill.  The  system  wasreconfigured
 to maintain service to all but approximately 3,000 customers  while a final repair was completed safely on June 30, 2015. Water service was fullyrestored by July 1, 2015 to all custo
mers affected by this event.On
 June 2, 2017, a class action complaint was filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in Kanawha County against WVAWC on behalf of a purported class ofresidents
 and business owners who lost water service or pressure as a result of the Dunbar main break. The complaint alleges breach of contract by WVAWC forfailure
 to supply water, violation of West Virginia law regarding the sufficiency of WVAWC’s facilities and negligence by WVAWC in the design, maintenanceand operation of
 the water system. The plaintiffs seek unspecified alleged damages on behalf of the class for lost profits, annoyance and inconvenience, and loss ofuse, as well as punitive damag
es for willful, reckless and wanton behavior in not addressing the risk of pipe failure and a large outage.In
 October 2017, WVAWC filed with the court a motion seeking to dismiss all of the plaintiffs’ counts alleging statutory and common law tort claims.Furthermore,
 WVAWC  asserted  that  the  Public  Service  Commission  of  West  Virginia,  and  not  the  court,  has  primary  jurisdiction  over  allegations  involvingviolations
 of  the  applicable  tariff,  the  public  utility  code  and  related  rules.  On  May  30,  2018,  the  court,  at  a  hearing,  denied  WVAWC’s  motion  to  apply  theprimary
 jurisdiction doctrine, and on October 11, 2018, the court issued a written order to that effect. The court has not yet issued a written order on WVAWC’smotion
 to dismiss plaintiffs’ tort claims. The court has requested the parties submit a scheduling order with a trial date of August 26, 2019, and WVAWC hassought to prevent further dis
covery while its motion to dismiss is pending.The
 Company  and  WVAWC  believe  that  WVAWC  has  valid,  meritorious  defenses  to  the  claims  raised  in  this  class  action  complaint.  WVAWC  isvigorously
 defending  itself  against  these  allegations.  Given  the  current  stage  of  this  proceeding,  the  Company  cannot  reasonably  estimate  the  amount  of  anyreasonably possible losses or a 
range of such losses related to this proceeding.126

f these agreements on June 7, 2018 . Note 18: Fair Value of Financial Information
The following methods and assumptions we
re used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments:Current assets
 and current liabilities—The carrying amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for current assets and current liabilities, includingrevolving credit debt, 
due to the short-term maturities and variable interest rates, approximate their fair values.Preferred
 stock with mandatory redemption requirements and long-term debt—The fair values of preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirementsand
 long-term debt are categorized within the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs that are used to value each instrument. The fair value of long-term debtclassified as Level
 1 is calculated using quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 instruments are valued using observable inputs and Level 3 instruments are valuedusing
 observable and unobservable inputs. The fair values of instruments classified as Level 2 and Level 3 are determined by a valuation model that is based on aconventional
 discounted cash flow methodology and utilizes assumptions of current market rates. As a majority of the Company’s debt is not traded in activemarkets, the Company calculated
 a base yield curve using a risk-free rate (a U.S. Treasury securities yield curve) plus a credit spread that is based on the followingtwo
 factors: an average of the Company’s own publicly-traded debt securities and the current market rates for U.S. Utility A debt securities. The Company usedthese
 yield curve assumptions to derive a base yield for the Level 2 and Level 3 securities. Additionally, the Company adjusted the base yield for specific featuresof the debt securities incl
uding call features, coupon tax treatment and collateral for the Level 3 instruments.The
 following tables provide the carrying amounts, including fair value adjustments previously recognized in acquisition purchase accounting, and a fairvalue adjustment related to i
nterest rate swap fair value hedges (classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy), and the fair values of the financial instruments:

To
 increase  consistency  and  comparability  in  fair  value  measurements,  GAAP  establishes  a  fair  value  hierarchy  that  prioritizes  the  inputs  to  valuationtechniques used to measure 
fair value into three levels as follows:Level
 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access as of the reporting date.Financial
 assets  and  liabilities  utilizing  Level  1  inputs include  active  exchange-traded  equity  securities,  exchange-based  derivatives,  mutual  funds and  moneymarket funds.
Level
 2—Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable throughcorroboration
 with  observable  market  data.  Financial  assets  and  liabilities  utilizing  Level  2  inputs  include  fixed  income  securities,  non-exchange-basedderivatives, commingl
ed investment funds not subject to purchase and sale restrictions and fair-value hedges.Level
 3—Unobservable  inputs,  such  as  internally-developed  pricing  models  for  the  asset  or  liability  due  to  little  or  no  market  activity  for  the  asset  orliability.
 Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs include infrequently-traded non-exchange-based derivatives and commingled investment fundssubject to purchase and sal
e restrictions.Recurring Fair Value Measurements

 funds—The Company’s restricted funds primarily represent proceeds received from financings for the construction and capital improvement offacilities
 and from customers for future services under operations, maintenance and repair projects. Long-term restricted funds of $1  million and $1 million were included in Other long-ter
m assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Rabbi
 trust investments—The Company’s rabbi trust investments consist of equity and index funds from which supplemental executive retirement planbenefits and deferred 
compensation obligations can be paid. The Company includes these assets in Other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Deposits—Deposits
 include  escrow  funds  and  certain  other  deposits  held  in  trust.  The  Company  includes  cash  deposits  in  Other  current  assets  on  theConsolidated Balance Sheets.
Deferred
 compensation  obligations—The  Company’s  deferred  compensation  plans  allow  participants  to  defer  certain  cash  compensation  into  notionalinvestment
 accounts. The Company includes such plans in Other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The value of the Company’s deferredcompensation
 obligations is based on the market value of the participants’  notional investment  accounts. The notional investments are comprised primarily  ofmutual funds, which are based on obse
rvable market prices.Mark-to-market
 derivative assets and liabilities—The Company utilizes fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, typically designated as fair value hedges, toachieve
 a targeted level of variable-rate debt as a percentage of total debt. The Company also employs derivative financial instruments in the form of variable-to-fixed
 interest rate swaps and forward starting interest rate swaps, classified as economic hedges and cash flow hedges, respectively, in order to fix the interest coston
 existing  or  forecasted  debt.  The  Company  uses  a  calculation  of  future  cash  inflows  and  estimated  future  outflows,  which  are  discounted,  to  determine  thecurrent fair value. Additi
onal inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, counterparty credit risk, interest rates and market volatility.Other
 investments—Other  investments  primarily  represent  money  market  funds  used  for  active  employee  benefits.  The  Company  includes  otherinvestments in Other curr
ent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements

Note 19: Leases
The
 Company has entered into operating leases involving certain real property, vehicles, and equipment. Rental expenses under operating leases were $35 million 
, $29 million and $24 million for  the years ended December  31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 ,  respectively. The operating leases for real property, vehicles, andequipment will expire ove
r the next 40 years, seven years and five years, respectively. Certain operating leases have renewal options ranging from one to 60 years.The following table 
provides the minimum annual future rental commitment under operating leases that have initial or remaining non-cancelable lease termsover the next 
five years and thereafter:

80 The
 Company has a series of agreements with various public entities (the “Partners”) to establish certain joint ventures, commonly referred to as “public-private
 partnerships.” Under the public-private partnerships, the Company constructed utility plant, financed by the Company, and the Partners constructed utilityplant
 (connected to the Company’s property), financed by the Partners. The Company agreed to transfer and convey some of its real and personal property to thePartners
 in exchange for an equal principal amount of Industrial Development Bonds (“IDBs”), issued by the Partners under a state Industrial Development Bondand Commercial Developmen
t Act. The Company leased back the total facilities, including portions funded by both the Company and the Partners, under leases fora period of 
40 years.The
 leases related to the portion of the facilities funded by the Company have required payments from the Company to the Partners that approximate thepayments
 required  by  the  terms  of  the  IDBs  from  the  Partners  to  the  Company  (as  the  holder  of  the  IDBs).  As  the  ownership  of  the  portion  of  the  facilitiesconstructed by the Company will r
evert back to the Company at the end of the lease, the Company has recorded these as capital leases. The lease obligation and thereceivable
 for  the  principal  amount  of  the  IDBs  are  presented  by  the  Company  on  a  net  basis.  The  carrying  value  of  the  facilities  funded  by  the  Companyrecognized
 as a capital lease asset was $147  million and $150 million as  of December  31, 2018 and 2017 ,  respectively, which is presented in Property, plant andequipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheet
s. The future payments under the lease obligations are equal to and offset by the payments receivable under the IDBs.As of 
December  31, 2018 ,  the minimum annual future rental commitment under the operating leases for the portion of the facilities funded by the Partnersthat
 have initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year included in the preceding minimum annual rental commitments are $4  million in 2019 
through 2023 , and $59 million thereafter. Note 20: Segment Information
The
 Company’s  operating  segments  are  comprised  of  the  revenue-generating  components  of  its  businesses  for  which  separate  financial  information  isinternally
 produced  and  regularly  used  by  management  to  make  operating  decisions  and  assess  performance.  The  Company  operates  its  businesses  primarilythrough 
one reportable segment, the Regulated Businesses segment. The  Company also operates market-based businesses that provide a broad range of related andcomplementary water 
and wastewater services within non-reportable operating segments, collectively referred to as the Market-Based Businesses . The

ITEM 9A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The
 Company, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer,conducted
 an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under th
e Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report.Based
 on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December  31, 2018 ,  our disclosure controlsand
 procedures were effective at a reasonable level of assurance. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that theinformation required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Excha
nge Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the timeperiods specified in the
 SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officerand the Chief Financial Offi
cer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Report
ingOur management is responsible for
 establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f)of
 the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and ChiefFinancial Officer
 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes inaccordance
 with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that inreasonable
 detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded asnecessary
 to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordancewith
 authorizations  of  our  management  and  our  directors,  and  (iii)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorizedacquisition, use or disposition o
f our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because
 of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness
 to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate.Our
 management,  including  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  assessed  the  effectiveness  of  our  internal  control  over  financialreporting,
 as of December  31, 2018 ,  using the criteria described in Internal 
Control—Integrated
Framework
(2013)
 issued  by the Committee of SponsoringOrganizations of the Treadway Com
mission (COSO).Management
 has excluded Pivotal from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 since it was acquired by theCompany
 in a business combination in June 2018. Pivotal is a wholly owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from our assessment ofinternal
 control over financial reporting represent less than 1% and approximately 2% , respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as ofand for the year ended Dece
mber 31, 2018.Based on our evaluation under the 
framework in Internal
Control—Integrated
Framework
(2013)
 , our management concluded that our internal control overfinancial reporting was 
effective as of December 31, 2018 . The
 effectiveness  of  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of December  31,  2018 has  been  audited  by  PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP,  anindependent
 registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing in Item  8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of  this Annual Report on Form 10-K 
. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
On 
June 4, 2018 ,  the Company completed the acquisition of Pivotal. See Note  4—Acquisitions and Divestitures in  the Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements
 for  additional  information.  We  began  to  integrate  Pivotal  into  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  structure  and  expect  to  complete  thisintegration
 in  2019.  We  concluded  that  there  have  been  no  changes  in  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  that  occurred  during  the  three  months  ended December
 31, 2018 ,  other than changes resulting from the acquisition of Pivotal, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, theCompany’s
 internal control over financial reporting. As permitted by the SEC, management has elected to exclude Pivotal from its assessment of the effectivenessof its internal contro
ls over financial reporting as of  December 31, 2018 . 133

 of the six (6) month period measured from the date of separation from service, (b) the date of Executive’s death or (c) such earlier date as permittedunder Section 409A
 without the imposition of adverse taxation. Upon the first business day following the expiration of such period, all payments deferred pursuantto this paragraph

(vi)
    With  regard  to  any  provision  herein  that  provides  for  reimbursement  of  costs  and  expenses  or  in-kind  benefits,  except  aspermitted
 by Section 409A, (a) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit, (b) the amount ofexpenses
 eligible for reimbursement,  or in-kind benefits, provided during any taxable year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement,  or in-kindbenefits
 to be provided, in any other taxable year, and (c) such payments shall be made on or before the last day of Executive’s taxable year following the taxableyear in which the expense was incu
rred.5
