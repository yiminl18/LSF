PART I
Item 1.    Business
Oracle
 Corporation provides products and services that address all aspects of corporate information technology (IT) environments—applications, platform  andinfrastructure.
 Our applications, platform and infrastructure offerings are delivered to customers worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable ITdeployment
 models, including cloud-based, on-premise, or  hybrid,  which  enable  customer  choice  and  flexibility.  We  market  and  sell  our  offerings  globally  tobusinesses of many sizes, government agenc
ies, educational institutions and resellers with a worldwid e sales force positioned to offer the combinations that bestmeet customer needs.
Our
 Oracle Cloud offerings provide a comprehensive and fully  integrated stack of applications, platform, compute, storage and networking services in all threeprimary
 layers of the cloud: Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Our Oracle Cloud SaaS,  PaaS and IaaSofferings
 (collectively, “Oracle Cloud Services”) integrate the software, hardware and services on customers’ behalf in IT environments that we deploy, supportand
 manage for the customer. Our integrated Oracle Cloud  Services are designed to be rapidly deployable to enable customers shorter time to innovation; easilymaintainable
 to reduce integration and testing work; connectable among differing deployment models to enable interchangeability and extendibility between IT environments;
 compatible to easily move workloads between the Oracle Cloud and other IT environments; cost-effective by requiring lower upfront customerinvestment;
 and secure, standards-based and reliable. We are a leader in  the core technologies of cloud IT environments, including database and middlewaresoftware
 as well as enterprise applications, virtualization, clustering, large-scale systems management and related infrastructure. Our products and services arethe building blocks of our Oracle Cloud Services, our partners’ cloud services and our customers’ cloud IT environments.
Our
 cloud license  and on-premise license  deployment model includes Oracle Applications, Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware software offerings,among others, which customers deploy utilizing IT
 infrastructure from the Oracle Cloud or  their own cloud-based or on-premise IT environments. Substantially all customers, at their option, purchase
 license support contracts when they purchase a license. Our hardware products include Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage
 and  industry-specific  products,  among  others,  and  customers  generally  opt  to  purchase  hardware  support  contracts  when  they  make  a  hardwarepurchase. We also offer services to assist 
our customers and partners to maximize the performance of their Oracle purchases.Providing
 choice  and  flexibility  to  our  customers  as  to  when  and  how they  deploy  our  applications,  platform  and  infrastructure  technologies  is  an  importantelement of our corporate strategy. We believe that
 offering customers broad, comprehensive, flexible and interoperable deployment models for our applications,platform
 and infrastructure technologies is important to our growth strategy and better addresses customer needs relative to our competitors, many of whomprovide fewer offerings and more restrictive deployment models.
Our
 investments in, and innovation with respect to, our products and services that we offer through our cloud and license, hardware and services businesses are another
 important  element  of  our  corporate  strategy.  In  fiscal  2018,  2017  and  2016,  we  invested  $6.1  billion,  $6.2  billion  and  $5.8  billion,  respectively,  inresearch
 and  development  to  enhance  our  existing  portfolio  of offerings  and  products  and  to  develop  new  technologies  and  services.  We  have  a  deepunderstanding
 as to how applications, platform and infrastructure technologies interact and function with one another. We focus our development efforts onimproving 
the  performance,  security,  operation  and  integration  of  our  technologies  to  make  them  more  cost-effective  and  easier  to  deploy,  manage  andmaintain for
 our customers and to improve their computing performance relative to our competitors’ products.  For example, we believe that Oracle applicationsand
 platform technologies, such as the Oracle Database, when combined with Oracle infrastructure technologies deliver improved performance at a lower costrelative
 to competing infrastructure  technologies.  After  the  initial purchase  of  Oracle  products  and  services,  our  customers  can  continue  to  benefit  from  ourresearch and
 development efforts and deep IT expertise by electing to purchase and renew Oracle support offerings for their  license and hardware deployments,which may include product enhancements that we periodically deliver to our products, and by renewing their Oracle
 Cloud Services contracts with us.

Our
 selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. We believe  that our acquisitions enhance the products andservices that we can offer to customers, expand our customer base, provide greater scale to accelerate innovati
on, grow our revenues and earnings, and increasestockholder
 value. In recent years,  we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies that add to, arecomplementary
 to,  or  have  otherwise  enhanced  our  existing  offerings.  We  expect  to  continue  to  acquire  companies, products,  services  and  technologies  tofurther our corporate strategy.
We have three businesses:
 
 
• our cloud and license business, which is comprised of a single operating segment and includes our Oracle Cloud Services  offerings, cloud license andon-premise 
license  offerings,  and  license  support  offerings,  represented  82%,  80%  and  78%  of  our  total  revenues  in  fiscal  2018,  2017  and  2016,respectively;
 
 
• our hardware business, which is comprised of a single operating segment and includes our hardware products and related hardware  support servicesofferings, represented 10%, 11% and 13% of our total revenues in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively; and
 
 
• our  services  business,  which  is  comprised  of  a  single  operating  segment,  represented  8%  of  our  total  revenues  in fiscal  2018  and  9%  of  our  totalrevenues in each of fiscal 2017 and 2016.
Management’s
 Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  and  Note  15  of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  bothincluded elsewhere in this Annual Report, provide additional information related t
o our businesses and operating segments.Oracle Corporation was incorporated 
in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977.Applications, Platform and Infrastructure Technologies
Oracle’s
 comprehensive  portfolio  of  applications,  platform  and  infrastructure  technologies  is  designed  to  address  an  organization’s  IT environment  needsincluding
 business  process,  infrastructure  and  applications  development  requirements,  among  others.  Oracle  applications,  platform  and  infrastructuretechnologies
 are based upon industry standards and are designed to be enterprise-grade,  reliable, scalable and secure. We offer our applications, platform andinfrastructur
e offerings through our cloud and license, hardware and services businesses and deliver them through the Oracle Cloud, or through customer use ofother
 IT  environments  including  cloud-based,  hybrid  and on-premise. We  believe  our  applications,  platform  and  infrastructure  offerings  enable  flexibility,interoperability, and choice to best meet customer IT 
needs. Oracle License Support
Oracle
 license support  offerings represent our largest revenue stream and are a part of our cloud and license business. Substantially all of our customers opt topurchase license support contracts when they purchase Oracle applications, platform and/or 
infrastructure licenses to run within the Oracle Cloud or other cloud- based
 and on-premise IT  environments. Substantially all customers renew their license support contracts annually. Our license support contracts  are generallypriced
 as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to access the license and are typically one year in duration. We believe our license support offeringsprotect
 and enhance our customers’ current investments in Oracle  applications, platform and infrastructure technologies because they provide proactive andpersonalized support services, including Oracle Lifetime Support and unspecified license enhancements and upgrades during the term of the support 
period. Providing
 choice  and  flexibility to  our  customers  as  to  when  and  how  they  deploy  our  applications,  platform  and  infrastructure technologies  is an importantelement
 of our corporate strategy. In recent periods, customer demand has increased for our Oracle Cloud Services. To address customer demand and enablecustomer
 choice,  we  have  introduced  certain  programs  for  customers to  pivot  their  applications,  platform  and  infrastructure  licenses  and  license  supportcontracts
 to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for their existing workloads. We expect these trends tocontinue.

 among others, and related license support at the customer’s option. Our platform technologies are designed to provide a cost-effective, standards-based, 
high-performance platform for developing, running, integrating, managing and extending business applications. Our customers are increasingly focused on developing innovations and reducing the total cost of their IT infrastructure and we believe that 
our platform technologies help them achieve this goal. Our
 platform  technologies  are  designed  to  accommodate  demanding,  mission-critical  business environments  using  elastic  clusters  of  middleware,  databaseservers
 and  storage.  These  elastic  clusters  are  designed  to  scale  incrementally  as  required  to  address  our  customers’  IT  capacity  requirements,  satisfy  theirplanning
 and  procurement needs,  support  their  business  applications  with  a  standardized  platform  architecture,  reduce  their  risk  of  data  loss  and  ITinfrastructure
 downtime and efficiently utilize available IT resources to meet quality of service expectations. In addition to  utilizing these tools for modernizingtheir

tasks so our customers can utilize their IT resources to  focus on extracting more value from the data they currently manage.Oracle
 infrastructure technologies  provide  cloud-based  compute,  storage  and  networking  capabilities  through  our  Oracle  Cloud  IaaS  offerings.  Oracleinfrastructur
e technologies also include hardware and certain hardware-related software offerings such as Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry- specific
 hardware, virtualization software, operating systems, management software and related hardware services including support at the customer’s option.We
 design our infrastructure technologies to work in  customer environments that may include other Oracle or non-Oracle hardware  or software components.Our
 flexible  and  open  approach  provides  Oracle  customers  choice  on  how  they  utilize  and  deploy  our infrastructure  technologies:  through  the  use  of  OracleCloud
 Platform’s  IaaS  offerings;  in  our  customer’s  data  centers;  or  a  hybrid  combination  of  these  two  deployment  models.  We  focus  on  the  operation  andintegration
 of  our  infrastructure technologies  to make them  easier to deploy, extend,  interconnect,  manage and  maintain for our customers  and  to improvecomputing
 performance relative to our competitors’ offerings. For example, we believe that Oracle applications and platform technologies  when combined withOracle infrastructure technologies deliver improved performance at a l

customer’s behalf. We believe t hat we can market and sell our PaaS and IaaS offerings together to help customers migrate their extensive installed base ofon-premise 
platform  and infrastructure technologies  to the Oracle Cloud while at the same time reaching a broader ecosystem of developers and partners. Wealso
 believe we can market our PaaS and IaaS services to small and medium-sized businesses and non-IT lines  of business purchasers due to the highly available,low touch and low cost characteristics of the 
Oracle Cloud.Oracle Cloud Platform as a Servic

Oracle Cloud Operations
Oracle
 Cloud  Operations  deliver  our  Oracle  Cloud  Services  to  customers  through  a  secure,  reliable,  scalable,  enterprise  grade  cloud  infrastructure platform managed
 by  our  employees  within  a  global  network  of  data  centers,  which  we  refer  to  as  the  Oracle  Cloud.  Oracle  Cloud  Operations  leverage  automatedsoftware
 tools to enable the rapid delivery of the latest cloud technology capabilities to the  Oracle Cloud as they become available. The Oracle Cloud enablessecure and isolated cloud-based instances for each of our customers to access the functionalit
y of our Oracle Cloud Services via a broad spectrum of devices.Manufacturing
To
 produce  our  hardware  products  that  we market  and  sell  to  third-party  customers  and  that  we  utilize  internally  to  deliver  as  a  part  of  our  Oracle  Cloudoperations,
 we rely on both our internal manufacturing operations as well as third-party manufacturing partners. Our internal manufacturing  operations consistprimaril
y of materials procurement, assembly, testing and quality control of our Oracle Engineered Systems and certain of our enterprise and data center serversand
 storage products. For all other manufacturing, we generally  rely on third-party manufacturing partners to produce our hardware-related components andhardware
 products and we may involve our internal manufacturing operations in the final assembly, testing and quality control processes for these components and products. We distribute most of our hardware products either from our facilities or partner facilities. Our manufactur
ing processes are substantially based onstandardization
 of components across product types, centralization of assembly  and distribution centers and a “build-to-order” methodology  in which productsgenerally
 are built only after customers have placed firm orders. Production  of our hardware products requires that we purchase materials, supplies, productsubassemblies
 and full assemblies from a number of vendors. For most of our hardware products, we have existing alternate sources of supply or such sourcesare
 readily available. However, we do rely on sole sources for certain of our hardware products. As a result, we continue to evaluate potential risks of disruptionto
 our supply chain operations. Refer to “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A within  this Annual Report for additional discussion of the challenges we encounterwith respect to the sources and availability
 of supplies for our products and the related risks to our business.Sales and Marketing
We
 directly market and sell our cloud,  license, hardware and services offerings to businesses of many sizes and in many industries, government agencies andeducationa
l institutions. We also market and sell our offerings through indirect channels. No single customer accounted for 10% or  more of our total revenues infiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016.
In
 the United States, our sales and services employees are based in our headquarters  and in field offices throughout the country. Outside the United States, ourinternati
onal subsidiaries sell, support and service our offerings in their local countries as well as within other foreign countries where we do not operate through a
 direct  sales  subsidiary.  Our  geographic  coverage  allows  us  to  draw  on  business  and  technical  expertise  from  a  global  workforce,  provides  stability  to  ouroperations
 and revenue streams to offset geography specific economic trends and offers  us an opportunity to take advantage of new markets for our offerings.Our
 international operations subject us to certain risks, which are more fully described in “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A of this Annual Report. A summary ofour
 domestic and international revenues and long-lived assets is set forth in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in thisAnnual Report.
We
 also  market  our  product  offerings  worldwide  through  indirect  channels.  The  companies  that  comprise  our  indirect  channel  network  are  members  of  theOracle
 Partner  Network.  The  Oracle  Partner  Network  is  a  global  program  that  manages  our  business  relationships  with  a  large,  broad-based  network  ofcompanies,
 including independent software and hardware vendors, system integrators and resellers that deliver  innovative solutions and services based uponour
 product  offerings.  By  offering  our  partners  access  to  our  product  offerings,  educational  information,  technical  services,  marketing  and  sales  support,  theOracle
 Partner Network program extends  our market reach by providing our partners with the resources they need to be successful in delivering solutions tocustomers globally. The majority of 
our hardware products are sold through indirect channels including independent distributors and value-added resellers.

Research and Development
We
 develop the substantial majority of our product offerings internally. In addition, we have extended our product offerings and intellectual property through acquisitions
 of businesses and technologies. We also purchase or license intellectual property rights in certain circumstances. Internal development allows us tomaintain
 technical control over the design and development of our products. We have  a number of United States and foreign patents and pending applicationsthat
 relate to various aspects of our products and technology. While we believe that our patents have value, no single patent is essential to us or to any of ourprincipal 
businesses. Research and  development expenditures were $6.1 billion, $6.2 billion and $5.8 billion in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, or 15% oftotal
 revenues in fiscal 2018 and 16% of total revenues in each of fiscal 2017 and  2016. Rapid technological advances in hardware and software development,evolving
 standards  in  computer  hardware  and  software  technology,  changing  customer  needs  and  frequent  new  product  introductions,  offerings  andenhancements
 characterize the markets  in which we compete. We plan to continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and developmentefforts to maintain and improve our current product and services offerings.
Employees
As
 of May 31, 2018, we employed approximately  137,000 full-time employees, including approximately 39,000 in sales and marketing, approximately 18,000 inour
 cloud services and license support operations, approximately 4,000  in hardware, approximately 24,000 in services, approximately  39,000 in research anddevelopment
 and approximately 13,000 in general and administrative positions. Of these employees, approximately 49,000 were employed in the United Statesand
 approximately  88,000  were  employed  internationally. None  of  our  employees  in  the  United  States  is  represented  by  a  labor  union;  however,  in  certainforeign subsidiaries, labor unions or workers’ councils represent some of
 our employees.Seasonality and Cyclicality
Our
 quarterly revenues have historically  been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including the structure of our sales force incentive compensation plans,which
 are common in the technology industry. In each fiscal year, our total revenues and operating margins are typically  highest in our fourth fiscal quarter andlowest
 in our first fiscal quarter. The operating margins of our businesses (in particular, our cloud and license business and hardware business) are generallyaffected by
 seasonal factors in a similar manner as our  revenues as certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term. See “SelectedQuarterly
 Financial  Data”  in  Item  7  of  this  Annual  Report  for  a  more  complete  description  of  the  seasonality and  cyclicality  of  our  revenues,  expenses  andmargins.
Competition
We
 face intense  competition  in all aspects  of our business.  The nature  of the IT industry  creates  a competitive  landscape  that is constantly  evolving as  firmsemerge, expand or are acquired, as technology evolves and as customer demands and competitive pressures otherwise
 change.Our
 customers are  demanding less complexity and lower total cost in the implementation, sourcing, integration and ongoing maintenance of their enterprisesoftware
 and hardware. Our enterprise cloud license and on-premise license,  and hardware offerings compete directly with certain offerings from some of thelargest
 and most competitive companies in the world, including Amazon.com, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, International Business Machines Corporation (IBM),Intel 
Corporation,  Cisco  Systems,  Inc.,  Adobe  Systems  Incorporated,  Alphabet  Inc.  and  SAP  SE,  as  well  as  other  companies  like  Hewlett-Packard  Enterprise,salesforce.com,
 inc. and Workday, Inc. In addition, due to the low barriers to entry in many of our market  segments, new technologies and new and growingcompetitors frequently emerge to
 challenge our offerings. Our competitors range from companies offering broad IT solutions across many of our lines of businessto
 vendors  providing  point solutions,  or  offerings  focused  on  a  specific  functionality,  product  area  or  industry.  In  addition,  as  we  expand  into  new  marketsegments, we face
 increased competition as we compete with existing competitors, as well as firms that may be partners in other areas of our business and other firms with whom we have not previousl
y competed. 
12

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
Moreover,
 we or our competitors may take certain strategic actions—including acquisitions, partnerships and joint ventures, or repositioning of product lines—which invite even greater 
competition in one or more product offering categories. Key
 competitive factors in each of the segments in which we currently compete and may compete  in the future include: total cost of ownership, performance,scalability,
 reliability,  security,  functionality,  efficiency,  speed  to  production  and  quality  of  technical  support.  Our  product  and  service  sales  (and  the  relativestrength of our 
products and services versus those of our competitors) are also  directly and indirectly affected by the following, among other things: 
 
•  the adoption of cloud-based IT offerings including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings; 
 
•  ease of deployment, use and maintenance of our products and services offerings; 
 
• compatibility between Oracle products and services deployed within local IT environments and public cloud IT environments, including our Oracle Cloud environments;
 
 
•  the adoption of commodity servers and microprocessors; 
 
•  the broader “platform” competition between our industry standard Java technology platform and the .NET programming environment of Microsoft;  
 
• operating system competition among our Oracle Solaris and Linux operating systems, with alternatives including Microsoft’s Windows Server, and other UNIX and Linux operating systems;
 
 
•  the adoption of open source alternatives to commercial software by enterprise software customers; 
 
•  products, features and functionality developed internally by customers and their IT staff; 
 
•  products, features and functionality customized and implemented for customers by consultants, systems integrators or other third parties; and  
 
•  attractiveness of offerings from business processing outsourcers.For more information about the competitive r
isks we face, refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report.Available Information

Factors We
 operate in rapidly  changing  economic and  technological environments  that  present  numerous  risks, many of which  are driven  by factors  that we cannotcontrol
 or predict. The following discussion, as well as our “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” discussion in Management’s Discussion and Analysis ofFinancial
 Condition  and  Results  of Operations  (Item 7),  highlights some of these risks. The risks described  below are not exhaustive and you should carefullyconsider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities.
Our
 Oracle Cloud strategy, including our Oracle Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and  Data as aService
 (DaaS)  offerings,  may  adversely  affect  our  revenues  and  profitability.     We  provide  our  cloud  and  other  offerings  to  customers  worldwide  viadeployment models that best suit their needs, including 
via our cloud-based SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and Da aS offerings. As these business 
14

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
models
 continue  to  evolve,  we  may  not  be  able  to  compete  effectively,  generate  significant  revenues  or  maintain  the  profitability  of  our  cloud  offerings.Additionally, the increasing prevalence 
of cloud  and SaaS delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our cloud andlicense
 offerings. If we do not successfully execute our cloud computing strategy or anticipate the cloud computing needs of our customers,  our reputation as acloud services provider could be harmed and our revenues and profitability could decline.
As customer demand for 
our cloud  offerings increases, we experience volatility in our reported revenues and operating results due to the differences in timing ofrevenue
 recognition  between  our  cloud  license  and on-premise license, and  hardware  arrangements  relative  to  our  cloud  offering  arrangements.  Customersgenerally
 purchase  our  cloud  offerings  on  a  subscription  basis  and  revenues  from  these  offerings  are  generally  recognized  ratably  over  the  terms  of  thesubscriptions. 
Consequently,  any  deterioration  in  sales  activity  associated  with  our  cloud  offerings  may  not  be  immediately  observable  in  our  consolidatedstatement of operations. This is in
 contrast to revenues associated with our cloud license and on-premise license arrangements which are  generally recognized infull at the time of 
delivery of the related licenses. In addition, we incur certain expenses associated with the infrastructure and marketing of our cloud offerings in advance of our ability to recognize the revenues ass
ociated with these offerings.We have also acquired a number of cloud 
computing companies,  and the integration of these companies into our Oracle Cloud strategy may not be as efficient orscalable as anticipated, which could adversely affect our abi
lity to fully realize the benefits anticipated from these acquisitions. Our
 success depends upon our ability to develop new products and services, integrate acquired products and services and enhance  our existing products andservices. 
    Rapid  technological  advances,  changing  delivery  models  and  evolving  standards  in  computer  hardware  and  software  development  andcommunications infrastructure, 
changing and increasingly sophisticated customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the
 industries  in which  we compete.  If  we are unable  to develop new or sufficiently differentiated  products  and  services, enhance  and  improve  our  productofferings
 and support services in a timely manner or position and price our products and services to meet demand, customers may not purchase or subscribe toour
 software,  hardware  or  cloud  offerings  or  renew  software support,  hardware  support  or  cloud  subscriptions  contracts.  Renewals  of  these  contracts  areimportant
 to the growth of our business. In addition, we cannot provide any assurance that the standards on which we choose to develop new products willallow us to compete effectively f
or business opportunities in emerging areas.We
 have continued to refresh and release new offerings of our cloud products  and services, including the launch of the Oracle Autonomous Data WarehouseCloud
 Service in  fiscal 2018.  The  Oracle  Autonomous  Data Warehouse Cloud  Service offers automation based  on machine  learning and  we have guaranteed,among
 other matters,  that it will reduce customer downtime to less than 30 minutes a year and that Amazon Data Warehouse customers will see a significantcost
 reduction if they migrate their workloads to our offering. Machine learning and artificial intelligence  are increasingly driving innovations in technology but ifthey
 fail to operate as anticipated or the Oracle Autonomous Warehouse Cloud Service or our other products do not perform as promised, our business andreputation may be harmed.
In addition, our business may be adversely affected if:
 
 
•  we do not continue to develop and release new or enhanced products and services within the anticipated time frames; 
 
•  there is a delay in market acceptance of new, enhanced or acquired product lines or services; 
 
•  there are changes in information technology (IT) trends that we do not adequately anticipate or address with our product development efforts;  
 
•  we do not timely optimize complementary product lines and services; or 
 
•  we fail to adequately integrate, support or enhance acquired product lines or services.We
 might experience significant coding, manufacturing or configuration errors in our cloud, license and hardware offerings.     Despite testing prior to therelease and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service,

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
our cloud, license and hardware offerings sometimes contain coding or manufacturing errors that can impact their function, performance and security, and result
in
 other negative consequences. The detection  and correction of any errors in released cloud, license or hardware offerings can be time consuming and costly.Errors
 in our cloud, license or hardware offerings could affect their ability to properly function or operate with other cloud, license  or hardware offerings, coulddelay
 the development or release of new products or services or new versions of products or services, could create security vulnerabilities in our products orservices,
 and could adversely affect market acceptance  of our products or services. This includes third-party software products or services incorporated into ourown.
 If we experience errors or delays in releasing our cloud, license or hardware offerings or new versions thereof, our sales could  be affected and revenuescould
 decline. In addition, we run Oracle’s business operations as well as cloud and other services that we offer to our customers on our products and networks.Therefore,
 any flaws could affect our ability to conduct  our business operations and the operations of our customers. Enterprise customers rely on our cloud,license
 and hardware offerings and related services to run their businesses and errors in our cloud, license and hardware offerings and related  services couldexpose us to product liability, performance and warranty
 claims as well as significant harm to our brand and reputation, which could impact our future sales.If
 our  security  measures  for  our  products  and  services  are  compromised  and  as  a  result,  our  data,  our  customers’  data  or  our  IT  systems  are accessed improperly,
 made  unavailable,  or  improperly  modified,  our  products  and  services  may  be  perceived  as  vulnerable,  our  brand  and  reputation  could  bedamaged,
 the IT services we provide to our customers could be disrupted, and customers may stop  using our products and services, all of which could reduceour
 revenue and earnings, increase our expenses and expose us to legal claims and regulatory actions.     We are in the IT business, and our products andservices,
 including our Oracle Cloud Services, store, retrieve, manipulate and manage our customers’ information and data, external data, as well as our owndata.
 We have a reputation for secure and reliable product offerings and related services  and we have invested a great deal of time and resources in protectingthe
 integrity and security of our products, services and the internal and external data that we manage. At times, we encounter attempts by third parties (whichmay 
include  individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, such as state-sponsored organizations, nation states and individuals sponsored bythem)
 to  identify  and  exploit  product  and  service  vulnerabilities,  penetrate  or  bypass  our security  measures,  and  gain  unauthorized  access  to  our  or  ourcustomers’,
 partners’  and  suppliers’  software,  hardware  and  cloud  offerings,  networks  and  systems,  any  of  which  could  lead  to  the  compromise  of  personalinformation
 or the confidential  information  or  data  of  Oracle  or  our  customers.  Computer  hackers  and  others  may  be  able  to  develop  and  deploy  IT  relatedviruses,
 worms, and other malicious software programs that could attack our networks, systems, products and services,  exploit potential security vulnerabilitiesof
 our  networks,  systems,  products  and  services,  create  system  disruptions  and  cause  shutdowns  or  denials  of  service.  This  is  also  true  for  third-party  data,products or services incorporated into 
our own. Data may also be  accessed or modified improperly as a result of customer, partner, employee or supplier error ormalfeasance
 and third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce customers, partners, employees or suppliers into disclosing sensitive information  such as usernames,
 passwords  or  other  information  in  order  to  gain  access  to  our  data,  our  customers’,  suppliers’  or  partners’  data  or  the  IT  systems  of  Oracle,  ourcustomers, suppliers or partners.
Security
 industry experts and government officials have warned about the risks of hackers and cyber-attacks targeting IT products and businesses. Although this is an
 industry-wide problem that affects software and hardware companies generally, it affects Oracle in particular because computer hackers tend to focus theirefforts
 on the most prominent IT companies, and they may focus on Oracle because  of our reputation for, and marketing efforts associated with, having secureproducts
 and services. These risks will increase as we continue to grow our cloud offerings and store and process increasingly large amounts of data, includingpersonal
 information and our customers’ confidential information and data and other external data, and host or manage parts of our customers’ businesses incloud-based
 IT environments, especially in customer sectors involving particularly sensitive  data such as health sciences, financial services, retail, hospitality andthe
 government. We also have an active acquisition program and have acquired a number of companies, products, services and technologies over the years.While
 we make significant  efforts to address any IT security issues with respect to our acquired companies, we may still inherit such risks when we integratethese companies within Oracle.

Because
 the  techniques  used  to  obtain  unauthorized  access  to,  or  sabotage  IT  systems  change  frequently, grow  more  complex  over  time,  and  often  are  notrecognized
 until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to prevent against such techniques. Our internal IT systems continue to evolve and we are often e
arly adapters of new technologies. However, our business policies and internal security controls m ay not keep pacewith
 these changes as new  threats emerge. In addition, we may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after thesecurity breach.
We
 could suffer significant damage to our brand and reputation if a cyber-attack or other security incident were to allow unauthorized access to or modification of
 our customers’ or suppliers’ data, other external data, or our own data or our IT systems or if the services we provide to our customers were disrupted, or ifour
 products  or  services  are  perceived  as  having  security vulnerabilities.  Customers  could  lose  confidence  in  the  security  and  reliability  of  our  products  andservices,
 including our cloud offerings, and perceive them to be not secure. This could lead to fewer customers using our products and services and result  inreduced
 revenue  and  earnings.  The  costs  we  would  incur  to  address  and  fix  these  security  incidents  would  increase  our  expenses.  These  types  of  securityincidents
 could also lead to loss or destruction of information, inappropriate use of proprietary  and sensitive data, lawsuits, indemnity obligations, regulatoryinvestigat
ions and financial penalties, and claims and increased legal liability, including in some cases contractual costs related to customer notification and fraudmonitoring.
As
 illustrated by the Spectre and Meltdown threats, our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components  across a broadecosystem.
 If there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liabilityclaims, customer dissatisfaction, reduced revenue, or 
harm to our reputation or competitive positi on.Our
 business practices with respect to data could give rise to operational interruption, liabilities  or reputational harm as a result of governmental regulation,legal
 requirements or industry standards relating to consumer privacy and data protection.     As regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and worldwide laws and regulations concerning the handling of personal inform
ation expand and become more complex, potential risks related to data collection anduse within our business will intensify. For e
xample, the European Union (EU) and the United States (U.S.) form ally entered into a new framework in July 2016 thatprovides
 a mechanism for companies to transfer data from EU member states to the U.S. This new framework, called the Privacy Shield, is intended to addressshortcomings
 identified by the Court of Justice of the EU in the previous EU-U.S. Safe  Harbor Framework, which the Court of Justice invalidated in October 2015.The
 Privacy Shield and other data transfer mechanisms  are currently subject to challenges in European courts, which may lead to uncertainty about the legalbasis for data transfers to
 the U.S. or interruption of such transfers. In the event any court blocks transfers to or from a particular jurisdiction on the basis that no transfer mechanisms
 are legally adequate, this could give rise to operational interruption in the performance of services for customers and internal processing ofemployee information, regulatory li
abilities or reputational harm. In
 addition,  U.S.  and  foreign  governments  have  enacted  or  are  considering  enacting  legislation  or  regulations,  or  may  in  the near  future  interpret  existinglegislation
 or regulations, in a manner that could significantly impact our ability, as well as the ability of our customers, partners and data providers, to collect,augment,
 analyze, use, transfer and share personal and  other information that is integral to certain services we provide. This could be true particularly in thosejurisdictions
 where  privacy  laws or  regulators  take  a  broader  view  of  how  personal  information  is  defined,  therefore  subjecting  the handling  of  such  data  toheightened restrictions that
 may be obstructive to our operations and the operations of our customers, partners and data providers. This impact may be acute incountries that have passed or
 are considering passing legislat ion that requires data to remain localized “in country,” as this imposes financial costs on any serviceprovider
 that is required to store data in jurisdictions not of its choosing and nonstandard operational processes that are difficult  and costly to integrate withglobal processes.
Regulators globally
 are also imposing greater monetary fines for privacy violations. For example, in  2016, the EU adopted the General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR),
 which became effective in May 2018. The law establishes new requirements regarding the handling of personal data. Non-compliance with  the GDPRmay result in
 monetary penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. The GDPR and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protectionof personal and other types of data could greatl
y increase 
17

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
the
 size of potential fines related to data protection and our cost of providing our products and services could result in changes to our business practices or evenprevent
 us from offering certain  services in jurisdictions in which we operate. Although we have implemented contracts, policies and procedures designed toensure
 compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, partners,  data providers or agents will notviolate
 such  laws  and  regulations  or  our  contracts,  policies  and  procedures.  Additionally,  public  perception  and  standards  related  to  the  privacy  of  personalinformation
 can shift rapidly, in ways that may affect  our reputation or influence regulators to enact regulations and laws that may limit our ability to providecertain products.
We
 make statements  about  our  use  and  disclosure  of  personal  information  through  our  privacy  policy,  information  provided  on  our  website  and  pressstatements.
 Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with these public statements or with U.S. federal,  state, or foreign laws and regulations, includinglaws
 and regulations regulating privacy, data security, or consumer protection, public perception, standards, self-regulatory requirements or legal obligations,could
 result in lost or restricted  business, proceedings, actions or fines brought against us or levied by governmental entities or others, or could adversely affectour business and harm our reputation.
Economic,
 political and market conditions can adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability, which in turn could adve
rsely affect our stock price.     Our business is influenced by a range of factors that  are beyond our control and that we haveno comparative advantage in forecasting. 
These include:  
 
•  general economic and business conditions; 
 
•  overall demand for enterprise cloud, license and hardware products and services; 
 
•  governmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities; and 
 
•  general legal, regulatory and political developments.Macroeconomic
 developments  like  the  developments  associated  with  the  United  Kingdom’s  vote  to  exit  the  EU  or  the  occurrence  of  similar  events  in other countries
 that  lead  to  uncertainty  or  instability  in  economic,  political  or  market  conditions  could  negatively  affect  our  business,  operating  results,  financialcondition
 and outlook, which, in turn, could adversely affect our stock price. Any general  weakening of, and related declining corporate confidence in, the globaleconomy
 or  the  curtailment  of  government  or  corporate  spending  could  cause  current  or  potential  customers  to  reduce  or  eliminate  their  IT  budgets  andspending, which 
could  cause customers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services or cause customers not to pay us or to delay payingus for previously purchased products and services.
In
 addition, international, regional or domestic political unrest and the related potential impact on global stability, terrorist attacks and the potential  for otherhostilities
 in  various  parts  of  the  world,  potential  public  health  crises  and  natural  disasters  continue  to  contribute  to  a  climate  of  economic  and  politicaluncertainty
 that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial  condition, including our revenue growth and profitability. These factors generallyhave
 the strongest effect on our sales of cloud license and on-premise license, hardware and  related services and, to  a lesser extent, also may affect our renewalrates for license support and our subscription-based cloud offerings.
If
 we are unable to compete effectively, the  results of operations and prospects for our business could be harmed.     We face intense competition in all aspectsof
 our business. The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that  is constantly evolving as firms emerge, expand or are acquired, as technologyevolves
 and  as  delivery  models  change.  Many  vendors  spend  amounts  in  excess  of  what  Oracle  spends  to  develop  and  market  applications,  platform  andinfrastructure 
technologie s including databases, middleware products, application development tools, business applications, collaboration products and businessintelligence
 products, among others, which compete with Oracle applications, platform and infrastructure offerings.  Use of our competitors’ technologies mayinfluence a customer’s purchasing decision or create an environment that makes it less efficient to utilize Orac
le products and services. Our competition may alsoadopt business practices 
that provide customers ac cess to competing products and services at a risk profile that we may not generally find acceptable, which mayconvince customers to purchase competitor products and services. We could lose
 
18

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
customers
 if our competitors introduce new competitive products, add new functionality, acquire competitive products, reduce prices, better execute on theirsales
 and marketing strategies, offer more  flexible business practices or form strategic alliances with other companies. We may also face increasing competitionfrom
 open source software initiatives in which competitors may provide software and intellectual property for free. Existing or  new competitors could gain salesopportunities or customers at our expense.
Our
 hardware  business  competes  with,  among  others,  (1)  systems manufacturers  and  resellers  of  systems  based  on  our  own  microprocessors  and  operatingsystems
 and  those  of  our  competitors,  (2)  microprocessor/chip  manufacturers,  (3)  providers  of  storage  products,  (4)  certain  industry-specific hardware manufacturers
 including those serving communications, hospitality and retail industries and (5) certain cloud providers that build their own IT infrastructures.Our hardware
 business causes us to compete with certain companies that historica lly have been partners. Some of these competitors may have more experiencethan
 we do in managing a hardware business. Certain of these competitors  also compete very aggressively  on price. A loss in our competitive position couldresult in 
lower revenues or profitability, which could adversel y impact our ability to realize the revenue and profitability forecasts for our hardware business.We
 may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully.     The intense competition we face in the sales of our  products and services and generaleconomic and business conditions can put pressure on us to change our prices. If
 our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or developproducts
 that the marketplace considers more valuable,  we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully. Any suchchanges
 may reduce margins and could adversely affect operating results. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud delivery models offered by  us and ourcompetitors
 may unfavorably  impact the pricing  of our other cloud and license,  hardware and services  offerings,  in particular  our IaaS offerings,  which couldreduce
 our revenues  and  profitability.  Our license  support  fees  and hardware  support fees are generally priced as a percentage of our net cloud license andon-premise 
license  fees and net new hardware products fees, respectively. Our competitors may offer lower pricing on their  support offerings, which could putpressure on us to further discount our offerings or support pricing.
We introduced Oracle Bring Your Own 
License (BYOL) to PaaS and Universal Credit Pricing in fiscal 2018  to simplify the way customers purchase and consume ourcloud services. Oracle BYOL enables customers to maintain their existing software licenses for Oracle PaaS while expanding 
their platform technology footprint at a
 discounted  price.  Oracle  Universal  Credit  Pricing  provides  a  flexible  model  for  customers  to  access  Oracle  PaaS  and  IaaS  services  on  demand  via  a  singlecontract.
 These  changes  and  any  future  changes  to  our prices  and  pricing  policies  could  cause  our  revenues  to  decline  or  be  delayed  as  our  sales  forceimplements
 and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies. Some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a long-termpricing
 strategy, commit to large customer deployments at prices that are unprofitable, or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations. Thesepractices
 could,  over  time,  significantly  constrain  the  prices  that  we  can  charge  for  certain of  our  products.  If  we  do  not  adapt  our  pricing  models  to  reflectchanges
 in customer use of our products or changes in customer demand, our revenues could decrease. The increase in open source software distribution mayalso cause us to change our 
pricing models. Our
 international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results.     We derive a substantial portion of ourrevenues
 from,  and  have  significant  operations,  outside  of  the  U.S.  Our  international  operations  include  cloud  operations,  cloud,  software  and  hardwaredevelopment, 
manufacturing, assembly, sales, customer support, consulting and other services and shared administrative service centers. Compliance
 with international  and  U.S.  laws  and  regulations  that  apply  to  our  international  operations  increases  our  cost  of  doing  business  in  foreignjurisdictions. These laws and regulations include U.S. laws and l
ocal laws which include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, foreign currency-related
 regulations,  anti-competition  regulations,  prohibitions  on  payments  to  governmental  officials,  market  access,  import,  export  and  general  traderegulations,
 including but not limited  to economic sanctions and embargos. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminalsanctions
 against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business, including the loss  of trade privileges. Any such violationscould result in
 prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, could delay or prevent potential acquisitions and could alsomaterially damage our
 
19

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
reputation,
 our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. Compliance withthese
 laws requires a significant amount  of management attention and effort, which may divert management’s attention from running our business operationsand
 could  harm  our  ability  to  grow  our  business,  or  may  increase  our  expenses  as  we  engage  specialized  or  other  additional resources  to assist us with ourcompliance efforts. Our success
 depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties. We monitor our operations and investigateallegations
 of improprieties relating to transactions and  the way in which such transactions are recorded. Where circumstances warrant, we provide informationand report our findings to government authorities, but no assurance can be given that action will
 not be taken by such authorities.We are also subject to a variety
 of other risks and challenges in managing an organization operating globally, including those related to: 
 
•  general economic conditions in each country or region; 
 
•  fluctuations in currency exchange rates and related impacts to customer demand and our operating results; 
 
• difficulties in transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries that could lead to a devaluation of  our net assets, in particular ourcash assets, in that country’s currency;
 
 
• regulatory changes, including government austerity measures in certain countries that we may not be able to sufficiently  plan for or avoid that mayunexpectedly
 impair bank deposits or other cash assets that we hold in these countries or that impose additional taxes that we may be required to payin these countries;
 
 
•  political unrest, terrorism and the potential for other hostilities; 
 
•  common local business behaviors that are in direct conflict with our business ethics, practices and conduct policies; 
 
•  natural disasters; 
 
•  the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires and increased storm sensitivity); 
 
•  longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; 
 
•  overlapping tax regimes; 
 
•  public health risks, social risks and supporting infrastructure stability risks, particularly in areas in which we have significant operations; and  
 
•  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.The
 variety of risks and challenges listed above could also disrupt or otherwise negatively impact the supply chain operations for our hardware business and the sales of our products and services in affected countries or regions.
As
 the majority shareholder of Oracle Financial Services Software  Limited, a publicly traded company in India, and Oracle Corporation Japan, a publicly tradedcompany
 in Japan, we are faced with several additional risks, including being subject to local securities regulations and being unable to exert full  control that wewould otherwise have if these entities were
 wholly-owned subsidiaries.Acquisitions
 present many risks and we may not realize  the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of a transaction.     We continueto
 invest  billions of  dollars to  acquire  companies,  products,  services  and  technologies.  We  have  a  selective and  active  acquisition  program  and  we expect  tocontinue
 to make acquisitions in the future because acquisitions are an important element of our overall corporate strategy. Risks we may face in connectionwith our acquisition program include:
 
 
•  our ongoing business may be disrupted and our management’s attention may be diverted by acquisition, transition or integration activities;  
20

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
• we may have difficulties (1) managing an acquired company’s technologies or lines of business; (2)  entering new markets where we have no or limiteddirect prior experience or where competitors may have str
onger market positions; or (3) retaining key personnel from the acquired companies; 
 
• an acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected, we may not integrate an acquired company or technology  as successfully as weexpected, we may impose our
 business practices or alter go-to-market strategies that adverse ly impact the acquired business or we may overpay for, or otherwise
 not realize the expected return on, our investments, which could adversely affect our business or operating results and potentially causeimpairment to assets that we recorded as a
 part of an acquisition including intangible assets and goodwill;  
 
• our  operating  results  or  financial  condition  may  be  adversely  impacted  by  (1)  claims  or  liabilities  that  we assume  from  an  acquired  company  ortechnology
 or that are otherwise related to an acquisition, including, among others, claims from government agencies, terminated employees, currentor
 former customers, former stockholders or other third parties; (2)  pre-existing contractual  relationships of an acquired company that we would nothave
 otherwise entered into, the termination or modification of which may be costly or disruptive to our business; (3)  unfavorable revenue recognitionor other accounting treatment as a result of an acquired company’s practices; and (4)
 intellectual property claims or disputes; 
 
• we may fail to identify or assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring  a company or technology,which
 could  result  in  unexpected  litigation  or  regulatory  exposure,  unfavorable  accounting  treatment,  unexpected  increases  in  taxes  due,  a  loss  ofanticipated tax benefits or other adverse effects on our business, 
operating results or financial condition;  
 
• we may not realize the anticipated increase in our revenues from an acquisition for a number of reasons, including if a larger  than predicted number ofcustomers
 decline  to  renew  cloud-based  subscription  contracts  or  software  or  hardware  support  contracts,  if  we  are  unable  to  sell  the  acquiredproducts
 or service offerings to our customer base, if acquired customers  do not elect to purchase our technologies due to differing business practicesor if contract models of an acquired company do not 
allow us to recognize revenues on a timely basis; 
 
• we  may  have  difficulty  incorporating  acquired  technologies,  products,  services  and  their  related  supply  chain operations  with  our  existing  lines  ofbusiness and supply chain infrastructure and maintaining uniform standards, architecture, controls, procedures and policies;
 
 
• we may have multiple product lines or services offerings as a result of our acquisitions that are offered, priced and supported  differently, which couldcause customer confusion and delays;
 
 
• we  may  have  higher  than  anticipated  costs  in  continuing  support  and  development  of  acquired  products  or  services,  in general  and  administrativefunctions that support new business models, or in compliance with associated regulations that
 are more complicated than we had anticipated; 
 
• we may be unable to obtain timely approvals from, or may otherwise have certain limitations, restrictions, penalties or  other sanctions imposed on usby
 worker councils or similar bodies under applicable employment laws as a result of an acquisition, which could adversely affect our integration plansin certain jurisdictions and potentially increase our 
integration and restructuring expenses;  
 
• we may be unable to obtain required approvals from governmental authorities under competition and antitrust laws on a timely  basis, if at all, whichcould,
 among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, adversely affect our integration plans in certain jurisdictions, restrict ourability to realize
 the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition, or have other adverse effects on our current business and operations;  
 
• our use of cash to pay for acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash, including stock repurchases, dividend  payments and retirement ofoutstanding indebtedness;
 
21

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
• we may significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to  pay for an acquisition and wemay
 have  to  delay  or  not  proceed  with  a  substantial  acquisition  if  we  cannot  obtain  the  necessary  funding  to  complete  the  acquisition  in  a  timelymanner or on favorable terms;
 
 
• to the extent that we issue a significant amount of equity securities in connection with future acquisitions, existing stockholders  may be diluted andearnings per share may decrease; and
 
 
• we  may  experience  additional  or  unexpected  changes  in  how  we  are  required  to  account  for  our  acquisitions  pursuant  to U.S.  generally  acceptedaccounting principles, including arrangements that we assume from an acquisition.
The
 occurrence of any of  these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, particularly inthe case of a larger acquisition or sever
al concurrent acquisitions.Any
 failure  to  offer  high-quality  technical  support  services  may  adversely  affect  our  relationships  with  our  customers  and  our  financial results.     O urcustomers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relat
ing to our applications, platform and infrastructure offerings. We may be unable torespond quickly
 enough to accommodate short-term increases in  customer demand for support services. Increased customer demand for these services, withoutcorresponding
 revenues,  could  increase  costs  and  adversely  affect  our  operating  results.  Any  failure  to  maintain  high-quality technical  support,  or  a  marketperception
 that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our applications to existing and prospectivecustomers, and our business, operating results, and 
financial position. We
 may fail to achieve our financial forecasts due to inaccurate sales forecasts or other factors.     Our revenues, particularly certain of our cloud license andon-premise 
license revenues and hardware revenues, are difficult to forecast. As a result, our quarterly operating results can fluctuate substantially. For our Oracle Cloud Ser
vices, we may use conversion or renewal rates in our forecasts that differ materially from our actual  conversion or renewal rates becausethis
 business is continuing to evolve and such rates may be unpredictable. For our license business, we use a “pipeline” system, a common industry practice, toforecast
 sales and  trends in that business. Our sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decisionand
 the dollar amount of the sale. These estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline.  Our pipeline estimates can prove to be unreliableboth in a particular quarter and over a longer peri
od of time, in part because the conversion rate or closure rate of the pipeline into contracts can be very difficultto estimate.
A
 reduction  in the conversion  rates, renewal rates, or in the pipeline itself, could cause us to plan or budget  incorrectly  and adversely  affect our business  orresults
 of operations. In particular, a slowdown in IT spending or economic conditions generally can unexpectedly reduce the conversion rates and renewal ratesin
 particular periods as purchasing decisions are delayed, reduced in amount or  cancelled. The conversion rates can also be affected by the tendency of some ofour
 customers to wait until the end of a fiscal period in the hope of obtaining more favorable terms, which can also impede our ability to negotiate, execute anddeliver upon these contracts
 in a timely manner. In addition, for newly acquired companies, we have limited ability to predict how their pipelines will convert intosales
 or  revenues  for  a  number  of  quarters  following  the  acquisition.  Conversion rates  and  renewal  rates  post-acquisition  may  be  quite  different  from  theacquired
 companies’ historical conversion rates. Differences in conversion rates and renewal rates can also be affected by changes in business practices that weimplement 
in our newly acquired companies. These changes may negatively affect customer behavior. A substantial portion of our
 cloud license and on-premise license, and hardware contracts is completed in  the latter part of a quarter and a significant percentageof
 these  are  larger  orders.  Because  a  significant  portion  of  our  cost  structure  is  largely  fixed in  the  short  term,  sales  and  revenue  shortfalls  tend  to  have  adisproportionately
 negative impact on our profitability. The number of large cloud license and on-premise license  transactions and, to a lesser extent, hardware products
 transactions increases the risk of fluctuations in our quarterly results because a delay in even a small number of these transactions could cause ourquarterly sales, revenues and profitability to f
all significantly short of our predictions.

We
 may  experience  foreign  currency  gains  and  losses.  Changes  in  currency  exchange  rates  can adversely  affect  customer  demand  and  our  revenue  andprofitability. 
    We conduct a significant number of transactions and hold cash in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Changes in the values of major foreigncurrencies,
 particularly the Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound, relative to the U.S. Dollar can significantly affect our total assets, revenues, operating resultsand cash
 flows, which are reported in U.S. Dollars. In particular, the economic uncertainties relating to  European sovereign and other debt obligations may causethe
 value of the Euro to fluctuate relative to the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in foreign currency rates, including the strengthening of the U.S.  Dollar against the Euroand
 most other major international currencies, adversely affects our revenue growth in terms of the amounts that we report in U.S. Dollars after converting ourforeign
 currency results into U.S. Dollars and in terms of  actual demand for our products and services as certain of these products may become relatively moreexpensive
 for foreign currency-based enterprises to purchase. In addition, currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products  in countriesoutside
 of  the  U.S.  Generally,  our  revenues  and  operating  results  are  adversely  affected  when  the  dollar  strengthens  relative  to  other  currencies  and  arepositively
 affected  when  the  dollar  weakens.  In  addition,  our  reported assets  generally  are  adversely  affected  when  the  dollar  strengthens  relative  to  othercurrencies as a portion of our consolidated cash and bank deposits, among other 
assets, are held in foreign currencies.In
 addition, we incur foreign currency transaction gains and losses, primarily related to sublicense fees and other intercompany agreements among us and our subsidiari
es that we expect to cash settle in the near term, which are charged against earnings in the period incurred. We have a program which primarily utilizesforeign
 currency forward contracts designed to offset the risks associated with  certain foreign currency exposures. We may suspend the program from time totime.
 As a part of this program, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset atleast 
in  part  by gains  or losses  on the foreign  currency  forward  contracts  in an effort  to mitigate  the risks  and  volatility associated  with our foreign  currencytransaction
 gains or losses. A large portion of our consolidated operations are international,  and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses withrespect
 to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts. For example, we will experience foreign currencygains 
and  losses in certain instances if it is not possible or cost-effective to hedge our foreign currency exposures, if our hedging efforts are ineffective, or shouldwe
 suspend our foreign currency forward contract program. Our ultimate realized loss or  gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on thesize
 and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whetherwe
 have entered into  foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors. All of these factors could materially impact our results ofoperations, financial position and cash flows.
We
 have incurred foreign currency losses associated with the devaluation of currencies in certain highly inflationary economies relative to the U.S.  Dollar. Wecould incur future losses in emerging market countries where we do business should their currencies become designated as highly inflationar
y.Our
 hardware revenues and profitability have declined and could continue to decline.     Our hardware business may adversely  affect our overall profitability.We
 may not achieve our estimated revenue, profit or other financial projections with respect to our hardware business in a timely manner or at all due to anumber of factors, including:
 
 
• our changes in hardware strategies, offerings and technologies including the development marketing and sale of our own Oracle  Cloud Services, whichcould adversely affect demand for our hardware products;
 
 
•  our hardware business has higher expenses as a percentage of revenues, and thus has been less profitable, than our cloud and license business;  
 
• our focus on our more profitable Oracle Engineered Systems, such as our Oracle Exadata Database Machine, and the de-emphasis of  our lower profitmargin
 commodity  hardware  products,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  hardware  revenues  because  the  lower  profit  products  have  historicallyconstituted a larger portion of our hardware 
revenues;  
23

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
• changes in strategies for the development and introduction of new versions or next generations of our hardware products,  including the pace at whichwe
 offer new versions or next generations of our hardware products, and the related impacts from customers that may defer or delay purchases ofexisting hardware products and wait for these new releases, 
all of which could adversely affect our hardware revenues;  
 
• a greater risk of material charges that could adversely affect our operating results, such as potential write-downs and  impairments of our inventories;higher
 warranty expenses than what we experience in our cloud and license and services businesses; and amortization and potential impairment ofintangible assets associated with our hardware business;
 
 
• the  close  connection  between  hardware  products  (which  have  a  finite  life)  and  customer  demand  for  related  hardware support  in which hardwareproducts that approach the end of their useful lives are less likel
y to have hardware support contracts renewed by customers; and 
 
• we may acquire hardware companies that are strategically important to us but (1) operate in hardware businesses with  historically lower operatingmargins
 than  our  own;  (2)  have  different  legacy  business  practices  and go-to-market strategies  than  our  own  that  we  may  alter  as  a part  of  ourintegration
 efforts, which may significantly impact our estimated revenues and profits from the acquired company; (3) leverage different platforms orcompeting
 technologies that we may encounter difficulties in integrating; or (4)  utilize unique manufacturing processes that affect our ability to scalethese acquired products within our own manufacturing operations.
Our
 hardware  offerings  are  complex  products,  and  if  we  cannot  successfully  manage  this  complexity,  the  results  of  our  hardware  business  will suffer.  
   Designing,  developing,  manufacturing  and  introducing  new  hardware  products  are  complicated  processes.  The  development  process  for  our  hardwareproducts is uncertain and requires a
 high level of innovation. After the  development phase, we must be able to forecast customer demand and manufacture newhardware
 products in sufficient volumes to meet this demand and do so in a cost-effective manner. Our “build-to-order” manufacturing  model, in which ourhardware
 products generally are not built until after customers place orders, may from time to time experience delays in delivering our hardware products  tocustomers in a timely manner. These delays could cause our customers to purchase hardware products and services from our competitors. We must also manage
new
 hardware product introductions and transitions to minimize the impact of customer  delayed purchases of existing hardware products in anticipation of newhardware
 product  releases.  It  is  also  possible  that  we  could  experience  design  or  manufacturing  flaws,  which  could  delay  or  prevent  the  production  of  thecomponents
 for which  we have previously committed to pay or need to fulfill orders from customers and could also prevent the production of our hardwareproducts
 or  cause  our  hardware  products  to  be  returned,  recalled  or  rejected  resulting  in  lost  revenues, increases  in  warranty  costs  or  costs  related  toremediation efforts, damage to our reputation, penalties and l
itigation.We
 depend on suppliers to design,  develop, manufacture and deliver on a timely basis the necessary technologies and components for our hardware products,and there are some techno
logies and components that can only be purchased from a single vendor due to price, quality, technology, availability or other businessconstraints. As a result, our supply chain operations could be disrupted or negatively impacted by 
industry consolidation and component constraints or shortages,natural
 disasters,  political unrest,  port stoppages  or other transportation disruptions or slowdowns, or other factors affecting the countries or regions wherethese
 single source component vendors are located or where the products are being shipped. We may be unable to purchase these items from  the respectivesingle
 vendors  on  acceptable  terms  or  may  experience  significant  shortages,  delays  or  quality  issues  in  the  delivery  of  necessary  technologies,  parts  orcomponents
 from a particular vendor. If we had to find a new supplier for these  technologies, parts and components, hardware product shipments could bedelayed,
 which  would  adversely  affect  our  hardware  revenues.  We  could  also  experience  fluctuations  in  component  prices,  which,  if  unanticipated,  couldnegatively affect 
our hardware business cost structure. Additionally, we could experience changes in shipping and logistics of our hardware products, which couldresult in fluctuati
ons in prices and negatively impact our hardware margins. These factors may make it difficult for us to plan and procure appropriate component inventory levels in a timely
 fashion to meet customer demand for our hardware products. Therefore, we may experience component inventory 
24

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
shortages,
 which  may  result  in  production  delays  or  customers  choosing  to  purchase  fewer  hardware  products  from  us  or  hardware  products  from  ourcompetitors.
 We negotiate supply commitments with vendors  early in the manufacturing process to ensure we have sufficient technologies and components forour
 hardware products to meet anticipated customer demand. We must also manage our levels of older component inventories used in our hardware products to
 minimize inventory write-offs or write-downs. If we have excess inventory, it may be necessary to write-down the inventory, which would adversely affect ouroperating
 results. If one or more of the risks described above occurs, our hardware  business  and related  operating  results  could  be materially  and  adverselyaffected.
We
 are  susceptible  to  third-party  manufacturing and  logistics  delays,  which  could  result  in  the  loss  of  sales  and  customers.     We  outsource  the  design,manufacturing,
 assembly and delivery of certain of our hardware products to a variety of companies, many of which are  located outside the U.S. Our reliance onthese
 third  parties  reduces  our  control  over  the  manufacturing  and  delivery  process,  exposing  us  to  risks,  including  reduced  control  over  quality  assurance,product
 costs, product supply and delivery delays  as well as the political and economic uncertainties and natural disasters of the international locations wherecertain
 of  these  third-party  manufacturers  have  facilities  and  operations.  Some  countries  may  raise  national  security  concerns  or impose  market  accessrestrictions
 based on location of manufacturing or sourcing. Any manufacturing disruption or logistics delays by these third parties could impair our ability tofulfill
 orders for these hardware products for extended periods of time.  If we are unable to manage our relationships with these third parties effectively, or ifthese third parties experien
ce delays, disruptions, capacity constraints, regulatory issues or quality control problems in their operations, or fail to meet our future requirements for
 timely delivery, our ability to ship and deliver certain of our hardware products to our customers could be impaired and our hardware businesscould be harmed.
We
 endeavor to continue simplifying our supply chain processes by reducing  the number of third-party manufacturing partners and the number of locationswhere
 these third-party manufacturers build our hardware products. We therefore have become more dependent on a fewer number of these manufacturingpartners
 and  locations.  If  these  partners  experience  production  problems  or  delays  or  cannot  meet  our demand  for  products,  we  may  not  be  able  to  findalternate
 manufacturing sources in a timely or cost-effective manner, if at all. If we are required to change third-party manufacturers, our ability to meet ourscheduled
 hardware products deliveries to  our customers could be adversely affected, which could cause the loss of sales and existing or potential customers,delayed revenue recognition or an increase in our hardware products expenses, all 
of which could adversely affect the margins of our hardware business. These
 challenges  and  risks  also  exist  when  we  acquire  companies  with  hardware  products  and  related  supply  chain  operations. In  some  cases,  we  may  bedependent,
 at least initially, on these acquired companies’ supply chain operations that we are less familiar with and thus we may be slower to adjust or react tothese challenges and risks.
Our
 cloud and license, and hardware indirect sales channel could affect our future operating results.     Our cloud and  license, and hardware indirect channelnetwork
 is comprised primarily of resellers, system integrators/implementers, consultants, education providers, internet service providers, network integratorsand
 independent software vendors. Our relationships  with these channel participants are important elements of our cloud, software and hardware marketingand
 sales efforts. Our financial results could be adversely affected if our contracts with channel participants were terminated, if our  relationships with channelparticipants
 were  to  deteriorate,  if  any  of  our  competitors  enter  into  strategic  relationships  with  or  acquire  a  significant  channel  participant,  if  the  financialcondition
 or  operations  of  our  channel  participants were  to  weaken  or  if  the  level  of  demand  for  our  channel  participants’  products  and  services  were  todecrease. There
 can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining, expanding or developing our relationships with channel participants.  If we are notsuccessful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and revenues.
We
 may not be able to protect our intellectual  property rights.     We rely on copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures,controls
 and  contractual  commitments  to  protect  our  intellectual  property  rights.  Despite  our efforts,  these  protections  may  be  limited.  Unauthorized  thirdparties may try to copy or
 reverse engineer portions of our products or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property. Any 
25

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
patents
 owned  by  us  may  be  invalidated,  circumvented  or  challenged.  Any  of  our  pending  or  future  patent  applications,  whether  or  not  being  currentlychallenged,
 may not be issued with the scope of  the claims we seek, if at all. In addition, the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protectionof
 our intellectual property rights as do the laws and courts of the U.S. If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized  copying or use,or other misappropriation, we may not
 remain competitive.Third
 parties have claimed, and in the future may  claim, infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights and/or breach of license agreement provisions. 
   We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by, others claiming infringement or  other misuse of their intellectual property rightsand/or
 breach of our agreements with them. These third parties include entities that do not have the capabilities to design, manufacture, or distribute productsor
 services or that acquire intellectual  property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims ofinfringement and misuse. We expect to continue to receive such claims as:
 
 
•  we continue to acquire companies and expand into new businesses; 
 
•  the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows; 
 
•  the use and support of third-party code (including open source code) becomes more prevalent in the industry; 
 
•  the volume of issued patents continues to increase; and 
 
•  non-practicing entities continue to assert intellectual property infringement in our industry segments. Responding to any such claim, regardless of its validity, could:
 
 
•  be time consuming, costly and result in litigation; 
 
•  divert management’s time and attention from developing our business; 
 
•  require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable;  
 
•  require us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our products; 
 
•  require us to release source code to third parties, possibly under open source license terms; 
 
•  require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers; or 
 
•  otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.Our
 periodic workforce restructurings and reorganizations can be disruptive.     We have in the past  restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce,including
 our  hardware  employees  and  direct  sales  force,  in  response  to  management  changes,  product  changes,  performance  issues,  change  in  strategies,acquisitions
 and other internal and external  considerations. In the past, these types of restructurings have resulted in increased restructuring costs, increasedsales
 and marketing costs and temporary reduced productivity while the employees adjusted to their new roles and responsibilities.  In addition, we may notachieve
 or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of these restructurings, or may not do so within the expected timeframe. These effects couldrecur in connection with future acquisitions and 
other restructurings and our revenues and other results of operations could be negatively affected. We
 may lose key employees or may be unable  to hire enough qualified employees.     We rely on hiring qualified employees and the continued service of oursenior
 management, including our Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Technology Officer and founder,  our Chief Executive Officers, other members of ourexecutive
 team  and  other  key  employees.  In  the  technology  industry,  there  is  substantial  and  continuous  competition  for  highly  skilled  business,  productdevelopment, technical and other 
personnel. We may also  experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or highersales.
 We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel. With rare exceptions,  we do not have long-termemployment
 or non-competition agreements  with  our employees.  Members  of our senior  management  team  have  left  Oracle  over  the  years  for a variety  ofreasons, and we cannot 
guarantee that there will not be additional departures, which may  be disruptive to our operations. 
26

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
We
 continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in countries where advanced technical  expertise and other expertise are available atlower
 costs.  When  we  make  adjustments  to  our  workforce,  we  may  incur  expenses  associated  with  workforce  reductions  that  delay  the  benefit  of  a  moreefficient workforce structure. We may also 
experience increased competition for employees in these countries as the trend tow ard globalization continues, whichmay
 affect  our  employee  retention  efforts  and  increase  our  expenses  in  an  effort  to  offer  a  competitive  compensation  program.  In addition,  changes  toimmigration and labor law po
licies may adversely impact our access to technical and professional talent.Our
 general compensation  program includes restricted stock units, performance equity and stock options, which are important tools in attracting and retainingemployees
 in  our  industry.  If  our  stock  price  performs  poorly,  it  may  adversely  affect  our  ability  to retain  or attract  employees.  We  continually  evaluate  ourcompensation
 practices and consider changes from time to time, such as reducing the number of employees granted equity awards or the number of equityawards granted per employee and granting 
alternat ive forms of stock-based compensation, which may have an impact on our ability to retain employees and theamount
 of stock-based compensation expense that we record. Any changes in our compensation practices or those of our competitors could affect  our ability toretain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel.
Our
 sales  to  government  clients  expose  us  to business  volatility  and  risks,  including  government  budgeting  cycles  and  appropriations,  procurementregulations,
 governmental policy shifts, early termination of contracts, audits, investigations, sanctions and penalties.     We derive revenues from contractswith
 the U.S. government, state and local governments, and foreign governments and are subject to procurement laws and regulations relating to the award,administration and 
performance of those contracts. Governmental
 entities  are  variously  pursuing  policies  that  affect  our  ability  to  sell  our  products  and  services. Changes  in  government  procurement  policy,priorities, technology initiatives, and/or contract award criter
ia may negatively impact our potential for growth in the government sector.We
 are also subject to early termination of our contracts. Many governmental entities have the right to terminate contracts at any time, without cause. For example,
 the  U.S.  federal  government  may  terminate  any  of  our  government  contracts  and  subcontracts  at  its  convenience,  or  for  default  based  on  ourperformance.
U.S.
 federal contracts are subject to the congressional approval of appropriations to fund the expenditures under these contracts. Similarly, our contracts with U.S.
 state  and  local  governments,  foreign  governments  and  their  agencies  are  generally  subject  to  government  funding  authorizations.  Contracts  may  beterminated based upon a lack of appropriated funds.
There
 is  increased  pressure  on  governments  and  their  agencies,  both  domestically  and  internationally,  to  reduce  spending  as  governments  continue  to face significant deficit reduction pressures. This may adversely impact spending on government programs.
Government
 contracts laws and regulations impose  certain risks, and contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations. If violations of law are found,they
 could result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion of  fees received, forfeiture ofprofits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business.
We may
 not receive significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years, if at all.     Developing our cloud and license, andhardware
 offerings  is  expensive  and  the  investment  in  the  development  of  these  offerings  often  involves  a  long  return  on  investment  cycle.  An  importantelement
 of our corporate  strategy is to continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development and related product and serviceopportunities
 both through internal investments and the acquisition of intellectual property from companies that  we have acquired. Accelerated product andservice introductions and short life cycles require high levels of expenditures for rese
arch and development that could adversely affect our operating results if notoffset
 by  revenue  increases.  We believe  that  we  must  continue  to  dedicate  a  significant  amount  of  resources  to  our  research  and  development  efforts  tomaintain our competitive position. Ho
wever, we do not expect to receive significant revenues from these investments for several years, if at all.

Business disrupt
ions could adversely affect our operating results.     A significant portion of our  critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographicareas,
 some of which include emerging market international locations that may be less stable relative to running such business operations solely within the U.S. We
 are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems and processes could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, includingsome of
 our cloud offerings, and enabling a seamless customer experience with respect to  our customer facing back office processes. A major earthquake or fire,political,
 social or other disruption to infrastructure that supports or operations or other catastrophic event or the effects of climate change (such as increasedstorm severity, drought and
 pandemics) that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems could severely affect our ability toconduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results 
could be materially and adversely affected. Adverse
 litigation results could affect our business.     We are subject  to various legal proceedings. Litigation can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to ouroperations, and can divert our management’s attention away from
 running our core business. The results of our litigation also cannot be predicted with certainty. An
 adverse  decision  could  result  in  monetary  damages  or  injunctive  relief  that  could  affect  our  business,  operating  results  or  financial  condition.  Additionalinformation
 regarding certain of the lawsuits we are involved in is discussed  under Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere inthis Annual Report.
We may
 have exposure to additional tax liabilities.     As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the
 U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant  uncertainties exist with respect to the amount of our tax liabilities, including those arising from potentialchanges
 in laws in the countries in which we do business and the possibility of adverse determinations with respect to the application  of existing laws. Manyjudgments
 are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by tax authorities,which
 often do not agree with positions taken by us on our  tax returns. Any unfavorable resolution of these uncertainties may have a significant adverse impacton our tax rate.
Increasingly,
 countries around  the  world  are  actively  considering  or  have  enacted  changes  in  relevant  tax,  accounting  and  other  laws,  regulations  andinterpretat
ions. In particular, the recently enacted U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act) significantly changed how corporations are taxed in the United States, which
 has had and we expect will continue to have a meaningful impact on our provision for income taxes. Due to the complexity involved in applying theprovisions
 of the Tax Act, we made reasonable estimates of  the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements for the year ended May 31,2018.
 The U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and other standards-setting bodies may issue guidance on how  the provisions of theTax
 Act will be applied that is different from our interpretation. The Tax Act requires complex computations not previously required or produced, and significantjudgments
 and assumptions in the interpretation of the law were  made in producing our provisional estimates. As we complete our analyses, and interpret anyadditional
 guidance, we may adjust the provisional amounts we have recorded, and those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the
 period in which the adjustments are made. We also anticipate that uncertainty in the application of the Tax Act to our ongoing operations as well as possibleadverse
 future law changes attributable to changes in the U.S. political environment could  have an adverse impact on our future tax rate. Other countries alsocontinue
 to  consider  enacting  new  laws,  including  changes  in  withholding  tax  regimes  and  the  imposition  of  taxes  targeted  at  certain  technology  businesses(some of which may 
be made in response to the Tax Act), that could adversely affect us. As a part of our income tax
 structure, there are many intercompany transacti ons and calculations made in the ordinary course of business where the ultimate taxdetermination
 is uncertain. Our intercompany transfer pricing has been and is currently being reviewed by the IRS and by foreign tax jurisdictions and will likely be
 subject to additional audits in the future. Although we have negotiated a number of agreements with certain taxing jurisdictions, these agreements do notcover
 substantial elements of our transfer pricing. In recent periods, transfer pricing  audits in many foreign jurisdictions have become increasingly contentious.Similarly,
 certain jurisdictions are increasingly raising concerns about certain withholding tax matters under current law. In addition, our provision for incometaxes
 could be adversely affected by shifts of earnings from jurisdictions or regimes that have relatively lower statutory tax rates to those in which the rates arerelatively higher.
 
28

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
We
 are also subject to non-income based  taxes, such as payroll, sales,  use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the UnitedStates
 and various foreign jurisdictions that have uncertain applicability to the businesses in which we are engaged. Although we believe that our income and non-income 
based  tax estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what isreflected in our historical income tax 
provisions and accruals. Charges
 to earnings resulting from acquisitions may adversely affect our operating results.     Under business combination accounting standards pursuant toAccounting
 Standards  Codification  (ASC)  805, Business 
Combinations
,  we  recognize  the  identifiable  assets  acquired,  the  liabilities  assumed  and any non-controlling 
interests  in  acquired  companies  generally  at  their  acquisition  date  fair  values  and,  in  each  case,  separately  from  goodwill.  Goodwill  as  of  theacquisition date is measured as the excess 
amount of consideration transferred,  which is also generally measured at fair value, and the net of the acquisition dateamounts
 of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed  to be reasonable butwhich are
 inherently uncertain. After we complete an acquisition, the following factors could result in material charges and adversely affect our operating resultsand may adversely affect our cash flows:
 
 
• costs incurred to combine the operations of companies we acquire, such as transitional employee expenses and employee retention,  redeployment orrelocation expenses;
 
 
•  impairment of goodwill or impairment of intangible assets; 
 
•  amortization of intangible assets acquired; 
 
•  a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired; 
 
• identification  of,  or  changes  to,  assumed  contingent  liabilities,  both  income  tax  and non-income tax  related,  after  our  final  determination  of  theamounts
 for these contingencies or the conclusion of the measurement period (generally up to one year from the acquisition date), whichever comesfirst;
 
 
• charges to our operating results to maintain certain duplicative pre-merger activiti es for an extended period of time or to maintain these activities for aperiod
 of time that is longer than  we had  anticipated,  charges  to eliminate certain duplicative pre-merger activities,  and charges  to restructure ouroperations or to reduce our cost structure;
 
 
•  charges to our operating results due to expenses incurred to effect the acquisition; and 
 
•  charges to our operating results due to the expensing of certain stock awards assumed in an acquisition.Substantia
lly all of these costs will be accounted for as expenses that will adversely impact our operating results for the periods in which those costs are incurred. Charges
 to our operating results in any given period could differ substantially from other periods based on the timing and size of our future acquisitions and theextent
 of integration activities. A more detailed  discussion of our accounting for business combinations and other items is presented in the “Critical AccountingPolicies
 and Estimates” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  (Item 7) included elsewhere in thisAnnual Report.
There
 are  risks  associated  with  our  outstanding  and  future indebtedness.     As  of  May  31,  2018,  we  had  an  aggregate  of  $60.9  billion  of  outstandingindebtedness
 that will mature between calendar year 2018 and calendar year 2055 and we may incur additional indebtedness in  the future. Our ability to payinterest
 and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations, generate sufficient cash flows to servicesuch debt and the other factors discussed in this 
section. There can be no assurance that we will be able  to manage any of these risks successfully.We
 may also need to refinance a portion of our outstanding  debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that theterms
 of  any  refinancing  may  not  be  as  favorable  as  the  terms  of  our  existing  debt.  Furthermore,  if  prevailing  interest  rates  or  other factors  at  the  time  ofrefinancing
 result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. Should we incurfuture
 increases in interest expense, our ability to utilize certain  of our foreign tax credits to reduce our U.S. federal income tax could be limited, which couldunfavorably affect our provision for income t
axes and effective tax rate. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating  
29

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
could
 negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase the interest amounts we pay on certain outstanding or future debt. Theserisks could adversely affect our 
financial condition and results of operations. Environmental
 and other related laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could  result in significant liabilities and costs.     Some  of our cloudand
 hardware operations are subject to state, federal and international laws governing protection of the environment, proper handling and disposal of materials used for these products, human health and safety, the use of certain chemical substances and the labor practices of suppliers, as well
 as local testing and labellingrequirements.
 Compliance  with  these  environmental  and  other  laws  could increase  our product  design,  development, procurement, manufacturing,  delivery,cloud
 operations  and administration  costs,  limit our ability to manage excess and  obsolete non-compliant inventory,  change our sales  activities, or otherwiseimpact
 future financial results of our cloud and hardware businesses. Any violation of these laws can subject us to significant liability, including fines, penaltiesand
 possible  prohibition  of  sales  of  our  products and  services  into  one  or  more  states  or  countries  and  result  in  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  financialcondition
 or  results  of  operations  of  our  cloud  and  hardware  businesses.  Regulatory,  market,  and  competitive  pressures  regarding  the  energy intensity  andenergy mix for our data center operations ma
y also grow.The
 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted disclosure requirements  for companies that use certain “conflict minerals” (tantalum, tin, tungstenand
 gold) in their products. Our supply chain is multi-tiered, global and highly complex. As a provider of hardware end products, we are several steps removed from
 the mining and smelting or refining of any conflict minerals in our supply chain. Accordingly, our ability to determine with certainty the origin and chain ofcustody of conflict minerals is limited. 
Our relationships with customers and suppliers could suffer if we are unable to describe our products as “conflict-free.” We may also face increased costs in comply
ing with conflict minerals disclosure requirements.A
 significant portion of our hardware revenues come from international sales. Environmental legislation, such as the EU Directive on Restriction of Hazardous Substances
 (RoHS), the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) and China’s regulation on Management Methods for ControllingPollution
 Caused by Electronic Information Products, may increase our cost of doing  business internationally and impact our hardware revenues from the EU,China
 and other countries with similar environmental legislation as we endeavor to comply with and implement these requirements. The cumulative impact ofinternational 
environmental legislation could be significant. Our
 stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value.     All of the factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price. Thetiming
 of  announcements  in  the  public  market  regarding  new  products,  product  enhancements  or  technological  advances  by  our competitors  or  us  and  anyannouncements
 by us of acquisitions, major transactions, or management changes could also affect our stock price. Changes in the amounts and frequency ofshare
 repurchases or dividends could adversely affect our stock price.  Our stock price could also be affected by factors, some of which are beyond our control,including, among others: speculation in the press and the analyst community, changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by
 financial analysts, changes in investors’
 or analysts’ valuation measures for our stock, earnings announcements where our financial results differ from our guidance or investors’ expectations,our
 credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance.  A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class actionlawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources, which could adversely
 affect our business. We
 cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully implemented or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value.      In  fiscal 2018, ourBoard of Directors approved expansions of our st
ock repurchase program totaling $24.0 billion. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date and weare
 not obligated to repurchase  a specified number or dollar value of shares. Our repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time and, even iffully implemented, may not enhance long-term stockholder value.

Our
 Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On December 14, 2017 and February 2, 2018, we announced that
 our  Board  of  Directors  approved  expansions  of  our  stock  repurchase  program  totaling  $24.0  billion.  As  of  May  31,  2018,  approximately  $17.8  billionremained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock 
repurchase program. Our
 stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors  such as our working capitalneeds, our
 cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economicand
 market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected  from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan.  Our stockrepurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.

Financial DataThe
 following table sets forth selected financial data as of and for our last five fiscal years. This selected financial data should be read in conjunction  with theconsolidated
 financial  statements  and  related  notes  included  in  Item  15  of this  Annual  Report.  Over  our  last  five  fiscal  years,  we have  acquired  a number  ofcompanies,
 including NetSuite Inc. (NetSuite) in fiscal 2017 and MICROS Systems,  Inc. in fiscal 2015, among others. The results of our acquired companies havebeen
 included in our consolidated financial statements since their respective dates of acquisition and have contributed to our revenues, income, earnings pershare and total assets.

(1)
Our net income  and diluted earnings per share were unfavorably impacted by  a net charge of $7.0 billion during fiscal 2018 due to our preliminary assessment of the one-time effects of the
 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act). The more significant provisions  of the Tax Act as applicable to us are described below under “Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and JobsAct of 2017”.
 
(2)
Total  working  capital  and  total  assets  sequentially  increased  in nearly  all  periods  presented  primarily  due  to  the  favorable  impacts  to  our  net  current  assets  resulting  from  our  netincome
 generated during all periods presented and the issuances of long-term senior notes of $10.0 billion in fiscal 2018, $14.0  billion in fiscal 2017, $20.0 billion in fiscal 2015, and€2.0
 billion and $3.0 billion in fiscal 2014. Our total assets were also favorably impacted by the issuance of $2.5 billion of short-term borrowings in fiscal  2018, and $3.8 billion of short-term
 borrowings in each of fiscal 2017 and 2016. These increases were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock and dividend payments made inall
 periods presented, repayments  of certain of our senior notes in fiscal 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015, and the repayment of $3.8 billion of short-term borrowings in each of fiscal 2018and 2017.
 
(3) 
 Our notes payable and other borrowings, which represented the summation of our notes payable and other borrowings, current, and  notes payable and other borrowings, non-current, as
 reported per our consolidated balance sheets as of the dates listed in the table above, increased between fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2018 primarily due to  the fiscal 2018 issuance of long-term
 senior notes of $10.0 billion and short-term borrowings of $2.5 billion, the fiscal 2017 issuance of long-term senior notes of $14.0 billion and short-term borrowings of $3.8 billion,the
 fiscal 2016 issuance of $3.8 billion of short-term borrowings, the issuances of long-term senior notes of $20.0 billion in fiscal 2015, and €2.0 billion and $3.0 billion in fiscal 2014. SeeNote 7 of Notes to

Item 7.    Managem
ent’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We
 begin Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with an  overview of our businesses and significant trends. Thisoverview
 is  followed  by  a  summary  of  our  critical  accounting  policies  and  estimates  that  we  believe  are  important  to  understanding  the  assumptions  andjudgments incorporated in our reported 
financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition.Business Overview
Oracle
 Corporation provides products and services that address all aspects of corporate information technology (IT) environments—applications, platform  andinfrastructure.
 Our applications, platform and infrastructure offerings are delivered to customers worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable ITdeployment
 models, including cloud-based, on-premise, or  hybrid,  which  enable  customer  choice  and  flexibility.  We  market  and  sell  our  offerings  globally  tobusinesses
 of  many  sizes,  government  agencies,  educational  institutions  and  resellers  with  a worldwide  sales  force  that  is  employed  by  our  domestic  andinternational subsidiaries and is positioned to
 offer the combinations that best meet customer needs.We
 have three businesses: cloud and license; hardware; and services; each of which comprises a single operating segment. The descriptions set forth below as a part
 of  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  and  the  information  contained  within  Note  15  of  Notes  toConsolidated
 Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provide additional  information related to our businesses and operating segmentsand
 align as to how our chief operating decision makers (CODMs), which include our Chief Executive Officers and Chief Technology Officer, view our operatingresults and allocate 
resources. Cloud and License Business
Our
 cloud and license line of business, which represented 82%, 80% and 78% of our total revenues in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum of applications, platform and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and license offer
ings.Cloud 
services and license support revenues include:  
 
• license support revenues, which is our largest revenues stream. Oracle license support grants rights to unspecified product  upgrades and maintenancereleases
 and patches released during the term of the support period, as well as technical support assistance. Substantially all of our customers opt topurchase
 license  support  contracts  when  they  purchase  Oracle applications,  platform  and/or  infrastructure  licenses  and  substantially  all  customersrenew their license support contracts annually in order to continue to benefit from
 Oracle’s research and development investments that are utilized as apart 
of  unspecified periodic license updates that may be released and that customers with current license support contracts are entitled to. Our licensesupport
 contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to access the  license, are generally billed in advance of thesupport
 services being performed and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the support services are delivered over the contractual terms;and
 
 
• cloud  services  revenues,  which  includes  revenues  from  Oracle  Cloud Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)  andInfrastructure-as-a-Service 
(IaaS)  offerings  (collectively,  Oracle  Cloud  Services),  which  deliver  applications,  platform  and infrastructure  technologies,respectively,
 via cloud-based deployment models that we develop functionality for, host, manage and support and that customers access by enteringinto a subscription agreement with us for a stated period. Our IaaS 
offerings also include Oracle Managed Cloud Serv ices, which are designed to providecomprehensive
 software and hardware management, maintenance and security services for customer cloud-based, hybrid IT or other IT infrastructurefor
 a fee for a stated  term. The majority of our Oracle Cloud Services arrangements have durations of 12 to 36 months and are generally recognized asrevenues
 ratably over the contractual period of the contract or, in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services  are consumed. We strive torenew these cloud services contracts when they are eligible for renewa
l.

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
Cloud
 license and on-premise license  revenues  include  revenues from  the  licensing  of  our  software  products  including  Oracle  Applications,  Oracle  Database,Oracle
 Fusion  Middleware  and  Java,  among  others  which  our  customers  use  for  cloud-based, on-premise and  other  IT environments.  Our  cloud  license  andon-premise 
license transactions are generally perpetual  in nature and are generally recognized when unrestricted access to the license is granted to the customerprovided 
all  other revenue  recognition  criteria are met. The  timing of a few large license  transactions  can substantially  affect our quarterly  license  revenues,which
 is different than the typical revenue recognition pattern for our cloud services and license  support revenues in which revenues are generally recognizedratably over the contractual periods. Cloud license and 
on-premise license customers have the option to purchase license support contracts, as described above. Providing
 choice  and  flexibility to  our  customers  as  to  when  and  how  they  deploy  our  applications,  platform  and  infrastructure technologies  is an importantelement
 of our corporate strategy. In recent periods, customer demand has increased for our Oracle Cloud Services. To address customer demand and enablecustomer
 choice, we have introduced certain programs for customers to  pivot their applications, platform and infrastructure licenses and license support to theOracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate
 to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for their existing workloads. We expect these trends to continue.Our cloud services revenues growth and our cloud license and 
on-premise license revenues growth are affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions,
 governmental budgetary constraints, the strategy for and competitive position of our offerings, our acquisitions, our ability to deliver and renew ourcloud services
 contracts with our existing  customers and foreign currency rate fluctuations. Our license support revenues growth is primarily influenced by threefactors:
 (1)  the  continuity  of  substantially  all  of  our  license  support  customer  contract  base  renewing  their license  support  contracts  and  substantially  allcustomers continuing to
 purchase license support contracts in connection with their purchase of a new license; (2) the pricing of license support contracts sold inconnection
 with the sale of new licenses;  and (3) the pricing of new licenses sold. Customers do so in order to benefit from Oracle’s research and developmentinvestments that are utilized as a part
 of unspecified periodic license updates that may be released and that customers with current license support contracts are entitled to.
On a constant currency basis, we expect that our total cloud and l
icense revenues generally will continue to increase due to:  
 
• expected growth in our cloud services and license support offerings, including the high percentage of customers that purchase  and renew their licensesupport contracts;
 
 
•  continued demand for our cloud license and on-premise license offerings; and  
 
•  contributions from our acquisitions.We
 believe all of these factors should contribute to future growth in our cloud and license revenues, which should enable us to continue to make investments in research and development to develop and improve our cloud and license products and services.
Our
 cloud and license business’ margin  has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historicalupward
 trend  of our  cloud  license  and on-premise license  revenues over those quarterly  periods  and  because  the  majority  of our  costs  for this  business  aregenerally fixed in the short term.
Hardware Business
Our
 hardware business, which represented 10%, 11% and 13% of our total revenues in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, provides a broad selection of hardware
 products  and  hardware-related  software  products  including  Oracle  Engineered  Systems,  servers,  storage,  industry-specific  hardware,  operatingsystems,
 virtualization,  management  and other hardware  related software,  and related hardware support.  Hardware transactions  are generally recognized  asrevenues upon delivery to the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Our hardware business also offer
s related hardware support. Weexpect
 to  make  investments  in research  and  development  to  improve  existing  hardware  products  and  services  and  to  develop  new  hardware  products  andservices. The majority of our hardware products are so
ld through indirect channels, 
36

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
including
 independent distributors and value-added resellers. Our hardware support offerings provide customers with unspecified software updates for softwarecomponents
 that are essential to the functionality  of our hardware  products  and  associated  software products  such  as Oracle  Solaris. Our hardware  supportofferings can
 also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are entered into  at the option of thecustomer,
 are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware supportservices are delivered over the contractual terms.
We
 generally  expect  our  hardware  business  to  have  lower  operating  margins  as  a  percentage  of  revenues  than  our  cloud  and  license  business  due  to  theincremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs.
Our
 quarterly hardware revenues are difficult to predict. Our hardware revenues, cost of hardware and hardware operating margins that we report are affected by,
 among others: our ability to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions; our strategy for and the position of our hardware productsrelative
 to competitor offerings; customer demand for competing offerings such as PaaS  and IaaS; the strength of general economic and business conditions;governmental budgetary constraints; whet
her customers decide to purchase hardware support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware productsale;
 the percentage  of our hardware support contract customer base that renews its support contracts and the close association between hardware products,which
 have a finite life, and customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products age; customer  decisions to either maintain or upgrade theirexisting hardware infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are
 available; certain of our acquisitions; and foreign currency rate fluctuations.Services Business
Our
 services  business helps  customers  and  partners  maximize  the  performance  of  their  investments  in  Oracle  applications,  platform  and  infrastructuretechnologies.
 We  believe  that  our  services  are  differentiated  based  on  our  focus  on  Oracle  technologies,  extensive experience  and  broad  sets  of  intellectualproperty and best
 practices. Our services offerings include consulting services, advanced support services and education services and represented 8% of our totalrevenues
 in fiscal 2018 and 9% of our total revenues  in each of fiscal 2017 and 2016. Our services business has lower margins than our cloud and license andhardware businesses. Our services
 revenues are impacted by, among others: our strategy for, and the competitive position of, our services; customer demand for our
 cloud and license and hardware offerings and the associated services for these offerings; our strategic emphasis on growing our cloud revenues; certain ofour
 acquisitions; general economic conditions; governmental budgetary  constraints; personnel reductions in our customers’ IT departments; and tighter controlsover discretionary spending.
Acquisitions
Our
 selective  and  active  acquisition  program  is  another  important  element  of  our  corporate  strategy.  In  recent  years,  we  have  invested billions  of dollars toacquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies, including NetSuite in fiscal 2017.
We 
expect  to  continue  to  acquire  companies,  products,  services  and  technologies  in  furtherance  of  our  corporate  strategy.  Note  2  of  Notes  to  ConsolidatedFinancial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provides additional inform
ation related to our recent acquisitions. We
 believe  that  we  can  fund  our  future  acquisitions  with  our  internally  available  cash,  cash  equivalents  and marketable  securities,  cash  generated  fromoperations,
 additional  borrowings  or  from  the  issuance  of  additional  securities.  We  estimate  the  financial  impact  of  any  potential  acquisition  with  regard  toearnings, operating margin, cash flow and return 
on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our
 consolidated  financial  statements  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (GAAP)  as  set  forth  in  the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Accounting Standards
 
37

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
Codification
 (ASC), and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC).
 GAAP,  as  set  forth  within  the ASC,  requires  us  to  make  certain  estimates,  judgments  and  assumptions.  We  believe  that  the  estimates,  judgments  andassumptions
 upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These
 estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as thereported
 amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the  periods presented.  To  the  extent  that  there  are  differences  between  these  estimates,  judgments  orassumptions
 and  actual  results,  our  financial  statements  will  be  affected.  The  accounting  policies  that  reflect  our  more  significant  estimates,  judgments  andassumptions and which we believe are the most critical
 to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include: 
 
•  Revenue Recognition; 
 
•  Business Combinations; 
 
•  Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments; 
 
•  Accounting for Income Taxes; and 
 
•  Legal and Other Contingencies.In
 many  cases,  the  accounting  treatment  of  a  particular  transaction  is  specifically  dictated  by  GAAP  and  does  not  require  management’s  judgment  in its application.
 There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. Oursenior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and rel
ated disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of D irectors.Revenue Recognition
Our sources of revenues include:
 
 
• cloud and license revenues, which include the sale of: cloud services and license support; and cloud license and on-premise licenses,  which representlicenses purchased by customers for use in both cloud and 
on-premise deployments;  
 
• hardware revenues, which include the sale of hardware products including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware; and hardware support revenues; and
 
 
• services revenues, which are earned from providing cloud-, license- and hardware-related services including consulting, advanced customer support and education services.
Revenue Recognition for Cloud Services Offerings, Hardware 
Products, Hardware Support and Related Services (Non-software Elements) Our
 revenue recognition policy for non-software deliverab les including our cloud services offerings, hardware products, hardware support and related services isbased
 upon  the  accounting  guidance  contained  in  ASC 605-25, Revenue
Recognition,
Multiple-Element
Arrangements
,  and  we  exercise  judgment  and  useestimates
 in connection with the determination of the amount of cloud services revenues, hardware products revenues,  hardware support and related servicesrevenues to be recognized in each accounting period.
Revenues
 from the sales of our non-software elements  are recognized when: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) we deliver the products orservices;
 (3) the sale price is fixed or determinable; and (4)  collection is reasonably assured. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because theforegoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are
 subsequently met.Revenues
 for our cloud services offerings sold on a subscription basis are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date the service
 is  made  available  to  customers.  Revenues  for  cloud  services  offerings  sold  on  a  usage  basis  are  generally  recognized  as  the  customer  consumes  theservice, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied.

(Non-software Arrangements)
We enter into arrangements with customers that purchase 
non-software related products and services from us at the same time, or within close proxim ity of oneanother
 (referred to as non-software multiple-element  arrangements). Each element within a non-software multiple-element arrangement  is accounted for as aseparate
 unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met: the delivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis; and foran
 arrangement  that  includes  a  general  right  of return  relative  to  the  delivered  products  or  services,  delivery  or  performance  of  the  undelivered  product  orservice is considered probable and is substantial
ly controlled by us. We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by
 us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer. Further, our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to thedelivered
 products.  Where  the  aforementioned  criteria  for  a separate  unit  of  accounting  are  not  met,  the  deliverable  is  combined  with  the  undeliveredelement(s
) and treated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition. For those units of accounting
 that include more than one deliverable but are treated as a single unit of accounting, we generally recognize revenues over the contractual period ofthe
 arrangement, or in the case of our cloud services offerings, we generally recognize revenues  over the contractual term of the cloud services subscription. Forthe
 purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenue to the respective revenue lineitems
 within our consolidated statements of operations based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of relative selling prices ofsuch elements.
For
 our non-software multiple-element  arrangements, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price  hierarchy at the arrangement’s inception.The
 selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) if available, third-party evidence(TPE)
 if VSOE is not available, or  estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE are available (a description as to how we determine VSOE, TPE and ESP isprovided
 below). If a tangible hardware product includes software, we determine whether the tangible hardware product and  the software work together todeliver
 the  product’s  essential  functionality  and,  if  so,  the  entire  product  is  treated  as  a non-software deliverable.  The  total  arrangement  consideration  isallocated
 to each  separate unit of accounting for each of the non-software deliverables  using the relative selling prices of each unit based on the selling pricehierarchy.
 We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered  elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products orservices or meeting of any specified performance conditions.
When
 possible, we establish VSOE of selling price for deliverables in software and non-software multiple-element  arrangements using the price charged for adeliverable
 when sold separately. TPE is established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements withsimilarly situated customers. 
If  we are unable to determine the selling price because VSOE or TPE does not exist, we determine ESP for the purposes of allocatingthe
 arrangement  by  reviewing  historical  transactions,  including  transactions  whereby  the  deliverable  was  sold  on  a standalone  basis  and  considering  severalother external and internal factors.
Revenue Recognition for Cloud License and 
On-Premise License and License Related Services (Software Elements) The
 basis for our cloud license and on-premise license  revenues and related services revenue recognition is substantially governed by the accounting guidancecontained in ASC 
985-605, Software-Revenue
 Recognition
 . We exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of  cloudlicense and 
on-premise license revenues and related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period.

For
 license  arrangements  that  do  not  require  significant  modification  or  customization  of  the  underlying license,  we  recognize  cloud  license  and on-premise license revenues
 when: (1) we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software; (2) we deliver the products; (3) the sale price is
 fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties; and (4) collection is probable. Revenues that are not recognized at the time oflicense sale because the foregoing conditions are not met, 
are generally recognized when those conditions are subsequently met. The
 vast majority of our cloud license and on-premise license  arrangements include license support contracts, which are entered into at the customer’s option.We
 recognize  the  related  fees  ratably  over  the  term  of  the  arrangement,  typically  one year.  License  support  contracts  provide  customers  with  rights  tounspecified
 software  product  upgrades,  maintenance  releases  and  patches  released  during  the  term  of  the  support  period  and  include  internet  access  totechnical
 content, as well as internet  and telephone access to technical support personnel. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of thenet
 cloud license and on-premise license  fees and are generally invoiced in full  at the beginning of the support term. Substantially all of our customers renewtheir license support contracts annually.

(Software
Arrangements) We often enter into arrangements with customers that purchase cloud licenses and 
on-premise licenses, license support and related services from us at the same time,
 or within close proximity of one another (referred to as software related multiple-element arrangements). For those software related multiple-elementarrangements, we have applied the residual 
method to determine the amount of cloud license and on-premise license revenues to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985-605. 
Under  the residual method, if VSOE exists for undelivered  elements in a multiple-element arrangement, VSOE of the undelivered elements is deferredwith
 the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration generally recognized upon delivery of the license. Where VSOE does not exist for the undelivered element
 in such arrangement, no revenue is recognized until the earlier of the point in time at which 1) VSOE has been established for such element; or 2) theelement that does not have VSOE has been delivered.
Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements—Arrangements with Software and 
Non-software Elements We
 also  enter  into  multiple-element  arrangements  that  may  include  a  combination  of  our  various  software  related  and non-software related  products  andservices
 offerings including cloud licenses and on-premise licenses,  license support, cloud services offerings, hardware products, hardware support, consulting, advanced
 customer support services and education. In such arrangements, we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative sellingprices
 of the software group of elements as a whole and the non-software group  of elements. We then further allocate consideration within the software groupto
 the  respective  elements  within  that  group  following  the  guidance  in  ASC 985-605 and  our  policies  as  described  above.  In  addition,  we  allocate  theconsideration
 within the non-software group  to each respective element within that group based on  a selling price hierarchy at the arrangement’s inception asdescribed
 above. After the arrangement consideration has been allocated to the software group of elements and non-software group  of elements, we account for each respective element in the arrangement as described above and below.

 of  our  cloud  license  and on-premise license  arrangements  include  consulting  implementation  services  sold  separately  under  consulting  engagementcontracts

 and on-premise license  revenues  because  the  arrangements  qualify  as  services  transactions  as  defined  in  ASC 985-605. The  more  significant  factorsconsidered
 in determining whether the revenues should be accounted for separately include the nature of services (i.e., consideration of whether the servicesare essential to 
the functionality of  the licensed product), degree of risk, availability of services from other vendors, timing of payments and impact of milestonesor acceptance criteria on the realizabilit
y of the license fee. Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed.

If
 an  arrangement  contains  multiple  elements  and  does  not  qualify  for  separate  accounting  for  the  product and  service  transactions,  then  cloud  license  andon-premise 
license  revenues and/or hardware products revenues, including the costs of hardware products, are generally recognized together with the servicesbased on contract accounting using either the 
percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method. We
 also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing “fiscal funding” or “termination for convenience” provisions, when  such provisions arerequired
 by  law,  to  determine  the  probability  of  possible  cancellation.  We  consider  multiple  factors,  including  the  history  with  the  customer  in  similartransactions, the “essential use” of the license or hardware 
products and the planning, budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity. If
 we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote, we then recognize revenues for such arrangements once all of
 the criteria described above have been met. If such a determination cannot be made, revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval ofthe applicable funding provision by the governmental entity for such 
arrangements. We assess whether fees
 are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met. Our standard payment
 terms  are  net  30  days.  However,  payment  terms  may  vary  based  on  the  country  in  which  the  agreement  is  executed.  We  evaluate non-standard payment
 terms  based  on whether  we  have  successful  collection  history  on  comparable  arrangements  (based  upon  similarity  of  customers,  products,  andarrangement
 economics)  and,  if  so,  generally  conclude  such  payment  terms  are  fixed  and  determinable  and  thereby  satisfy the required  criteria for revenuerecognition.
While most
 of our arrangements for sales within our businesses include short-term payment terms, we have a  standard practice of providing long-term financingto
 creditworthy customers primarily through our financing division. Since fiscal 1989, when our financing division was formed, we have established a history ofcollection,
 without concessions,  on  these  receivables  with  payment  terms  that  generally  extend  up  to  five  years  from  the  contract  date.  Provided  all  otherrevenue
 recognition  criteria  have  been  met,  we  recognize  cloud  license  and on-premise license  revenues  and  hardware  products  revenues  for  thesearrangements
 upon  delivery,  net  of  any  payment  discounts  from  financing  transactions.  We  have  generally  sold  receivables  financed  through our  financingdivision
 on a non-recourse basis  to third-party financing institutions within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution and we classify the proceeds from thesesales as cash flows from 
operating activitie s in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables as “true sales” as definedin ASC 860, 
Transfers
and
Servicing
 , as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. Our
 customers include several of our suppliers and, occasionally, we have purchased goods or services for our operations  from these vendors at or about thesame
 time  that  we  have  sold  our  products  to  these  same  companies  (Concurrent  Transactions).  Cloud  license  and on-premise license  agreements,  sales  ofhardware or 
sales  of services that occur within a common period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed forappropriate
 accounting treatment and disclosure. When we acquire goods or services from a customer, we negotiate  the purchase separately from any salestransaction, at terms we consider to
 be at arm’s length and settle the purchase in cash. We recognize revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenuerecognition criteria are met and 
the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations. Business Combinations
We
 apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business 
Combinations
,  in accounting for our acquisitions. It requires us to recognize separately from goodwill  the assetsacquired
 and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferredover
 the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired  and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accuratelyvalue
 assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  at  the  acquisition  date  as  well  as  any  contingent  consideration,  where  applicable,  our  estimates  are inherently uncertain and subject
 to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustmentsto the assets acquired and liabilities assumed w
ith the corresponding offset to 
41

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
goodwill.
 Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first,any subsequent adjustments are 
recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Accounting
 for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and  assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including ourestimates for
 intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, pre-acquisition contingencies  and any contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe that the
 assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience andinformation
 obtained from the management of the acquired companies and  are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur thatmay affect the accuracy or validity 
of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.We
 estimate the fair values of our cloud services and license support, and hardware obligations assumed as part of an acquisition. The estimated fair values of these
 performance  obligations  are  determined  utilizing  a  cost build-up approach.  The  cost build-up approach  determines  fair  value  by  estimating  the  costsrelated to fulfilling these assumed obligations plus a
 normal profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the assumed obligations are based on the historical directcosts
 related to providing the services including the correction of any errors in the  products acquired. The sum of these costs and operating profit approximates,in theory, the
 amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the performance obligations. We do not include any costs associated with sellingefforts 
or  research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs. Profit associated with any selling efforts is excluded because the acquiredentities
 would have concluded those selling efforts on the performance obligations prior to the  acquisition date. We also do not include the estimated researchand development costs in our fair value deter
minations, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition. As a result of ourfair value 
estimates  for these obligations, we did not recognize certain cloud services and license support revenue amounts and hardware revenue amounts thatwould
 have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities upon delivery of the  contractual obligations (refer to “SupplementalDisclosure
 Related  to  Certain  Charges”  below  for  further  discussion).  To  the  extent  customers  to  which  these  contractual  obligations  pertain  renew  thesecontracts with us, we expect to 
recognize revenues for the full contracts’ values over the respective contracts’ renewal periods. In
 connection  with  a  business combination  or  other  strategic  initiative,  we  may  estimate  costs  associated  with  restructuring  plans  committed  to  by  ourmanagement.
 Restructuring costs are typically comprised of employee severance costs, costs of consolidating duplicate facilities and  contract termination costs.Restructuring expenses are based upon
 plans that have been committed to by our management, but may be refined in subsequent periods. We account for coststo
 exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company  separately from the business combination pursuant to ASC 420, Exit
or 
Disposal
Cost
Obligations.A
 liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement  of operations in theperiod
 in which the liability is incurred. When estimating the fair value of facility restructuring activities, assumptions are applied regarding estimated sub-lease payments to 
be received, which  can differ materially from actual results. This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may materially affect our resultsof operations and financial position 
in the period the revision is made.For
 a  given  acquisition,  we  may  identify  certain pre-acquisition contingencies  as  of  the  acquisition  date  and may  extend  our  review  and  evaluation  of  thesepre-acquisition 
contingencies  throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies asa 
part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts.If
 we cannot reasonably  determine  the  fair  value  of a pre-acquisition contingency (non-income tax  related)  by  the  end  of  the  measurement  period,  which  isgenerally the
 case given the nature  of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if:  (1) it is probable that an assetexisted
 or  a  liability  had  been  incurred  at  the  acquisition  date and  (2)  the  amount  of  the  asset  or  liability  can  be  reasonably  estimated.  Subsequent  to  themeasurement
 period,  changes  in  our  estimates  of  such  contingencies  will  affect  earnings  and  could  have  a  material  effect  on  our  results  of  operations and financial position.

In
 addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business  combination  are  initially  estimated  as of theacquisition
 date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to ourpreliminary estimates being recorded 
to goodwill if identified within  the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determinationof the
 tax allowance’s or contingency’s estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax  related valuation allowances willaffect
 our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financialposition.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
— Impairment AssessmentsWe
 review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with
 ASC 350, Intangibles—Goodwill 
and
Other
.  According to ASC 350, we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting unit’s goodwill forimpairment or we can directly perform the quantitative 
impairment test. Should the qualitative assessment be used for any given fiscal  year, qualitative factors toconsider include cost factors; financial performance; legal, regulat
ory, contractual, political, business, or other factors; entity specific factors; industry and market considerat
ions, macroeconomic conditions, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. If we determine that it is more likely than not thatthe
 fair  value  of  the  reporting  unit  is  less  than  its  carrying value,  a  quantitative  test  is  then  performed;  otherwise,  no  further  testing  is  required.  For  thosereporting
 units tested using a quantitative approach, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill.
 If  the  estimated  fair  value  of  the  reporting  unit  is  less  than  the  carrying  amount  of  the  reporting  unit,  goodwill  impairment  is  recognized  for  thedifference, limited to the amount of goodwill recognized f
or the reporting unit.Determining
 the  fair  value  of  a  reporting  unit  involves  the  use  of  significant  estimates  and  assumptions.  These  estimates  and  assumptions  include revenue growth
 rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and thedetermination
 of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on  assumptions which we believe to be reasonable but that are inherentlyuncertain.
 Actual  future  results  may  differ  from  those  estimates.  In  addition,  we  make  certain  judgments  and  assumptions  in  allocating  shared  assets  andliabilities to 
determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. Our
 most  recent  annual  goodwill  impairment  analysis,  which  was  performed  on March  1,  2018,  did  not  result  in  a  goodwill  impairment  charge,  nor  did  werecognize an impairment charge in fiscal 2017 or 2016.
We
 make judgments  about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairmentmay
 exist. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and  whether events or changes in circumstances warranta
 revision to the remaining periods of amortization. Recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the assetto
 the future undiscounted  cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured asthe difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired 
asset.Assumptions
 and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of
 factors,  including  external  factors  such  as  industry  and  economic  trends  and  internal  factors  such  as  changes  in  our  business  strategy  and  our  internalforecasts. Although we believe that the historical assumptions and estim
ates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial
 results. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016.Accounting for Income T
axesSignificant judgment
 is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations
 where  the  ultimate  tax  outcome  is  uncertain.  Some  of  these  uncertainties  arise  as  a  consequence  of  revenue  sharing  and  cost  reimbursementarrangements

among
 related  entities,  the  process  of  identifying  items  of  revenues  and  expenses  that  qualify  for  preferential  tax  treatment  and  segregation  of  foreign  anddomestic
 earnings and expenses to avoid  double taxation. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters couldbe
 different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material  effect on our income taxprovision and net income in the period in which such determination is made.
On
 December 22, 2017 the U.S. Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act), was signed into law. The net expense related to the enactment of the Tax Act hasbeen
 accounted for during fiscal 2018 based on provisional estimates pursuant to the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.  118. Subsequent adjustments, if any, willbe
 accounted  for  in  the  period  such  adjustments  are  identified.  The  provisional  estimates  incorporate,  among  other  factors,  assumptions  made  based  oninterpretations
 of the Tax Act and existing tax laws  and a range of historical and forecasted financial and tax-specific facts  and information, including, withoutlimitation,
 the  amount  of  cash  and  other  specified  assets  anticipated  to  be  held  by  the company’s  foreign  subsidiaries  on  relevant  dates  and  estimates  ofdeferred tax balances during interim periods pending finalization of those ba
lances.We record a valuation allo
wance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In order for us to realize our deferred tax
 assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future growth,forecasted
 earnings,  future  taxable  income,  the  mix  of earnings  in  the jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate,  historical earnings,  taxable income  in  prior  years,  ifcarryback is permitted under the
 law and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine
 that  we  would  not  be  able  to  realize  all  or  part  of  our  net  deferred  tax  assets  in  the  future,  an  adjustment  to  the  deferred  tax  assets  valuationallowance
 would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination,  or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of thevaluati
on allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assetswould 
be realized, we would reverse the applicable porti on of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to earnings at such time.We 
record deferred tax assets for stock-based compensation awards that result in deductions on certain of our income tax returns based on the amount of stock-based compensation
 recognized and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed  in connection with a business combination at thestatutory ta
x rates in the jurisdictions that we are able to recognize such tax deductions. The impacts of the actual tax deductions for stock-based awards that arerealized
 in these jurisdictions  are generally recognized to our consolidated statements of operations in the period that a restricted stock-based award vests or astock
 option is exercised with any shortfall/windfall relative to the deferred tax asset established recorded  as a discrete detriment/benefit to our provision forincome taxes in this period. Such detriment/benefit can materially impact 
our reported effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 and prospective periods.We
 calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed
 during  the  subsequent  year.  Adjustments  based  on  filed  returns  are  generally  recorded  in  the  period  when  the  tax  returns  are  filed  and  the  global  taximplications are known, which can materiall
y impact our effective tax rate.The
 amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Our estimate
 of  the  potential  outcome  for  any  uncertain  tax  issue  is  highly  judgmental.  A  description  of  our  accounting  policies  associated  with  tax  relatedcontingencies
 assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations”  above. For those tax related contingencies that are not apart of a
 business combination, we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes, which contains a two-step approach to recognizing and
 measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicatesthat it is 
more likely than not that the tax  position will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second stepis to measure the tax benefit as the l
argest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although we believe that  
44

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
we
 have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters. We adjust reservesfor
 our  uncertain  tax  positions  due to  changing  facts  and  circumstances,  such  as  the  closing  of  a  tax  audit,  judicial  rulings,  and  refinement  of  estimates  orrealization of earnings or deductions that differ fr
om our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences generally will impact our provision for
 income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made. Our provisions for income taxes includethe impact of reserve provisions and changes to 
reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties.In
 addition,  as  a  part  of  our  accounting  for business  combinations,  intangible  assets  are  recognized  at  fair  values  and  goodwill  is  measured  as  the  excess  ofconsideration transferred over t
he net estimated fair values of assets acquired. Impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will
 result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period that any impairment is recorded. Amortization expenses associated with acquired intangibleassets
 are  generally  not  tax  deductible  pursuant  to  our existing  tax  structure;  however,  deferred  taxes  have  been  recorded  for non-deductible amortization expenses
 as a part of the accounting for business combinations. We have taken into account the allocation of these identified  intangibles among different taxingjurisdictions, including those with nominal or zero percent tax rates, in est
ablishing the related deferred tax liabilities.Legal and Other Contingencies
We 
are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financialexposure.
 A  description  of  our  accounting  policies  associated  with  contingencies  assumed  as a  part  of  a  business  combination  is  provided  under  “BusinessCombinations”
 above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potentialloss
 from  any claim  or  legal  proceeding  is  considered  probable,  and  the  amount  can  be  reasonably  estimated.  Significant  judgment  is  required  in  both  thedetermination
 of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable.  Because of uncertainties related to thesematters,
 accruals are based only on the best information available at the time the accruals are made. As additional information becomes available, we reassessthe
 potential liability related to our  pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities couldhave a material impact on our results
 of operations and financial position.Results of Operations
Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts 
and Jobs Act of 2017 The
 comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2018 compared to the corresponding prior year periods, and of our consolidated balance sheets as  of May 31,2018
 relative to May 31, 2017, was impacted by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act), which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. EffectiveJanuary
 1, 2018, the Tax Act  reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%; creates a quasi-territorial tax system that a) generally allows, amongother
 provisions,  companies  to  repatriate  certain  foreign  source  earnings  without  incurring  additional  U.S. income  tax  for  such  earnings  generated  afterDecember
 31, 2017 and b) generally requires companies to pay a one-time transition  tax on certain foreign subsidiary earnings generated prior to December 31, 2017
 that,  in  substantial  part,  were  previously  tax  deferred;  creates  new  taxes  on  certain  foreign  sourced  earnings;  limits  deductibility  of  certain  futurecompensation
 arrangements to certain highly compensated employees; and provides  tax incentives for the exportation of U.S. products to foreign jurisdictionsand for the purchase of qualifying capital equipment, among other provisions.
Because we have a May 31 fiscal year
 end, our fiscal 2018 blended U.S. federal statutory tax rate was approximately 29%.

During
 fiscal 2018, our provision for income taxes increased and our net income decreased, primarily as a result  of the following items related to the enactmentof the Tax Act:
 
 
• $7.8 billion of income tax expense, which we refined by a $166 million increase as of May 31, 2018 from our initial estimate made in our third quarter offiscal
 2018  in  accordance  with  SEC  Staff  Accounting  Bulletin  No.  118  (SAB  118),  related  to  the  application  of  the one-time transition  tax  to  certainforeign
 subsidiary  earnings  that  were generated  prior  to December  31,  2017  and  for which  such  expense  was substantially  recorded  to non-current income
 taxes payable in our consolidated balance sheet and corresponds  to the amount we currently expect to periodically settle over an eight yearperiod as provided by the Tax Act;
partially offset by:
 
 
• $820 million of income tax benefit, which we refined by a $76 million increase as of May 31, 2018 from our  initial estimate made in our third quarter offiscal
 2018 in accordance with SAB 118, related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities based on the rates at which they are expectedto reverse in the future; and
 
 
• the net favorable impacts of the Tax Act on our tax profile and effective tax rate beginning on January 1, 2018, which we  generally expect will continueinto future periods.
The
 net  expense  related  to  the  enactment  of  the  Tax  Act  has  been accounted  for  during  fiscal  2018  based  on  provisional  estimates  pursuant  to  SAB  118.Subsequent
 adjustments, if any, will be accounted for in the period such adjustments are identified. The provisional estimates incorporate, among other factors,assumptions made based on interpretations of the Tax Act and exist
ing tax laws and a range of historical financial and tax-specific facts and information, including among
 other items, the amount of cash and other  specified assets and liabilities of the company and its foreign subsidiaries on relevant dates and estimates ofdeferred tax balances pending finalization of those bal
ances.We
 expect the enactment of the Tax Act to generally provide greater flexibility for us to access and utilize our cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries as 
of January 1, 2018, as well as for prospective assets generated by these foreign subsidiaries’ future earningsand
 profits. We believe we have sufficient cash, cash equivalent  and marketable securities balances, as well as access to other capital resources, if required, tosettle the $7.8 billion 
one-time transition tax described above. Impacts of Acquisitions
The 
comparability  of  our  operating  results  in  fiscal  2018  compared  to  fiscal  2017  and  in  fiscal  2017  compared  to  fiscal  2016  was  impacted  by  our  recentacquisitions,
 including our acquisition of NetSuite during the second quarter of fiscal 2017. In our discussion  of changes in our results of operations from fiscal2018
 compared to fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, we may qualitatively disclose the impact of our acquired products and services (for theone-year 
period subsequent to the acquisition date) to the growth in  certain of our businesses’ revenues where such qualitative discussions would be meaningfulfor an
 understanding of the factors that influenced the  changes in our results of operations. When material, we may also provide quantitative disclosures relatedto
 such acquired products and services. Expense contributions from our recent acquisitions for each of the respective period comparisons  may not be separatelyidentifiable
 due  to  the  integration  of  these  businesses  into  our  existing  operations,  and/or  were  insignificant  to  our  results  of  operations  during  the  periodspresented.
We
 caution readers that, while pre- and  post-acquisition comparisons, as well as any quantified amounts themselves,  may provide indications of general trends,any acquisition information that we prov
ide has inherent limitations for the following reasons: 
 
• any qualitative and quantitative disclosures cannot specifically address or quantify the substantial effects attributab le to changes in business strategies,including
 our  sales  force  integration  efforts.  We  believe  that  if  our  acquired  companies  had  operated  independently  and  sales  forces  had  not  beenintegrated, the relative mix of products and services 
sold would have been different; and

Presentation of Operating Segm
ent Results and Other Financial InformationIn
 our results of operations discussion below, we provide an overview of our total consolidated revenues, total consolidated expenses and total consolidated operating
 margin, all of which are presented on a GAAP basis. We also present a GAAP-based discussion below for substantially all of the other expense items aspresented in our consolidated statement of operations that are not
 directly attributable to our three businesses. In
 addition, we discuss below the results of each our three businesses—cloud and license, hardware and services—which  are our operating segments as definedpursuant
 to ASC 280, Segment 
Reporting
.  The financial reporting for our three businesses that is presented below is presented in a manner that is consistentwith
 that used by our CODMs.  Our operating segment presentation below reflects revenues, direct costs and sales and marketing expenses that correspond toand
 are directly attributable to each of our three businesses. We also utilize these inputs to calculate and present  a segment margin for each business in thediscussion below.
Consistent
 with  our  internal  management  reporting  processes,  the  below operating  segment  presentation  includes  revenues  adjustments  related  to  cloudservices
 and license support contracts and hardware contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities butwere
 not recognized  in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented due to business combination accounting requirements. Refer to“Supplemental
 Disclosure Related to Certain Charges” below for additional discussion of these items  and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statementsincluded elsewhere
 in this Annual Report for a reconciliation of the summations of our total operating segment revenues as presented in the discussion below tototal revenues as 
presented per our consolidated statements of operations for al l periods presented.In
 addition, research and development expenses, general and administrative  expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets,certain
 other expense allocations, acquisition related and other expenses, restructuring expenses, interest expense, non-operating income,  net and provision forincome
 taxes are not attributed to our three operating segments because our management does not view the performance of our three businesses includingsuch
 items and/or  it is impractical to do so. Refer to “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges” below for additional discussion of certain of theseitems
 and  Note  15  of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  elsewhere  in  this Annual  Report  for  a  reconciliation  of  the  summations  of  totalsegment
 margin  as  presented  in  the  discussion  below  to  total  income  before  provision  of  income  taxes  as  presented  per  our  consolidated  statements  ofoperations for all periods presented.
Constant Currency Present
ationOur
 international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of each of our businesses’ revenues and expenses. As a result,
 each businesses’ revenues and expenses and our total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against majorinternational
 currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing  how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency ratefluctuations,
 we  compare  the  percent  change  in  the  results  from  one  period  to  another  period  in  this  Annual  Report  using  constant  currency  disclosure. To present this information, current
 and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars atconstant
 exchange rates (i.e., the rates in effect on May 31, 2017, which was  the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effectduring
 the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on May 31, 2018 and 2017, our financial
 statements  would  reflect  reported  revenues  of $1.16  million  in  fiscal  2018  (using  1.16  as the month-end average  exchange rate for the period) and$1.11 million in fiscal 2017 
(using 1.11 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation,  
47

however,
 would translate the fiscal 2018 results using the fiscal 2017 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the period. Ineach of the tables below, we 
present the percent change based on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency. Total Revenues and Operating

 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017:     Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our total revenues increased in  fiscal 2018 primarily due to growth inour
 cloud and license revenues, partially offset by decreases in our hardware revenues and services revenues. The constant currency increase in our cloud andlicense
 revenues  during  fiscal  2018  was attributable  to  growth  in  our  cloud  services  and  license  support  revenues  as  customers  purchased  our  applications,platform
 and infrastructure technologies via cloud and license deployment models and renewed their related contracts to continue to gain  access to our latesttechnology and support services.
 To a lesser extent, our cloud and license revenues also increased due to revenue contributions from our recent acquisitions. Theconstant
 currency decrease in our hardware revenues during fiscal  2018 was due to the reduction in our hardware products revenues and hardware supportrevenues
 primarily  due  to  the  emphasis  we  placed  on  the  marketing  and  sale  of  our  cloud  and  license  technologies.  The  constant  currency  decrease  in  ourservices
 revenues during fiscal 2018 was attributable to declines in our education and advanced customer support services revenues. In constant currency, theAmericas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed 78%, 10% and 12%, respectively, to the 
growth in our fiscal 2018 total revenues. Excluding
 the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our total operating expenses increased during fiscal  2018 primarily due to higher cloud services and licensesupport expenses
 resulting primarily from increased headcount and infrastructure expenses to support the increases in our revenues; higher sales and marketingexpenses
 related  to  our cloud  and  license  business;  increased  stock-based  compensation  expenses;  higher  general  and  administrative  expenses;  increasedrestructuring expenses; and higher intangible asset amortization. These constant currency expense increases were partial
ly offset by certain expense decreases in fiscal 2018, which primarily consisted of lower research and development expenses primar
ily related to lower 
48

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
employee
 expenses; and lower hardware products costs and a related decrease in hardware sales and marketing costs, both of which aligned to lower hardwarerevenues.
In constant currency, our total operating margin increased during fiscal 2018 primarily due to the increase in revenues and total
 operating margin as a percentage of total revenues remained flat.
Fiscal 2017
 Compared to Fiscal 2016:     Excluding the effects of foreign  currency rate variations, our total revenues increased in fiscal 2017 due to growth in ourcloud
 and license revenues and our services revenues, partially offset by a decrease in our hardware revenues. The constant currency increases in our cloud and license revenues during fiscal 2017
 and constant currency decreases in our hardware revenues during fiscal 2017 were primarily attributable to similar reasons asnoted
 above  for  the  fiscal  2018  changes  of  each.  The  constant  currency services  revenues  increase  during  fiscal  2017  was  primarily  attributable  to  certainacquisitions.
 In constant currency, the Americas region contributed 54%, the EMEA region contributed 24% and the Asia Pacific region contributed 22% to thegrowth in 
our total revenues during fiscal 2017. Excluding
 the effects of foreign currency rate variations, our total operating expenses increased during fiscal  2017 relative to the prior year period due to highersales
 and  marketing  and  research  and  development  expenses,  which  were  primarily  attributable  to  increased  headcount  and  increased  stock-basedcompensation
 expenses; and higher cloud services  and license support expenses resulting primarily from increased headcount and infrastructure expenses tosupport the increase in our revenues. These constant currency expense increases were partially offset by certa
in expense decreases in fiscal 2017, primarily lower hardware
 expenses due to similar reasons noted for the fiscal 2018 decrease above and lower intangible asset amortization in fiscal 2017 due to certain of ourintangible assets that became fully amortized.
In constant currency,
 our total operating margin increased in fiscal 2017 due to the increase in our total revenues while total operating margin as a percentage of revenues was flat.
Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain
 ChargesTo
 supplement  our  consolidated  financial  information,  we  believe  that  the  following  information  is  helpful  to  an  overall  understanding  of  our  past financial performance
 and prospects for the future. You should review the introduction under “Impact of Acquisitions” (above) for a discussion of the inherent limitationsin comparing

 In connection with our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud services and license support contracts  and hardware contracts assumed. Due to our application ofbusiness
 combination accounting rules, we did not recognize the cloud services and license support revenue amounts and hardware revenue amounts as presented in the above tablethat 
would  have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities upon delivery of the contractual obligations. To the extent customers for which thesecontractual obligations pertain renew th
ese contracts with us, we expect to recognize revenues for the full contracts’ values over the respective contracts’ renewal periods.

Certain  acquired  companies  capitalized  sales  commissions associated  with  subscription  agreements  and  amortized  these  amounts  over  the  related  contractual  terms.  Businesscombination
 accounting rules generally require us to eliminate these acquired capitalized sales commissions balances as of the acquisition  date and our post-combination GAAP salesand marketing expenses gener
ally do not reflect the amortization of these acquired deferred sales commissions balances. This adjustment is intended to include, and thus reflect, the fullamount of 
amortization related to such balanc es as though the acquired companies operated independently in the periods presented.

Stock-based compensation included in acquisition related and  other expenses resulted from unvested stock options and restricted stock-based awards assum ed from acquisitions whosevesting was accelerated generall

For fiscal 2018, the appli cable jurisdictional tax rates applied to our income before p rovision for income taxes after adjusting for the effects of the items within the table above, excludingincome tax reform (see footnote (8) below), resulted in an
 effective tax rate of 21.1%, which represented our effective ta x rate as derived per our consolidated statements of operations,primarily
 due to the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense and acquisition related items, including the tax effects of amortization of intangible assets. The income tax effects presented
 for  fiscal  2017  and  2016  were  calculated  reflecting  effective  tax  rates  of  22.8%  and  23.2%,  respectively,  which  represented  our  effective  tax  rates  as  derived  per  ourconsolidated
 statements of operations, primarily due to the net  tax effects of acquisition related items, including the tax effects of amortization of intangible assets, and the net taxeffects of stock-based compensa
tion. 
(8)
The  income tax reform adjustments for fiscal 2018 presented in the table  above were due to the our enactment of the Tax Act (refer to “Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of2017” above for additional discu
ssion), which increased our GAAP provision for income taxes during fiscal 2018.Cloud and License Business
Our 
cloud  and  license  business  engages  in  the  sale,  marketing  and  delivery  of  our  applications,  platform  and  infrastructure  technologies  through  variousdeployment models including license support offerings; Oracle

Cloud Services offerings; and cloud
 license and on-premise license offerings. License support  revenues are typically generated through the sale of license support contracts
 related to cloud license and on-premise licenses  purchased by our customers at their option and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over thecontractual
 term.  Our Oracle  Cloud Services  offerings  deliver  certain  of  our  applications,  platform  and  infrastructure  technologies  on  a  subscription  basis  viacloud-based
 deployment  models  that  we  host,  manage  and  support,  and  revenues  are  generally  recognized  over  the  subscription period.  Cloud  license  andon-premise 
license  revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware andour
 applications  software products  within  cloud  and on-premise IT  environments  and  are  generally  recognized  as  revenues  when  unrestricted  access  to  thelicense
 is granted, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met. We continue  to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, ondirect
 sales  through  our  own  sales  force.  We  also  continue  to  market  our  offerings  through  indirect  channels.  Costs  associated  with  our  cloud  and  licensebusiness
 are included  in cloud services and license support expenses, and sales and marketing expenses. These costs are largely personnel and infrastructurerelated
 including the cost of providing our cloud services and license support offerings, salaries and commissions  earned by our sales force for the sale of ourcloud and license offerings, and marketing program costs.

 and  license  support  revenues  during  fiscal  2018  were  primarily  due  to  the  purchase  and  renewal  of  our  cloud-based  services  and  license  supportservices,
 and due to contributions from our recent  acquisitions. These revenues increases were partially offset by decreases in our cloud license and on-premise license
 revenues during fiscal 2018. In constant currency, our total applications revenues and  total platform and infrastructure revenues grew during fiscal 2018as
 customers continued to deploy our applications, platform and infrastructure technologies through a wide array of different deployment models that we offerthat
 enable customer choice.  In constant currency, the Americas region contributed 71%, the EMEA region contributed 15% and Asia Pacific region contributed14% of the constant currency revenues growth for this business during fiscal 2018.
In
 constant currency, total cloud and license expenses increased in fiscal 2018 primarily due to higher cloud services and license support expenses and higher sales
 and  marketing  expenses,  both  of which  increased  primarily due  to  higher  employee related expenses  from higher  headcount.  In  addition, our constantcurrency cloud services
 and license support expenses increased during fiscal 2018 due to higher technology infrastructure expenses that supported the growth  inour revenues.
Excluding
 the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our cloud  and license segment’s total margin increased during fiscal 2018 primarily due to the increase inrevenues for this segment while total margin as 
a percentage of revenues decreased slightly due to expenses growth for this segment.Fiscal
 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016:     Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total revenues, total expenses  and total margin from our cloud andlicense
 business each increased in fiscal 2017 relative to fiscal 2016 due to similar reasons as noted above for the increases in fiscal 2018 relative to fiscal 2017.During
 fiscal 2017, the Americas, EMEA  and Asia Pacific regions contributed 63%, 20% and 17%, respectively, of the constant currency revenues growth for thisbusiness.
Excluding 
the  effects of currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business’ total margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2017 as our totalexpenses grew at a faster rate than our tot
al revenues for this business.

Hardware Business
Our
 hardware business’ revenues are generated from the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems, server, storage, and industry-specific hardware products that are
 generally recognized as revenues upon delivery to the customer, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Our hardware business also earnsrevenues
 from  the  sale  of  hardware  support  contracts  purchased  by  our customers  at  their  option  and  are  generally  recognized  as  revenues  ratably  as  thehardware
 support  services  are  delivered  over  the  contractual  term.  The  majority  of  our  hardware  products  are  sold  through  indirect  channels  such  asindependent 
distributors  and  value-added  resellers  and  we  also  market  and  sell  our  hardware  products  through  our  direct  sales  force.  Operating  expensesassociat
ed with our hardware business include the cost of hardware products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by
 our  internal  manufacturing  operations  or  by  third-party  manufacturers,  warranty  expenses  and  the  impact  of  periodic  changes  in  inventory  valuation,including
 the  impact  of  inventory  determined  to be  excess  and  obsolete;  the  cost  of  materials  used  to  repair  customer  products;  the  cost  of  labor  andinfrastructure
 to provide support services; and sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of
 our hardware offerings.

Excluding
 the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware  revenues decreased in fiscal 2018 and 2017,  each relative to the corresponding prior yearperiod,
 due to lower hardware products revenues and, to a lesser extent, lower hardware support revenues. The decreases in hardware products revenues in both fiscal
 2018 and 2017, each relative to the corresponding prior year period, were primarily attributable to our continued emphasis on the marketing and saleof
 our cloud-based infrastructure technologies, which resulted in reduced sales volumes  of certain of our hardware product lines and also impacted the volumeof customers that purchased hardware support contracts.
Excluding 
the  effects of currency  rate fluctuations, total hardware expenses decreased in fiscal 2018 and 2017,  each relative to the corresponding prior yearperiod, primarily due to lower hardware
 products costs and lower employee related expenses, which aligned to lower hardware revenues.

Fiscal 2018
 Compared to Fiscal 2017:      Excluding the  effects of currency rate fluctuations, our total services revenues decreased during fiscal 2018 due primarilyto
 revenue declines in our advanced customer services and education revenues. Constant currency  decreases in our services revenues in the Americas regionwere partially offset by 
a constant currency services revenues increase in the Asia Pacific region, while services revenues in the EMEA region were flat.In

Fiscal
 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017:     On  a constant currency basis, our non-operating income,  net for fiscal 2018 increased primarily due to higher interestincome
 in fiscal 2018 resulting from higher cash, cash equivalent and short-term investment balances and higher interest rates,  lower foreign currency losses infiscal 2018, and an increase in other income, net in fiscal 2018 related to higher net realized ga
ins on the sale of certain marketable securities.Fiscal
 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016:     On  a constant currency basis, our non-operating income,  net for fiscal 2017 increased primarily due to higher interestincome
 resulting from higher cash, cash equivalent and short-term investment balances and higher interest rates. In addition,  we incurred higher other income,net
 during fiscal 2017 related to investment gains for our deferred compensation plan investments that we held and classified as trading in comparison to netlosses for such investments during fiscal 2016. 
The aforementioned favorable movements in non-operating income, net during  fiscal 2017 were partially offset byhigher foreign currency losses, net during fiscal 2017.
Provision
 for Income Taxes:     Our effective tax rates for each of the periods presented were the result of the mix of  income earned in various tax jurisdictionsthat apply
 a broad range of income tax rates. In fiscal 2018, the Tax Act was signed into law. The more significant provisions of the Tax Act as applicable to us aredescribed above under “Impacts 
of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act of 2017”. Our provision for income taxes for the fiscal 2018 presented varied from the 21% U.S.statutory
 rate imposed by the Tax Act due primarily to the January 1, 2018 effective date of the Tax Act, the impacts  of the Tax Act upon adoption, state taxes,the
 U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation, and the U.S. domestic productionactivity
 deduction. Prior to the January  1, 2018 effective date of the Tax Act, our provision for income taxes historically differed from the tax computed at theprevious
 U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to certain earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested  in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S.research
 and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation and the U.S. domestic production activitydeduction.
 Future  effective  tax rates  could  be  adversely  affected  by  an  unfavorable  shift  of  earnings  weighted  to  jurisdictions  with  higher  tax  rates,  byunfavorable
 changes in tax laws and regulations, by adverse rulings in tax related litigation, or by shortfalls in stock-based compensation  realized by employeesrelative to stock-based compensation that was
 recorded for book purposes, among others.

 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017:     Provision for income taxes increased in fiscal  2018, relative to fiscal 2017, primarily due to the net unfavorable impactsdue
 to  our  initial  accounting  for  the  enactment  of  the  Tax  Act  on  January  1,  2018  (refer  to  “Impacts  of  the  U.S.  Tax  Cuts  and  Jobs  Act  of  2017”  above for additiona
l information) and, to a lesser extent, by the tax effect of higher income before provision for income taxes (determined after taking into account the netfavorable
 impact  of  the  Tax  Act  on  our  tax  profile)  during  fiscal  2018;  an unfavorable  shift  in  jurisdiction  mix  of  earnings  in  fiscal  2018;  and  a  decrease  inunrecognized
 tax benefits due to settlements with tax authorities and other events during fiscal 2018. These unfavorable impacts to our provision for incometaxes 
were partially offset by higher fisca l 2018 realized excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation expense.Fiscal 2017 Compared 
to Fiscal 2016:      Provisi on for income taxes in fiscal 2017 decreased relative to fiscal 2016 primarily due to the favorable impact of excesstax
 benefits recognized in fiscal 2017 that related to stock-based compensation,  which were recorded as a benefit to provision for income taxes in fiscal 2017, incomparison
 to fiscal 2016 when such benefits were recognized as an increase to additional paid in capital. To a lesser extent, the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2017 also benefited from a favorab
le jurisdictional mix of earnings, as well as net favorable changes in fiscal 2017 relating to unrecognized tax benefits fromaudit settlements, statute of limitation rele
ases, and other events.

   $ 67,261    2%   $ 66,078    18%   $ 56,125 Working capital: 
    The increase in working capital as of May 31, 2018 in comparison  to May 31, 2017 was primarily due to our issuance of $10.0 billion of long-term
 senior  notes  in  November  2017  (refer  to  Recent  Financing  Activities  Below  for  additional  information),  the  favorable  impacts  to  our  net  current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2018 and
 cash proceeds from stock option exercises. These favorable working capital movements were partially offsetby
 cash  used  for  repurchases  of  our  common  stock,  cash  used  to  pay  dividends  to our  stockholders,  cash  used  for  capital  expenditures  and  cash  used  foracquisitions in fiscal 2018.
The
 increase in working capital as of May  31, 2017 in comparison to May 31, 2016 was primarily due to our issuance of $14.0 billion of long-term senior notes inJuly
 2016, the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2017 and cash proceeds  from stock option exercises. Thesefavorable
 working capital movements were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions, including $9.0 billion of net cash used for our acquisition of NetSuite inthe
 second quarter of fiscal 2017,  cash used for repurchases of our common stock, cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders and cash used for capitalexpenditures.
Our 
working capital may be impacted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the amounts and timing of which are variable.Cash,
 cash equivalents and marketable securities:     Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major  banks, Tier-1 commercial  paper andother securities with original maturities of 90
 days or less. Marketable securities consist of Tier-1 commercial paper debt securities, corporate debt securities and certain other securities. The in
crease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2018 in comparison to May 31, 2017 was primarily due to theissuance
 of  $12.5  billion  of cash  inflows  from  fiscal  2018  debt  issuances  (refer  to  Recent  Financing  Activities  Below  for  additional  information),  cash  inflowsgenerated
 by our operations and cash inflows from stock option exercises. These cash inflows were partially offset by certain fiscal  2018 cash outflows, primarily$11.3 billion of repurchases of
 our common stock, the repayment of $9.8 billion of borrowings, payments of cash dividends to our stockholders and cash used forcapital expenditures.
As
 a result of the enactment of the Tax Act on January 1, 2018, we expect greater flexibility in accessing and utilizing our cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities
 balances held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries, as well as prospective assets generated by these foreign subsidiaries’ future earnings and profits.We
 believe  we  have  sufficient  cash,  cash  equivalent  and marketable  securities  balances  and  access  to  additional  capital  resources,  if  required,  to  settle  the$7.8 billion 
one-time transition tax described under “Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017” above. The
 amount  of  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities  that  we  report  in  U.S.  Dollars  for  a  significant  portion  of the  cash,  cash  equivalents  andmarketable
 securities balances held by our foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as ofthe
 end of each respective reporting period (the offset to  which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balancesheets and
 is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report). As the U.S. Dollar generally
 weakened against certain major international currencies during fiscal 2018, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that wereported in
 U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries increased on a net basis  as of May 31, 2018 relative to what we would have reported using constant currency ratesfrom our May 31, 2017 balance sheet date.
The
 increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2017 in comparison to May 31, 2016 was primarily due to cash inflows generated by our
 operations during fiscal 2017, $13.6 billion of net cash inflows from fiscal 2017 debt issuances, net of debt repayments, and cash inflows from fiscal 2017stock option

exercises.
 These fiscal 2017 cash inflows were partially offset by certain fiscal 2017 cash outflows, primarily acquisitions, including our acquisition of NetSuite,repurchases of
 our common stock,  payments of cash dividends to our stockholders, and cash used for capital expenditures. Additionally, our reported cash, cashequivalents
 and  marketable  securities  balances  as  of  May  31,  2017  decreased  on  a  net  basis  in  comparison  to May  31,  2016  as  the  U.S.  Dollar  generallystrengthened in comparison to most major international currencies during fiscal 2017.

 license support agreements. Payments from customers for these support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contracts’ terms,which
 are generally  one year in length. Over the course of a fiscal year, we also have historically generated cash from the sales of new licenses, cloud services,hardware
 offerings and services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee  related expenditures, material and manufacturing costsrelated to the production of our hardware products, taxes and leased faci
lities.Fiscal

2017:
     Net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2018 was $10.0 billion in  comparison to net cash provided by financingactivities
 of $9.1 billion during fiscal 2017. The increase in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2018 was primarily due to increased stock repurchaseactivity in
 fiscal 2018 (we used  $11.3 billion in fiscal 2018 for stock repurchases in comparison to $3.6 billion in fiscal 2017) and debt related cash flows for whichwe

 billion  of  net cash  inflows  from  fiscal  2016  borrowing  activities.  In  addition,  we  significantly  reduced  our  stock  repurchase  activity  in  fiscal  2017,  using$3.6 billion, in comparison to fiscal 2016 when we used $10.4 billion.
Free cash flow: 
    To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash  flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to
 analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe that free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases  for comparing our performance with ourcompetitors.
 The presentation of non-GAAP free  cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of ourperformance, or as an alternative to cash fl
ows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flow as follows:

 Customer Financing:     We  offer certain of our customers the option to acquire  licenses, cloud services, hardware and services offerings throughseparate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell
 these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions within
 90  days  of  the  contracts’  dates  of  execution.  We  generally  record  the  transfers  of  amounts  due  from  customers  to  financial  institutions  as  sales  offinancing
 receivables because we are considered to have surrendered  control of these financing receivables. We financed $1.5 billion in fiscal 2018, $912 millionin 2017
 and $1.2 billion in fiscal 2016, respectively, or approximately 24%, 14% and 16% of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Recent Financing Activities:
Cash Dividends 
:     In fiscal 2018, we declared and paid cash dividends of $0.76 per share that totaled $3.1  billion. In June 2018, our Board of Directors declared aquarterly
 cash dividend of $0.19 per share of our outstanding common stock payable on July 31, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business onJuly
 17, 2018. Future  declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board ofDirectors.
Swap
 Agreements:     In May 2018, we entered into certain cross-currency interest rate swap agreements to manage the foreign currency  exchange risk andinterest
 rate  risk  associated  with  our €  750  million  of  3.125%  senior  notes  due  July  2025  (July  2025  Notes)  by  effectively  converting  the  fixed-rate,  Eurodenominated
 July 2025 Notes, including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to variable-rate, U.S. Dollar denominated debt.The economic effect
 of the swap agreement was to eliminate the uncertainty of the principal balance in  U.S. Dollars associated with the July 2025 Notes by fixingthe
 principal amount of the July 2025 Notes at $868 million and modify the related fixed interest obligations so that the interest payable on these notes becamevariable
 based on LIBOR. As of May 31, 2018, our July 2025 Notes had an effective interest rate of 5.17% after considering the effects of the aforementionedcross-currency
 interest rate swap arrangement. We are accounting for these cross-currency  interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC815, 
Derivatives
and
Hedging
(ASC 815). In April 2018, we 
entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of  modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our$1.5
 billion of 6.50% senior notes due April 2038 (April 2038 Notes), so that the interest payable on  these notes became variable based on LIBOR. As of May 31,2018,
 our April 2038 Notes had effective interest rates of 5.65% after considering the effects of the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements. We areaccounting for these 
interest rate swap agreements as fair va lue hedges pursuant to ASC 815.

Revolving
 Credit Agreements:     In  May  2018,  we  entered  into  three  revolving  credit  agreements  with  JPMorgan  Chase  Bank,  N.A.,  as  initial  lender  andadministrative agent (the 2018 Credit Agreements) and borrowed $2.5 billion pursuant to 
these agreements. The 2018 Credit Agreements provided us with short- term borrowings
 for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Interest for the 2018 Credit Agreements is based on either (1) a LIBOR-based formulaor
 (2) the Base  Rate formula, each as set forth in the 2018 Credit Agreements. The borrowings are due and payable on June 28, 2018, which is the terminationdate
 of  the  2018  Credit  Agreements.  Additional  details  regarding  the  2018  Credit  Agreements  are included  in  Note  7  of  Notes  to  Consolidated  FinancialStatements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Common Stock Repurchase 
Program:     Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. During fiscal 2018, ourBoard
 of  Directors  approved  expansions  of  our  stock  repurchase  program  totaling $24.0  billion.  As  of  May  31,  2018,  approximately  $17.8  billion  remainedavailable
 for  stock  repurchases  pursuant  to  our  stock  repurchase  program.  We  repurchased  238.0  million  shares  for  $11.5  billion,  85.6  million shares  for$3.5
 billion, and 271.9 million shares for $10.4 billion in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expirationdate
 and  the  pace  of  our  repurchase  activity  will  depend on  factors  such  as  our  working  capital  needs,  our  cash  requirements  for  acquisitions  and  dividendpayments,
 our  debt  repayment  obligations or  repurchases  of  our  debt,  our  stock  price,  and  economic  and  market  conditions.  Our  stock  repurchases  may  beeffected
 from time to time through open market purchases and pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan.  Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended,delayed or discontinued at any time.
Senior Notes 
:    In November 2017, we issued $10.0 billion of senior notes comprised of the fo llowing: 
 
•  $1.25 billion of 2.625% senior notes due February 2023; 
 
•  $2.00 billion of 2.95% senior notes due November 2024; 
 
•  $2.75 billion of 3.25% senior notes due November 2027; 
 
•  $1.75 billion of 3.80% senior notes due November 2037; and 
 
•  $2.25 billion of 4.00% senior notes due November 2047.We
 issued the senior notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock, repayment of
 indebtedness and future acquisitions. Additionally, in fiscal 2018, we repaid $3.5 billion of senior notes pursuant to their terms. Additional details regardingour senior notes are included in Note 7 of Notes to C
onsolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Contractual
 Obligations:     The  contractual obligations  presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under our fixed contractualobligations
 and commitments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates and other factors may result in  actual paymentsdiffering

 Represents the principal balances and interest payments to be paid in connection with our senior notes and other borrowings out standing as of May 31, 2018 after considering: 
 
• certain interest rate swap agreements for certain series of senior notes that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest  obligations associated with these senior notesso
 that they effectively became variable pursuant to a LIBOR-based index. Interest payments on these senior notes have been presented in the table above after consideration ofthese fixed

• interest payments on our floating-rate senior notes that are based upon the interest rates applicable to the senior notes  as of May 31, 2018 and are subject to change in futureperiods;
 
 
• certain cross-currency  swap agreements for our €  1.25 billion 2.25%  senior  notes due 2021 that have  the economic  effect of converting  our fixed-rate,  Euro-denominated  debt,including
 annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt with a fixed annual  interest rate. Principal and interestpayments for thes
e senior notes were calculated and presented in the table above based on the terms of these cross-currency swap agreements; and 
 
• certain  cross-currency  interest  rate  swap  agreements  for  our €  750 million  3.125% senior  notes  due July  2025 that  have  the  economic  effect of converting  our  fixed-rate,  Euro-denominated
 debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal  at maturity, to a variable-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt. Principal and interest paymentsfor these senior notes wer

 Primarily represents leases of facilities and includes future minimum rent payments for facilities that we have vacated pursuant to our restructuring and merger integration activities. Wehave
 approximately $61 million in facility obligations,  net of estimated  sublease income,  for certain  vacated locations  in accrued restructuring  on our consolidated  balance sheet  atMay 31, 2018.
 
(3) 
 Primarily represents amounts associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and specify terms, including:  fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed,minimum
 or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payment. We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our hardware products and
 to perform final assembly and testing of finished hardware products. We also obtain individual hardware components for our products from a variety of individual suppliers based on
 projected demand information. Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment withinagreed
 upon  lead-times  and/or  commercially  standard lead-times  for  the  particular  part  or  product  and  have  been  included  in  the  amount  presented  in  the  above  contractualobligations
 table. Routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain  other suppliers and that are entered into in theordinary
 course of business are not included in the amounts presented above, as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult toquantify in a meaningful way.
As of May 31, 2018, we had $6.6
 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet,
 and all such obligations have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to the uncertainty as to when they might be settled. Wecannot
 make a reasonably  reliable estimate of the period in which the remainder of our unrecognized income tax benefits will be settled or released with therelevant
 tax  authorities,  although  we  believe  it  is  reasonably  possible  that  certain  of  these  liabilities could  be  settled  or  released  during  fiscal  2019.  We  areinvolved
 in claims and legal proceedings. All such claims and obligations have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to the uncertaintyof
 claims and legal proceedings and  associated estimates and assumptions, all of which are inherently unpredictable and many aspects of which are out of ourcontrol. Notes 14
 and 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report includes additional information regarding these contingencies.
We
 believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated  from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital,capital expenditur
es and contractual obligation requirements, including the $7.8 billion one-time transition tax described under “Impacts of  the U.S. Tax Cuts andJobs
 Act of 2017” above. In addition, we believe that we could fund our future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt withour
 internally  available  cash,  cash  equivalents and  marketable  securities,  cash  generated  from  operations,  additional  borrowings  or  from  the  issuance  ofadditional securities.
Off-Balance 
Sheet Arrangements:     We do not have any off-balance sheet  arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
 financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that arematerial to investors.

Selected Quarterly Financial Data
Quarterly
 revenues,  expenses  and  operating  income  have  historically  been  affected  by  a  variety  of  seasonal  factors,  including  the  structure  of  sales force incentive compensation
 plans. In addition, our European operations generally provide lower revenues in our first fiscal quarter because of the reduced economicactivity
 in Europe during the summer. These seasonal factors are common in the technology  industry. These factors have historically caused a decrease in ourfirst
 quarter revenues as compared to revenues in the immediately preceding fourth quarter, which historically has been our highest revenue quarter within aparticular 
fiscal  year. Similarly, the operating income of our business is affected by seasonal factors in a similar manner as our revenues (in particular, our cloudand
 license  business  and  hardware  business)  as  certain  expenses  within  our  cost  structure  are relatively  fixed  in  the  short  term.  We  expect  these  trends  tocontinue in fiscal 2019.
The
 following  tables  set  forth  selected  unaudited  quarterly information  for  our  last  eight  fiscal  quarters.  We  believe  that  all  necessary  adjustments,  whichconsisted
 only  of  normal  recurring  adjustments,  have  been  included  in  the  amounts  stated  below  to  present  fairly  the  results  of  such  periods  when  read in conjunction

Our stock-based compensation program
 is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of exist
ing stockholders.We
 recognize that restricted stock-based awards and stock options dilute existing  stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock-based awardsgranted
 while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2015 has been aweighted-average
 annualized rate of 1.7% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new restricted stock-based awardsor
 stock  options  granted  and  assumed,  net  of  restricted  stock-based  awards  and  stock options  forfeited  by  employees  leaving  the  company,  divided  by  theweighted-average
 outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all restricted stock-based awards vest andstock options are 
exercised. Of the  outstanding stock options at May 31, 2018, which generally have a ten-year exercise period, approximately 19% have exercise prices
 higher than the market price of our common stock on such  date. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect ofour
 stock-based compensation program. However, we may modify the levels of our stock repurchases in the future depending on a number of factors, including the
 amount  of  cash  we  have  available  for  acquisitions,  to  pay  dividends,  to  repay  or  repurchase  indebtedness  or  for  other  purposes.  At  May  31,  2018,  themaximum potential dilution from a
ll outstanding restricted stock-based awards and

 stock options, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including stock options where the strike price is higherthan the market price as of such 
date, was 9.8%. During
 fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviewed and approved the annual organization-wide stock-based  award grants toselected
 employees, all stock-based award grants to executive officers and any individual grant of restricted stock units of 62,500 or greater. Each member of aseparate executive
 officer committee, referred to as the Plan  Committee, was allocated a fiscal 2018 equity budget that could be used throughout the fiscal yearto grant equity within his or her organizat
ion, subject to certain limitations established by the Compensation Committee.Restricted stock-based award and stock option activity from

For information with 
respect to  recent accounting pronouncements, if any, and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, ifany, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated F
inancial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.Item 7A.    Quantitative
 and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskCash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and
 Interest Income RiskCash,
 cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $67.3 billion and $66.1 billion as of May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our bank  deposits and timedeposits
 are  generally  held  with  large,  diverse  financial  institutions  worldwide  with  high  investment-grade  credit  ratings  or  financial  institutions  that  meetinvestment-grade ratings criteria, which we believe mitigates 
credit risk and certain other risks. In addition, as of May  31, 2018, substantially all of our marketablesecurities were
 high quality with approximately 26% having maturity dates within one year and 74% having maturity dates within one to five years (a description of
 our  marketable  securities  held  is  included  in  Notes  3  and  4  of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  elsewhere  in  this  Annual  Report  and“Liquidity
 and  Capital  Resources”  above).  We  held  a  mix  of both  fixed  and  floating-rate  debt  securities.  Fixed  rate  securities  may  have  their  market  valueadversely impacted as interest rates increase,
 
65

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
while
 floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may varydue
 to changes in interest rates or  we may realize losses if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. Howeverbecause
 we classify our debt securities as “available for sale,” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes  in interest rates unless such securities are soldprior
 to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. The fair values of our fixed-rate debt securities are impacted by interestrate
 movements and if interest rates  would have been higher by 50 basis points as of May 31, 2018 and 2017 we estimate the change would have decreased thefair
 values of our marketable securities holdings by $308 million and $348 million, respectively. Substantially  all of our marketable securities are designated asavailable-for-sale. 
We generally do not use our investments for trading purposes. Changes
 in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. For  fiscal2018
 and  2017,  total  interest  income  was  $1.2  billion  and  $802  million,  respectively,  with  our  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities  investmentsyielding an average 1.73% and 1.47%, respectively, on a worldwide basis.
Interest Expense Risk
Interest Expense 
Risk — Interest Rate Swap Agreements and Cross-Currency Interest Rate Swap AgreementsOur
 total borrowings were $60.9  billion as of May 31, 2018, consisting of $56.9 billion of fixed-rate borrowings, $1.2 billion of floating-rate borrowings (Floating-Rate
 Notes) and $2.8 billion of other borrowings, primarily under the 2018 Credit Agreements.  We have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements thathave
 the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with our $1.5 billion of 2.375% senior notes due January 2019 (January 2019Notes), our 
$2.0 billion of 2.25% senior notes due October 2019 (October 2019 Notes), our $1.5 billion of 2.80% senior notes due July 2021  (July 2021 Notes), andour
 April 2038 Notes, so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectively became  variable based on LIBOR. We have also entered into cross-currencyinterest
 rate swap agreements to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our July 2025 Notes by effectively converting the fixed-rate,Euro
 denominated debt,  including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to variable-rate, U.S. Dollar denominated debt basedon
 LIBOR. The critical terms of the swap agreements match the critical terms of the January 2019 Notes, October  2019 Notes, July 2021 Notes, April 2038 Notesand
 July  2025  Notes  that  the  swap  agreements  pertain  to,  including  the  notional amounts  and  maturity  dates.  We  do  not  use  these  swap  arrangements  fortrading
 purposes. We are accounting for these swap  agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives 
and
Hedging
(ASC  815). The fair values ofthese
 fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements as of May 31, 2018 and 2017 were a $26 million net loss and a $40  million gain, respectively. We estimatethat
 the  changes  in  the  fair  values  of these  swap  agreements  during  fiscal  2018  and  2017  were  primarily  attributable  to an  increase  in  forward  interest  rateprices. If LIBOR-based interest rates would 
have been higher by 100 basis points as of May 31, 2018 and 2017, the change would have decreased the fair values of the fixed to variable swap agreements by $315 mill
ion and $153 million, respectively.By
 issuing the Floating-Rate Notes and by entering into the aforementioned swap arrangements, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based
 upon LIBOR. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations. Aninterest
 rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk  by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in marketinterest
 rates. As of May 31, 2018 and 2017, if LIBOR-based interest rates would have been higher by 100 basis points, the change would have increased our interest
 expense annually by approximately $86 million and $73 million, respectively, as it relates to our fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements andfloating-rate
 borrowings. Additional details regarding our senior notes and related  swap agreements are included in Notes 7 and 10 of Notes to ConsolidatedFinancial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Currency Risk
Foreign 
Currency Transaction Risk—Foreign  Currency Forward ContractsWe
 transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a  program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risksassociated
 with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so thatincreases or
 decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks andvolati
lity associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from  time to time. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise fromintercompany
 sublicense  fees,  intercompany  loans  and  other  intercompany  transactions.  Our  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  are  generally  short-term  induration.
Neither
 do we use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to
 ASC 815. Accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fairvalues
 recorded to our consolidated statement of operations. Given the short duration  of the forward contracts, amounts recorded generally are not significant.The
 balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for forward contracts in an unrealizedgain
 position and other current liabilities for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position. The statement of operations classification for changes in fair valuesof these forward contracts is 
non-operating income, net for both realized and unrealized gains and losses. We expect that we will 
continue to realize gains or losses  with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forwardcontracts.
 Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend  on the size and type of cross-currency transactionsthat
 we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currencyforward
 contracts and other factors.  The notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major internationalcurrencies were $3.4 bil
lion as of each of May 31, 2018 and 2017 and the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell U.S. Dollars in  exchange for othermajor
 international currencies were $1.4 billion as of each of May 31, 2018 and 2017. The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts werenominal at 
May 31,  2018 and 2017. Net foreign exchange transaction losses included in non-operating income, net  in the accompanying consolidated statementsof
 operations were $74 million, $152 million and $110  million in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As a large portion of our consolidated operations areinternational, we could experience additional foreign currency volat
ility in the future, the amounts and timing of which are unknown. Foreign Currency T
ranslation Risk—Impact on Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable SecuritiesFluctuations
 in  foreign  currencies  impact  the  amount  of  total  assets  and  liabilities  that  we  report  for  our  foreign  subsidiaries  upon  the  translation of  theseamounts
 into U.S. Dollars. In particular, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion ofthe
 cash  held  by  these  subsidiaries  is  subject  to  translation  variance caused  by  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  as  of  the  end  of  each  respectivereporting period (the offset
 to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheets and is also presentedas 
a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report).As
 the U.S. Dollar fluctuated against  certain international currencies as of the end of fiscal 2018, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securitiesthat
 we reported in U.S. Dollars for foreign subsidiaries that hold international currencies as of May 31, 2018  increased relative to what we would have reportedusing
 a constant currency rate from May 31, 2017. As reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, the estimated effects of exchange rate changes onour
 reported cash and cash equivalents  balances in U.S. Dollars was an increase of $57 million for fiscal 2018, and decreases of $86 million and $115 million infiscal
 2017 and 2016, respectively. If overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the U.S.  Dollar uniformly would have been weaker by 10% as ofMay
 31,  2018  and  May  31,  2017  the  amount  of  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities  we  would  report  in  U.S.  Dollars  would  have  decreased  byapproximately 
$555 million and $518 million, respectively, assuming constant foreign currency cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances.

Item 8.    Financial Statem
ents and Supplementary DataThe response to this item is submitted as a separate
 section of this Annual Report. See Part IV, Item 15.Item 9.    Changes In
 and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial DisclosureNone.
Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Di
sclosure Controls and ProceduresAs
 of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we  carried out an evaluation under the supervision  and with the participation of ourDisclosure Committee and
 our management, including our Principal Executive Officers (one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of thedesign and operation of our disclosure 
controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Based on
 our management’s evaluation (with the participation of our Principal Executive Officers, one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer), as of the end of the
 period covered by this report, our Principal Executive Officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of May 31, 2018to
 provide  reasonable  assurance  that  information  required  to  be disclosed  by  us  in  reports  that  we  file  or  submit  under  the  Exchange  Act  is  (i)  recorded,processed,
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officers (one of whom 
is our Principal Financial Officer) as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Management’s 
Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingOur management
 is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) 
and 15d-15(f). Under  the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officers (one of whom is ourPrincipal
 Financial Officer), we conducted  an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2018 based on theguidelines
 established  in Internal 
Control—Integrated
Framework
issued  by the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission’s  2013framework.
 Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financialreporting and the preparation of financial statements for externa
l reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Based
 on  the  results  of  our evaluation,  our  management  concluded  that  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  effective  as  of  May  31,  2018.  Wereviewed the results of management’s assessment with our Finance and Audit Committee.
The
 effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2018 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent  registered publicaccounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report.
Changes in Internal Contr
ol over Financial ReportingThere
 were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange  ActRules 
13a-15 or 15d-15 that  occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations o
n Effectiveness of ControlsOur
 management, including our Principal Executive Officers (one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer), believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed
 
68

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
to
 provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expectthat
 our disclosure controls and procedures  or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter howwell
 conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system  are met. Further, the design of acontrol
 system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of theinherent
 limitations in all control systems, no evaluation  of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, havebeen
 detected.  These  inherent limitations include the  realities that judgments  in decision-making can be faulty and  that breakdowns can  occur because of asimple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can 
be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by managementoverride
 of the controls. The design of any system of controls also  is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there canbe
 no  assurance  that  any  design  will  succeed  in  achieving  its  stated  goals  under  all  potential  future  conditions;  over  time,  controls  may  become inadequate because of changes
 in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effectivecontrol system, misstatements due to error or fraud ma
y occur and not be detected. Item 9B.    Other Information

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of 
Oracle CorporationOpinion 
on the Financial Statements We
 have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Oracle Corporation (the Company) as of May  31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidatedstatements of operations, comprehensive income, equity
 and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2018, and the related notes andthe
 financial statement schedule listed  in the Index at Item 15(a)2 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statementspresent
 fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the  consolidated  financial  position  of  the  Company  at May  31,  2018  and  2017,  and  the  consolidated  results  of  itsoperations and its cash flows for e
ach of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2018, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We
 also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control
 over  financial  reporting  as  of  May  31,  2018,  based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control-Integrated  Framework  issued  by  the  Committee  ofSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway C
ommission (2013 framework) and our report dated June 22, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion
These
 financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Company’s  management.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  Company’s financial statements
 based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company inaccordance
 with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  and regulations  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  and  the  PCAOB.  Weconducted
 our  audits  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  PCAOB.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonableassurance about
 whether the financial  statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing proceduresto
 assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures  that respond to those risks.Such
 procedures  included  examining,  on  a  test  basis,  evidence  regarding  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements.  Our  audits  also  includedevaluating
 the  accounting  principles  used  and significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  presentation  of  the  financialstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reas

 Company’s  management  is  responsible  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  for  its  assessment  of  the effectiveness  ofinternal control over financial reporting included
 in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is toexpress an opinion on the
 Company’s internal control over financial rep orting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB andare
 required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations  of theSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We
 conducted  our  audit  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  PCAOB.  Those standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonableassurance about whether effective internal control over financial report
ing was maintained in all material respects.Our
 audit  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists, testing  andevaluating
 the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control  based  on  the  assessed  risk,  and  performing  such  other  procedures  as  we  considerednecessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
 basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s
 internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
 of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  A  company’s  internal  control  overfinancial
 reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflectthe
 transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as necessary  to  permitpreparation
 of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are beingmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors 
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding preventi on or timelydetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that
 could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because
 of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any evaluation  ofeffectiveness
 to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliancewith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Oracle
 Corporation provides products and services that address all aspects of corporate information technology (IT) environments—applications, platform  andinfrastructure.
 Our applications, platform and infrastructure offerings are delivered to customers worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable ITdeployment
 models,  including  cloud-based, on-premise, or  hybrid,  which  enable  customer  choice  and  flexibility.  Our  Oracle  Cloud  offerings  provide  acomprehensive and fully integr
ated stack of applications, platform, compute, storage and networking services in all three primary layers of the cloud: Software as a
 Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Our Oracle Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings (collectively, “Oracle CloudServices”) 
integrate  the software, hardware and services on customers’ behalf in IT environments that we deploy, support and manage for the customer. Weoffer
 our customers the option to deploy our comprehensive set of cloud offerings including Oracle Cloud  Services or to purchase our software and hardwareproducts
 and related services to manage their own cloud-based or on-premise IT  environments. Customers that purchase our software products may elect topurchase license support contracts,
 which provide our customers with rights to unspecified license upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the supportperiod as well as technical support assistance. Customers that
 purchase our hardware products may elect to purchase hardware support contracts, which provide customers
 with software updates and can include product repairs, maintenance services, and technical support services. We also offer customers a broad set ofservices offerings 
that are designed to improve customer utilization of their investments in Oracle applications, platform and infrastructure technologies.Oracle 
Corporation  conducts business globally and was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun inJune 1977.
Basis of Financial Statements
The
 consolidated financial statements  included our accounts and the accounts of our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interest positionsof
 certain of our consolidated entities are reported as a separate component of consolidated equity from the equity attributable  to Oracle’s stockholders for allperiods
 presented. The noncontrolling interests in our net income were not significant to our consolidated results for the periods presented and therefore havebeen
 included as a component of non-operating income,  net in our consolidated statements of operations. Intercompany transactions and balances have beeneliminated.
 Certain  other  prior  year  balances  have  been  reclassified  to  conform  to  the  current year  presentation.  Such  reclassifications  did  not  affect  totalrevenues, operating income or net income.
In
 fiscal  2018,  we  adopted  Accounting Standards  Update  (ASU) No.  2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill 
and
Other
(Topic
350):
Simplifying
the
Test
for
GoodwillImpairment
(ASU 2017-04). The  ASU simplifies  the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. Under the legacyguidance,
 Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test required entities to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner  as the amount of goodwillrecognized
 in a business combination by assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The carrying value inexcess
 of the implied fair value was recognized as  goodwill  impairment.  Under  the  new  standard,  goodwill  impairment  is  recognized  as  the  carrying  value  inexcess
 of the reporting unit’s fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. ASU 2017-04 did  not have a material impact onour consolidated financial statements.
Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
of 2017 The
 comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2018 compared to the corresponding prior year periods, and of our consolidated balance sheets  as of May 31,2018
 relative to May 31, 2017, was impacted by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act), which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. EffectiveJanuary 1, 2018, the Tax Act reduces the 
U.S. federal corporate tax rate from  35% to 21%; creates a quasi-territorial tax

 earnings generated after December  31, 2017 and b) generally requires companies to pay a one-time transition  tax on certain foreign subsidiary earningsgenerated
 prior  to  December  31,  2017  that,  in  substantial  part,  were previously  tax  deferred;  creates  new  taxes  on  certain  foreign  sourced  earnings;  limitsdeductibility
 of  certain  future  compensation  arrangements  to  certain  highly  compensated  employees;  and  provides  tax  incentives  for  the  exportation  of  U.S.products to foreign jurisdictions and for the purchase of qualifying capital equipment, among other provisions.
Because we have a May 31 
fiscal year end, our fiscal 2018 blended U.S. federal statutory tax  rate was approximately 29%.During
 fiscal 2018, our provision for income taxes increased  and our net income decreased, primarily as a result of the following items related to the enactmentof the Tax Act:
 
 
• $7.8 billion of income tax expense, which we refined by a $166 million increase as of May 31, 2018 from our initial estimate made in our third quarter offiscal
 2018 in accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), related to the application ofthe 
one-time transition  tax to certain foreign subsidiary  earnings  that were generated  prior to December  31, 2017 and for which such expense wassubstantially
 recorded to non-current income  taxes payable in our consolidated balance sheet and corresponds to the amount we currently expect toperiodically settle over an eight ye
ar period as provided by the Tax Act;partially offset by:
 
 
• $820 million of income tax benefit, which we refined by a $76 million increase as of May 31, 2018 from our  initial estimate made in our third quarter offiscal
 2018 in accordance with SAB 118, related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities based on the rates at which they are expectedto reverse in the future; and
 
 
• the net favorable impacts of the Tax Act on our tax profile and effective tax rate beginning on January 1, 2018, which we  generally expect will continueinto future periods.
The
 net  expense  related  to  the  enactment  of  the  Tax  Act  has  been accounted  for  during  fiscal  2018  based  on  provisional  estimates  pursuant  to  SAB  118.Subsequent
 adjustments, if any, will be accounted for in the period such adjustments are identified. The provisional estimates incorporate, among other factors,assumptions made based on interpretations of the Tax Act and exist
ing tax laws and a range of historical financial and tax-specific facts and information, including among
 other items, the amount of cash and other  specified assets and liabilities of the company and its foreign subsidiaries on relevant dates and estimates ofdeferred tax balances pending finalization of those bal
ances.Use of Estimates
Our
 consolidated  financial  statements are  prepared  in  accordance  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (GAAP)  as  set  forth  in  the  FinancialAccounting
 Standards  Board’s  (FASB)  Accounting  Standards  Codification  (ASC),  and  we  consider  the  various  staff  accounting bulletins  and  other  applicableguidance
 issued  by  the  SEC.  These  accounting  principles  require  us  to  make  certain  estimates,  judgments  and  assumptions.  We  believe  that  the  estimates,judgments
 and  assumptions  upon  which  we  rely  are  reasonable  based upon  information  available  to  us  at  the  time  that  these  estimates,  judgments  andassumptions
 are  made.  These  estimates,  judgments  and  assumptions  can  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities as  of  the  date  of  the  financialstatements
 as well  as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are differences between theseestimates,
 judgments or assumptions and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected.  In many cases, the accounting treatment of aparticular transaction is specifically dictated by 
GAAP and does not require management’s judgment in its

application. There are also areas
 in which management’s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result.Revenue Recognition
Our sources of revenues include:
 
 
• cloud and license revenues, which include the sale of: cloud services and license support; and cloud license and on-premise licenses,  which representlicenses purchased by customers for use in both cloud and 
on-premise deployments;  
 
• hardware revenues, which include the sale of hardware products including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, and storage  products, and industry-specific hardware; and hardware support revenues; and
 
 
• services revenues, which are earned from providing cloud-, license- and hardware-related services including consulting, advanced customer support and education services.
Revenue Recognition for Cloud Services Offerings, Hardware 
Products, Hardware Support and Related Services (Non-software Elements) Our
 revenue recognition policy for non-software deliverab les including our cloud services offerings, hardware products, hardware support and related services isbased
 upon  the  accounting  guidance  contained  in  ASC 605-25, Revenue
Recognition,
Multiple-Element
Arrangements
,  and  we  exercise  judgment  and  useestimates
 in connection with the determination of the amount of cloud services revenues, hardware products revenues,  hardware support and related servicesrevenues to be recognized in each accounting period.
Revenues
 from the sales of our non-software elements  are recognized when: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) we deliver the products orservices;
 (3) the sale price is fixed or determinable; and (4)  collection is reasonably assured. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because theforegoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are
 subsequently met.Revenues
 for our cloud services offerings sold on a subscription basis are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date the service
 is  made  available  to  customers.  Revenues  for  cloud  services  offerings  sold  on  a  usage  basis  are  generally  recognized  as  the  customer  consumes  theservice, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied.
Revenues
 from  the  sale  of  hardware  products  are  generally  recognized  upon  delivery  of  the  hardware  product  to  the  customer  provided  all  other  revenuerecognition
 criteria are satisfied. Hardware support contracts are entered into at the customer’s option and are recognized ratably over the contractual term ofthe arrangements, which is typically one year, provided al
l other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Revenue

 (Non-software Arrangements)
We enter into arrangements with customers 
that purchase non-software related products and serv ices from us at the same time, or within close proximity of oneanother
 (referred to as non-software multiple-element arrangements).  Each element within a non-software multiple-element  arrangement is accounted for as aseparate
 unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met: the delivered products or services have value  to the customer on a standalone basis; and foran
 arrangement  that  includes  a  general  right  of  return  relative  to  the  delivered  products  or  services,  delivery  or  performance  of  the  undelivered  product  orservice is considered probable and is 
substantia lly controlled by us. We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separatelyby
 us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer. Further, our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general  right of return relative to thedelivered products.

Where
 the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met, the deliverable is combined with the undelivered element(s) and treated as asingle
 unit of accounting for the purposes  of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition. For those units of accounting that includemore
 than one deliverable but are treated as a single unit of accounting, we generally recognize revenues over the contractual  period of the arrangement, or inthe
 case  of  our  cloud  services  offerings,  we  generally  recognize  revenues  over  the  contractual  term  of  the  cloud  services  subscription.  For  the  purposes  ofrevenue
 classification of the elements that are accounted  for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenue to the respective revenue line items within ourconsolidated statements of operations based on a r
ational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of relative selling prices of such elements. For
 our non-software multiple-element  arrangements, we allocate revenue to each element  based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangement’s inception.The
 selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) if available, third-party evidence(TPE)
 if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE are available (a description as to how we determine VSOE, TPE and ESP isprovided
 below). If a tangible hardware product includes software, we determine whether the  tangible hardware product and the software work together todeliver
 the  product’s  essential  functionality  and,  if  so,  the  entire  product  is  treated  as  a non-software deliverable.  The  total  arrangement consideration  isallocated
 to each separate unit of accounting for each of the non-software deliverables  using the relative selling prices of each unit based on the selling pricehierarchy.
 We limit the amount of  revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products orservices or meeting of any specified performance conditions.
When
 possible, we establish VSOE of selling price for deliverables in software and non-software multiple-element  arrangements using the price charged for adeliverable
 when sold separately. TPE is established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements withsimilarly situated customers. 
If  we are unable to determine the selling price because VSOE or TPE does not exist, we determine ESP for the purposes of allocatingthe
 arrangement  by  reviewing  historical  transactions,  including  transactions  whereby  the  deliverable  was  sold  on  a standalone  basis  and  considering  severalother external and internal factors.
Revenue Recognition for Cloud License and 
On-Premise License and License Related Services (Software Elements) The
 basis for our cloud license and on-premise license  revenues and related services revenue recognition is substantially governed by the accounting guidancecontained in ASC 
985-605, Software-Revenue
 Recognition
 . We exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of  cloudlicense and 
on-premise license revenues and related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period. For
 license  arrangements  that  do  not  require  significant  modification  or  customization  of  the  underlying  license,  we recognize  cloud  license  and on-premise license revenues
 when: (1) we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software; (2) we deliver the products; (3) the sale price is
 fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties; and (4) collection is probable. Revenues that are not recognized at the time oflicense sale because the foregoing conditions are not met, are generall
y recognized when those conditions are subsequently met. The
 vast majority of our cloud license and on-premise license  arrangements include license support contracts, which are entered into at the customer’s option.We
 recognize  the  related  fees  ratably  over  the  term  of  the  arrangement,  typically  one year.  License  support  contracts  provide  customers  with  rights  tounspecified
 software  product  upgrades,  maintenance  releases  and  patches  released  during  the  term  of  the  support  period  and  include  internet  access  totechnical
 content, as well as internet  and telephone access to technical support personnel. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of thenet cloud license and

(Software
Arrangements) We often enter into arrangements with customers that purchase cloud licenses and 
on-premise licenses, license support and related services from us at the same time,
 or within close proximity of one another (referred to as software related multiple-element arrangements). For those software related  multiple-elementarrangements, we have applied the residual method to determine the amount of cloud l
icense and on-premise license revenues to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985-605. 
Under  the residual method, if VSOE exists for undelivered elements in a multiple-element arrangement, VSOE of the undelivered elements is deferredwith
 the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration generally  recognized upon delivery of the license. Where VSOE does not exist for the undeliveredelement
 in such arrangement, no revenue is recognized until the earlier of the point in time at which 1) VSOE has been established for such element; or 2) the element that does not have VSOE has been delivered.
Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements—Arrangements with 
Software and Non-software Elements We
 also  enter  into  multiple-element  arrangements  that  may  include  a combination  of  our  various  software  related  and non-software related  products  andservices
 offerings including cloud licenses and on-premise licenses,  license support, cloud  services offerings, hardware products, hardware support, consulting,advanced
 customer support services and education. In such arrangements, we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative sellingprices
 of the software  group of elements as a whole and the non-software group  of elements. We then further allocate consideration within the software groupto
 the  respective  elements  within  that  group  following  the guidance  in  ASC 985-605 and  our  policies  as  described  above.  In  addition,  we  allocate  theconsideration
 within the non-software group  to each respective element within that  group based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangement’s inception asdescribed
 above. After the arrangement consideration has been allocated to the software group of elements and non-software group  of elements, we accountfor each respective element in the arrangement as described above and below.

to
Software
and

 Elements Many
 of  our  cloud  license  and on-premise license  arrangements  include  consulting  implementation  services  sold  separately  under  consulting  engagementcontracts
 and are included as a part of our services business. Consulting revenues from these  arrangements are generally accounted for separately from cloudlicense
 and on-premise license  revenues  because  the  arrangements  qualify  as  services  transactions  as  defined  in  ASC 985-605. The  more  significant  factorsconsidered
 in determining whether the revenues should be accounted for separately include the nature of services (i.e., consideration of whether the servicesare essential to 
the functionality of  the licensed product), degree of risk, availability of services from other vendors, timing of payments and impact of milestonesor acceptance criteria on the realizabilit
y of the license fee. Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed. If
 an  arrangement  contains  multiple  elements  and  does  not  qualify  for  separate  accounting  for the  product  and  service  transactions,  then  cloud  license  andon-premise 
license  revenues and/or hardware products revenues, including the costs of hardware products, are generally recognized together with the services based on contract accounting using either the 
percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method. We
 also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing “fiscal funding” or “termination for convenience” provisions, when  such provisions arerequired by law, to determine the probability of poss
ible

cancellat
ion. We consider multiple factors, including the history with the customer in similar transactions, the “essential use” of the license or hardware productsand
 the planning, budgeting  and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity. If we determine upon execution of these arrangements that thelikelihood
 of  cancellation  is  remote,  we  then  recognize  revenues  for  such  arrangements  once  all  of  the  criteria described  above  have  been  met.  If  such  adetermination
 cannot be made, revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmentalentity for such arrangements.
We assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recogn
ition requirements are met. Our standard payment
 terms  are  net  30  days.  However,  payment  terms  may  vary  based  on  the  country  in  which  the  agreement  is  executed.  We  evaluate non-standard payment
 terms  based  on  whether  we  have  successful collection  history  on  comparable  arrangements  (based  upon  similarity  of  customers,  products,  andarrangement
 economics) and,  if so, generally conclude  such  payment terms are  fixed and  determinable and  thereby  satisfy the  required  criteria for revenue recognition.
While most
 of our arrangements for sales within our businesses include short-term payment terms, we have a standard practice of providing long-term financing to
 creditworthy customers primarily through our financing division. Since fiscal 1989, when our financing division was formed, we have established a history ofcollection,
 without  concessions,  on  these  receivables with  payment  terms  that  generally  extend  up  to  five  years  from  the  contract  date.  Provided  all  otherrevenue
 recognition  criteria  have  been  met,  we  recognize  cloud  license  and on-premise license  revenues  and hardware  products  revenues  for  thesearrangements
 upon  delivery,  net  of  any  payment  discounts  from  financing  transactions.  We  have  generally  sold  receivables  financed  through  our  financingdivision
 on a non-recourse basis  to third-party financing institutions within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution and we classify the proceeds from thesesales as cash flows from operating activities in our 
consolida ted statements of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables as “true sales” as definedin ASC 860, 
Transfers
and
Servicing
 , as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. Our
 customers include several of our suppliers and, occasionally, we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about  thesame
 time that we have sold our products to these same companies (Concurrent Transactions). License agreements, sales of hardware or sales of services thatoccur
 within  a  common  time  period  from  the  date  we  have  purchased  goods  or  services from  that  same  customer  are  reviewed  for  appropriate  accountingtreatment
 and disclosure. When we acquire goods or services from a customer, we negotiate the purchase separately from any sales transaction, at terms weconsider to
 be at arm’s length  and settle the purchase in cash. We recognize revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria aremet and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations.
Business Combinations
We
 apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business
Combinations
,  in accounting for our acquisitions. ASC 805 requires us to recognize separately from goodwill theassets
 acquired  and  the  liabilities  assumed  at  the  acquisition  date  fair  values.  Goodwill  as of the  acquisition  date is  measured as the excess of considerationtransferred ove
r the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions toaccurately
 value  assets  acquired  and liabilities  assumed  at  the  acquisition  date  as  well  as  any  contingent  consideration,  where  applicable,  our  estimates  areinherently
 uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition  date, we recordadjustments
 to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or finaldetermination
 of  the  values  of  assets  acquired  or  liabilities assumed,  whichever  comes  first,  any  subsequent  adjustments  are  recorded  to  our  consolidatedstatements of operations.

Costs
 to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company or our internal operations are accounted  for as termination and exit costs pursuant to ASC420, 
Exit
or
Disposal
Cost
Obligations
,  and are accounted for separately from the business combination. A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposalactivity
 is recognized  and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred. When estimatingthe
 fair value of facility restructuring activities, assumptions are applied regarding estimated sub-lease payments to  be received, which can differ materially fromactual
 results. This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may materially affect our results of operations and financial position in the  period therevision is made.
For
 a  given  acquisition,  we  may  identify  certain pre-acquisition contingencies  as  of  the  acquisition  date  and  may  extend  our  review  and  evaluation  of  thesepre-acquisition 
contingencies  throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether  we include these contingencies asa part of the fair value estim
ates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts.If
 we  cannot  reasonably  determine  the  fair  value  of  a pre-acquisition contingency (non-income tax  related)  by  the  end  of  the  measurement  period,  which  isgenerally the
 case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if:  (1) it is probable that an assetexisted
 or  a  liability  had  been  incurred  at  the  acquisition  date  and  (2)  the  amount  of  the  asset  or  liability  can  be  reasonably estimated.  Subsequent  to  themeasurement
 period,  changes  in  our  estimates  of  such  contingencies  will  affect  earnings  and  could  have  a  material  effect  on  our  results  of  operations  andfinancial position.
In
 addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of  theacquisition
 date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to ourprelimina
ry estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the
 tax allowance’s or contingency’s estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances willaffect
 our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financialposition.
Marketable and 
Non-Marketable Securities In
 accordance with ASC 320, Investments
 — Debt
and
Equity
Securities,
and  based on our intentions regarding these instruments, we classify  substantially all ofour
 marketable debt and equity securities as available-for-sale. Marketable  debt and equity securities classified as available-for-sale are  reported at fair value,with all unrealized gains (losses
) reflected net of tax in stockholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheets, and as a line item in our consolidated statements of
 comprehensive  income.  If  we  determine  that  an  investment  has  an  other  than  temporary  decline  in  fair  value,  we  recognize  the  investment  loss  innon-operating 
income,  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. We periodically evaluate our investments to determine if impairmentcharges
 are required. Substantially all of our marketable debt and equity investments are classified as current  based on the nature of the investments and theiravailability for use 
in current operations.We
 hold investments in certain non-marketable equity  securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence. These equity securitiesare
 recorded at cost and included in other non-current assets  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. If based on the terms of our ownership of thesenon-marketable 
securities,  we  determine  that  we exercise  significant  influence  on  the  entity  to  which  these non-marketable securities  relate,  we  apply  therequirements
 of ASC 323, Investments
 — Equity
Method
and
Joint
Ventures
, to account for such investments .
 Our non-marketable securities  are subject  toperiodic impairment reviews.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments
We
 apply the provisions of ASC 820, Fair 
Value
Measurement
(ASC  820), to our assets and liabilities that we are required to measure at fair value  pursuant toother accounting standards, including our investments in marketable debt and equity securities and our derivative financial instruments.
The additional disclosures regarding our fair value measurements are
 included in Note 4.Allowances for Doubtful Accounts
We
 record allowances for  doubtful accounts  based upon a specific  review of all significant outstanding  invoices. For those invoices not specifically reviewed,provisions
 are provided at differing rates, based upon the age of the receivable, the collection history associated  with the geographic region that the receivablewas
 recorded in and current economic trends. We write-off a  receivable and charge it against its recorded allowance when we have exhausted our collection efforts without success.
Concentrations of Risk
Financial instruments that are
 potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivatives and
 trade receivables. Our cash and cash equivalents are generally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide to reduce the amount of exposure toany single financial institution. Investment policies have been 
implemented that limit purchases of marketab le debt securities to investment-grade securities. Ourderivative
 contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standings and any exposure to counterparty credit-related losses  in thesecontracts
 is largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of these contractsfluctuate
 from  contractually  established  thresholds.  We  generally  do not  require  collateral  to  secure  accounts  receivable.  The  risk  with  respect  to  tradereceivable
s is mitigated by credit evaluations we perform on our customers, the short duration of our payment terms for the significant majority of our customercontracts and by the diversification of our customer base. No single customer 
accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016.We
 outsource the manufacturing, assembly and delivery of certain of our hardware products to a variety of companies, many of which are located outside the United States. Further, we
 have simplified our supply chain processes by reducing the number of third-party manufacturing partners and the number of locationswhere
 these third-party manufacturers build our hardware products. Any inability of these  third-party manufacturing partners to deliver the contracted servicesfor our hardware products could adversely impact future operating results of our hardw
are business.Inventories
Inventories
 are stated at the lower of cost or  net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost, on a first-in, first-out basis.
 We  evaluate  our  ending  inventories  for estimated  excess  quantities  and  obsolescence.  This  evaluation  includes  analysis  of  sales  levels  by  product  andprojections
 of future demand within specific time horizons (generally six to nine months). Inventories in excess of future demand are written  down and chargedto
 hardware expenses. In addition, we assess the impact of changing technology to our inventories and we write down inventories that are considered obsolete.At
 the point of loss recognition, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory  is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in therestoration
 or increase in that newly established cost basis. Inventories are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and totaled $398 million and $300 million at May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Other Receivables
Other receivables represent value-added tax and sales
 tax receivables associated with the sale of our products and services to third parties. Other receivables are included
 in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and totaled $802 million and $794 million at May 31, 2018 and 2017,respectively.
Deferred Sales Commissions
We
 defer sales commission expenses  associated with our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, and recognize the related expenses over the non-cancelable terms of
 the related contracts, which are typically one to three years. The current portion  of the deferred sales commissions balances are included in prepaid expensesand
 other current  assets and the non-current portion  of the deferred  sales commissions  balances are included  in other assets as  of May 31, 2018 and 2017.Amortization of deferred sales commissi
ons is included as a component of sales and marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations.Property, Plant and Equipment
Property,
 plant and equipment  are stated at the lower of cost or realizable value, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line
 method  based  on  estimated  useful  lives  of  the  assets,  which  range  from  one  to  40  years.  Leasehold improvements  are amortized over the lesser of theestimated
 useful  lives  of  the  improvements  or  the  lease  terms,  as  appropriate.  Property,  plant  and  equipment  are  periodically  reviewed  for  impairmentwhenever
 events  or  changes  in  circumstances indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of  an  asset  may  not  be  recoverable.  We  did  not  recognize  any  significantproperty impairment charges in fiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016.
Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessments
Goodwill
 represents  the  excess  of  the  purchase  price  in  a  business  combination  over  the  fair  value  of  net  tangible  and  intangible  assets  acquired. Intangible assets
 that are not considered to have an indefinite useful life are amortized over their useful lives, which generally range from one to 10 years. Each period weevaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible 
assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warran t a revision to the remainingperiods of amortization.
The carrying
 amounts of our goodwil l and intangible assets are periodically reviewed for impairment (at least annually for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibleassets)
 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be  recoverable. When goodwill is assessed forimpairment,
 we  have  the  option  to  perform  an  assessment  of  qualitative  factors  of  impairment  (optional  assessment)  prior  to  necessitating  a  quantitativeimpairment
 test. Should the optional assessment be used  for any given fiscal year, qualitative factors to consider include cost factors; financial performance;legal,
 regulatory,  contractual,  political,  business,  or  other  factors;  entity  specific  factors;  industry  and  market  considerations, macroeconomic  conditions,  andother relevant even
ts and factors affecting the reporting unit. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than itscarrying value,
 a quantitative test is then performed. Otherwise, no  further testing is required. For those reporting units tested using a quantitative approach, wecompare
 the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. To determine the  fair value of each reportingunit
 we utilize estimates, judgments and assumptions including estimated future cash flows the reporting unit is expected to generate on a discounted basis,future
 economic and market conditions, and market comparable  of peer companies, among others. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less thanthe
 carrying amount of the reporting unit, impairment is recognized for the difference, limited to the amount of goodwill recognized for the reporting  unit. Wedid not recognize any goodwill impairment charges in f
iscal 2018, 2017 or 2016.Recoverability

intangible
 assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of anyimpairment
 is  measured  as  the difference  between  the  carrying  value  and  the  fair  value  of  the  impaired  asset.  We  did  not  recognize  any  intangible  assetimpairment charges in fiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016.
Derivative Financial Instruments
During
 fiscal 2018, 2017  and 2016, we used derivative and non-derivative financial  instruments to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks (see Note 10below
 for additional information). We account for these instruments in accordance  with ASC 815, Derivatives 
and
Hedging
(ASC  815), which requires that everyderivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or 
liability measured at its fair value as of the reporting date. ASC 815 also requires that changes
 in our derivatives’ fair values be recognized in earnings, unless specific hedge accounting and documentation criteria are met (i.e., the instruments areaccounted for as hedges).
The
 accounting  for  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  a  derivative  depends  on  the  intended  use  of  the  derivative  and  the  resulting  designation.  For  a derivative instrument
 designated  as  a  fair  value  hedge,  loss  or  gain  attributable  to  the  risk  being  hedged  is  recognized  in  earnings  in  the  period  of  change  with  acorresponding offset
 recorded to the item for which the risk is being hedged. For a derivative  instrument designated as a cash flow hedge, each reporting periodwe record
 the change in fair value on the effective portion of the derivative to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets, and anamount
 is reclassified  out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings to offset the earnings impact that is attributable to the risk being hedged. Forthe 
non-derivative financial instrument that was designated as a net investment hedge for our investments in certain of our internationa l subsidiaries, the changeon
 account of remeasurement of the effective portion for each reporting period was recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our  consolidatedbalance sheets until the
 net investment is sold, at which time the amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to non-operating income, net.
We
 perform  the  effectiveness  testing  of  our  aforementioned  designated  hedges  on  a  quarterly  basis  and  material  changes  in  ineffective  portions  of  thederivatives, if any, are recognized immediately
 in earnings.Legal and Other Contingencies
We
 are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure.
 Descriptions  of  our  accounting  policies  associated  with  contingencies  assumed  as  a  part  of  a  business  combination  are  provided  under  “BusinessCombinations”
 above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of  a business combination or related to income taxes, we accrue a liability for anestimated
 loss  if  the  potential  loss  from  any  claim  or  legal  proceeding  is  considered  probable,  and  the  amount  can  be  reasonably estimated.  Note  17  belowprovides 
additional information regarding certain of our legal contingencies.Shipping and Handling Costs
Our shipping and handling costs for hardware products sales are included in hardware expenses for al
l periods presented.Foreign Currency
We
 transact  business  in  various  foreign currencies.  In  general,  the  functional  currency  of  a  foreign  operation  is  the  local  country’s  currency.  Consequently,revenues
 and expenses of operations outside the United States are translated into U.S. Dollars using weighted-average exchange rates  while assets and liabilitiesof operations outside the United States are transl
ated into U.S. Dollars using exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The

 consolidated balance sheets  and related periodic movements are summarized as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensiveincome.
 Net  foreign  exchange  transaction  losses  included  in non-operating income,  net  in  the accompanying  consolidated  statements  of  operations  were$74 million, $152 million and $110 million in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation
We
 account  for  share-based payments  to  employees,  including  grants  of  service-based  restricted  stock  awards,  performance-based  restricted  stock  awards(PSUs),
 service-based employee stock options, performance-based stock options (PSOs), and purchases under employee stock purchase  plans in accordance withASC
 718, Compensation
 — Stock
Compensation,
which  requires  that  share-based  payments  (to  the  extent  they  are  compensatory)  be  recognized  in  ourconsolidated statements of operations based on their 
fair values. We account for forfeitures of st ock-based awards as they occur.For
 our  service-based  stock  awards,  we  recognize  stock-based compensation  expense  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  service  period  of  the  award,  which  isgenerally four years.
For
 our PSUs and PSOs, we recognize  stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the longer of the derived, explicit or implicit service period(which is
 the period of time expected for the performance condition to be satisfied). During our interim and annual reporting periods, stock-based compensation expense
 is recorded based on expected attainment of performance targets. Changes in our estimates of the expected attainment of performance targets thatresult in a
 change in the number of shares that are  expected to vest, or changes in our estimates of implicit service periods may cause the amount of stock-basedcompensation
 expense that we record for each interim reporting period to vary. Any changes in estimates that impact our expectation  of the number of sharesthat are expected to vest
 are reflected in the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we recognize for each PSU or PSO tranche on a cumulative catchup basis during each interim reporting period in which 
such estimates are alter ed. Changes in estimate of the implicit service period are recognized prospectively.We record deferred tax assets for 
stock-based comp ensation awards that result in deductions on certain of our income tax returns based on the amount of stock-based compensation
 recognized and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with a  business combination at thestatutory ta
x rates in the jurisdictions that we are able to recognize such tax deductions. The impacts of the actual tax deductions for stock-based awards that arerealized
 in these jurisdictions are generally recognized  in the reporting period that a restricted stock-based award vests or a stock option is exercised with anyshortfall/windfall relative to
 the deferred tax asset established recorded as a discrete detriment/benefit to our provision for income taxes in such period. Advertising

advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses, which were included within sales and marketing expenses, were $138 million, $95 millionand $68 million in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

 differences  between  the  tax  bases  of  assets  and  liabilities  for  financial  reporting purposes  and  amounts  recognized  for  income  tax  purposes.  Werecord a valuation allow
ance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized.A 
two-step approach is applied pursuant  to ASC 740 in the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in  a tax return.The
 first  step  is  to  determine  if  the  weight  of  available  evidence  indicates  that  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  the  tax  position  will  be  sustained  in  an  audit,including
 resolution of any related  appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50%likely to
 be realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in  our provision for income taxes line of ourconsolidated statements of operations.
A
 description  of  our  accounting  policies  associated  with  tax related  contingencies  and  valuation  allowances  assumed  as  a  part  of  a  business  combination  isprovided under “Business Combinations” above.

iscal 2019. Topic 606 supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The core principle of Topic 606 is to re
cognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be
 received for those goods or services. Topic 606 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment andestimates
 may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required  under existing GAAP, including identifying performance obligations in thecontract,
 estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performanceobligation,
 among others. Topic 606 also provides guidance on the recognition of costs related to obtaining customer contracts, which will result in additionalcosts that
 will be capitalized. We will adopt the requirements of the new standard as  of June 1, 2018, utilizing the full retrospective method of transition and willadjust
 our consolidated financial statements from amounts previously reported for the fiscal 2018 and 2017 periods. We do not believe there will be a materialimpact
 to our revenues or operating expenses upon adoption of Topic 606. We are continuing to evaluate the impact related to our pending adoption of Topic606 and our preliminary assessments are subject to change.

ACQUISITIONS Fiscal 2018 Acquisitions
Acquisition of Aconex 
Limited On
 March 28, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Aconex Limited (Aconex), a provider of cloud-based collaboration software for  construction projects. Wehave included
 the financial results of Aconex in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. These results were not individually material toour
 consolidated  financial  statements.  The  total preliminary  purchase  price  for  Aconex  was  approximately  $1.2  billion,  which  consisted  of  approximately$1.2
 billion in cash and $1 million for the fair values of stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed. In connection with  the Aconex acquisition, wehave
 preliminarily  recorded  $32  million  of  net  tangible  assets  and  $368  million  of  identifiable  intangible  assets  based  on  their  estimated  fair  values,  and$832
 million  of  residual  goodwill.  Goodwill generated  from  our  acquisition  of  Aconex  was  primarily  attributable  to  synergies  expected  to  arise  after  theacquisition and is not expected to be tax deductible.
Other Fiscal 2018 Acquisitions
During
 fiscal  2018,  we  acquired  certain  other  companies  and  purchased  certain  technology  and  development  assets  primarily  to  expand  our  products  andservices offerings. These acquisitions were not significant individually

 LLC investment entity whose interests are beneficially owned by a trust controlled by Mr. Ellison), which owned approximately 40% of the issued andoutstanding NetSuite Shares 
immediately prior to the conclusion of the merger. The
 total purchase price for NetSuite was approximately $9.1 billion, which consisted of approximately  $9.0 billion in cash and $78 million for the fair values ofrestricted stock-based awards and
 stock options assumed. In allocating the purchase price based on estimated fair values, we recorded approximately $6.7 billionof
 goodwill,  $3.2  billion  of  identifiable  intangible  assets  and  $763  million  of  net  tangible  liabilities.  Goodwill  generated  from  our  acquisition  of  NetSuite  wasprimarily attributable to synergies expected to 
arise after the acquisition and was not tax deductible. Other Fiscal 2017 Acquisitions
During
 fiscal  2017,  we  acquired  certain  companies  and  purchased  certain  technology  and  development  assets  primarily  to  expand  our  products  and  servicesofferings.
 These  acquisitions  were  not  individually  or  in  the  aggregate  significant.  We  have  included  the  financial  results  of  the  acquired  companies  in  ourconsolidated
 financial statements from their respective acquisition dates, and the results from  each of these companies were not individually material to ourconsolidated
 financial statements. In the aggregate, the total purchase price for these acquisitions was approximately $3.0 billion, which consisted of $3.0 billionin
 cash and  $13  million  for  the  fair  values  of  restricted  stock-based  awards  and  stock  options  assumed.  Based  on  their  estimated  fair  values,  we  recorded$243 million of net tangible assets and $948 million of 
identifiable intangible assets and $1.8 billion of residual goodwill re lated to our fiscal 2017 acquisitions.Fiscal 2016 Acquisitions
During
 fiscal  2016,  we  acquired  certain  companies  and  purchased  certain  technology  and  development  assets  primarily  to  expand  our  products  and  servicesofferings. These acquisitions were not significant individually 
or in the aggregate.Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information
The
 unaudited pro forma financial information in the table below summarizes the combined results of operations for Oracle, NetSuite, Aconex and certain other companies

CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES Cash
 and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial  paper and other securities  with original maturities of 90 days orless. Marketable securities consist of 
Tier-1 commercial paper debt securities, corporate debt securities and certain other securities. The
 amortized principal amounts of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities approximated their fair values at May 31, 2018 and 2017. We  use thespecific
 identification method to determine any realized gains or losses from the sale of our marketable securities classified as available-for-sale. Such realized gains
 and  losses  were  insignificant  for  fiscal  2018,  2017  and  2016.  The  following  table  summarizes  the  components  of  our  cash  equivalents  and  marketablesecurities held, substantially all of which were

 mature within one to five years. Our investment portfolio is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. As described above, we limitpurchases
 of marketable debt securities to investment-grade  securities, which have high credit ratings and also limit the amount of credit exposure to any oneissuer. As stated in our investment policy, we are averse
 to principal loss and seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk. Restricted
 cash that was included within cash and cash equivalents as presented within our consolidated balance sheets  as of May 31, 2018 and 2017 and ourconsolidated statements of cash flows for the

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS We
 perform fair value measurements in accordance with ASC 820. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer
 a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assetsand
 liabilities  required  to  be  recorded  at  their  fair  values,  we  consider  the principal  or  most  advantageous  market  in  which  we  would  transact  and  considerassumptions that market participants would use when pricing the assets or l
iabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance.

ASC
 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs  and minimize the use of unobservable inputs whenmeasuring
 fair value. An asset’s or a liability’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fairvalue 
measurement. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fa ir value: 
 
•  Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
 
• Level 2: inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for  similar assets or liabilities,quoted
 prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated byobservable market data for substantially 
the full term of the assets or li abilities; or 
 
•  Level 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values of th e assets or liabilities.Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a
 Recurring BasisOur assets and liabilities measured at fair
 value on a recurring basis, excluding accrued interest components, consisted of the following (Level 1 and Level 2 inputs are defined above):

We  have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have  the economic effects of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with the 2.375% senior notes dueJanuary 2019
 (January 2019 Notes), the 2.25% senior notes due October 2019 (October 2019 Notes), the 2.80% senior notes due July 2021 (July 2021  Notes), and the 6.50% senior notesdue
 April 2038 (April 2038 Notes) so that the interest payable on these notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. The effective interest rates after consideration of these fixedto variable 
interest  rate swap agreements were 3.00% and 1.81%, respectively, for the January 2019 Notes, 2.81% and 1.64%, respectively, for the October 2019 Notes, and 2.96% and1.79%,
 respectively, for the July 2021 Notes as of May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The effective interest rate as of May 31, 2018 after consideration of the fixed to variable interestrate swap agreemen
ts was 5.65% for the April 2038 Notes. Refer to Notes 1 and 10 for a description of our accounting for fair value hedges.

In July 2013, we issued €  2.0 billion of fixed-rate senior notes comprised of €  1.25 billion of 2.25% senior notes due January 2021 (January 2021 Notes) and €  750 million of 3.125% seniornotes
 due July 2025 (July 2025 Notes, and together with the January 2021 Notes, the Euro Notes). Principal and unamortized discount/issuance costs for the Euro Notes in  the tableabove
 were  calculated  using  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  as  of  May  31,  2018  and  May  31,  2017,  respectively.  The  Euro  Notes  are  registered  and  trade  on  the  New  York  StockExchange.
 
(3)
In  connection with the issuance of the January 2021 Notes, we  entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements that have the economic effect of converting our fixed-rate, Euro-denominated debt,
 including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt of  $1.6 billion with a fixed annual interestrate of 3.53% (see Note 10 for additi
onal information). 
(4)
We  designated the July 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of  our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order toreduce
 the volatility in stockholders’ equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect  to the U.S. Dollar in connection with the issuance of theJuly
 2025 Notes. In our fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we de-designated the  2025 Notes as a net investment hedge and entered into certain cross-currency interest rate swap agr eementsthat
 have the economic effect of converting our fixed-rate, Euro-denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a variable-rate, U.S.Dollar-denominated 
debt  of $0.9 billion based on LIBOR. The effective interest rate as of May 31, 2018 after consideration of the cross-currency interest rate swap agreements was5.17% for the July 2025 Notes. Refer to Notes 1 and 10 for 
a description of our accounting for fair v alue hedges.

In  July  2016,  we  issued  $14.0  billion  of  senior  notes for  general  corporate  purposes,  which  may  include  stock  repurchases,  payment  of  cash  dividends  on  our  common  stock  andrepayment
 of indebtedness and future acquisitions. The interest is payable semi-annually. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes  of each series prior to their maturity, subjectto certain restrictions, and the pay
ment of an applicable make-whole premium in certain instances.

In  November 2017, we issued $10.0 billion of senior notes  for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock andrepayment
 of indebtedness and future acquisitions. The interest is payable semi-annually. We may redeem some or all of the senior  notes of each series prior to their maturity, subjectto certain restrictions, and the pay
ment of an applicable make-whole premium in certain instances.Future principal payments (adjusted for the effects of the cross-currency swap agreements associ

In
 May 2018,  we entered into three  revolving  credit agreements  with JPMorgan  Chase Bank, N.A.,  as initial lender  and administrative  agent (the 2018 CreditAgreements)
 and borrowed $2.5 billion pursuant to these agreements. The 2018 Credit Agreements provided us with short-term  borrowings for working capitaland
 other general corporate purposes. Interest for the 2018 Credit Agreements is based on either (1) a LIBOR-based formula or (2) the Base Rate formula, as setforth in the 2018 Credit Agreements. 
The borrowings are due and payable on June 28, 2018, which is the termination date of the 2018 Credit Agreements. In
 May 2017, we borrowed $3.8  billion pursuant to four revolving credit agreements with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as initial lender and administrative agent(the 2017 Credit Agreements). In June 2017, we repaid the $3.8 billion and the 2017 Credit Agreements 
expired pursuant to their terms. In
 May 2016, we borrowed $3.8 billion pursuant to three revolving credit agreements with JPMorgan Chase Bank,  N.A., as initial lender and administrative agent(the 2016 Credit Agreements). In June 2016, we repaid the $3.8 billion and the 2016 Credit Agreements expired pursuant to their terms.

 and certain other lenders (the 2013 Credit Agreement). The 2013 Credit Agreement provided for an unsecured 5-year revolving  credit facility to be used forgeneral
 corporate  purposes  including back-stopping  any  commercial  paper  notes  that  we  may  issue.  In  April  2018,  the  2013  Credit  Agreement  expired.  Noamounts were outstanding as of the expiration date nor

 banks and a new Issuing and Paying Agency Agreement with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A (JP Morgan). Effective on December 22, 2014, Deutsche BankTrust
 Companies Americas  became the Successor Issuing and Paying Agent replacing JP Morgan. Since that time, we have entered into new dealer agreementswith additional banks. As of May 31, 2018 and 2017, we did not have any outstanding commercial paper

specific acceptance
 provisions, time-based license arrangements and license transactions that cannot be separated from undelivered consulting or other services.In
 connection  with  our  acquisitions,  we  have  estimated  the  fair  values  of  the  cloud  services  and  license  support,  and  hardware  obligations,  among others, assumed
 from  our  acquired  companies.  We  generally  have  estimated  the  fair  values  of  these  obligations  assumed  using  a  cost build-up approach.  The  costbuild-up 
approach  determines  fair  value  by  estimating  the  costs  related  to  fulfilling  the  obligations  plus  a  normal  profit  margin.  The  sum  of  the  costs  andoperating
 profit  approximates,  in  theory,  the  amount  that  we  would  be  required  to  pay  a  third  party  to assume  these  acquired  obligations.  Theseaforementioned
 fair value adjustments recorded for obligations assumed from our acquisitions reduced the cloud services and license support and hardwaredeferred
 revenues balances that we recorded as liabilities  from these acquisitions and also reduced the resulting revenues that we recognized or will recognizeover the terms of the acquired obligations during the post-combination periods.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair Value Hedges—Interest Rate Swap
 Agreements and Cross-Currency Interest Rate Swap AgreementsIn
 May 2018, we entered into certain cross-currency interest rate swap agreements to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our July 2025
 Notes  by  effectively  converting  the  fixed-rate,  Euro  denominated  2025  Notes,  including  the  annual  interest  payments  and  the  payment  of  principal  atmaturity,
 to variable-rate, U.S. Dollar denominated debt based on LIBOR. In April 2018,  we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have theeconomic
 effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with our April 2038 Notes so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectivelybecame
 variable based  on LIBOR.  In  July  2014,  we entered  into certain  interest  rate swap agreements  that  have  the  economic  effect  of modifying  the  fixed-interest
 obligations  associated  with  our  October  2019  Notes  and  our  July  2021  Notes  so  that  the  interest  payable on  these  senior  notes  effectively  becamevariable
 based  on  LIBOR.  In  July  2013,  we  entered  into  certain  interest  rate  swap  agreements  that  have  the  economic  effect  of  modifying  the  fixed-interestobligations
 associated with our January 2019 Notes so that  the interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. The criticalterms
 of the swap agreements match the critical terms of the July 2025 Notes, April 2038 Notes, October 2019 Notes, July 2021 Notes and the January  2019Notes that the swap agreements pertain to, including the notional amounts and maturity
 dates.We
 have designated the aforementioned swap  agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for them as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC815.
 These transactions are characterized as fair value hedges for financial accounting purposes because they protect us against changes  in the fair values ofcertain
 of our fixed-rate borrowings due to benchmark interest rate movements. The changes in fair values of these swap agreements are recognized as interestexpense
 in  our  consolidated  statements  of  operations  with  the corresponding  amounts  included  in  other  assets  or  other non-current liabilities  in  ourconsolida
ted balance sheets. The amount of net gain (loss) attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of
 operations with the corresponding amount included in notes payable, non-current. The  periodic interest settlements for the swap agreements for the July2025
 Notes, April  2038 Notes, October 2019 Notes, July 2021 Notes and the January 2019 Notes are recorded as interest expense and are included as a part ofcash flows from operating activities.
We do not use any swap agreements for trading purposes.
Cash 
Flow Hedges — Cross-Currency Swap AgreementsIn
 connection with the issuance of the January 2021 Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency  swap agreements to manage the related foreign currencyexchange
 risk  by  effectively  converting  the  fixed-rate,  Euro-denominated  January  2021  Notes,  including  the  annual  interest  payments  and  the  payment  ofprincipal at

maturity,
 to fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt. The economic effect of the swap agreements was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cash flows in U.S.Dollars associated with the January 
2021 Notes  by fixing the principal amount of the January 2021 Notes at $1.6 billion with a fixed annual interest rate of 3.53%.We
 have designated these cross-currency swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for these  as cash flow hedges pursuant to ASC815.
 The critical terms of the cross-currency swap agreements correspond to the January 2021 Notes including the annual interest payments being hedged, andthe cross-currency swap agreements mature at the 
same time as the January 2021 Notes. We
 used the hypothetical derivative method to measure the effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreements.  The fair values of these cross-currency swapagreements
 are recognized as other assets or other non-current liabilities  in our consolidated balance sheets. The effective portions of the changes in fair values of these cross-currency swap agreements are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consol
idated balance sheets and an amount is reclassifiedout of
 accumulated other comprehensive loss into non-operating income, net  in the same period that the carrying values of the Euro-denominated January 2021Notes are remeasured and the interest expense is recognized. The ineffective portion of the unreal
ized gains and losses on these cross-currency swaps, if any, are recorded
 immediately to non-operating income,  net.  We evaluate the  effectiveness  of our cross-currency  swap agreements  on a quarterly basis. We did not record
 any  ineffectiveness  for  fiscal  2018,  2017  or  2016.  The  cash  flows  related  to  the  cross-currency  swap  agreements  that  pertain  to  the  periodic  interestsettlements are classified as operating activit
ies and the cash flows that pertain to the principal balance are classified as financing activities. We do not use any cross-currency swap agreements for trading purposes.
Net Investment Hedge 
— Foreign Currency BorrowingsIn
 July 2013, we designated our July 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their
 functional  currency  in  order  to  reduce  the  volatility  in  stockholders’  equity  caused  by  the  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  of  the  Euro  withrespect
 to the U.S. Dollar. We used the spot method to measure the effectiveness  of our net investment hedge. Under this method, for each reporting period,the
 change  in  the  carrying  value  of  the  Euro-denominated  July  2025  Notes  due  to  remeasurement  of  the  effective  portion  is  reported  in  accumulated  othercomprehensive
 loss  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheet  and  the  remaining  change  in  the  carrying  value  of  the  ineffective  portion,  if  any,  was  recognized  innon-operating 
income,  net in our consolidated statements  of operations. We evaluated the effectiveness of our net investment hedge at the beginning of everyquarter.
 We did not record any ineffectiveness for fiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we de-designated the  July 2025 Notes as a netinvestment
 hedge, and as noted above, we entered into cross-currency interest rate swap agreements to manage the foreign currency exchange risk associatedwith our July 
2025 Notes by  effectively converting the fixed-rate, Euro denominated debt, including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal atmaturity, to variable-rate, U.S. Do
llar denominated debt.Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as 
HedgesWe
 transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated
 with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so thatincreases or
 decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on  the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks andvolati
lity associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise fromintercompany
 sublicense fees, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions that are generally expected to be cash settled in the near term. Ourforeign
 currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. Our ultimate realized gain  or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will generallydepend on the size and type of

cross-currency
 exposures  that  we  enter  into,  the  currency  exchange  rates  associated  with  these  exposures  and  changes  in  those  rates,  the  net  realized  andunrealized gains or losses on foreign 
currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors. Neither
 do we use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes  nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuantto ASC
 815. Accordingly, we recorded the fair values of these contracts as of the end of each reporting period to our consolidated balance sheets with changes infair
 values  recorded  to  our  consolidated  statements  of  operations.  The  balance  sheet  classification  for  the  fair  values  of  these  forward  contracts  is  prepaidexpenses
 and other current assets for forward contracts in an unrealized gain position and other  current liabilities for forward contracts in an unrealized lossposition.
 The  statement  of  operations  classification  for  changes  in  fair  values  of  these  forward  contracts  is non-operating income,  net, for  both realized andunrealized gains and losses.
The notional amounts of the forward contracts we
 held to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies was $3.4 billion as  of each ofMay
 31, 2018 and 2017 and the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies was$1.4 billion 
as  of each of May 31, 2018 and 2017. The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at May 31, 2018 and 2017.The cash flows related to these foreign currency contract
s are classified as operating activiti es. Net gains or losses related to these forward contracts are includedin 
non-operating income, net. The
 effects of derivative and non-derivative instruments  designated as hedges on certain of our consolidated financial  statements were as follows as of or foreach of the respective periods presented below (amounts presented exclude any income tax effects):

 discussed in Note 8. We have approximately $61 million in facility obligations, net of estimated sublease income and other costs, in accrued restructuring forthese locations in our 
consolidated balance sheet at May 31, 2018. Rent expense was
 $292 million, $273 million and $283 million for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016,  respectively, net of sublease income of approximately $104 million,$87
 million and $45 million for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Certain lease agreements contain renewal options providing for extensions of the lease terms.
Unconditional Obligations
In
 the ordinary  course of business, we enter into certain unconditional purchase obligations with our suppliers, which are agreements that are enforceable andlegally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum

quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisi
ons; and the approximate timing of the payment. We utilize several external manufacturers tomanufacture 
sub-assemblies for  our  hardware  products  and  to  perform  final  assembly  and  testing  of  finished  hardware  products.  We  also  obtain  individualcomponents for our hardware products from a variety of individual suppliers 
based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments are based on our
 forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standardlead-times
 for the particular  part or product and have been included in the amounts below. Routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are notrelated
 to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course  of business are not included in the amountsbelow, as they are generally entered into 
in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way.As of May 31, 2018, our unconditional purchase and certain other obligations were as foll

anage certain risks and exposures.Guarantees
Our
 cloud, license and hardware sales agreements  generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if our products infringe athird
 party’s intellectual property rights. To date, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications  and have not accrued any materialliabilities
 related to such obligations in our consolidated financial statements. Certain of our sales agreements also include provisions indemnifying customersagainst liabilit
ies in the event we breach confidentiality or service  level requirements. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under theseindemnification
 agreements due to our limited and infrequent history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and  circumstances involved in eachparticular agreement.
Our
 Oracle Cloud Services agreements generally include a warranty that the cloud services will  be performed in all material respects as defined in the agreementduring
 the service period. Our license and hardware agreements also generally include a warranty that our products will substantially operate as described in theapplicable 
program documentation for a period  of one year after delivery. We also warrant that services we perform will be provided in a manner consistent withindustry standards for a period of 90 days from performance of
 the services.We
 occasionally are required, for various reasons, to enter into financial guarantees with third parties in the ordinary course of our business  including, amongothers,
 guarantees related to taxes, import licenses and letters of credit on behalf of parties with whom we conduct business. Such agreements have not had amaterial effect on our results of operat
ions, financial position or cash flows.

STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Common Stock Repurchases
Our Board of Directors has 
approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. During fiscal 2018, our Board of Directors approved expansionsof
 our stock repurchase program totaling $24.0 billion. As of May 31, 2018, approximately $17.8 billion remained  available for stock repurchases pursuant to ourstock
 repurchase program. We repurchased 238.0 million shares for $11.5 billion (including 3.8 million shares for $180 million that were repurchased but notsettled), 
85.6  million shares for $3.5  billion and 271.9  million shares for $10.4  billion in fiscal 2018,  2017  and 2016,  respectively, under  the stock repurchaseprogram.
Our
 stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our
 cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economicand
 market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through  open market purchases and pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.
Dividends on Common Stock
During
 fiscal  2018,  2017  and 2016,  our  Board  of  Directors  declared  cash  dividends  of  $0.76,  $0.64  and  $0.60  per  share  of  our  outstanding  common  stock,respectively, which we paid during the same period.
In
 June 2018, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share of our outstanding common stock. The dividend is payable on July 31, 2018
 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 17, 2018. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and paymentdates are subject to the final determination of our Bo
ard of Directors. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS Stock-Based Compensation Plans
Stock Plans
In
 fiscal 2001,  we adopted the 2000  Long-Term Equity Incentive  Plan, which  provides for the issuance of long-term performance  awards, including  restrictedstock-based
 awards, non-qualified stock  options  and  incentive  stock  options,  as  well  as  stock  purchase  rights  and  stock  appreciation  rights,  to  our  eligibleemployees, officers and 
directors who are also employees  or consultants, independent consultants and advisers. 
 
• In fiscal 2011, our stockholders, upon the recommendation of our Board of Directors (the Board), approved the adoption of  the Amended and Restated2000
 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the 2000 Plan), which extended the termination date of the 2000 Plan by 10 years and increased the number ofauthorized shares of stock that may be issued by 388,313,015 shares.
 
 
• In fiscal 2014, our stockholders, upon the recommendation of the Board, approved a further increase in the number of authorized  shares of stock thatmay
 be issued under the 2000 Plan by 305,000,000 shares. Under the terms of the 2000 Plan, long-term full value awards are granted in the form ofrestricted stock
 units (RSUs) and performance stock units (PSUs). For each share  granted as a full value award under the 2000 Plan, an equivalent of 2.5shares is deducted from our pool of shares avai
lable for grant. 
 
• In fiscal 2018, our stockholders, upon the recommendation of the Board, approved a further increase in the number of authorized  shares of stock thatmay be
 issued under the 2000 Plan by 330,000,000 shares, and approved material terms of the performance goals under which PSUs and performance-based stock options (PSOs) could be granted.
As
 of May 31, 2018, the 2000 Plan had 83 million unvested RSUs outstanding, 3 million unvested PSUs outstanding, 69 million PSOs outstanding  and service-based
 stock  options  (SOs)  to  purchase  231  million  shares  of  common  stock  outstanding  of  which  197  million  shares  were  vested.  As  of  May  31,  2018,approximately
 376 million shares of common stock were available  for future awards under the 2000 Plan. To date, we have not issued any stock purchase rightsor stock appreciation rights under the 2000 Plan.
The vesting schedule for all awards grated under the 2000 Plan are established by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. RSUs generall
y require vesting 25%
 annually over four years. The vesting schedule for PSUs currently requires achieving performance targets and providing service over four fiscal years.SOs are granted at not less than fair market value, become exercisable 
generally 25% annual ly over four years under our current practice, and generally expire 10years from the date
 of grant. PSOs granted to four of our executive officers in fiscal 2018 consist of seven numerically equivalent vesting tranches that potentially may vest.
 One tranche vests solely on attainment of a market-based metric. The remaining six tranches require the attainment of both a performance metric anda market capitaliz
ation metric. In each case, the market-based metric, performance metrics and market capit alization metrics may be achieved at any time duringa
 five year performance period, assuming continued employment and service through the date the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors certifiesthat 
performance  has been achieved. The PSOs have contractual lives of eight years in comparison to the typical ten year contractual lives for SOs. For the sixtranches
 of the PSOs with both performance and market conditions, stock-based compensation expense  is to be recognized once each vesting tranche becomesprobable
 of achievement over the longer of the estimated implicit service period or derived service. We have preliminarily estimated service periods for thosetranches
 that have been deemed  probable of achievement to be approximately three to five years. Stock-based compensation for the market-based tranche willbe recognized using the derived service period for the market-based metric achievement, which we have initia
lly estimated to be approximately three ye ars.

In
 fiscal 1993, the Board adopted the 1993 Directors’ Stock Plan (the Directors’ Plan), which  provides for the issuance of RSUs and other stock-based awards,including 
non-qualified stock  options, to non-employee directors.  The Directors’ Plan has from time  to time been amended and restated. Under the terms of theDirectors’
 Plan,  10  million  shares  of  common  stock  are  reserved  for  issuance  (including  a  fiscal  2013  amendment  to  increase  the  number  of  shares  of  ourcommon stock reserved 
for issuance by 2 million shares). In prior years, we granted stock options at not less than fair market value, that vest over four yea rs, andexpire
 no  more  than  10  years  from  the  date  of  grant.  The  Directors’  Plan  was  most  recently amended  on  April  29,  2016  and  permits  the  CompensationCommittee
 of the Board to determine the amount and form of automatic grants of stock awards to each non-employee director  upon first becoming a director and
 thereafter on an annual basis, as well as automatic nondiscretionary grants for chairing certain Board committees, subject to certain stockholder approvedlimitations
 set forth in the Directors’  Plan. As of May 31, 2018, approximately  109,000 unvested RSUs and stock options to purchase approximately 1 millionshares of
 common stock (of which approximately 1 million were vested) were outstanding under the Directors’ Plan. As of May 31, 2018, approximately 1 million shares were available for future stock 
awards under this plan.In
 connection with certain of our acquisitions, we assumed  certain outstanding restricted stock-based awards and stock options under each acquired company’srespective
 stock plans, or we substituted substantially similar awards under the 2000 Plan. These restricted stock-based awards and stock options  assumed orsubstituted
 generally  retain  all  of  the  rights,  terms  and  conditions  of  the  respective  plans  under  which  they  were  originally  granted.  As  of  May  31,  2018,approximately
 3 million shares of restricted stock-based awards and  stock options to purchase 3 million shares of common stock were outstanding under theseplans.
The
 following  table  summarizes  restricted stock-based  award  activity,  including  service  based  awards  and  performance-based  awards,  granted  pursuant  toOracle-based stock plans and stock plans assumed from our acquisiti

 The  unrecognized  compensation  expense  calculated  under  the  fair  value  method  for  shares  expected  to  vest  (unvested shares  net  of expected forfeitures) as of May 31, 2018 wasapproximately
 $375 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.33 years. Approximately 43 million shares outstanding as of May 31, 2018 were not expected to vest.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense and Valuations of St
ock AwardsWe
 estimated the fair values of our restricted stock-based awards that are solely subject to service-based vesting requirements based upon their market values as of the grant dates, discounted for the present values of expected dividends.

The
 fair values of our PSUs were also measured based upon their market values as of their respective grant  dates, discounted for the present values of expecteddividends.
 The  vesting  conditions  and  related  terms  of  our  PSUs  were  communicated  to  each  participating  employee  as  of  their  respective  grant  dates  andincluded
 attainment metrics that were defined,  fixed and based upon consistent U.S. GAAP metrics or internal metrics that are defined, fixed and consistentlydetermined, and
 that require the employee to render service. Therefore, these awards met the performance-based award classification criteria as defined within ASC 718.
We
 estimated the fair values of our stock options that were solely subject to service-based vesting  requirements using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricingmodel,
 which was developed for use in estimating the fair values of stock options. Option valuation models, including the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricingmodel,
 require the input of  assumptions, including stock price volatility. Changes in the input assumptions can affect the fair value estimates and ultimately howmuch
 we recognize as stock-based compensation expense. The fair values of our stock options were estimated at the  grant dates or at the acquisition dates foroptions assumed in a
 business combination. The weighted-average input assumptions used and resulting fair values of our stock options were as follows for fiscal2018, 2017 and 2016:
 
 
   Year Ended May 31,    
       2018            2017            2016      Expected life (in years)
    4.7     4.8     4.8  Risk-free interest rate
    2.0%    1.0%    1.6% Volatility
    22%    23%    24% Dividend yield
    1.5%    1.5%    1.5% Weighted-average fair value per share
   $ 9.34   $ 8.18   $ 8.49 The
 expected life input is based on historical exercise patterns and post-vesting termination behavior, the risk-free interest  rate input is based on U.S. Treasuryinstruments,
 the annualized dividend yield input is based on the per share dividend declared by the Board and the volatility input is calculated based on theimplied volatility of
 our publicly traded options. We
 estimated the fair values of the PSOs issued during fiscal 2018 using a Monte Carlo simulation approach as of the grant date with the following assumptions: risk-free
 interest  rate  of  2.14%,  expected  term  of  7  years,  expected  volatility  of  22.44%  and  dividend  yield  of  1.49%.  Stock-based  compensation  expense  isincluded in the following operating expense line items in our

Tax Benefits from Exercises of St
ock Options and Vesting of Restricted Stock-Based AwardsTotal
 cash received as a result of option exercises was approximately $2.3 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.3 billion for fiscal 2018, 2017 and  2016, respectively. Thetotal
 aggregate intrinsic value of restricted stock-based awards that vested and were issued and stock options that were exercised was $3.0 billion, $2.0 billionand
 $1.0 billion for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016,  respectively. In connection with the vesting and issuance of restricted stock-based awards and stock options thatwere exercised, the tax benefits realized by us were
 $860 million, $614 million and $311 million for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Employee Stock Purchase Plan
We have
 an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Purchase Plan) that allows employees to purchase shares of common stock at a price per share that is 95% of the fair market
 value of Oracle stock as of the end of the semi-annual option period. As of May 31, 2018, 48 million shares were reserved for future issuances under thePurchase Plan. We issued 3 million shares in each of f
iscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, under the Purchase Plan. Defined Contribution and Other Postretirement
 PlansWe
 offer various defined contribution plans for our U.S. and non-U.S. employees.  Total defined contribution plan  expense was $384 million, $366 million and$387
 million for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The number of plan participants in our benefit plans has generally increased in recent years as we havehired additional 
employees and assumed eligible employees from our acquisitions.In
 the  United  States,  regular  employees  can  participate  in  the  Oracle  Corporation 401(k)  Savings  and  Investment  Plan  (Oracle  401(k)  Plan).  Participants  cangenerally
 contribute up to 40% of their eligible compensation on a per-pay-period basis  as defined  by the Oracle 401(k) Plan document or by the section 402(g)limit
 as defined by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). We match a portion of employee contributions, currently 50% up to 6% of compensation each payperiod,
 subject to maximum aggregate  matching amounts. Our contributions to the Oracle 401(k) Plan, net of forfeitures, were $151 million, $157 million and$153 million in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
We
 also  offer non-qualified deferred  compensation  plans  to  certain  employees  whereby  they  may  defer  a  portion of  their  annual  base  and/or  variablecompensation
 until retirement or a date specified by the employee in accordance with the plans. Deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities were eachapproximately
 $555 million as of May 31, 2018 and  were each approximately $487 million as of May 31, 2017 and were presented in other assets and othernon-current 
liabilities in the accompanying consolidated bal ance sheets.We sponsor certain defined benefit pension plans that are offered primarily
 by certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Many of these plans were assumed through our acquisitions
 or  are  required  by  local  regulatory  requirements.  We  may  deposit  funds  for  these  plans  with  insurance  companies,  third-party  trustees,  or  intogovernment-managed
 accounts consistent with local regulatory requirements, as applicable.  Our total defined benefit plan pension expenses were $102 million,$85
 million and $95 million for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The aggregate projected benefit obligation and aggregate net liability (funded status) of our
 defined  benefit  plans  as  of  May  31,  2018  was  $1.1  billion  and  $711  million,  respectively,  and  as  of  May  31,  2017  was  $1.1  billion  and  $712  million,respectively.

INCOME TAXES Our effective tax rates fo
r each of the periods presented are the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax
 rates. In the third quarter of fiscal 2018 the Tax Act was signed into law. The more significant provisions of the Tax Act as applicable to us are described inNote
 1 above under “Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017”.  Our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2018 varied from the 21% U.S. statutory rateimposed by the Tax Act due primarily to the January 1, 2018 effective date of

the Tax
 Act, the impacts of the Tax Act upon adoption, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effectsof
 stock-based compensation and the  U.S. domestic production activity deduction. Prior to the January 1, 2018 effective date of the Tax Act, our provision forincome
 taxes historically differed from the tax computed at the previous U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily  to certain earnings considered asindefinitely
 reinvested in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation and the U.S. domestic

amount
 of temporary differences related to other outside basis temporary differences of investments in foreign subsidiaries upon which United States incometaxes have not been provided was 
approximately $7.9 billion. If  the other outside basis differences were recognized in a taxable transaction, they would generateforeign
 tax  credits  that  would  reduce  the  federal  tax  liability  associated  with  the  foreign  dividend  or  the otherwise  taxable  transaction.  At  May  31,  2018,assuming a
 full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these other outside basis temporary differences wouldbe approximately 
$1.5 billion. Our
 net deferred tax assets were $1.4 billion and $683 million as of May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We believe  that it is more likely than not that the netdeferred
 tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxableincome
 in future  years in appropriate  tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and taxcredit
 carryforwards. The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if  estimates of future taxable incomechange.
The
 valuation  allowance  was  $1.3  billion  and  $1.2  billion  at  each  of  May  31, 2018  and  2017,  respectively.  Substantially  all  of  the  valuation  allowances  as  ofMay
 31, 2018 and 2017 related to tax assets established in purchase accounting. Any subsequent reduction of that portion of the valuation allowance and therecognition
 of  the  associated  tax  benefits  associated  with  our  acquisitions  will  be  recorded  to  our  provision  for  income  taxes  subsequent  to  our  finaldetermination of the valuation all
owance or the conclusion of the measurement period (as defined above), whichever comes first. At
 May  31,  2018,  we  had  federal  net  operating  loss  carryforwards  of  approximately  $806  million,  which  are subject  to  limitation  on  their  utilization.Approximately
 $802 million of these federal net operating  losses expire in various years between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2036.  An immaterial amount of thesefederal
 net operating losses are not currently  subject to expiration dates. We had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.4 billion at May 31,2018, which expire between fiscal 2019
 and fiscal 2036 and are subject to limitations on their utilization. We had total foreign net  operating loss carryforwards ofapproximately
 $1.8 billion at May 31, 2018, which are subject to limitations on their utilization. Approximately $1.8 billion of these foreign net operating lossesare not 
currently  subject to expiration dates. The remainder of the foreign net operating losses, approximately $92 million, expire between fiscal 2019 and fiscal2035.
 We  had  tax  credit  carryforwards  of  approximately  $893  million  at  May  31, 2018,  which  are  subject  to  limitations  on  their  utilization.  Approximately$738
 million  of  these  tax  credit  carryforwards  are  not  currently  subject  to  expiration  dates.  The  remainder  of  the  tax  credit  carryforwards,  approximately$155 million, expire in various years between fisca

As
 of May 31,  2018,  2017  and  2016,  $4.2  billion,  $3.4  billion  and $3.1  billion, respectively,  of unrecognized tax benefits would affect our effective tax rate ifrecognized.
 We  recognized  interest  and  penalties  related  to  uncertain  tax  positions  in  our  provision  for  income  taxes  line  of  our  consolidated  statements  ofoperations 
of  $127 million, $125 million and $26 million during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Interest and penalties accrued as of May 31, 2018 and2017 were $992 million and $885 million, respectively.
Domestically,
 U.S. federal and state taxing authorities are currently examining income tax returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through fiscal 2017.
 Many  issues  are  at  an  advanced  stage  in  the  examination  process,  the  most  significant  of  which  include  the  deductibility  of  certain  royalty  payments,transfer
 pricing, extraterritorial income exemptions, domestic production activity,  foreign tax credits, and research and development credits taken. With all ofthese
 domestic audit issues considered in the aggregate, we believe that it was reasonably possible that, as of May 31, 2018, the gross unrecognized tax benefits related
 to these audits could decrease (whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) in the next 12 months by as much as $665 million ($611 millionnet
 of offsetting tax benefits). Our U.S. federal income tax returns have  been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2007 and we are no longer subject to audit forthose
 periods. Our U.S. state income tax returns, with some exceptions, have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2004, and we are no longer subject to audit for those periods.
Internationally,
 tax authorities for numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions are  also examining returns affecting our unrecognized tax benefits. We believe that it wasreasonably
 possible that, as of May 31, 2018, the gross unrecognized tax benefits, could decrease (whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) by as much
 as  $162  million  ($68  million  net  of  offsetting  tax  benefits)  in  the  next  12  months,  related  primarily  to  transfer  pricing.  With  some  exceptions,  we  aregenerally no longer subject to tax examinati
ons in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal  1997.We
 believe  that  we  have  adequately  provided  under  GAAP for  outcomes  related  to  our  tax  audits.  However,  there  can  be  no  assurances  as  to  the  possibleoutcomes or any
 related financial statement effect thereof. On July 27, 2015, in Altera
Corp.
v.
Commissioner
 , the  U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion related to the treatment
 of  stock-based  compensation  expense  in  an  intercompany  cost-sharing  arrangement.  At  this  time,  the  U.S.  Department  of  the  Treasury  has  notwithdrawn
 the requirement to include stock-based compensation from its regulations.  We have reviewed this case and its impact on Oracle and concluded thatno
 adjustment to the consolidated financial statements is appropriate at this time. We will continue to monitor ongoing developments and potential impacts toour 
consolidated financial statements.We
 are under audit by the IRS and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax and  indirect tax matters and are involved invarious challenges
 and litigation in a number of countries, including, in particular, Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, Spain and the UnitedKingdom,
 where the amounts under controversy  are significant. In some, although not all cases, we have reserved for potential adjustments to our provision forincome
 taxes and accrual of indirect taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax  authorities or final outcomes injudicial
 proceedings,  and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations, agreements or judicial proceedings  will not have a material effect on ourresults
 of operations. If events occur which indicate payment  of these amounts is unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition ofbenefits in
 the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimates of the federal, state, and foreign income tax liabilities and indirect tax liabilities are less than the ult
imate assessment, it could result in a further charge to expense.

available
 that  is  evaluated  regularly  by  the  chief  operating  decision  maker,  or  decision-making  group,  in  deciding  how  to  allocate  resources  and  in  assessingperformance.
 Our chief operating decision  makers (CODMs) are our Chief Executive Officers and Chief Technology Officer. We are organized by line of businessand
 geographically. While our CODMs evaluate results in a number of different ways, the line of business management structure is  the primary basis for whichthe allocation of resources and
 financial results are assessed. The footnote information below presents the financial information provided to our CODMs for theirreview and assists our CODMs with eva
luating the company’s performance and allocating company resources. We have three businesses—cloud and license, hardware and services—each of 
which are comprised of a single operating segment. Our
 cloud  and  license  business  engages  in  the  sale,  marketing  and  delivery  of  our  applications, platform  and  infrastructure  technologies  through  variousdeployment
 models  including  license  support  offerings;  Oracle  Cloud  Services  offerings;  and  cloud  license  and on-premise license  offerings.  License support revenues
 are typically generated through the sale of license support contracts related to cloud license and on-premise licenses  purchased by our customers attheir
 option and are generally recognized as  revenues ratably over the contractual term. Our Oracle Cloud Services offerings deliver certain of our applications,platform
 and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that we host, manage and support  and revenues generallyare recognized over the subscription period. Cloud license and 
on-premise license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses, generally on a
 perpetual basis, to  use our database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud and on-premise IT  environments and are generallyrecognized as revenues when unrestricted access to the license is 
granted, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Our
 hardware  business  provides  Oracle  Engineered  Systems,  servers,  storage, industry-specific  hardware,  operating  systems,  virtualization, management  andother
 hardware-related software to support diverse IT environments. Our hardware business also includes hardware support, which provides customers withsoftware updates 
for the software components t hat are essential to the functionality of the hardware products, such as Oracle Solaris and certain other software,and can include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services.
Our
 services business provides services to customers and partners to help maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications, platform and infrastructure technologies.
We do not track our assets for each business. Consequently, it is not
 practical to show assets by operating segment.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Hewlett-Packard Company Litigation
On
 June 15, 2011, Hewlett-Packard  Company, now Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HP), filed a complaint in the California Superior Court, County of SantaClara
 against  Oracle  Corporation  alleging  numerous  causes  of  action  including  breach  of  contract,  breach  of  the covenant  of  good  faith  and  fair  dealing,defamation,
 intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and violation of the California Unfair Business Practices Act. The complaint allegedthat
 when Oracle announced on March 22 and 23,  2011 that it would no longer develop future versions of its software to run on HP’s Itanium-based servers, itbreached
 a  settlement  agreement  signed  on  September  20,  2010  between  HP  and  Mark  Hurd  (the  Hurd  Settlement  Agreement),  who  is our  Chief  ExecutiveOfficer
 and  was  both  HP’s  former  chief  executive  officer  and  chairman  of  HP’s  board  of  directors.  HP  sought  a  judicial  declaration  of  the  parties’  rights  andobligations under the Hurd Settlement Agreement and 
other equitable and monetary relief. Oracle
 answered the complaint and filed a cross-complaint, which was amended on December 2, 2011. The amended  cross-complaint alleged claims includingviolation of the Lanham Act. Oracle 
alleged that HP had secretly agreed to pay Intel to continue to develop and manufacture the Itanium microprocessor, and hadmisrepresented
 to  customers  that  the Itanium  microprocessor  had  a  long  roadmap,  among  other  claims.  Oracle  sought  equitable  rescission  of  the  HurdSettlement Agreement, and other equitable and monetary relief.
The
 court bifurcated the trial and tried HP’s causes of action for declaratory relief and promissory estoppel without a jury in June 2012. The court  issued a finalstatement
 of decision on August 28, 2012, finding that the Hurd Settlement Agreement required Oracle to continue to develop certain of its software productsfor use on
 HP’s Itanium-based servers and to port such products at no cost to  HP for as long as HP sells those servers (the Phase One Ruling). A jury trial began onMay
 23, 2016. On June 30, 2016, the jury returned a verdict in favor of HP on its claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied  covenant of good faithand fair dealing and

against
 Oracle on its claim for violation of the Lanham Act (the Phase Two Jury Verdict). The jury awarded HP damages in the amount of $3.0 billion, and HP isentitled
 to  post-judgment interest  on  this  award.  On  August  30,  2016,  the  court  denied  HP’s  motion  for pre-judgment interest.  Judgment  was  entered  onOctober 20,
 2016. Oracle posted certain court-mandated surety bonds with  the court in order to proceed with its motion for a new trial and entered into relatedindemnification agreements with each of the surety bond issuing companies. Oracle fi
led a motion for a new trial on November 14, 2016, which was denied.Oracle
 filed  its  notice  of  appeal  on  January  17,  2017,  specifying  that  it  was  appealing  the  trial  court’s  Phase  One  Ruling  and  Phase  Two Jury  Verdict.  OnFebruary
 2,  2017,  HP  filed  a  notice  of  appeal  of  the  trial  court’s  denial  of pre-judgment interest.  No  amounts  have  been  paid  or  recorded  to  our  results  ofoperations
 either prior to or  subsequent to the Phase One Ruling or Phase Two Jury Verdict. We continue to believe that we have meritorious defenses againstHP’s claims, and we in
tend to present these defenses to the appellate court. Among the arguments we expect to make on appeal are the following: the tr ial courtmisapplied
 fundamental  principles  of  contract  law  and  misinterpreted  the  Hurd  Settlement  Agreement,  including  by  disregarding  the  context  of  the  HurdSettlement
 Agreement and the evidence of the parties’  mutual intentions; that HP’s breach of contract claim should fail as a matter of law because HP does notclaim and did not prove that Oracle fai
led to deliver any software under the trial court’s interpretation of the contract; that awarding HP both damages for breach of
 the  Hurd  Settlement  Agreement  and  specific  performance  of  that  agreement  constitutes  an  improper  double  recovery;  and  that  the  damages  award  isexcessive,
 unsupported  by  the  evidence,  and contrary  to  law.  We  cannot  currently  estimate  a  reasonably  possible  range  of  loss  for  this  action  due  to  thecomplexities
 and uncertainty surrounding the appeal process and the nature of the claims. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome  of the appealprocess
 related to this action is uncertain. It is possible that the resolution of this action could have a material impact to our future cash flows and results ofoperations.
Derivative Litigation
On
 May  3,  2017,  a  stockholder derivative  lawsuit  was  filed  in  the  Court  of  Chancery  of  the  State  of  Delaware.  The  derivative  suit  is  brought  by  an  allegedstockholder
 of Oracle, purportedly on Oracle’s behalf, against Oracle, our Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Technology  Officer in his capacities as adirector, officer
 and an alleged controlling stockholder, one of our Chief Executive Officers (who is also a director), three other directors, and Oracle as a nominaldefendant.
 Plaintiff alleges that the defendants  breached their fiduciary duties by causing Oracle to agree to purchase NetSuite Inc. (NetSuite) at an excessiveprice.
 Plaintiff seeks declaratory relief, an order rescinding or reforming the NetSuite transaction, unspecified monetary damages  (including interest), attorneys’fees and costs, and disgorgement of various unspecified profits, fees, compensation, and benefits.
On
 July 18, 2017, a second stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, brought by another alleged stockholder of Oracle,
 purportedly  on  Oracle’s  behalf.  The  suit  is  brought  against  all  current  members  and  one  former  member  of  our  Board  of  Directors,  and  Oracle  as  anominal
 defendant. Plaintiff alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary  duties by causing Oracle to agree to purchase NetSuite at an excessive price.Plaintiff seeks declaratory relief, unspecified monetary
 damages (including interest), and attorneys’ fees and costs.On
 August 9, 2017, the court consolidated the two derivative cases. In a September 7, 2017 order, the court appointed plaintiff’s counsel  in the second case aslead plaintiffs’ couns
el and designated the July 18, 2017 complaint as the operative complaint. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on October 27, 2017, andafter
 briefing and argument, the court denied  this motion on March 19, 2018. The parties stipulated that all of the individual defendants, except for our ChiefTechnology Off
icer and one of our Chief Executive Officers, should be dismissed from this case without prejudice, and on March 28, 2018, the court approved this stipulation. On May 4, 2018, the remaining defendants answered plaintiff’s complaint.

On
 May 4, 2018, the Board of Directors established a Special Litigation Committee (the SLC) to investigate  the allegations in this derivative action. Three outsidedirectors serve on the SLC.
While Oracle continues to evaluate these claims, 
we do not believe this litigati on will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.Other Litigation
We
 are party to various other legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings and
 claims that relate to acquisitions we have completed or to companies we have acquired or are attempting to acquire. While the outcome of these matterscannot
 be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these  matters, individually or in the aggregate, will result in losses that arematerially in excess of 
amounts already recognized, if any.

 The term “fixed charges” means the amounts resulting from the following: (a) our interest expensed, plus (b) our estimate of the interest component ofrent expense.
We do not report any shares of preferred stock outstanding in our consol
