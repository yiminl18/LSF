The Company has an approximate 56% controlling interest in MGM China Holdings Limited (together with its subsidiaries, “MGM China”), which
owns MGM Grand Paradise, S.A. (“MGM Grand Paradise”). MGM Grand Paradise owns and operates MGM Macau and MGM Cotai, two integrated casino,
hotel and entertainment resorts in Macau, as well as the related gaming concession and land concessions.
The Company also owns LeoVegas AB (“LeoVegas”), a consolidated subsidiary that has global online gaming operations headquartered in Sweden and
Malta. Additionally, the Company and its venture partner, Entain plc, each have a 50% ownership interest in BetMGM, LLC (“BetMGM”), an unconsolidated
affiliate, which provides online sports betting and gaming in certain jurisdictions in North America.
Japan. In April 2023, the Japanese government officially certified the Area Development Plan previously submitted by the city/prefecture of Osaka and
the Company’s 50% owned unconsolidated venture.
MGM Grand Paradise gaming concession. Gaming in Macau is currently administered by the Macau Government through concessions awarded to six
different concessionaires. On December 16, 2022, MGM Grand Paradise was awarded a ten-year concession contract to permit the operation of games of
chance or other games in casinos in Macau, which commenced on January 1, 2023. Refer to Note 5 for further discussion of the gaming concession.
Reportable segments. The Company has three reportable segments: Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and MGM China. See Note 12 for
additional information about the Company’s segments.
Impact of COVID-19 - Update. On January 8, 2023, Macau lifted the majority of its COVID-19 pandemic travel and quarantine restrictions with the
exception of overseas visitors travelling from outside of mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan being required to present a negative nucleic acid test or rapid
antigen test result, and on February 6, 2023 all remaining COVID-19 travel restrictions were removed. As of June 30, 2023, all of the Company’s properties
were open and not subject to any COVID-19 related operating restrictions.
NOTE 2 — BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of presentation. As permitted by the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), certain information and footnote
disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) have been
condensed or omitted. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s 2022 annual consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.
In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, which include only normal
recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Company’s interim financial statements. The results for such periods are not necessarily indicative of the
results to be expected for the full year.
7
Principles of consolidation. The Company evaluates entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights to determine if it is
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (“VIE”). The Company consolidates its investment in a VIE when it determines that it is its primary
beneficiary. The Company may change its original assessment of a VIE upon subsequent events such as the modification of contractual arrangements that
affect the characteristics or adequacy of the entity’s equity investments at risk and the disposition of all or a portion of an interest held by the primary
beneficiary. The Company performs this analysis on an ongoing basis.
The Company has a 5% ownership interest in the venture that owns and leases back the real estate assets of Bellagio (the “Bellagio BREIT Venture”).
Bellagio BREIT Venture is a VIE of which the Company is not the primary beneficiary and, accordingly, the Company does not consolidate the venture. The
Company’s maximum exposure to loss in Bellagio BREIT Venture is equal to the carrying value of its investment of $55 million as of June 30, 2023, assuming
no future capital funding requirements, plus the exposure to loss resulting from the Company’s guarantee of the debt of Bellagio BREIT Venture, which
guarantee is immaterial as of June 30, 2023, as further discussed in Note 9.
For entities determined not to be a VIE, the Company consolidates such entities in which the Company owns 100% of the equity. For entities in which
the Company owns less than 100% of the equity interest, the Company consolidates the entity under the voting interest model if it has a controlling financial
interest based upon the terms of the respective entities’ ownership agreements, such as MGM China. For these entities, the Company records a noncontrolling
interest in the consolidated balance sheets and all intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. If the entity does not qualify for
consolidation under the voting interest model and the Company has significant influence over the operating and financial decisions of the entity, the Company
generally accounts for the entity under the equity method, such as BetMGM, which does not qualify for consolidation as the Company has joint control, given
the entity is structured with substantive participating rights whereby both owners participate in the decision making process, which prevents the Company from
exerting a controlling financial interest in such entity, as defined in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810. For entities over which the Company does
not have significant influence, the Company accounts for its equity investment under ASC 321.
Fair value measurements. Fair value measurements affect the Company’s accounting and impairment assessments of its long-lived assets, investments
in unconsolidated affiliates or equity interests, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed in an acquisition, and goodwill and other intangible assets. Fair value
measurements also affect the Company’s accounting for certain of its financial assets and liabilities. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and is measured according to a
hierarchy that includes: Level 1 inputs, such as quoted prices in an active market; Level 2 inputs, which are quoted prices for identical or comparable
instruments or pricing using observable market data; or Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs. The Company used the following inputs in its fair value
measurements:
•Level 1 inputs when measuring its equity investments recorded at fair value;
•Level 2 inputs for its long-term debt fair value disclosures; See Note 6; and
•Level 1 and Level 2 inputs for its debt investments.
Equity investments. Fair value is measured based upon trading prices on the applicable securities exchange for equity investments for which the
Company has elected the fair value option of ASC 825 and equity investments accounted for under ASC 321 that have a readily determinable fair value. The
fair value of these investments was $466 million and $461 million as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and is reflected within “Other
long-term assets, net” on the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses are recorded in “Other, net” in the statements of operations. For the three and six
months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded a net gain on its equity investments of $6 million and $5 million, respectively. For the three and six
months ended June 30, 2022, the Company recorded a net loss on its equity investments of $23 million and $8 million, respectively.
Debt investments. The Company’s investments in debt securities are classified as trading securities and recorded at fair value. Gains and losses are
recorded in “Other, net” in the statements of operations. Debt securities are considered cash equivalents if the criteria for such classification is met or otherwise
classified as short-term investments within “Prepaid expenses and other” since the investment of cash is available for current operations.

Restricted cash. MGM China’s pledged cash of $87 million and $124 million as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, securing the
bank guarantees discussed in Note 9 is restricted in use and classified within “Other long-term assets, net.” Such amounts plus “Cash and cash equivalents” on
the consolidated balance sheets equal “Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash” on the consolidated statements of cash flows as of June 30, 2023 and
December 31, 2022.
Accounts receivable. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the loss reserve on accounts receivable was $129 million and $113 million,
respectively.
Note receivable. In February 2023, the secured note receivable related to the sale of Circus Circus Las Vegas and the adjacent land was repaid, prior to
maturity, for $170 million, which approximated its carrying value on the date of repayment. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of the note receivable
was $167 million and was recorded within “Other long-term assets, net” on the consolidated balance sheets.
Accounts payable. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had accrued $60 million and $80 million, respectively, for purchases of
property and equipment within “Accounts and construction payable” on the consolidated balance sheets.
Revenue recognition. Contract and Contract-Related Liabilities. There may be a difference between the timing of cash receipts from the customer and
the recognition of revenue, resulting in a contract or contract-related liability. The Company generally has three types of liabilities related to contracts with
customers: (1) outstanding chip liability, which represents the amounts owed in exchange for gaming chips held by a customer, (2) loyalty program obligations,
which represents the deferred allocation of revenue relating to loyalty program incentives earned, and (3) customer advances and other, which is primarily
funds deposited by customers before gaming play occurs (“casino front money”) and advance payments on goods and services yet to be provided, such as
advance ticket sales and deposits on rooms and convention space or for unpaid wagers. These liabilities are generally expected to be recognized as revenue
within one year of being purchased, earned, or deposited and are recorded within “Other accrued liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets.
The following table summarizes the activity related to contract and contract-related liabilities:

The January 1, 2023 balances exclude liabilities related to assets held for sale.
Revenue by source. The Company presents the revenue earned disaggregated by the type or nature of the good or service (casino, room, food and
beverage, and entertainment, retail and other) and by relevant geographic region within Note 12.
Leases. The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception or modification of the arrangement. An arrangement is or contains
a lease if there are identified assets and the right to control the use of an identified asset is conveyed for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control
over the use of the identified asset means the lessee has both the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset and the right
to direct the use of the asset.
The Company classifies a lease with terms greater than twelve months as either operating or finance. At commencement, the right-of-use (“ROU”)
assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The initial measurement of
ROU assets also includes any prepaid lease payments and are reduced by any previously accrued deferred rent. When available, such as for the Company’s
triple-net operating leases for which the lessor has provided its implicit rate or provided the assumptions required for the Company to readily determine the rate
implicit in the lease, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments to present value. However, for most of the Company’s leases,
such as its ground subleases and equipment leases, the Company cannot readily determine the implicit rate. Accordingly, the Company uses its incremental
borrowing rate to discount the lease payments for such leases based on the information available at the commencement date. Lease terms include options to
extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that such option will be exercised. The Company’s triple-net operating leases each contain renewal
periods at the Company’s option, each of which are not considered to be reasonably certain of being exercised. Many of the Company’s leases include fixed
rental escalation clauses that are factored into the determination of lease payments. For operating leases, lease expense for minimum lease payments is
recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. For finance leases, the ROU asset depreciates on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the
lease term or useful life of the ROU asset and the lease liability accretes interest based on the interest method using the discount rate determined at lease
commencement. Refer to Note 8 for discussion of leases under which the Company is a lessee.
The Company is a lessor under certain other lease arrangements. Lease revenues earned by the Company from third parties are classified within the line
item corresponding to the type or nature of the tenant’s good or service. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, lease revenues from third-party
tenants include $19 million and $37 million recorded within food and beverage revenue, respectively, and $29 million and $59 million recorded within
entertainment, retail, and other revenue for the same such periods, respectively. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, lease revenues from third-
party tenants include $19 million and $33 million recorded within food and beverage revenue, respectively, and $29 million and $55 million recorded within
entertainment, retail, and other revenue for the same such periods, respectively. Lease revenues from the rental of hotel rooms are recorded as rooms revenues
within the consolidated statements of operations.
Redeemable noncontrolling interest. Certain noncontrolling interest parties have non-voting economic interests in MGM National Harbor which
provide for annual preferred distributions by MGM National Harbor to the noncontrolling interest parties based on a percentage of its annual net gaming
revenue (as defined in the MGM National Harbor operating agreement). Such distributions are accrued each quarter and are paid 90 days after the end of each
fiscal year. The noncontrolling interest parties each have the ability to require MGM National Harbor to purchase all or a portion of their interests for a
purchase price based on a contractually agreed upon formula.
The Company has recorded the interests as “Redeemable noncontrolling interests” in the mezzanine section of the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets and not stockholders’ equity because their redemption is not exclusively in the Company’s control. The interests were initially accounted for at fair
value. Subsequently, the Company recognizes changes in the redemption value as they occur and adjusts the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling
interests to equal the maximum redemption value, provided such amount does not fall below the initial carrying value, at the end of each reporting period. The
Company records any changes caused by such an adjustment in capital in excess of par value. Additionally, the carrying amount of the redeemable
noncontrolling interests is adjusted for accrued annual preferred distributions, with changes caused by such adjustments recorded within net income (loss)
attributable to noncontrolling interests.
During the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, MGM National Harbor purchased $138 million and $21 million of interests from the
noncontrolling interest parties, respectively.
10
Share repurchases. Shares repurchased pursuant to the Company’s share repurchase plans are retired upon purchase. The cost of the repurchases in
excess of the aggregate par value of the shares reduces capital in excess of par value, to the extent available, with any residual cost applied against retained
earnings.
NOTE 3 — ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES
LeoVegas acquisition. On May 2, 2022, the Company commenced a public offer to the shareholders of LeoVegas to tender 100% of the shares at a
price of SEK 61 in cash per share. On September 7, 2022, the Company completed its tender offer and acquired 65% of the outstanding shares of LeoVegas
and, at the completion of an extended acceptance period on September 22, 2022, acquired an additional 2% of outstanding shares, for an aggregate cash tender
price of $370 million. During the tender offer period, the Company had acquired 31% of outstanding shares in open market purchases that had an acquisition-
date fair value of approximately $172 million. As the Company’s previous 31% ownership interest was accounted for at fair value, no gain or loss was recorded
upon consolidation. The remaining outstanding shares, with a fair value of approximately $11 million based upon the tender price, were settled by the
Company in cash in connection with squeeze-out proceedings during the second quarter of 2023. The acquisition provides the Company an opportunity to
create a scaled global online gaming business.
The Company recognized 100% of the assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests of LeoVegas at fair value at the date of the acquisition. The fair
value of the acquired equity interests of LeoVegas was determined by the tender price and equaled $556 million, inclusive of cash settlement of equity awards.
Under the acquisition method, the fair value was allocated to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests. The Company estimated fair
value using level 1 inputs, level 2 inputs, and level 3 inputs. The estimated fair values of the identified intangible assets were determined using methodologies
under the income approach based on significant inputs that were not observable. The intangible assets include trademarks, which is an indefinite-lived
intangible asset, and customer lists and technology, which are finite-lived intangibles that are amortized over each of their estimated useful lives of five years.
Goodwill is primarily attributable to the profitability of LeoVegas in excess of identifiable assets and is not deductible for tax purposes. All of the goodwill was
assigned to Corporate and other.

The Cosmopolitan acquisition. On May 17, 2022, the Company acquired 100% of the equity interests in the entities that own the operations of The
Cosmopolitan for cash consideration of $1.625 billion plus working capital adjustments for a total purchase price of approximately $1.7 billion. The acquisition
expands the Company’s customer base and provides a greater depth of choices and experiences for guests in Las Vegas.
The Company recognized 100% of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities at fair value at the date of the acquisition. Under the acquisition method,
the fair value was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. The Company estimated fair value using level 1 inputs, level 2
inputs, and level 3 inputs. The estimated fair values of the identified intangible assets were determined using methodologies under the income approach based
on significant inputs that were not observable. The intangible assets include trademarks, which is an indefinite-lived intangible asset, and customer lists, which
is amortized over its estimated useful life of seven years. Goodwill, which is deductible for
11
tax purposes, is primarily attributable to the profitability of The Cosmopolitan in excess of identifiable assets as well as expected synergies. All of the goodwill
was assigned to the Las Vegas Strip Resorts segment.

VICI Transaction. Prior to the closing of the VICI Transaction (defined below), MGM Growth Properties LLC (“MGP”) was a consolidated subsidiary
of the Company. Substantially all of its assets were owned by and substantially all of its operations were conducted through MGM Growth Properties
Operating Partnership LP ("MGP OP”). MGP had two classes of common shares: Class A shares and a single Class B share. The Company owned MGP’s Class
B share, through which it held a controlling interest in MGP as it was entitled to an amount of votes representing a majority of the total voting power of MGP’s
shares. The Company and MGP each held MGP OP units representing limited partner interests in MGP OP.
Additionally, the Company had leased the real estate assets of The Mirage, Luxor, New York-New York, Park MGM, Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike
Tunica, MGM Grand Detroit, Beau Rivage, Borgata, Empire City, MGM National Harbor, MGM Northfield Park, and MGM Springfield from MGP OP. The
Company also leased, and continues to lease, the real estate assets of Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas from subsidiaries of a venture that was 50.1%
owned by a subsidiary of MGP OP at the time of the transaction (such venture, the “MGP BREIT Venture”).
On April 29, 2022, VICI Properties Inc. (“VICI”) acquired MGP in a stock-for-stock transaction (such transaction, the “VICI Transaction”). MGP Class
A shareholders received 1.366 shares of newly issued VICI stock in exchange for each MGP Class A share outstanding and the Company received 1.366 units
of VICI OP in exchange for each MGP OP unit held by the Company. The fixed exchange ratio represents an agreed upon price of $43 per share of MGP Class
A share to the five-day volume weighted average price of VICI stock as of the close of business on July 30, 2021. In connection with the exchange, VICI OP
redeemed the majority of the Company’s VICI OP units for cash consideration of $4.4 billion, with the Company retaining an approximate 1% ownership
interest in VICI OP that had a fair value of approximately $375 million. MGP’s Class B share that was held by the Company was cancelled. Accordingly, the
Company no longer held a controlling interest in MGP and deconsolidated MGP upon the closing of the transactions.
12
Further, the Company entered into an amended and restated master lease with VICI as discussed in Note 8. The Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas
lease remained unchanged.
In connection with the transactions, the Company recognized a $2.3 billion gain recorded within “Gain on REIT transactions, net.” The gain reflects the
fair value of consideration received of $4.8 billion plus the carrying amount of noncontrolling interest immediately prior to the transactions of $3.2 billion less
the net carrying value of the assets and liabilities and accumulated comprehensive income derecognized of $5.7 billion.

The Mirage transaction. On December 19, 2022, the Company completed the sale of the operations of The Mirage to an affiliate of Seminole Hard
Rock Entertainment, Inc. (“Hard Rock”) for cash consideration of $1.075 billion, or $1.1 billion, net of purchase price adjustments and transaction costs. At
closing, the master lease between the Company and VICI was amended to remove The Mirage and to reflect a $90 million reduction in annual cash rent.
Gold Strike Tunica. On February 15, 2023, the Company completed the sale of the operations of Gold Strike Tunica to CNE Gaming Holdings, LLC
(“CNE”), a subsidiary of Cherokee Nation Business, for cash consideration of $450 million, or $474 million, net of purchase price adjustments and transaction
costs. At closing, the master lease between the Company and VICI was amended to remove Gold Strike Tunica and to reflect a $40 million reduction in annual
cash rent. The Company recognized a $399 million gain recorded within “Property transactions, net.” The gain reflects the net cash consideration less the net
carrying value of the assets and liabilities derecognized of $75 million.
The operations of Gold Strike Tunica are not classified as discontinued operations because the Company concluded that the sale is not a strategic shift
that has a major effect on the Company’s operations or its financial results and it does not represent a major geographic segment or product line.

MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession and concession. Pursuant to the gaming concession contract that MGM Grand Paradise entered into
with the Macau government, which commenced January 1, 2023, MGM Grand Paradise
15
is required, among other things, to pay a fixed annual premium and an annual variable premium based on the number of gaming tables and machines for the
term of the gaming concession. Additionally, in connection with the expiration of the MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession on December 31, 2022, the
casino areas of MGM Cotai and MGM Macau reverted, free of charge and without any encumbrances, to the Macau government, which became the legal
owner of the reverted gaming assets. Upon the commencement of the gaming concession, the gaming assets were temporarily transferred to MGM Grand
Paradise for the duration of the concession term in return for annual payments determined by square meters of the reverted casino areas.
On January 1, 2023, MGM Grand Paradise recorded an intangible asset, included within “Gaming rights” above, of $226 million for the right to conduct
gaming and operate the reverted gaming equipment and gaming areas and a corresponding liability for the in-substance consideration to be paid over the
concession term for such rights, which is the unconditional obligation of the fixed and variable annual premiums, as well as the payments relating to the use of
the reverted gaming assets. The initial value of the intangible asset and liability were measured as the present value of these payments based upon the approved
number of gaming tables and slot machines, estimates of the Macau average price index, and square meters of the reverted casino areas, each as of January 1,
2023. The current portion of $7 million and noncurrent portion of $212 million of the remaining liability was recorded within “Other accrued liabilities” and
“Other long-term liabilities,” respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2023. The gaming concession intangible asset is being amortized on
a straight-line basis over the ten-year term of the gaming concession contract. The fully amortized gaming subconcession intangible asset was derecognized
upon the expiration of the gaming subconcession and corresponding commencement of the gaming concession contract.

17
pay substantially all costs associated with each property, including real estate taxes, insurance, utilities and routine maintenance (with each lease obligating the
Company to spend a specified percentage of net revenues at the properties on capital expenditures), in addition to the annual cash rent. Each of the leases also
requires the Company to comply with certain financial covenants, which, if not met, would require the Company to maintain cash security or provide one or
more letters of credit in favor of the landlord in an amount equal to 6 months or 1 year of rent, as applicable to the circumstances, under the VICI lease, 1 year
of rent under the Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas lease, the Aria and Vdara lease, and The Cosmopolitan lease, and 2 years of rent under the

and has an initial term of 30 years with two 10-year renewal periods, exercisable at the Company’s option, with a fixed 2% rent escalator for the first 10 years
and, thereafter, an escalator equal to the greater of 2% and the CPI increase during the prior year, subject to a cap of 3% during the 11th through 20th years and
4% thereafter. Annual cash rent payments for the fourth lease year that commenced on December 1, 2022 increased to $260 million as a result of the 2% fixed
annual escalator.

Additionally, the VICI lease provides VICI with a right of first offer with respect to any further gaming development by the Company on the undeveloped land
adjacent to Empire City, which VICI may exercise should the Company elect to sell the property. Annual cash rent payments for the first lease year that
commenced on April 29, 2022 was $860 million. In December 2022, in connection with the sale of the operations of The Mirage, the VICI lease was amended
to remove The Mirage and to reflect a $90 million reduction in annual cash rent, thereby reducing the annual cash rent payments to $770 million. In February

$40 million reduction in annual cash rent, thereby reducing the annual cash rent payments to $730 million. The modification resulted in a reassessment of the
lease classification and remeasurement of the VICI lease, with the lease continuing to be accounted for as an operating lease and $507 million of net operating
lease ROU and $516 million of lease liabilities allocable to Gold Strike Tunica were derecognized (see Note 3). Annual cash rent payments for the second lease
year that commenced on May 1, 2023 increased to $745 million as a result of the 2% fixed annual escalator.

NOTE 9 — COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Litigation. The Company is a party to various legal proceedings, most of which relate to routine matters incidental to its business. Management does not
believe that the outcome of such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Other guarantees. The Company and its subsidiaries are party to various guarantee contracts in the normal course of business, which are generally
supported by letters of credit issued by financial institutions. The Company’s senior credit facility limits the amount of letters of credit that can be issued to
$1.35 billion. At June 30, 2023, $29 million in letters of credit were outstanding under the Company’s senior credit facility. The amount of available
borrowings under the credit facility is reduced by any outstanding letters of credit.
MGM China bank guarantees. In connection with the issuance of the gaming concession in January 2023, bank guarantees were provided to the
government of Macau in the amount of MOP 1 billion (approximately $124 million as of June 30, 2023) to warrant the fulfillment of labor liabilities and of
damages or losses that may result if there is noncompliance with the concession. The guarantees expire 180 days after the end of the concession term. As of
December 31, 2022, MOP 1 billion (approximately $124 million as of December 31, 2022) of the bank guarantees were secured by pledged cash and, in
connection with a release of MOP 300 million of such pledged cash during the six months ended June 30, 2023, MOP 700 million of the bank guarantees
(approximately $87 million as of June 30, 2023) were secured by pledged cash as of June 30, 2023.

interest accrued and unpaid thereon) of the landlords of Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas, which matures in 2032 and has an anticipated repayment
date(1)
20
of March 2030. The terms of the shortfall guarantees provide that after the lenders have exhausted certain remedies to collect on the obligations under the
indebtedness, the Company would then be responsible for any shortfall between the value of the collateral, which is the real estate assets of the applicable
property owned by the landlord, and the debt obligation. The guarantees are accounted for under ASC 460 at fair value; such value is immaterial.

NOTE 13 — RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
MGP. Prior to the closing of the VICI Transaction, the Company leased the real estate assets of The Mirage, Luxor, New York-New York, Park MGM,
Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunica, MGM Grand Detroit, Beau Rivage, Borgata, Empire City, MGM National Harbor, MGM Northfield Park, and MGM
Springfield pursuant to a master lease with MGP.
The annual cash rent payments under the master lease with MGP for the seventh lease year, which commenced on April 1, 2022, increased to
$877 million from $873 million, due to the sixth 2% annual base rent escalator that went into effect on April 1, 2022, as the adjusted net revenue to rent ratio
on which such escalator was contingent was met, which increased annual cash rent by $16 million, partially offset by the percentage rent reset that went into
effect on April 1, 2022, calculated based on the percentage of average actual annual net revenue of the leased properties during the preceding five year period,
which decreased annual cash rent by $12 million.
All intercompany transactions, including transactions under the MGP master lease, have been eliminated in the Company’s consolidation of MGP. The
public ownership of MGP’s Class A shares was recognized as noncontrolling interests in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In April 2022, the Company completed the VICI Transaction, which resulted in the deconsolidation of MGP. Refer to Note 3 for additional information
on the VICI Transaction. As part of the transaction, the Company entered into an amended and restated master lease with VICI. Refer to Note 8 for further
discussion on the master lease with VICI.

consolidated financial statements and notes for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, which were included in our Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 24, 2023. The results of operations for the periods reflected herein are not necessarily indicative of results that
may be expected for future periods. MGM Resorts International together with its subsidiaries may be referred to as “we,” “us” or “our.” MGM China
Holdings Limited together with its subsidiaries is referred to as “MGM China.” MGM Growth Properties LLC together with its subsidiaries is referred to as

Overview of strategic business developments
In February 2023, we completed the sale of the operations of Gold Strike Tunica to CNE for cash consideration of $450 million, or $474 million, net of
purchase price adjustments and transaction costs. At closing, the master lease with VICI was amended to remove Gold Strike Tunica and reflect a $40 million
reduction in annual cash rent. Refer to Note 3 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this transaction.
In April 2023, the Japanese government officially certified the Area Development Plan (“ADP”) previously submitted by the city/prefecture of Osaka,
Japan and our 50% owned venture.
In April 2023, LeoVegas entered into an agreement to acquire the majority ownership of digital gaming developer, Push Gaming Holding Limited. The
transaction is subject to regulatory and customary approvals and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023.
Impact of COVID-19 - Update
On January 8, 2023, Macau lifted the majority of its COVID-19 pandemic travel and quarantine restrictions with the exception of overseas visitors
travelling from outside of mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan being required to present a negative nucleic acid test or rapid antigen test result, and on
February 6, 2023 all remaining COVID-19 travel restrictions were removed. As of June 30, 2023, all of our properties were open and not subject to any
COVID-19 related operating restrictions.
Key Performance Indicators
Key performance indicators related to gaming and hotel revenue are:
•Gaming revenue indicators: table games drop and slot handle (volume indicators); “win” or “hold” percentage, which is not fully controllable by us.
Our normal table games hold percentage at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts is in the range of 25.0% to 35.0% of table games drop for baccarat and 19.0%
to 23.0% for non-baccarat; and
•Hotel revenue indicators (for Las Vegas Strip Resorts) – hotel occupancy (a volume indicator); average daily rate (“ADR,” a price indicator); and
revenue per available room (“RevPAR,” a summary measure of hotel results, combining ADR and occupancy rate). Our calculation of ADR, which is
the average price of occupied rooms per day, includes the impact of complimentary rooms. Complimentary room rates are determined based on
standalone selling price. Because the mix of rooms provided on a complimentary basis, particularly to casino customers, includes a disproportionate
suite component, the composite ADR including complimentary rooms is slightly higher than the ADR for cash rooms, reflecting the higher retail value
of suites.

Net income attributable to MGM Resorts International 200,796 1,783,937 667,603 1,765,921 
Consolidated net revenues increased 21% for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the prior year quarter due primarily to a 418% increase
at MGM China as a result of the removal of travel and entry restrictions in Macau, partially offset by a decrease at our Regional Operations of 3% due
primarily to the disposition of Gold Strike Tunica. Net revenues at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts were flat.
Consolidated operating income decreased 84% for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the prior year quarter. The decrease was due to a
$2.3 billion gain in the prior year quarter related to the VICI Transaction, an increase in rent expense recorded within general and administrative expense for
the VICI and The Cosmopolitan leases, which commenced in April 2022 and May 2022, respectively, partially offset by the increase in net revenues, as
discussed above, and a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $163 million compared to the
prior year quarter, due primarily to the amortization in the prior year quarter related to the MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession, which became fully
amortized as of December 31, 2022, and the deconsolidation of MGP in April 2022.
Consolidated net revenues increased 28% for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the prior year period due primarily to a 230% increase at
MGM China as a result of the removal of travel and entry restrictions in Macau, a 14% increase at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts as the current year period
benefited from the inclusion of a full year of operating results of The Cosmopolitan, which was partially offset by the disposition of The Mirage, and a 1%
increase at our Regional Operations as a result of increases in non-gaming revenues, partially offset by the disposition of Gold Strike Tunica.
Consolidated operating income decreased 56% for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the prior year period. The decrease was due to a
$2.3 billion gain in the prior year period related to the VICI Transaction and an increase in rent expense recorded within general and administrative expense for
the VICI and The Cosmopolitan leases, partially offset by a $399 million gain in the current year period related to the sale of the operations of Gold Strike
Tunica recorded in property transactions, net, the increase in net revenues, as discussed above, and a $248 million decrease in depreciation and amortization
expense. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased compared to the prior year period due to the deconsolidation of MGP in April 2022 and due to the
amortization in the prior year period related to the MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession.

Non-operating Results
Interest Expense
Gross interest expense was $113 million and $137 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $243 million and $333
million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease from the prior year periods is due primarily to a decrease in debt
outstanding as a result of the repayment of the $1.0 billion 7.75% senior notes in March 2022, the derecognition of MGP OP’s senior notes in connection with
the deconsolidation of MGP in April 2022, and the repayment of the $1.25 billion 6% senior notes in March 2023, and the decrease in the debt outstanding
under MGM China’s first revolving credit facility. See Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion on long-term debt and see
“Liquidity and Capital Resources” for discussion on issuances and repayments of long-term debt and other sources and uses of cash.
Other, net
Other, net was income of $24 million and expense of $43 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The change from the
prior year quarter is primarily due to an increase in interest and dividend income of $28 million and a change in the gain/loss on the fair value of equity
instruments of $29 million. Other, net was income of $70 million and expense of $9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The
change from the prior year period is primarily due to an increase in interest and dividend income of $80 million.
Income Taxes
Our effective income tax rate was 13.8% and 22.1% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to 26.1% and 25.3% for
the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively. The effective rate for the(1)
(1)
31
three and six months ended June 30, 2023 was favorably impacted by an increase in Macau income that was offset by expiring net operating losses from prior
years subject to valuation allowances. The effective rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 was driven primarily by tax expense recorded on the
VICI Transaction and was unfavorably impacted by an increase in the valuation allowance for Macau deferred tax assets and by losses in Macau from which
we could not benefit, partially offset by the favorable impact of a decrease in state deferred tax liabilities as a result of the VICI Transaction.
Reportable segment GAAP measure
“Adjusted Property EBITDAR” is our reportable segment GAAP measure, which we utilize as the primary profit measure for our reportable segments
and underlying operating segments. Adjusted Property EBITDAR is a measure defined as earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense),
taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, gain on REIT transactions, net, property transactions, net, rent expense related to triple-
net operating leases and ground leases, income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures, and also excludes corporate expense
and stock compensation expense, which are not allocated to each operating segment, and rent expense related to the master lease with MGP that eliminated in
consolidation. “Adjusted Property EBITDAR margin” is Adjusted Property EBITDAR divided by related segment net revenues.
Non-GAAP measures
“Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR” is Adjusted Property EBITDAR further adjusted to exclude the Adjusted Property EBITDAR of acquired
operating segments from the date of acquisition through the end of the reporting period and to exclude the Adjusted Property EBITDAR of disposed operating
segments from the beginning of the reporting period through the date of disposition. Accordingly, for Las Vegas Strip Resorts, we have excluded the Adjusted
Property EBITDAR of The Cosmopolitan for periods subsequent to its acquisition on May 17, 2022 and of The Mirage for the periods prior to its disposition
on December 19, 2022, as applicable. For Regional Operations, we have excluded the Adjusted Property EBITDAR of Gold Strike Tunica for the periods prior
to its disposition on February 15, 2023, as applicable.
Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR is a non-GAAP measure and is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measures
because management believes this measure is useful in providing meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the results of our operations for operating
segments that were consolidated for the full period presented to assist users of the financial statements in reviewing operating performance over time. Same-
Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR should not be viewed as a measure of overall operating performance, considered in isolation, or as an alternative to our
reportable segment GAAP measure or net income, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, because this measure is not presented on a GAAP basis, and is provided for the limited purposes discussed herein. In addition, Same-Store Adjusted
Property EBITDAR may not be defined in the same manner by all companies and, as a result, may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial
measures of other companies, and such differences may be material. A reconciliation of our reportable segment Adjusted Property EBITDAR GAAP measure
to Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR is included herein.
“Adjusted EBITDAR” is earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-
up expenses, property transactions, net, gain on REIT transactions, net, rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases, and income from
unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures.
Adjusted EBITDAR information is a non-GAAP measure that is a valuation metric, should not be used as an operating metric, and is presented solely as
a supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measures because we believe this measure is widely used by analysts, lenders, financial institutions, and investors
as a principal basis for the valuation of gaming companies. We believe that while items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAR may be recurring in nature and
should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends. Also, we
believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current trends or be indicative of future results. For example, preopening and start-up expenses will be
significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within
the development cycle, as well as the size and scope of the project(s). Property transactions, net includes normal recurring disposals, gains and losses on sales
of assets related to specific assets within our resorts, but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment
charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which may not be comparable period over period. In addition, management excludes
rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases. Management believes excluding rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and
ground leases provides useful information to analysts, lenders, financial institutions, and investors when valuing the Company, as well as comparing the
Company’s results to other gaming companies, without regard to differences in
32
capital structure and leasing arrangements since the operations of other gaming companies may or may not include triple-net operating leases or ground leases.
However, as discussed herein, Adjusted EBITDAR should not be viewed as a measure of overall operating performance, an indicator of our performance,
considered in isolation, or construed as an alternative to operating income or net income, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a
measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles because this measure is
not presented on a GAAP basis and excludes certain expenses, including the rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases, and is
provided for the limited purposes discussed herein. In addition, other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report Adjusted EBITDAR may
calculate Adjusted EBITDAR in a different manner and such differences may be material. We have significant uses of cash flows, including capital
expenditures, interest payments, taxes, real estate triple-net lease and ground lease payments, and debt principal repayments, which are not reflected in
Adjusted EBITDAR. A reconciliation of GAAP net income to Adjusted EBITDAR is included herein.

Guarantor Financial Information
As of June 30, 2023, all of our principal debt arrangements are guaranteed by each of our wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries that guarantee
our senior credit facility. Our principal debt arrangements are not guaranteed by MGM Grand Detroit, MGM National Harbor, Blue Tarp reDevelopment, LLC
(the entity that owns the operations of MGM Springfield), MGM Sports & Interactive Gaming, LLC (the entity that owns our 50% interest in BetMGM), and
each of their respective subsidiaries. Our foreign subsidiaries, including LeoVegas, MGM China, and each of their respective subsidiaries, are also not
guarantors of our principal debt arrangements. In the event that any subsidiary is no longer a guarantor of our credit facility or any of our future capital markets
indebtedness, that subsidiary will be released and relieved of its obligations to guarantee our existing senior notes. The indentures governing the senior notes
further provide that in the event of a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of, or capital stock in a subsidiary guarantor then such subsidiary guarantor will
be released and relieved of any obligations under its subsidiary guarantee.
33
The guarantees provided by the subsidiary guarantors rank senior in right of payment to any future subordinated debt of ours or such subsidiary
guarantors, junior to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt and effectively subordinated to any indebtedness and
other obligations of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes. In addition, the obligations of each subsidiary guarantor under its guarantee is
limited so as not to constitute a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law, which may eliminate the subsidiary guarantor’s obligations or reduce such
obligations to an amount that effectively makes the subsidiary guarantee lack value.
The summarized financial information of us and our guarantor subsidiaries, on a combined basis, is presented below. Assets held for sale and liabilities
related to assets held for sale associated with Gold Strike Tunica are included within current assets and other current liabilities, respectively, within the
summarized financial information as of December 31, 2022.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Flows
Operating activities. Trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income, excluding non-cash charges, but can be affected by
changes in working capital, the timing of significant interest payments, and tax payments or refunds. Cash provided by operating activities was $1.3 billion in
the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to $933 million in the prior year period. The change from the prior year period was due primarily to the increase
in Adjusted Property EBITDAR at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts and MGM China discussed within the Results of Operations section above, a decrease in
working capital primarily related to collection of receivables, and a decrease in cash paid for interest, partially offset by an increase in triple-net lease rent
payments and the change in cash paid (refunded) for taxes, net.
Investing activities. Our investing cash flows can fluctuate significantly from year to year depending on our decisions with respect to strategic capital
investments in new or existing resorts, business acquisitions or dispositions, and the timing of maintenance capital expenditures to maintain the quality of our
resorts. Capital expenditures related to regular investments in our existing resorts can also vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our
public spaces and hotel rooms.
Cash used in investing activities was $59 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to cash provided by investing activities of $2.2 billion
in the prior year period. In the six months ended June 30, 2023, we received $447 million in net cash related to the sale of the operations of Gold Strike Tunica,
received $153 million in cash related to the principal portion of the Circus Circus Las Vegas note receivable that was repaid, made payments of $393 million in
capital expenditures, as further discussed below, contributed $50 million to BetMGM, and made $216 million in net investments in debt securities. In
comparison, in the prior year period we received $4.4 billion in net cash proceeds related to the VICI
34
Transaction, which were partially offset by net cash paid of $1.6 billion to acquire The Cosmopolitan, payments of $237 million in capital expenditures, as
further discussed below, and contributed $150 million to BetMGM.
Capital Expenditures
We made capital expenditures of $393 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023, of which $20 million related to MGM China and is inclusive of
capital expenditures relating to the gaming concession investment. Capital expenditures at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations, and corporate and
other entities of $373 million primarily related to expenditures in information technology, room remodels, and convention center remodels.
We made capital expenditures of $237 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022, of which $16 million related to MGM China. Capital expenditures
at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and corporate entities of $221 million primarily related to expenditures in information technology and
room remodels.
Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities was $3.3 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to $2.5 billion in the prior year
period. In the six months ended June 30, 2023, we had net repayments of debt of $2.0 billion, as further discussed below, distributed $162 million to
noncontrolling interest owners, and repurchased $1.1 billion of our common stock. In comparison, in the prior year period, we had net repayments of debt of
$162 million, as further discussed below, distributed $206 million to noncontrolling interest owners, and repurchased $2.1 billion of our common stock.
Borrowings and Repayments of Long-term Debt
During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we had net repayments of debt of $2.0 billion, which consisted of the repayment of $1.25 billion of
aggregate principal amount of our 6% senior notes due 2023 upon maturity and aggregate net repayments of $758 million on MGM China’s revolving credit
facilities.
During the six months ended June 30, 2022, we had net repayments of debt of $162 million, which consisted of the repayment of $1.0 billion of
aggregate principal amount of our 7.75% senior notes due 2022, net draws of $40 million on MGP OP’s revolving credit facility, and net borrowings of $798
million on MGM China’s first revolving credit facility to fund an increase in share capital of MGM Grand Paradise pursuant to the capital requirements under
the new Macau gaming law and for general corporate purposes.
Dividends, Distributions to Noncontrolling Interest Owners, and Share Repurchases
During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we paid $1.1 billion relating to repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase plans.
See Note 11 for further information on the stock repurchases. In connection with those repurchases, the March 2022 $2.0 billion stock repurchase plan was
completed. In February 2023, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized a $2.0 billion stock repurchase plan. The remaining availability under the
February 2023 $2.0 billion stock repurchase plan was $1.4 billion as of June 30, 2023.
During the six months ended June 30, 2022, we repurchased and retired $2.1 billion of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase plans.
During the six months ended June 30, 2022, we paid dividends of $0.0025 per share in March and June 2022, totaling $2 million and MGP OP paid
$283 million of distributions to its partnership unit holders, of which we received $117 million and MGP received $166 million, which MGP concurrently paid
as a dividend to its Class A shareholders.
Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Anticipated Uses of Cash
We require a certain amount of cash on hand to operate our businesses. In addition to required cash on hand for operations, we utilize corporate cash
management procedures to minimize the amount of cash held on hand or in banks. Funds are swept from the accounts at most of our domestic resorts daily into
central bank accounts, and excess funds are invested overnight or are used to repay amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility. In addition, from time to
time we may use excess funds to repurchase our outstanding debt and equity securities subject to limitations in our revolving credit facility and Delaware law,
as applicable. We have significant outstanding debt, interest payments, rent payments, and contractual obligations in addition to planned capital expenditures
and commitments.
35
On February 8, 2023, we announced that the Board of Directors has determined to suspend the ongoing dividends in light of our current preferred
method of returning value to shareholders through our share repurchase plan. To the extent we determine to reinstate the dividend in the future, determinations
regarding the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions,
including our results of operations, financial condition, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.
As of June 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.8 billion, of which MGM China held $448 million, and we had $6.7 billion in principal
amount of indebtedness, including $708 million outstanding under MGM China’s first revolving credit facility. No amounts were drawn on our revolving credit
facility or MGM China’s second revolving credit facility. In June 2023, MGM China amended each of its first revolving credit facility and its second revolving
credit facility, which extended the maturity date of each facility to May 2026, increased the amount to which MGM China may upsize its second revolving
credit facility, removed the requirement for the MGM China first revolving credit facility to be fully drawn prior to utilizing the MGM China second revolving
credit facility, and extended the financial covenant waivers through December 31, 2024.
As of June 30, 2023, our expected cash interest payments over the next twelve months are approximately $180 million to $190 million, excluding MGM
China, and approximately $395 million to $405 million on a consolidated basis, which includes MGM China.
We are required, as of June 30, 2023, to make annual cash rent payments of $1.7 billion over the next twelve months under triple-net lease agreements,
which triple-net leases are also subject to annual escalators and also require us to pay substantially all costs associated with the lease, including real estate
taxes, ground lease payments, insurance, utilities and routine maintenance, in addition to the annual cash rent. See Note 8 for discussion of our leases and lease
obligations.
We have planned capital expenditures expected over the remainder of 2023 of approximately $450 million to $460 million domestically, which is
inclusive of the capital expenditures required under the triple-net lease agreements, each of which requires us to spend a specified percentage of net revenues at
the respective domestic properties, and an estimate of approximately $50 million to $80 million at MGM China, which is inclusive of the estimated amount of
the gaming concession investment for 2023 that relates to capital projects.
We continue to explore potential development or investment opportunities, such as expanding our global online gaming presence and pursuing a
commercial gaming facility in New York, which may require cash commitments in the future. Additionally, we expect to have cash commitments of $80
million to $100 million over the remainder of 2023 relating to our Japan venture’s planned integrated resort in Osaka for which the amount and timing is
subject to change and will be dependent upon funding of the venture from noncontrolling interests and the timing and amount of financing received by the
venture.
We also expect to continue to repurchase shares pursuant to our share repurchase plans. Subsequent to the quarter ended June 30, 2023, we repurchased
approximately 2 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate amount of $88 million, excluding excise tax. Repurchased shares were retired.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
A complete discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates is included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. There
have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates since year end.
Market Risk
Our primary market exposures are to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity market trading prices.
Interest rate risk. We are subject to interest rate risk associated with our variable rate long-term debt. We attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate
risk by managing the mix of our long-term fixed rate borrowings and short-term borrowings under our bank credit facilities. A change in interest rates generally
does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixed-rate debt instruments. As fixed-rate debt matures, however, and if additional debt is
acquired to fund the debt repayment, future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates. This effect would be realized in the periods
subsequent to the periods when the debt matures.
36
As of June 30, 2023, variable rate borrowings represented approximately 11% of our total borrowings. The following table provides additional
information about our gross long-term debt subject to changes in interest rates:

Variable rate $ 35 $ — $ — $ 708 $ — $ — $ 743 $ 743 
Average interest rate 9.2 % N/A N/A 7.8 % N/A N/A 7.9 %
Foreign currency risk. Our worldwide operations are conducted in multiple foreign currencies, which primarily are the Hong Kong dollar and Macau
pataca, but we report our financial results in U.S. dollars. We manage the foreign currency risk through normal operating activities and, when deemed
appropriate, through the use of derivative instruments. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
MGM China holds U.S. dollar denominated debt, which may cause foreign currency transaction losses. The Macau pataca is pegged to the Hong Kong
dollar and the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar, however, the current peg rates may not remain at the same level and possible changes to the peg
rates may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate thereof. While recent fluctuations in exchange rates have not been significant, potential changes in
policy by governments or fluctuations in the economies of the United States, China, Macau or Hong Kong could cause variability in these exchange rates. As of
June 30, 2023, a 1% adverse change in the exchange rate would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of $28 million.
We hold forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. As of June 30, 2023,
the notional amount of the forward contracts was $316 million with a fair value of ($14 million) and a 10% adverse change in the exchange rate would result in
a foreign currency transaction loss of approximately $32 million.
Equity price risk. We have investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies that are subject to equity price volatility. As of June 30, 2023,
a 10% adverse change in the quoted market prices would result in an impact to earnings of $47 million.

significant financial commitments, including the fixed components of our rent payments, and to make planned expenditures;
•restrictions and limitations in the agreements governing our senior credit facility and other senior indebtedness could significantly affect our ability to
operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity;

foreseeable future or at all;
•all of our domestic gaming facilities are leased and could experience risks associated with leased property, including risks relating to lease termination,
lease extensions, charges and our relationship with the lessor, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results
of operations;

•the potential occurrence of impairments to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets or long-lived assets which could negatively affect future profits;
•the susceptibility of leisure and business travel, especially travel by air, to global geopolitical events, such as terrorist attacks, other acts of violence,
acts of war or hostility or outbreaks of infectious disease (including the COVID-19 pandemic);
•the fact that co-investing in properties or businesses, including our investment in BetMGM, decreases our ability to manage risk;
•the fact that future construction, development, or expansion projects will be subject to significant development and construction risks;
•the fact that our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer, our insurance costs may increase
and we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future;
•the fact that a failure to protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names and adversely affect our business;
•the fact that a significant portion of our labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements;

•the potential failure of future efforts to expand through investments in other businesses and properties or through alliances or acquisitions, or to divest
some of our properties and other assets;

2.    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;
3.    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;
4.    The registrant’s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the
registrant and have:
a)    designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure
that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities,
particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;
b)    designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision,
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;
c)    evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness
of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and
d)    disclosed in this report any change in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant’s most recent fiscal
quarter (the registrant’s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting; and  
5.    The registrant’s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the
registrant’s auditors and the audit committee of registrant’s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):
a)    all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely
to adversely affect the registrant’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and
b)    any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant’s internal control over
financial reporting.
