BUSINESS Overview
eBay
 Inc.  was  formed  as  a  sole  proprietorship  in  September  1995  and  was  incorporated  in  California  in  May  1996.  In  April  1998,  wereincorporated in Delaware, and in S
eptember 1998, we completed the initial public offering of our common stock. Our principal executive offices arelocated
 at 2025 Hamilton Avenue, San Jose, California 95125, and our telephone number is (408) 376-7400. Unless otherwise expressly stated orthe
 context otherwise requires, when we refer to “we,” “our,” “us” or “eBay” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we mean the current Delawarecorporation
 (eBay Inc.) and its California predecessor, as well as all of its consolidated subsidiaries. When we refer to “eBay Inc.” we mean ourMarketplace, StubHub and Classifieds p
latforms.eBay
 Inc. is a global commerce leader, which includes our Marketplace, StubHub and Classifieds platforms. Collectively, we connect millionsof
 buyers  and  sellers  around  the  world.  The  technologies  and  services  that  power  our  platforms  are  designed  to  enable  sellers  worldwide  toorganize and offer their inventory for sale, and buyers to find and purchas
e it, virtually anytime and anywhere. Our Marketplace platforms include ouronline
 marketplace located at www.ebay.com, its localized counterparts and the eBay mobile apps. We believe that these are among the world’slargest
 and most vibrant marketplaces for discovering great value and unique selection. Our StubHub platforms include our online ticket platformlocated
 at  www.stubhub.com,  its  localized  counterparts  and  the  StubHub  mobile  apps.  These  platforms  connect  fans  with  their  favorite  sportingevents,
 shows and artists and enable them to buy and sell millions of tickets whenever and wherever they want. Our Classifieds platforms include acollection
 of brands such as mobile.de, Kijiji, Gumtree, Marktplaats, eBay Kleinanzeigen and others. Offering online classifieds around the world,these platforms help people find whatever they are lo
oking for in their local communities.Our
 platforms  are  accessible  through  a  traditional  online  experience  (e.g.,  desktop  and  laptop  computers),  from  mobile  devices  (e.g.,smartphones
 and tablets) and via our application programming interfaces or APIs (platform access for third party software developers). Our multi-screen
 approach offers downloadable, easy-to-use applications for iOS and Android mobile devices that allow access to ebay.com and some of ourother
 websites and vertical shopping experiences. In addition, our platform is increasingly based on open source technologies that provide industry-standard ways for software developers and merchants to access our APIs, to develop software an
d solutions for commerce.4

Our StrategyDelivering the best choice, the most relevance and the most pow
erful selling platformOur
 strategy is to drive the best choice, the most relevance and the most powerful selling platform for our buyers and sellers. We focus onconnecting buyers and sellers through simp
lified experiences to make it easier for users to list, find and buy items.On
 our Marketplace platform, our strategy is to drive the best choice by attracting and retaining sellers and brands that bring differentiatedinventory
 to eBay and provide our consumers with great selection and value. This includes new, everyday items as well as rare and unique goods,with
 a  majority  of  items  available  with  free  shipping  and  delivery  in  three  business  days  or  less.  To  help  deliver  the  most  relevance,  we  areinnovating new shoppi
ng experiences tailored to each user’s interests, passions and shopping history. Leveraging the foundation of structured data -our
 initiative  to  better  understand,  organize  and  leverage  inventory  on  eBay  -  we  are  delivering  more  personalized,  discovery-based  userexperiences
 and making it easier for customers to find inventory both on and off eBay. We focus on offering the most powerful selling platform forour
 business and consumer sellers by continuing to expand adoption of our Seller Hub product, while adding new capabilities to enable sellers tobuild their businesses and drive profita
ble sales on eBay.The
 eBay brand is one of our most important strategic assets.  In 2017, we activated a new, global brand platform – Fill Your Cart With Color–
 intended to facilitate increased consideration of eBay to drive more traffic and new buyers to our platforms.  As part of this effort, we rolled outlocal
 campaigns in North America, Europe and Australia using multiple channels, including television, digital and social.  This is the first time thecompany
 has adopted a truly global brand approach, and we view this as a long-term initiative that will require on-going investment as the brandevolves.  
As
 one of the world’s largest ticket marketplaces, StubHub connects people through inspiring live experiences. Event-goers can find morethan
 10 million live sports,  music, theater and other events in more than 40 countries on our StubHub platforms,  and can browse, buy and sellanytime,
 anywhere through desktop and mobile devices. We continue to extend StubHub’s reach by focusing on supply expansion, which includesincreasing consumer selling on o
ur site, and broadening StubHub’s international footprint to provide consumers a global major events catalog.A
 world  leader  in  online  classifieds,  eBay  Classifieds  is  designed  to  help  people  list  their  products  and  services,  generally  for  free,  findwhatever they
 are looking for in their local communities and trade at a local level. eBay Classifieds Group’s brands offer both horizontal and verticalexperiences,
 such as motors, real estate and jobs. We offer a personalized classifieds experience and focus on expanding our value proposition byleveraging data and analytics to improve customer relev
ance and growing the classifieds opportunity on mobile.Business model and pricing
On
 our eBay and StubHub platforms, our business model and pricing are designed so that our business is successful primarily when oursellers
 are successful. We make money primarily through fees collected on successfully closed sales. On our Classifieds platform, we monetize ourbusiness primarily through advertising.
The size
 and scale of our platforms are designed to enable our buyers and sellers to leverage our economies of scale and capital investment,for example in sales and marketing, mobile, customer acquisitio
n and customer service.Our offerings for buyers and sellers
We
 provide a number of features for our buyers and sellers that are designed to build trust, make users more comfortable buying and sellingon our platforms and reward our top sellers for their loyalty.
For
 our buyers, we believe that eBay sellers offer some of the best value and deals available for a number of consumer products. This yearwe introduced Price
 Match Guarantee, which allows buyers to feel comfortable knowing that they are getting the best price on the more than 80,000items
 where we match the prices of our competitors in key regions worldwide. We also unveiled eBay Authenticate, in which sellers can have theirluxury
 items, such as high-end handbags, authenticated by eBay, enabling customers to shop for exclusive goods with confidence. Additionally, themajority of our transactions in the U.S., the U.K. and Germany continue to include free shippin
g.5

eBay  Money  Back  Guarantee  covers  most  items  purchased  on  the  eBay  platform  in  a  number  of  countries,  including  the  U.S.,  the  U.K.,Germany
 and Australia, through a qualifying payment method and protects most buyers with respect to items that are not received or are receivedbut
 not as described in the listing. Some purchases, including some vehicles, are not covered. eBay Money Back Guarantee provides coverage forthe
 purchase price of the item, plus original shipping costs, for a limited period of time from the date of delivery and includes a streamlined interfaceto help buyers and sellers navigate the process.
For
 our sellers, eBay’s Top Rated Seller program rewards qualifying sellers with fee discounts and improved search standing for qualifyinglistings
 if they are able to maintain excellent customer service ratings and meet specified criteria for shipping and returns. We believe that sellerswho fulfill these standards help promote our goa
l of maintaining an online marketplace that is safe and hassle-free.We also help our sellers gain adde
d visibility and velocity for their inventory. This year, we began to scale the eBay Promoted Listings product,which
 is designed to enable sellers to increase the visibility of item listings on eBay to have a better chance of selling. We also removed somecompeting third-party product listing ads on the eBay platform in select loc
ations.eBay
 regularly evaluates pricing relative to alternatives in the market in order to remain competitive. In 2017, we implemented a number ofchanges
 to our policies and pricing in an effort to better incent sellers to deliver better buyer experiences. At the same time, we continued to investin more tools and new programs to help grow the overall sel
ler ecosystem.We offer choice to buyers and sellers across a number of dimensions.
For sellers, this includes:
•
Sellers can choose to list their products and services through fixed price listings or an auction-style format on our platforms. The fixedprice
 format on eBay allows buyers and sellers to close transactions at a pre-determined price set by the seller. Sellers also are able tosignal
 that they would be willing to close the transaction at a lower price through the Best Offer feature. Additionally, our auction-styleformat allows a seller to select a minimum price for opening bids.
•
Sellers can list items that are new, refurbished and used, and common and rare on our Marketplace platforms.•
Sellers can use Promoted Listings to improve the visibility of their item listings so that items have a better chance of standing out andselling faster.
•
Sellers can list luxury items, such as high-end handbags, through eBay Authenticate, giving buyers greater confidence in the luxury itemthey are purchasing.
For buyers, this includes:
•
Buyers can search for and purchase items that are new, refurbished and used, and common and rare on our Marketplace platforms, incategories such a Parts and Accessories, Fashion an
d Electronics.•
Buyers can filter searches for items by one-, two- and three-day delivery through eBay Guaranteed Delivery.•
Buyers can have greater confidence in purchasing high-end handbags through eBay Authenticate.•
Buyers  also  can  have  items  shipped  to  them  through  multiple  shipping  options  offered  by  sellers.  For  certain  items  purchased  fromcertain
 retailers, buyers can pick up items they purchased online or through mobile devices in one of the retailer’s physical stores (whichwe refer to as in-store pickup).
Our Impact and Responsibility
For
 more  than two decades,  we have worked to create  a marketplace  that  is inclusive and fair,  fosters  global trade  and empowers  smallbusiness
 entrepreneurship.  By  connecting  buyers  and  sellers  online,  wherever  they  are  in  the  world,  we  aim  to  enable  everyone  to  find  theirpersonal
 version of perfect—and in the process, participate in the global economy and enrich their lives and livelihoods. Through eBay for Charity,we also
 enable our community to give to the causes they care about. We strive to operate in the most environmentally and socially sustainable way,creating a safe, trusted, diverse environment in which our employees, buy
ers, sellers, suppliers and partners can thrive.6

Financial InformationWe
 measure our footprint in our addressable market according to Gross Merchandise Volume (“GMV”). GMV consists of the total value of allsuccessfully
 closed transactions between users on our Marketplace and StubHub platforms during the applicable period, regardless of whether thebuyer and seller actually consummated the transaction.
At
 the end of 2017, our Marketplace and StubHub platforms had more than 170 million active  buyers and over one billion live listings globally.The
 term “active buyer” means, as of any date, all buyers who successfully closed a transaction on our Marketplace and StubHub platforms withinthe previous 12-month period. Buyers may register more than once and, as a result, may have more than one acco
unt.We
 generate  revenue  primarily  from  the  transactions  we  successfully  enable  and  through  marketing  services,  including  classifieds  andadvertisi
ng. The majority of our revenue comes from a take rate on the GMV of transactions closed on our Marketplace and StubHub platforms. Wedefine
 “take  rate”  as  net  transaction  revenues  divided  by  GMV.  In 2017 ,  we  generated $88  billion in  GMV,  of  which  approximately 59% was generated outside the U.S.
For
 additional  financial  information  as  well  as  the  geographic  areas  where  we  conduct  business,  please  see  “Note  6  -  Segments”  to  theconsolidated
 financial statements included in this report. Additionally, please see the information in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” under the caption “Ourinternational
 operations are subject to increased risks, which could harm our business,” which describes risks associated with eBay Inc.’s foreignoperations.
Notable Business Transactions in 2017
We
 regularly  review  and  manage  our  investments  to  ensure  that  they  support  eBay’s  strategic  direction  and  complement  our  disciplinedapproach to
 value creation, profitability and capital allocation.  During the third quarter of 2017, we made a $500 million cash investment in and soldour
 eBay India business to Flipkart. eBay and Flipkart also entered into an exclusive agreement in which they will jointly pursue cross-border tradeopportunities to make eBay’s global i
nventory accessible to more India consumers, while eBay’s millions of active buyers globally will have access toIndian inventory provided by Flipkart.
Competition
We
 encounter vigorous competition in our business from numerous sources. Our users can find, buy, sell and pay for similar items through avariety
 of competing online, mobile and offline channels. These include, but are not limited to, retailers, distributors, liquidators, import and exportcompanies,
 auctioneers,  catalog  and  mail-order  companies,  classifieds,  directories,  search  engines,  commerce  participants  (consumer-to-consumer,
 business-to-consumer and business-to-business), shopping channels and networks. As our product offerings continue to broaden intonew
 categories of items and new commerce formats, we expect to face additional competition from other online, mobile and offline channels forthose new offerings. We compete on the basis of price, product selection and servic
es.For
 more information regarding these risks, see the information in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” under the captions “Substantial and increasinglyintense
 competition  worldwide  in  ecommerce  may  harm  our  business”  and  “We  are  subject  to  regulatory  activity  and  antitrust  litigation  undercompetition laws.”
To compete effectively, we will need to continue to expe
nd significant resources in technology and marketing. These efforts require substantialexpenditures,
 which could reduce our margins and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, operating results and cashflows
 and  reduce  the  market  price  of  our  common  stock  and  outstanding  debt  securities.  Despite  our  efforts  to  preserve  and  expand  the  size,diversity
 and  transaction  activity  of  our  buyers  and  sellers  and  to  enhance  the  user  experience,  we  may  not  be  able  to  effectively  manage  ouroperating expenses, to increase or maintain our reven
ue or to avoid a decline in our consolidated net income or a net loss.Government Regulation
Government
 regulation impacts key aspects of our business. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations that affect the ecommerceindustry
 in many countries where we operate. For more information regarding these risks, see the information in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” under thecaption “Our business is subject to extensive government regul
ation and oversight.”7

SeasonalityWe
 expect transaction activity patterns on our platforms to mirror general consumer buying patterns. Please see the additional information in“Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financ
ial Condition and Results of Operations” under the caption “Seasonality.”Technology
eBay
 Inc.’s platforms utilize a combination of proprietary technologies and services as well as technologies and services provided by others.We
 have developed intuitive user interfaces, buyer and seller tools and transaction processing, database and network applications that help enableour
 users to reliably and securely complete transactions on our sites. Our technology infrastructure simplifies the storage and processing of largeamounts
 of data, eases the deployment and operation of large-scale global products and services and automates much of the administration oflarge-scale
 clusters of computers. Our infrastructure has been designed around industry-standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event ofoutages
 or catastrophic occurrences. We strive to continually improve our technology to enhance the buyer and seller experience and to increaseefficiency,
 scalability  and  security.  Additionally,  we  recently  embarked  on  a  multi-year  evolution  of  our  shopping  platform  that  aims  to  deliverrelevant,
 persistent and personalized experiences for consumers. For information regarding technology-related risks, see the information in “Item1A:
 Risk  Factors”  under  the  caption  “Systems  failures  or  cyberattacks  and  resulting  interruptions  in  the  availability  of  or  degradation  in  theperformance of our websites, applications, products or services could h
arm our business.”Intellectual Property
We
 regard  the  protection  of  our  intellectual  property,  including  our  trademarks  (particularly  those  covering  the  eBay  name),  patents,copyrights, domain names, trade dress and trade secrets as critical to our success. We aggressively protect our intellectu
al property rights by relyingon federal, state and common
 law rights in the U.S. and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on contractualrestrictions
 to protect our proprietary rights in products and services. We routinely enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreementswith
 our employees and contractors and nondisclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business to limit access to and disclosure ofour proprietary information.
We
 pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and internationally. Additionally, we have filedU.S.
 and  international  patent  applications  covering  certain  aspects  of  our  proprietary  technology.  Effective  trademark,  copyright,  patent,  domainname,
 trade dress and trade secret protection is typically expensive to maintain and may require litigation. We must protect our intellectual propertyrights
 and  other  proprietary  rights  in  an  increasing  number  of  jurisdictions,  a  process  that  is  expensive  and  time  consuming  and  may  not  besuccessful.
We have
 registered our core brands as trademarks and domain names in the U.S. and a large number of other jurisdictions and have in placean
 active program to continue to secure trademarks and domain names that correspond to our brands in markets of interest. If we are unable toregister
 or protect our trademarks or domain names, we could be adversely affected in any jurisdiction in which our trademarks or domain namesare
 not  registered  or  protected.  We  have  licensed  in  the  past,  and  expect  to  license  in  the  future,  certain  of  our  proprietary  rights,  such  astrademarks or copyrighted material, to others.
From time
 to time, third parties have claimed - and others will likely claim in the future - that we have infringed their intellectual property rights.We
 are typically involved in a number of such legal proceedings at any time. Please see the information in “Item 3: Legal Proceedings” and in “Item1A:
 Risk  Factors”  under  the  captions  “We  are  subject  to  patent  litigation,”  “The  listing  or  sale  by  our  users  of  items  that  allegedly  infringe  theintellectual
 property rights of rights owners, including pirated or counterfeit items, may harm our business,” and “We may be unable to adequatelyprotect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or third parties may allege that we are infringin
g their intellectual property rights.”Employees
As
 of December  31, 2017 ,  we employed approximately 14,100 people globally. Approximately 7,300 of our employees were located in theU.S.

Item 1A: RISK FACTORS You
 should carefully review the following discussion of the risks that may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, aswell
 as  our  consolidated  financial  statements  and  notes  thereto  and  the  other  information  appearing  in  this  report,  for  important  informationregarding risks that affect us.
Risk Factors That May Affect our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Our
 operating and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition,results of operations and cash flows, as well as the trading price of our common stock and d
ebt securities.Our operating and financial results have varied
 on a quarterly basis during our operating history and may continue to fluctuate significantly as aresult
 of a variety of factors, including as a result of the risks set forth in this “Risk Factors” section. It is difficult for us to forecast the level or sourceof
 our revenues or earnings (loss) accurately. In view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business, period-to-period comparisons of our operatingresults may not be meaningful, and you should not rely up
on them as an indication of future performance. We do not have backlog, and substantiallyall of our net
 revenues each quarter come from transactions involving sales during that quarter. Due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues,it is
 also difficult to forecast expenses as a percentage of net revenues. Quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of net revenues reflected inour
 consolidated financial statements may be significantly different from historical or projected rates. Our operating results in one or more futurequarters
 may  fall  below  the  expectations  of  securities  analysts  and  investors.  The  trading  price  of  our  common  stock  and  debt  securities  coulddecline, perhaps substantially, as a result of the factors described i
n this paragraph.Substantial and increasing
ly intense competition worldwide in ecommerce may harm our business.The
 businesses and markets in which we operate are intensely competitive. We currently and potentially compete with a wide variety of onlineand
 offline companies providing goods and services to consumers and merchants. The Internet and mobile networks provide new, rapidly evolvingand
 intensely competitive channels for the sale of all types of goods and services. We compete in two-sided markets, and must attract both buyersand
 sellers to use our platforms. Consumers who purchase or sell goods and services through us have more and more alternatives, and merchantshave
 more channels to reach consumers. We expect competition to continue to intensify. Online and offline businesses increasingly are competingwith
 each other and our competitors include a number of online and offline retailers with significant resources, large user communities and well-established
 brands.  Moreover,  the  barriers  to  entry  into  these  channels  can  be  low,  and  businesses  easily  can  launch  online  sites  or  mobileplatforms
 and applications at nominal cost by using commercially available software or partnering with any of a number of successful ecommercecompanies.
 As we respond to changes in the competitive environment, we may, from time to time, make pricing, service or marketing decisions oracquisitions
 that  may  be  controversial  with  and  lead  to  dissatisfaction  among  sellers,  which  could  reduce  activity  on  our  platform  and  harm  ourprofitability.
We
 face  increased  competitive  pressure  online  and  offline.  In  particular,  the  competitive  norm  for,  and  the  expected  level  of  service  from,ecommerce
 and  mobile  commerce  has  significantly  increased,  due  to,  among  other  factors,  improved  user  experience,  greater  ease  of  buyinggoods,
 lower (or no) shipping costs, faster shipping times and more favorable return policies. Also, certain platform businesses, such as Alibaba,Amazon,
 Apple, Facebook and Google, many of whom are larger than us or have greater capitalization, have a dominant and secure position inother industries or certain significant markets
, and offer other goods and services to consumers and merchants that we do not offer. If we are unableto
 change  our  products,  offerings  and  services  in  ways  that  reflect  the  changing  demands  of  ecommerce  and  mobile  commerce  marketplaces,particular
ly the higher growth of sales of fixed-price items and higher expected service levels (some of which depend on services provided by sellerson our platforms), or compete effectively with and adapt to changes in larger platform business
es, our business will suffer.Competitors
 with other revenue sources may also be able to devote more resources to marketing and promotional campaigns, adopt moreaggressive
 pricing policies and devote more resources to website, mobile platforms and applications and systems development than we can. Othercompetitors
 may  offer  or  continue  to  offer  faster  and/or  free  shipping,  delivery  on  Sunday,  same-day  delivery,  favorable  return  policies  or  othertransaction-related
 services which improve the user experience on their sites and which could be impractical or inefficient for our sellers to match.Competitors
 may  be  able  to  innovate  faster  and  more  efficiently,  and  new  technologies  may  increase  the  competitive  pressures  by  enablingcompetitors to offer more efficient or lower-cost services.
10

Some  of  our  competitors  control  other  products  and  services  that  are  important  to  our  success,  including  credit  card  interchange,  Internetsearch, and mobile operating systems.
 Such competitors could manipulate pricing, availability, terms or operation of service related to their productsand services in a manner that impacts our
 competitive offerings. For example, Google, which operates a shopping platform service, has from time totime
 made changes to its search algorithms that reduced the amount of search traffic directed to us from searches on Google. If we are unable touse
 or adapt to operational changes in such services, we may face higher costs for such services, face integration or technological barriers or losecustomers, which could cause our business to suffer.
Consumers
 who might use our sites to buy goods have a wide variety of alternatives, including traditional department, warehouse, boutique,discount and
 general merchandise stores (as well as the online and mobile operations of these traditional retailers), online retailers and their relatedmobile
 offerings,  online and offline  classified  services  and other  shopping channels,  such  as offline  and online home  shopping networks.  In  theUnited
 States,  these include Amazon.com,  Facebook, Google, Wal-Mart,  Target,  Macy’s,  JC Penney, Costco, Office  Depot, Staples, OfficeMax,Sam’s
 Club, Rakuten, MSN, QVC and Home Shopping Network, among others. In addition, consumers have a large number of online and offlinechannels focused on one or more of the categories of products offered on our site.
Consumers
 also can turn to many companies that offer a variety of services that provide other channels for buyers to find and buy items fromsellers
 of all sizes, including social media, online aggregation and classifieds platforms, such as craigslist, Oodle.com and a number of internationalwebsites
 operated by Schibsted ASA or Naspers Limited. Consumers also can turn to shopping-comparison sites, such as Google Shopping. Incertain
 markets,  our  fixed-price  listing  and  traditional  auction-style  listing  formats  increasingly  are  being  challenged  by  other  formats,  such  asclassifieds.
Our
 Classifieds platforms offer classifieds listings in the United States and a variety of international markets. In many markets in which theyoperate,
 our Classifieds platforms compete for customers and for advertisers against more established online and offline classifieds platforms orother competing websites.
We
 use product search engines and paid search advertising to help users find our sites, but these services also have the potential to divertusers
 to  other  online  shopping  destinations.  Consumers  may  choose  to  search  for  products  and  services  with  a  horizontal  search  engine  orshopping
 comparison  website,  and  such  sites  may  also  send  users  to  other  shopping  destinations.  In  addition,  sellers  are  increasingly  utilizingmultiple
 sales channels, including the acquisition of new customers by paying for search-related advertisements on horizontal search engine sites,such as Google, Naver and Baidu.
Consumers
 and merchants who might use our sites to sell goods also have many alternatives, including general ecommerce sites, such asAmazon,
 Alibaba  and  11Street,  and  more  specialized  sites,  such  as  Etsy.  Our  international  sites  also  compete  for  sellers  with  general  andspecialized
 ecommerce sites. Sellers may also choose to sell their goods through other channels, such as classifieds platforms. Consumers andmerchants
 also can create and sell through their own sites, and may choose to purchase online advertising instead of using our services. In somecountries,
 there  are  online  sites  that  have  larger  customer  bases  and  greater  brand  recognition,  as  well  as  competitors  that  may  have  a  betterunderstanding
 of  local  culture  and  commerce.  We  increasingly  may  compete  with  local  competitors  in  developing  countries  that  have  uniqueadvantages, such as a greater ability to operate under loc
al regulatory authorities.In
 addition, certain manufacturers may limit or cease distribution of their products through online channels, such as our sites. Manufacturersmay
 attempt to use contractual obligations or existing or future government regulation to prohibit or limit ecommerce in certain categories of goodsor
 services. Manufacturers may also attempt to enforce minimum resale price maintenance or minimum advertised price arrangements to preventdistributors
 from selling on our platforms or on the Internet generally, or at prices that would make us less attractive relative to other alternatives.The adoption by
 manufacturers of policies, or their use of laws or regulations, in each case discouraging or restricting the sales of goods or servicesover
 the Internet, could force our users to stop selling certain products on our platforms, which could result in reduced operating margins, loss ofmarket share and diminished value of our brands.
11

The principal competitive factors for us include the following:    
•
ability to attract, retain and engage buyers and sellers;•
volume of transactions and price and selection of goods;•
trust in the seller and the transaction;•
customer service;•
brand recognition;    •
community cohesion, interaction and size;•
website, mobile platform and application ease-of-use and accessibility;•
system reliability and security;•
reliability of delivery and payment, including customer preference for fast delivery and free shipping and returns;•
level of service fees; and•
quality of search tools.We
 may  be  unable  to  compete  successfully  against  current  and  future  competitors.  Some  current  and  potential  competitors  have  longeroperating histories, larger customer bases and greater brand recog
nition in other business and Internet sectors than we do.Global and regional econ
omic conditions could harm our business.Our
 operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Adverse economic conditions and events(including
 volatility or distress in the equity and/or debt or credit markets) have in the past negatively impacted regional and global financial marketsand
 will likely continue to do so from time to time in the future. These events and conditions, including uncertainties and instability in economic andmarket
 conditions caused by the United Kingdom’s vote to exit the European Union, could have a negative and adverse impact on companies andcustomers with which we do business or cause us to write down o
ur assets or investments. In addition, financial turmoil affecting the banking systemor
 financial markets could cause additional consolidation of the financial services industry, or significant financial service institution failures, new orincremental
 tightening  in  the  credit  markets,  low  liquidity,  and  extreme  volatility  in  fixed  income,  credit,  currency,  and  equity  markets.  Adverseimpacts
 to the companies and customers with which we do business, the banking system, or financial markets could have a material adverse effecton our business, including a reducti
on in the volume and prices of transactions on our commerce platforms.We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchang
e rates.Because we
 generate the majority of our revenues outside the United States but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, our financial resultsare
 impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, or foreign exchange rates. The results of operations of many of our internationallyfocused
 platforms are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of the applicable subsidiaries are translated from thelocal currency
 into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. If the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreigncurrency
 denominated revenues or expenses will result in increased U.S. dollar denominated revenues and expenses. Similarly, if the U.S. dollarstrengthens
 against  foreign  currencies,  particularly  the  euro,  British  pound,  Korean  won  or  Australian  dollar,  our  translation  of  foreign  currencydenominated
 revenues or expenses will result in lower U.S. dollar denominated net revenues and expenses. In addition to this translation effect, astrengthen
ing U.S. dollar will typically adversely affect the volume of goods being sold by U.S. sellers to Europe and Australia more than it positivelyaffects
 the  volume of goods being sold by sellers  in those geographies to  buyers  in the United  States,  thereby  further  negatively  impacting  ourfinancial results.
While
 from time to time we enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation exposure, it is impossible to predict oreliminate
 the  effects  of  this  exposure.  Fluctuations  in  foreign  exchange  rates  could  significantly  impact  our  financial  results,  which  may  have  asignificant impact on the trading price of our common stock and debt securities.
12

Our international operations are subject to increased risks, which could harm our business.Our
 international businesses, especially in the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia and Korea, and cross-border business from greater China,have
 generated a majority of our net revenues in recent years. In addition to uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from our foreignoperations and expand into intern
ational markets, there are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:•
uncertainties and instability in economic and market conditions caused by the United Kingdom’s vote to exit the European Union;•
uncertainty regarding how the United Kingdom’s access to the European Union Single Market and the wider trading, legal, regulatory andlabor
 environments,  especially  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  European  Union,  will  be  impacted  by  the  United  Kingdom’s  vote  to  exit  theEuropean Union, includ
ing the resulting impact on our business and that of our clients;•
expenses  associated  with  localizing  our  products  and  services  and  customer  data,  including  offering  customers  the  ability  to  transactbusiness
 in the local currency and adapting our products and services to local preferences (e.g., payment methods) with which we mayhave limited or no experience;
•
trade barriers and changes in trade regulations;•
difficulties  in  developing,  staffing,  and  simultaneously  managing  a  large  number  of  varying  foreign  operations  as  a  result  of  distance,language, and cultural differences;
•
stringent local labor laws and regulations;•
credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;•
profit  repatriation  restrictions,  foreign  currency  exchange  restrictions  or  extreme  fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  for  aparticular currency;
•
political or social unrest, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues;•
geopolitical events, including natural disasters, public health issues, acts of war, and terrorism;•
import or export regulations;•
compliance with U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials,as well as U.S. and foreign laws design
ed to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities;•
antitrust and competition regulations;•
potentially adverse tax developments and consequences;•
economic uncertainties relating to sovereign and other debt;•
different, uncertain, or more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy, and other laws;•
risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local laws;•
national or regional differences in macroeconomic growth rates;•
local licensing and reporting obligations; and•
increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable. 
Violations
 of the complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines, criminal actions,or
 sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Although wehave
 implemented  policies  and  procedures  designed  to  promote  compliance  with  these  laws,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  our  employees,contractors,
 or agents will not violate our policies. These risks inherent in our international operations and expansion increase our costs of doingbusiness internationally an
d could harm our business.Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business.
Cross-border
 trade  is  an  important  source  of  both  revenue  and  profits  for  us.  Cross-border  trade  also  represents  our  primary  (or  in  somecases,
 only) presence in certain important markets, such as Brazil/Latin America, China, and various other countries. In addition, our cross-bordertrade is also subject to, and may be impacted by, foreign exchange rate fluctuati
ons.The interpretation and applicatio
n of specific national or regional laws, such as those related to intellectual property rights of authentic products,selective
 distribution networks, and sellers in other countries listing items on the Internet, and the potential interpretation and application of laws ofmultiple
 jurisdictions (e.g., the jurisdiction of the buyer, the seller, and/or the location of the item being sold) are often extremely complicated in thecontext
 of cross-border trade. The interpretation and/or application of such laws could impose restrictions on, or increase the costs of, purchasing,selling, shipping, or returning goo
ds across national borders.13

  The shipping of goods across nation
al borders is often more expensive and complicated than domestic shipping. Customs and duty proceduresand
 reviews, including duty-free thresholds in various key markets, the interaction of national postal systems, and security related governmentalprocesses
 at international borders, may increase costs, discourage cross-border purchases, delay transit and create shipping uncertainties. Anyfactors
 that  increase  the  costs  of  cross-border  trade  or  restrict,  delay,  or  make  cross-border  trade  more  difficult  or  impractical  would  lower  ourrevenues and profits and could harm our business.
Our
 business may be adversely affected by geopolitical events, natural disasters, seasonal factors and other factors that cause our users tospend less time on our websites or mobile platforms and app
lications, including increased usage of other websites.Our
 users  may  spend  less  time  on  our  websites  and  our  applications  for  mobile  devices  as  a  result  of  a  variety  of  diversions,  including:geopolitical
 events, such as war, the threat of war, or terrorist activity; natural disasters; power shortages or outages, major public health issues,including
 pandemics; social networking or other entertainment websites or mobile applications; significant local, national or global events capturingthe
 attention of a large part of the population; and seasonal fluctuations due to a variety of factors. If any of these, or any other factors, divert ourusers from using of our websites or mobile applications, our busi
ness could be materially adversely affected.Our success depends to a large degree on our abil
ity to successfully address the rapidly evolving market for transactions on mobile devices.Mobile
 devices are increasingly used for ecommerce transactions. A significant and growing portion of our users access our platforms throughmobile devices. We may lose users if we are not able to continue to meet our users’ mobil
e and multi-screen experience expectations. The variety oftechnical
 and  other  configurations  across  different  mobile  devices  and  platforms  increases  the  challenges  associated  with  this  environment.  Inaddition,
 a  number  of  other  companies  with  significant  resources  and  a  number  of  innovative  startups  have  introduced  products  and  servicesfocusing on mobile markets.
Our
 ability  to  successfully  address  the  challenges  posed  by  the  rapidly  evolving  market  for  mobile  transactions  is  crucial  to  our  continuedsuccess, and any failure to continuously increas
e the volume of mobile transactions effected through our platforms could harm our business.If
 we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative programs, products and services, the use of ourproducts and our
 revenues could decline.Rapid,
 significant technological changes continue to confront the industries in which we operate. We cannot predict the effect of technologicalchanges on our business. In additio
n to our own initiatives and innovations, we rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors, for thedevelopm
ent of and access to new technologies. We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate willcontinue to
 emerge. These new services and technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our productsand
 services. Incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures and take considerable time, andultimately
 may not be successful. In addition, our ability to adopt new services and develop new technologies may be inhibited by industry-widestandards,
 new laws and regulations, resistance to change from clients or merchants, or third parties’ intellectual property rights. Our success willdepend on our ability to develo
p new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards.Our business is subject to extensive government regulatio
n and oversight.We
 are  subject  to  laws  and  regulations  affecting  our  domestic  and  international  operations  in  a  number  of  areas,  including  consumerprotection,
 data privacy requirements, intellectual property ownership and infringement, prohibited items and stolen goods, resale of event tickets,tax,
 anti-competition, export requirements, anti-corruption, labor, advertising, digital content, real estate, billing, ecommerce, promotions, quality ofservices, telecommun
ications, mobile communications and media, environmental, and health and safety regulations, as well as laws and regulationsintended to combat money laundering a
nd the financing of terrorist activities.14

Compliance with these laws, regulations, and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and variances and inconsistencies fromjurisdict
ion to jurisdiction may further increase the cost of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result ofchanges in
 these laws and regulations or in their interpretation, could individually or in the aggregate make our products and services less attractiveto
 our customers, delay the introduction of new products or services in one or more regions, or cause us to change or limit our business practices.We
 have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurancethat our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and reg
ulations or our policies and procedures.  Regulation in the areas of privacy and protectio
n of user data could harm our business.We
 are subject to laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security, and transfer of personally identifiable information about our usersaround
 the  world.  Much  of  the  personal  information  that  we  collect,  especially  financial  information,  is  regulated  by  multiple  laws.  User  dataprotection
 laws  may  be  interpreted  and  applied  inconsistently  from  country  to  country.  In  many  cases,  these  laws  apply  not  only  to  third-partytransactions,
 but also to transfers of information between or among ourselves, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercialrelations. These laws continue to devel
op in ways we cannot predict and that may harm our business.Regulat
ory scrutiny of privacy, user data protection, use of data and data collection is increasing on a global basis. We are subject to a numberof
 privacy and similar laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate and these laws and regulations will likely continue to evolve overtime,
 both through regulatory and legislative action and judicial decisions. Some of these laws impose requirements that are inconsistent with oneanother,
 yet regulators may claim that both apply. Complying with these varying national requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs orrequire
 us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business and violations of privacy-related  laws can result in significantpenalties.
 In addition, compliance with these laws may restrict our ability to provide services to our customers that they may find to be valuable. Adetermination
 that  there  have been violations  of  laws relating  to  our practices  under  communications-based  laws could expose  us to  significantdamage
 awards, fines and other penalties that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business. In particular, because of theenormous number of texts, emails and other communications we send to our users, communications l
aws that provide a specified monetary damageaward or fine for each violation (such as those described b
elow) could result in particularly large awards or fines.For
 example, the Federal Communications Commission amended certain of its regulations under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, orTCPA,
 in 2012 and 2013 in a manner that could increase our exposure to liability for certain types of telephonic communication with customers,including but not limited to text messages to mobile pho
nes. Under the TCPA, plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of $500per violation, whichever is greater, and
 courts may treble the damage award for willful or knowing violations. We are regularly subject to class-actionlawsuits,
 as well as individual lawsuits, containing allegations that our businesses violated the TCPA. These lawsuits, and other private lawsuits notcurrently
 alleged as class actions, seek damages (including statutory damages) and injunctive relief, among other remedies. Given the enormousnumber
 of  communications  we send to  our  users,  a determination  that  there  have been violations  of  the  TCPA or  other  communications-basedstatutes could expose us to significant damage aw
ards that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business.We post
 on our websites our privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of user data. Any failure, or perceivedfailure,
 by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any regulatory requirements or orders or other federal, state or international privacyor
 consumer protection-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others (e.g., classaction
 privacy litigation), subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase our costsand adversely affect our business. Data collectio
n, privacy and security have become the subject of increasing public concern. If Internet and mobileusers
 were  to  reduce  their  use  of  our  websites,  mobile  platforms,  products,  and  services  as  a  result  of  these  concerns,  our  business  could  beharmed. As noted above, we are also subject to the possibi
lity of security breaches, which themselves may result in a violation of these laws.15

Other laws and regulations could harm our business.It
 is  not  always  clear  how  laws  and  regulations  governing  matters  relevant  to  our  business,  such  as  property  ownership,  copyrights,trademarks,
 and other intellectual property issues, parallel imports and distribution controls, taxation, libel and defamation, and obscenity apply toour
 businesses.  Many  of  these  laws were  adopted  prior  to  the  advent  of  the  Internet,  mobile,  and related  technologies  and,  as a result,  do notcontemplate
 or address the unique issues of the Internet and related technologies. Many of these laws, including some of those that do referencethe
 Internet are subject to interpretation by the courts on an ongoing basis and the resulting uncertainty in the scope and application of these lawsand
 regulations  increases  the  risk  that  we  will  be  subject  to  private  claims  and  governmental  actions  alleging  violations  of  those  laws  andregulations.
As
 our activities, the products and services we offer, and our geographical scope continue to expand, regulatory agencies or courts may claimor
 hold  that  we  or  our  users  are  subject  to  additional  requirements  (including  licensure)  or  prohibited  from  conducting  our  business  in  theirjurisdiction,
 either generally or with respect to certain actions. Financial and political events have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on largecompanies,
 and  regulatory  agencies  may  view  matters  or  interpret  laws  and  regulations  differently  than  they  have  in  the  past  and  in  a  manneradverse
 to  our  businesses.  Our  success  and  increased  visibility  have  driven  some  existing  businesses  that  perceive  us  to  be  a  threat  to  theirbusinesses
 to  raise  concerns  about  our  business  models  to  policymakers  and  regulators.  These  businesses  and  their  trade  association  groupsemploy
 significant resources in their efforts to shape the legal and regulatory regimes in countries where we have significant operations. They mayemploy
 these resources in an effort to change the legal and regulatory regimes in ways intended to reduce the effectiveness of our businesses andthe
 ability  of  users  to  use  our  products  and  services.  These  established  businesses  have  raised  concerns  relating  to  pricing,  parallel  imports,professional
 seller obligations, selective distribution networks, stolen goods, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights and theliability
 of  the  provider  of  an  Internet  marketplace  for  the  conduct  of  its  users  related  to  those  and  other  issues.  Any  changes  to  the  legal  orregulatory regimes in a manner that would increase our li
ability for third-party listings could negatively impact our business.Numerous
 U.S.  states  and  foreign  jurisdictions,  including  the  State  of  California,  have  regulations  regarding  “auctions”  and  the  handling  ofproperty
 by “secondhand dealers” or “pawnbrokers.” Several states and some foreign jurisdictions have attempted to impose such regulations uponus
 or our users, and others may attempt to do so in the future. Attempted enforcement of these laws against some of our users appears to beincreasing
 and we could be required to change the way we or our users do business in ways that increase costs or reduce revenues, such asforcing us
 to prohibit listings of certain items or restrict certain listing formats in some locations. We could also be subject to fines or other penalties,and any of these outcomes could harm our business.
A
 number of the lawsuits against us relating to trademark issues seek to have our platforms subject to unfavorable local laws. For example,“trademark
 exhaustion” principles provide trademark owners with certain rights to control the sale of a branded authentic product until it has beenplaced
 on the market by the trademark holder or with the holder’s consent. The application of “trademark exhaustion” principles is largely unsettledin
 the context of the Internet, and if trademark owners are able to force us to prohibit listings of certain items in one or more locations, our businesscould be harmed.
As
 we  expand  and  localize  our  international  activities,  we  are  increasingly  becoming  obligated  to  comply  with  the  laws  of  the  countries  ormarkets
 in which we operate. In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of goods and provide services tousers worldwi
de, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our users are required to comply with their laws based on the location of our serversor
 one or more of our users, or the location of the product or service being sold or provided in an ecommerce transaction. For example, we werefound
 liable in France, under French law, for transactions on some of our websites worldwide that did not involve French buyers or sellers. Lawsregulating
 Internet, mobile and ecommerce technologies outside of the United States are generally less favorable to us than those in the UnitedStates.
 Compliance may be more costly or may require us to change our business practices or restrict our service offerings, and the imposition ofany
 regulations on us or our users may harm our business. In addition, we may be subject to multiple overlapping legal or regulatory regimes thatimpose
 conflicting requirements on us (e.g., in cross-border trade). Our alleged failure to comply with foreign laws could subject us to penaltiesranging
 from criminal prosecution to significant fines to bans on our services, in addition to the significant costs we may incur in defending againstsuch actions.
16

We are regularly subject to general litigation, regulatory disputes, and government inquiries.We
 are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits (including class actions and individual lawsuits), government investigations, and other proceedingsinvolving
 competition and antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, accessibility claims, securities, tax, labor and employment,commercial disput
es, content generated by our users, services and other matters. The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries haveincreased
 as our company has grown larger, our businesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach, and our products and services haveincreased in complexity.
The
 outcome and impact of such claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardlessof
 the  outcome,  such  investigations  and  proceedings  can  have  an  adverse  impact  on  us  because  of  legal  costs,  diversion  of  managementresources,
 and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that is subject to judgment calls. Itis
 possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments, fines or penaltiesor
 to  settle  claims  or  proceedings,  any  of  which  could  harm  our  business.  These  proceedings  could  also  result  in  reputational  harm,  criminalsanctions,
 consent decrees, or orders preventing us from offering certain products, or services, or requiring a change in our business practices incostly
 ways, or requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies. Any of these consequences could harm ourbusiness.
We are subject to regulatory activity and antitrust litigation under competitio
n laws.We
 are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies under U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including competition laws. Somejurisdictions
 also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. Other companies andgovernment
 agencies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of the United States,individ
ual states, the European Commission or other countries, or otherwise constitute unfair competition. An increasing number of governments areregulating
 competition  law  activities,  including  increased  scrutiny  in  large  markets  such  as  China.  Our  business  partnerships  or  agreements  orarrangements
 with  customers  or  other  companies  could  give  rise  to  regulatory  action  or  antitrust  litigation.  Some  regulators,  particularly  thoseoutside
 of the United States, may perceive our business to be used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemedanticompetitive.
 Certain competition authorities have conducted market studies of our industries. Such claims and investigations,  even if withoutfoundation,
 may be very expensive to defend, involve negative publicity and substantial diversion of management time and effort and could result insignificant judgments against us or require us to chan
ge our business practices.We are subject to patent litigation.
We
 have repeatedly been sued for allegedly infringing other parties’ patents. We are a defendant in a number of patent suits and have beennotified
 of several other potential patent disputes. We expect that we will increasingly be subject to patent infringement claims because, amongother reasons:
•
our products and services continue to expand in scope and complexity;•
we continue to expand into new businesses, including through acquisitions; and•
the universe of patent owners who may claim that we, any of the companies that we have acquired, or our customers infringe their patents,and the aggregate number of patents controlled by such p
atent owners, continues to increase.Such
 claims may be brought directly against us and/or against our customers whom we may indemnify either because we are contractuallyobligated
 to  do  so  or  we  choose  to  do  so  as  a  business  matter.  We  believe  that  an  increasing  number  of  these  claims  against  us  and  othertechnology
 companies have been, and continue to be, initiated by third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. In addition,we
 have seen significant patent disputes between operating companies in some technology industries. Patent claims, whether meritorious or not,are time-consumin
g and costly to defend and resolve, and could require us to make expensive changes in our methods of doing business, enter intocostly
 royalty  or  licensing  agreements,  make  substantial  payments  to  satisfy  adverse  judgments  or  settle  claims  or  proceedings,  or  ceaseconducting certain operations, which w
ould harm our business.17

We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates.Some
 of our borrowings bear interest at floating rates and we have entered into agreements intended to convert the interest rate on some ofour
 fixed rate debt instruments to floating rates. To the extent that prevailing rates increase, our interest expense under these debt instruments willincrease.
Investments
 in both fixed-rate and floating-rate interest-earning instruments carry varying degrees of interest rate risk. The fair market value ofour
 fixed-rate investment securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. In general, fixed-rate securities with longer maturitiesare
 subject to greater interest-rate risk than those with shorter maturities. While floating rate securities generally are subject to less interest-rate riskthan
 fixed-rate securities, floating-rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decrease and may also suffer a decline inmarket
 value  if  interest  rates  increase.  Due  in  part  to  these  factors,  our  investment  income  may  decline  or  we  may  suffer  losses  in  principal  ifsecurities
 are sold that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. In addition, relatively low interest rates limit our investmentincome. Fluctuations
 in interest rates that increase the cost of our current or future indebtedness, cause the market value of our assets to decline orreduce our investment income could adversely affect our financi
al results.Our tickets business is subject to regulatory, competitive and other risks that could harm this business.
Our tickets business, which includes StubHub, is sub
ject to numerous risks, including:•
Some  jurisdictions,  in  particular  jurisdictions  outside  the  United  States,  prohibit  the  resale  of  event  tickets  (anti-scalping  laws)  at  pricesabove the face value of the
 tickets or at all, or highly regulate the resale of tickets, and new laws and regulations or changes to existing lawsand
 regulations imposing these or other restrictions could limit or inhibit our ability to operate, or our users’ ability to continue to use, ourtickets business.
•
Regulatory agencies or courts may claim or hold that we are responsible for ensuring that our users comply with these laws and regulations.•
In many jurisdictions, our tickets business depends on commercial partnerships with event organizers or licensed ticket vendors, which wemust develop and maintain on acceptab
le terms for our tickets business to be successful.•
Our tickets business is subject to seasonal fluctuations and the general economic and business conditions that impact the sporting eventsand live entertainment industries.
•
A portion of the tickets inventory sold by sellers on the StubHub platform is processed by StubHub in digital form. Systems failures, securitybreaches,
 theft or other disruptions that result in the loss of such sellers’ tickets inventory, could result in significant costs and a loss ofconsumer confidence in our tickets business.

Lawsuits  alleging  a  variety  of  causes  of  actions  have  in  the  past,  and  may  in  the  future,  be  filed  against  StubHub  and  eBay  by  venueowners,
 competitors, ticket buyers, and unsuccessful ticket buyers. Such lawsuits could result in significant costs and require us to changeour business practices in ways that negatively affect our tickets business.
•
Our tickets business also faces significant competition from a number of sources, including ticketing service companies, event organizers,ticket
 brokers, and online and offline ticket resellers. Some ticketing service companies, event organizers, and professional sports teamshave
 begun  to  issue  event  tickets  through  various  forms  of  electronic  ticketing  systems  that  are  designed  to  restrict  or  prohibit  thetransferability
 (and by extension, the resale) of such event tickets either to favor their own resale affiliates or to discourage resale or restrictresale
 of  season  tickets  to  a  preferred,  designated  website.  Ticketing  service  companies  have  also  begun  to  use  market-based  pricingstrategies or dynamic pricing to charge much higher prices, and impos
e additional restrictions on transferability, for premium tickets.•
Some sports teams have threatened to revoke the privileges of season ticket owners if they resell their tickets through a platform that is notaffiliated with, or approved by, such sports teams.

The listing or sale by our users of items that allegedly infringe the intellectual property rights of rights owners, including pirated or counterfeititems, may harm our business.
The listing or sale by our
 users of unlawful, counterfeit or stolen goods or unlawful services, or sale of goods or services in an unlawful manner,has
 resulted  and  may  continue  to  result  in  allegations  of  civil  or  criminal  liability  for  unlawful  activities  against  us  (including  the  employees  anddirectors
 of our various entities) involving activities carried out by users through our services. In a number of circumstances, third parties, includinggovernment regulators
 and law enforcement officials, have alleged that our services aid and abet violations of certain laws, including laws regardingthe
 sale  of  counterfeit  items,  laws  restricting  or  prohibiting  the  transferability  (and  by  extension,  the  resale)  of  digital  goods  (e.g.,  event  tickets,books,
 music and software), the fencing of stolen goods, selective distribution channel laws, customs laws, distance selling laws, anti-scalping lawswith respect to the resale of tickets, and the sale of items outside of the United States that are regulated by U.S. export controls.
In
 addition, allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights, including but not limited to counterfeit items, have resulted in threatenedand
 actual litigation from time to time by rights owners, including the following luxury brand owners: Tiffany & Co. in the United States; Rolex S.A.and
 Coty Prestige Lancaster Group GmbH in Germany; Louis Vuitton Malletier and Christian Dior Couture in France; and L’Oréal SA, LancômeParfums
 et  Beauté  &  Cie,  and  Laboratoire  Garnier  &  Cie  in  several  European  countries.  Plaintiffs  in  these  and  similar  suits  seek,  among  otherremedies, injunctive
 relief and damages. Statutory damages for copyright or trademark violations could range up to $150,000 per copyright violationand
 $2,000,000 per trademark violation in the United States, and may be even higher in other jurisdictions. In the past, we have paid substantialamounts
 in  connection  with  resolving  certain  trademark  and  copyright  suits.  These  and  similar  suits  may  also  force  us  to  modify  our  businesspractices in a manner that increases costs, lowers revenue, makes our websites and mob
ile platforms less convenient to customers, and requires usto
 spend substantial resources to take additional protective measures or discontinue certain service offerings in order to combat these practices. Inaddition, we have received sign
ificant media attention relating to the listing or sale of illegal or counterfeit goods, which could damage our reputation,diminish the value of our brand names, and make users reluctant to use our prod
ucts and services.We are subject to risks associated with information disseminated throug
h our services.Online
 services  companies  may  be  subject  to  claims  relating  to  information  disseminated  through  their  services,  including  claims  allegingdefamation,
 libel, breach of contract, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, among other things. The laws relating tothe
 liability of online services companies for information disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges both in the UnitedStates and
 foreign jurisdictions. Any liabilities incurred as a result of these matters could require us to incur additional costs and harm our reputationand our business.
Our
 potential liability to third parties for the user-provided content on our sites, particularly in jurisdictions outside the United States where lawsgoverning
 Internet transactions are unsettled, may increase. If we become liable for information provided by our users and carried on our service inany
 jurisdiction in which we operate, we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to thisliability, including exp
ending substantial resources or discontinuing certain service offerings, which could harm our business.Changes to our programs to protect buyers and sellers could increas
e our costs and loss rate.Our
 eBay Money Back Guarantee program represents the means by which we compensate users who believe that they have been defrauded,have
 not  received  the  item  that  they  purchased  or  have  received  an  item  different  from  what  was  described.  We  expect  to  continue  to  receivecommunications
 from  users  requesting  reimbursement  or  threatening  or  commencing  legal  action  against  us  if  no  reimbursement  is  made.  Ourliability
 for these sort of claims is slowly beginning to be clarified in some jurisdictions and may be higher in some non-U.S. jurisdictions than it is inthe
 United  States.  Litigation  involving  liability  for  any  such  third-party  actions  could  be  costly  and  time  consuming  for  us,  divert  managementattention, result in increased costs
 of doing business, lead to adverse judgments or settlements or otherwise harm our business. In addition, affectedusers will likely complain to regulatory ag
encies that could take action against us, including imposing fines or seeking injunctions.19

We  may  be  unable  to  adequately  protect  or  enforce  our  intellectual  property  rights,  or  third  parties  may  allege  that  we  are  infringing  theirintellectual property rights.
We
 believe the protection of our intellectual property,  including our trademarks,  patents, copyrights,  domain names, trade dress, and tradesecrets,
 is critical to our success. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the UnitedStates
 and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rightswhen
 offering or procuring products and services, including confidentiality and invention assignment agreements entered into with our employeesand contractors and confidentiality agreements with p
arties with whom we conduct business.However, effective intellectual property protection may
 not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available,and
 contractual arrangements and other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent third parties from infringing ormisappropriating
 our  intellectual  property  or  deter  independent  development  of  equivalent  or  superior  intellectual  property  rights  by  others.Trademark,
 copyright, patent, domain name, trade dress and trade secret protection is very expensive to maintain and may require litigation. Wemust protect our
 intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights in an increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and timeconsumin
g and may not be successful in every jurisdiction. Also, we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use ofour
 proprietary rights. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks orcopyright
ed material, to others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. Any failureto adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or significa
nt costs incurred in doing so, could materially harm our business.As
 the  number  of  products  in  the  software  industry  increases  and  the  functionality  of  these  products  further  overlap,  and  as  we  acquiretechnology
 through acquisitions or licenses, we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims, including patent, copyright, and trademarkinfringement
 claims. Litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the patent and other intellectual property rights of others.The
 ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and, regardless of the outcome, any such claim, with or without merit, may be time-consuming,result
 in  costly  litigation,  divert  management’s  time  and  attention  from  our  business,  require  us  to  stop  selling,  delay  roll-out,  or  redesign  ourproducts,
 or require us to pay substantial amounts to satisfy judgments or settle claims or lawsuits or to pay substantial royalty or licensing fees, orto
 satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers. Our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights, or litigation orclaims arising out of intellectual property matters, may harm our business.
Failure
 to deal effectively with fraudulent activities on our platforms would increase our loss rate and harm our business, and could severelydiminish merchant and consumer confidence i
n and use of our services.We
 face risks with respect to fraudulent activities on our platforms and periodically receive complaints from buyers and sellers who may nothave received the goods that they
 had contracted to purchase or payment for the goods that a buyer had contracted to purchase. In some Europeanand
 Asian jurisdictions, buyers may also have the right to withdraw from a sale made by a professional seller within a specified time period. Whilewe
 can, in some cases, suspend the accounts of users who fail to fulfill their payment or delivery obligations to other users, we do not have theability
 to require users to make payment or deliver goods, or otherwise make users whole other than through its buyer protection program, which inthe United States we refer to as the eBay Money Back Guarantee. Although we h
ave implemented measures to detect and reduce the occurrence offraudulent
 activities, combat bad buyer experiences and increase buyer satisfaction, including evaluating sellers on the basis of their transactionhistory
 and  restricting  or  suspending  their  activity,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  these  measures  will  be  effective  in  combating  fraudulenttransactions
 or improving overall satisfaction among sellers, buyers, and other participants. Additional measures to address fraud could negativelyaffect the attractiveness of
 our services to buyers or sellers, resulting in a reduction in the ability to attract new users or retain current users, damageto our reputation, or a diminution in the value of our brand names.

We have substantial indebtedness, and we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, and we may not generate sufficientcash flow
 from our business to service our indebtedness. Failure to comply with the terms of our indebtedness could result in the acceleration of ourindebtedness, which could h
ave an adverse effect on our cash flow and liquidity.We have
 a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness and we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including underour
 commercial paper program and revolving credit facility or through public or private offerings of debt securities. Our outstanding indebtednessand any additional ind
ebtedness we incur may have significant consequences, including, without limitation, any of the following:    
•
requiring  us to use a significant  portion  of our cash flow from  operations  and other  available cash to service  our indebtedness,  therebyreducing the amount of cash available for other purpos
es, including capital expenditures and acquisitions;•
our  indebtedness  and  leverage  may  increase  our  vulnerability  to  downturns  in  our  business,  to  competitive  pressures,  and  to  adversechanges in general economic a
nd industry conditions;•
adverse changes in the ratings assigned to our debt securities by credit rating agencies will likely increase our borrowing costs;•
our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases or other general corporateand other purposes may be limited; and
•
our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry may be limited.Our
 ability to make payments of principal of and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance, which will be subject togeneral
 economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our consolidated results of operations and financialcondition,
 many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt,we may be required to, among other things:
    
•
incur the tax cost of repatriating funds to the United States;•
seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;•
refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness;•
sell selected assets; or•
reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures.Such
 measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might notbe available on economic
ally favorable terms or at all.Our
 revolving credit facility and the indenture pursuant to which certain of our outstanding debt securities were issued contain, and any debtinstruments we enter into in the future may contain, financial and other coven
ants that restrict or could restrict, among other things, our business andoperatio
ns. If we fail to pay amounts due under, or breach any of the covenants in, a debt instrument, then the lenders would typically have the rightto
 demand immediate repayment of all borrowings thereunder (subject in certain cases to grace or cure period). Moreover, any such accelerationand required repayment of or
 default in respect of any of our indebtedness could, in turn, constitute an event of default under other debt instruments,thereby
 resulting in the acceleration and required repayment of that other indebtedness. Any of these events could materially adversely affect ourliquidity and financial condi
tion.21

A downgrade in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our business.Some
 of our outstanding indebtedness has received credit ratings from certain rating agencies. Such ratings are limited in scope and do notpurport
 to address all risks relating to an investment in those debt securities, but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time therating
 was issued. The credit ratings assigned to our debt securities could change based upon, among other things, our results of operations andfinancial
 condition. These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies, and there can be no assurance that such ratings willnot
 be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency or placed on a so-called “watch list” for a possible downgrade or assigned anegative
 ratings outlook if, in any rating agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant. Moreover, these credit ratings are not recommendations tobuy,
 sell or hold any of our debt securities. Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that ourratings
 are under review for a downgrade or have been assigned a negative outlook, would likely increase our borrowing costs, which could in turnhave a material adverse effect on our financial conditi
on, results of operations, cash flows and could harm our business.Our
 credit ratings were downgraded as a result of the distribution of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal to our stockholders(the
 “Distribution”), pursuant to which PayPal became an independent company. As of January 1, 2014, our long-term debt and short-term fundingwere
 rated  investment  grade  by  Standard  and  Poor’s  Financial  Services,  LLC  (long-term  rated  A,  short-term  rated  A-1,  with  a  stable  outlook),Moody’s
 Investor Service (long-term rated A2, short-term rated P-1, with a stable outlook), and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (long-term rated A, short-termrated
 F-1, with a stable outlook). All of these credit rating agencies lowered their ratings in connection with the Distribution, which occurred on July17, 2015. Since July
 20, 2015, we have been rated investment grade by Standard and Poor’s Financial Services, LLC (long-term rated BBB+, short-term
 rated  A-2,  with  a  stable  outlook),  Moody’s  Investor  Service  (long-term  rated  Baa1,  short-term  rated  P-2,  with  a  stable  outlook),  and  FitchRatings,
 Inc. (long-term  rated BBB, short-term  rated F-2, with a stable outlook). We disclose these ratings to enhance the understanding of oursources
 of liquidity and the effects of these ratings on our costs of funds. Our borrowing costs depend, in part, on our credit ratings and any furtheractions taken by these credit rating agencies to lower our credit ratings, as descri
bed above, will likely increase our borrowing costs. Our business and users may be subject to sales tax and other taxes.
The
 application of indirect taxes (such as sales and use tax, value-added tax (“VAT”), goods and services tax, business tax and gross receipttax)
 to ecommerce businesses and to our users is a complex and evolving issue. Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that imposethese
 taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the Internet and ecommerce. In many cases, it is not clear how existing statutesapply
 to  the  Internet  or  ecommerce.  In  addition,  governments  are  increasingly  looking  for  ways  to  increase  revenues,  which  has  resulted  indiscussions about tax reform and other legislative actio
n to increase tax revenues, including through indirect taxes. There are many transactions thatoccur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determinati
on is uncertain.Some
 jurisdictions have implemented, or may implement, laws that require remote sellers of goods and services to collect and remit taxes onsales
 to customers located within the jurisdiction. On January 12, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari in South  Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc.et al, 
a case challengi ng the current law under which online retailers are not required to collect sales tax unless they have a physical presence in thebuyer’s
 state. If the current law is changed, other states may adopt laws requiring sellers to collect and remit sales. In addition, the StreamlinedSales
 Tax Project (an ongoing, multi-year effort by U.S. state and local governments to pursue federal legislation that would require collection andremittance
 of sales tax by out-of-state sellers) could allow states that meet certain simplification and other criteria to require out-of-state sellers tocollect
 and  remit  sales  taxes  on  goods  purchased  by  in-state  residents.  The  adoption  of  such  legislation  could  result  in  a  use  tax  collectionresponsibility
 for certain of our sellers. This collection responsibility and the additional costs associated with complex use tax collection, remittanceand
 audit requirements would make selling on our websites and mobile platforms less attractive for small business retailers and would harm ourbusiness, and
 the proliferation of state legislation to expand sales and use tax collection on Internet sales could adversely affect some of our sellersand indirectly harm our business.
There
 are  proposals  that  have  been  made  at  the  U.S.  state  and  local  levels  that  would  impose  additional  taxes  on  the  sale  of  goods  andservices
 over the Internet. These proposals, if adopted, could substantially impair the growth of ecommerce and our platforms, and could diminishour
 opportunity to derive financial benefit from our activities. While the U.S. federal government’s moratorium on state and local taxation of Internetaccess or multiple or discriminatory taxes on ecommerce has been permanently exte
nded, this moratorium does not prohibit federal, state22

or local authorities from collecting taxes on our income or from collecting certain taxes that were in effect prior to the enactment of the moratoriumand/or one of its extensions.
From
 time to time, some taxing authorities in the United States have notified us that they believe we owe them certain taxes imposed on ourservices.
 These notifications have not resulted in any significant tax liabilities to date, but there is a risk that some jurisdiction may be successful inthe future, which would harm our business.
Similar
 issues exist outside of the United States, where the application of VAT or other indirect taxes on ecommerce providers is complex andevolving.
 While we attempt to comply in those jurisdictions where it is clear that a tax is due, some of our subsidiaries have, from time to time,received
 claims relating to the applicability of indirect taxes to our fees. Additionally, we pay input VAT on applicable taxable purchases within thevarious countries
 in which we operate. In most cases, we are entitled to reclaim this input VAT from the various countries. However, because of ourunique
 business model, the application of the laws and rules that allow such reclamation is sometimes uncertain. A successful assertion by one ormore countries that we are not entitled to reclaim VAT could harm our business.
In
 certain jurisdictions, we collect and remit indirect taxes on our fees and pay taxes on our purchases of goods and services. However, taxauthorities
 may raise questions about our calculation, reporting and collection of taxes and may ask us to remit additional taxes, as well as theproper
 calculation of such taxes. Should any new taxes become applicable or if the taxes we pay are found to be deficient, our business could beharmed.
Some
 jurisdictions have imposed a tax collection, reporting or record-keeping obligation on companies that engage in or facilitate ecommerce.For
 example, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) now requires that certain payments to sellers be reported to the sellers and the IRS on anannual
 basis. Any failure by us to meet these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions and could harm ourbusiness.
 Taxing authorities may also seek to impose tax collection or reporting obligations based on the location of the product or service beingsold or provided in an ecommerce transaction, regard
less of where the respective users are located. We are now jointly liable for UK VAT for certainnon-UK sellers who fail to fulfill their UK VAT ob
ligations unless we suspend their eBay activity until the matter is resolved.Some jurisdictio
ns could assert that we are responsible for tax on the underlying goods or services sold on our sites or pass laws imposing thisobligation. Certain jurisdictio
ns have enacted laws which will become effective in 2018 or later requiring marketplaces to report user activity or collectand
 remit taxes on certain items sold on the marketplace. Imposition of an information reporting or tax collection requirement could decrease selleror
 buyer  activity  on  our  sites  and  would  harm  our  business.  Tax  authorities  may  also  require  us  to  help  ensure  compliance  by  our  users  bypromulgating
 legislation regulating professional sellers or marketplaces, including tax reporting and collection requirements. In addition, we haveperiodically
 received requests from tax authorities in many jurisdictions for information regarding the transactions of large classes of sellers on oursites,
 and in some cases we have been legally obligated to provide this data. The imposition of any requirements  on us to disclose transactionrecords
 for all or a class of sellers to tax or other regulatory authorities or to file tax forms on behalf of any sellers, especially requirements that areimposed
 on us but not on alternative means of ecommerce, and any use of those records to investigate, collect taxes from or prosecute sellers orbuyers, could decrease activity on our sites and harm our business.
We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabil
ities.The
 determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment, and thereare many transactions and calculatio
ns where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Like many other multinational corporations, we are subjectto
 tax in multiple U.S. and foreign jurisdictions and have structured our operations to reduce our effective tax rate. Our determination of our taxliability
 is  always  subject  to  audit  and  review  by  applicable  domestic  and  foreign  tax  authorities,  and  we  are  currently  undergoing  a  number  ofinvestigations,
 audits and reviews by taxing authorities throughout the world, including with respect to our business structure. Any adverse outcomeof any
 such audit or review could harm our business, and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statementsand
 may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. While we have established reservesbased on assumptions and estimates that we beli
eve are reasonable to cover such eventualities, these reserves may prove to be insufficient.In
 addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by a shift in our jurisdictional earning mix, by changes in the valuation of ourdeferred
 tax assets and liabilities, as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program, or changes in tax laws, regulations, oraccounting principles, as well as certai
n discrete items.23

In light of continuing fiscal challenges in certain U.S. states and in many countries in Europe, various levels of government are increasinglyfocused
 on  tax  reform  and  other  legislative  action  to  increase  tax  revenue,  including  corporate  income  taxes.  A  number  of  U.S.  states  haveattempted
 to increase corporate tax revenues by taking an expansive view of corporate presence to attempt to impose corporate income taxes andother
 direct  business  taxes  on  companies  that  have  no  physical  presence  in  their  state,  and  taxing  authorities  in  foreign  jurisdictions  may  takesimilar actions. Many
 U.S. states are also altering their apportionment formulas to increase the amount of taxable income or loss attributable to theirstate
 from certain out-of-state businesses. Similarly, in Europe, and elsewhere in the world, there are various tax reform efforts underway designedto
 ensure that corporate entities are taxed on a larger percentage of their earnings. Companies that operate over the Internet, such as eBay, are atarget
 of some of these efforts. If more taxing authorities are successful in applying direct taxes to Internet companies that do not have a physicalpresence in their respective jurisdictions, this coul
d increase our effective tax rate.We may be subject to sales reporting and record-keeping ob
ligations.One
 or  more  states,  the  U.S.  federal  government  or  foreign  countries  may  seek  to  impose  reporting  or  record-keeping  obligations  oncompanies
 that engage in or facilitate ecommerce. Such an obligation could be imposed by legislation intended to improve tax compliance (andlegislation
 to  such  effect  has  been  contemplated  by  several  states  and  a  number  of  foreign  jurisdictions)  or  if  one  of  our  companies  was  everdeemed to be the legal agent of the users of our services by a jurisdiction in which it operates. Certai
n of our companies are required to report to theIRS
 and  most  states  on  customers  subject  to  U.S.  income  tax  who  receive  more  than  $20,000  in  payments  and  more  than  200  payments  in  acalendar
 year. As a result, we are required to request tax identification numbers from certain payees, track payments by tax identification numberand,
 under  certain  conditions,  withhold  a  portion  of  payments  and  forward  such  withholding  to  the  IRS.  We  modify  our  systems  to  meet  suchrequirements
 and expect increased operational costs and changes to our user experience in connection with complying with reporting obligations.Any
 failure  by  us  to  meet  these  requirements  could  result  in  substantial  monetary  penalties  and  other  sanctions  and  could  harm  our  business.Imposition of an information reporting requirement could decre
ase seller or buyer activity on our sites and would harm our business.Our business is subject to online security risks, includin
g security breaches and cyberattacks.Our
 businesses involve the storage and transmission of users’ personal financial information. In addition, a significant number of our usersauthorize us to bill their
 payment card accounts directly for all transaction and other fees charged by us. An increasing number of websites, includingthose
 owned  by  several  other  large  Internet  and  offline  companies,  have  disclosed  breaches  of  their  security,  some  of  which  have  involvedsophistic
ated and highly targeted attacks on portions of their websites or infrastructure. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable,or
 degrade service, or sabotage systems, change frequently, may be difficult to detect for a long time, and often are not recognized until launchedagainst
 a target. Certain efforts may be state sponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources and therefore may beeven
 more  difficult  to  detect.  As  a  result,  we  may  be  unable  to  anticipate  these  techniques  or  to  implement  adequate  preventative  measures.Unauthorized
 parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including hacking into our systems orfacilities,
 fraud, trickery or other means of deceiving our employees, contractors and temporary staff. A party that is able to circumvent our securitymeasures
 could misappropriate our or our users’ personal information, cause interruption or degradations in our operations, damage our computersor
 those of our users, or otherwise damage our reputation. In addition, our users have been and likely will continue to be targeted by parties usingfraudulent
 “spoof”  and  “phishing”  emails  to  misappropriate  user  names,  passwords,  payment  card  numbers,  or  other  personal  information  or  tointroduce
 viruses or other malware through “trojan horse” programs to our users’ computers. Our information technology and infrastructure may bevulnerable
 to cyberattacks or security incidents and third parties may be able to access our users’ proprietary information and payment card datathat
 are stored on or accessible through our systems. Any security breach at a company providing services to us or our users could have similareffects.
In
 May  2014,  we  publicly  announced  that  criminals  were  able  to  penetrate  and  steal  certain  data,  including  user  names,  encrypted  userpasswords
 and other non-financial user data. Upon making this announcement, we required all buyers and sellers on our platform to reset theirpasswords
 in order to log into their account. The breach and subsequent password reset have negatively impacted the business. In July 2014, aputative
 class action lawsuit was filed against us for alleged violations and harm resulting from the breach. The lawsuit was recently dismissed withleave
 to  amend.  In  addition,  we  have  received  requests  for  information  and  are  subject  to  investigations  regarding  this  incident  from  numerousregulatory and other government agencies across the worl
d.24

We may also need to expend significant additional resources to protect against security breaches or to redress problems caused by breaches.These
 issues are likely to become more difficult and costly as we expand the number of markets where we operate. Additionally, our insurancepolicies
 carry low coverage limits, which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches and we may not be able tofully collect, if at all, under these insurance polici
es.Systems
 failures  or  cyberattacks  and  resulting  interruptions  in  the  availability  of  or  degradation  in  the  performance  of  our  websites,applications, products or services could harm our busin
ess.Our systems may experience service interruptions or degradation due to of hardware a
nd software defects or malfunctions, computer denial-of-service
 and  other  cyberattacks,  human  error,  earthquakes,  hurricanes,  floods,  fires,  natural  disasters,  power  losses,  disruptions  intelecommun
ications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, or other events. Our systems are also subject tobreak-ins,
 sabotage  and  intentional  acts  of  vandalism.  Some  of  our  systems  are  not  fully  redundant  and  our  disaster  recovery  planning  is  notsufficient for all eventualities.
We
 have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failures, denial of service attacks and other events or conditions from timeto
 time that interrupt the availability or reduce the speed or functionality of our websites and mobile applications. These events have resulted andlikely
 will result in loss of revenue. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the speed or other functionality of our websites andmobile
 applications could materially harm our business. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential users tobelieve
 that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our sites, and could permanently harm our reputationand
 brands.  Moreover,  to  the  extent  that  any  system  failure  or  similar  event  results  in  damages  to  our  customers  or  their  businesses,  thesecustomers
 could seek significant compensation from us for their losses and those claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming andcostly
 for us to address. We also rely on facilities, components and services supplied by third parties and our business may be materially adverselyaffected to
 the extent these components or services do not meet our expectations or these third parties cease to provide the services or facilities. Inparticular,
 a decision by any of our third party hosting providers to close a facility that we use could cause system interruptions and delays, result inloss
 of critical data and cause lengthy interruptions in our services. We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us forlosses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events.
Acquisitions, dispositions, joi
nt ventures, and strategic investments could result in operating difficulties and could harm our business.We
 have acquired a significant number of businesses of varying size and scope, technologies, services, and products and have in July 2015distributed
 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal to our stockholders, pursuant to which PayPal became an independent company, andsold our Enterprise business in November 201
5. We also expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactionsas
 part  of  our  overall  business  strategy,  including  business  combinations,  acquisitions,  and  dispositions  of  businesses,  technologies,  services,products, and other assets, as well as strategic investments and joint ventures.
These transactions may involve significant cha
llenges and risks, including:•
the  potential  loss  of  key  customers,  merchants,  vendors  and  other  key  business  partners  of  the  companies  we  acquire,  or  dispose  of,following and continui
ng after announcement of our transaction plans;•
declining employee morale and retention issues affecting employees of companies that we acquire or dispose of, which may result fromchanges
 in compensation, or changes in management, reporting relationships, future prospects or the direction of the acquired or disposedbusiness;
•
difficulty making new and strategic hires of new employees;•
diversion  of  management  time  and  a  shift  of  focus  from  operating  the  businesses  to  the  transaction,  and  in  the  case  of  an  acquisition,integration and administration;
•
the need to provide transition services to a disposed of company, which may result in the diversion of resources and focus;•
the need to integrate the operations, systems (including accounting, management, information, human resource and other administrativesystems),
 technologies, products and personnel of each acquired company, which is an inherently risky and potentially lengthy and costlyprocess;
25

•the  inefficiencies  and  lack  of  control  that  may  result  if  such  integration  is  delayed  or  not  implemented,  and  unforeseen  difficulties  andexpenditures that may arise as a result;
•
the  need  to  implement  or  improve  controls,  procedures  and  policies  appropriate  for  a  larger  public  company  at  companies  that  prior  toacquisition
 may have lacked such controls, procedures and policies or whose controls, procedures and policies did not meet applicablelegal and other standards;
•
risks associated with our expansion into new international markets;•
derivative lawsuits resulting from the acquisition or disposition;•
liability for activities of the acquired or disposed of company before the transaction, including intellectual property and other litigation claimsor
 disputes, violations of laws, rules and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities and, in thecase
 of dispositions, liabilities to the acquirors of those businesses under contractual provisions such as representations, warranties andindemnities;
•
the potential loss of key employees following the transaction;•
the acquisition of new customer and employee personal information by us or a third party acquiring assets or businesses from us, which inand of itself may require regulatory approval and or additi
onal controls, policies and procedures and subject us to additional exposure; and•
our dependence on the acquired business’ accounting, financial reporting, operating metrics and similar systems, controls and processesand
 the risk that errors or irregularities in those systems, controls and processes will lead to errors in our consolidated financial statementsor make it more difficult to manage the acquired business.
At
 any given time, we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these types of transactions and any ofthese
 transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, it may take us longer than expected to fullyrealize
 the anticipated benefits of these transactions, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all,which
 could  adversely  affect  our  business  and  operating  results.  Any  acquisitions  or  dispositions  may  also  require  us  to  issue  additional  equitysecurities, spend our
 cash, or incur debt (and increased interest expense), liabilities, and amortization expenses related to intangible assets or write-offs of goodwill, which could adversely affect our results of operatio
ns and dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders.    
We
 have made certain investments, including through joint ventures, in which we have a minority equity interest and/or lack management andoperatio
nal control. The controlling joint venture partner in a joint venture may have business interests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent withours, and
 business decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling joint venture partner or the joint venture company may result in harm toour
 reputation or adversely affect the value of our investment in the joint venture. Our strategic investments may also expose us to additional risks.Any
 circumstances, which may be out of our control, that adversely affect the value of our investments, or cost resulting from regulatory action orlawsuits in connection with our investments, coul
d harm our business or negatively impact our financial results.Our
 success largely depends on key personnel. Because competition for our key employees is intense, we may not be able to attract, retain,and
 develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business. The loss of senior management or other key personnel could harm ourbusiness.
Our
 future performance depends substantially on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel, including keyengineering
 and product  development  personnel,  and our  ability  to attract,  retain,  and motivate  key personnel.  Competition  for  key personnel  isintense,
 especially in the Silicon Valley where our corporate headquarters are located, and we may be unable to successfully attract, integrate, orretain sufficiently qualified key personn
el. In making employment decisions, particularly in the Internet and high-technology industries, job candidatesoften consider the value of
 the equity awards they would receive in connection with their employment and fluctuations in our stock price may make itmore
 difficult  to  attract,  retain,  and  motivate  employees.  In  addition,  we  do  not  have  long-term  employment  agreements  with  any  of  our  keypersonnel
 and do not maintain any “key person” life insurance policies. The loss of the services of any of our senior management or other keypersonnel, or our inability to attract highly qualifi
ed senior management and other key personnel, could harm our business.26

Problems with or price increases by third parties who provide services to us or to our sellers could harm our business.A
 number  of  third  parties  provide  services  to  us  or  to  our  sellers.  Such  services  include  seller  tools  that  automate  and  manage  listings,merchant
 tools  that  manage  listings  and  interface  with  inventory  management  software,  storefronts  that  help  our  sellers  list  items  and  shippingproviders
 that  deliver  goods  sold  on  our  platform,  among  others.  Financial  or  regulatory  issues,  labor  issues  (e.g.,  strikes,  lockouts,  or  workstoppages), or other problems that prevent these companies from providing services to us or our sellers cou
ld harm our business.Price
 increases by, or service terminations, disruptions or interruptions at, companies that provide services to us and our sellers and clientscould
 also reduce the number of listings on our platforms  or make it more difficult for our sellers to complete transactions,  thereby harming ourbusiness.
 Some third parties who provide services to us or our sellers may have or gain market power and be able to increase their prices to uswithout
 competitive constraint. While we continue to work with global carriers to offer our sellers a variety of shipping options and to enhance theirshipping
 experience, postal rate increases may reduce the competitiveness of certain sellers’ offerings, and postal service changes could requirecertain sellers
 to utilize alternatives which could be more expensive or inconvenient, which could in turn decrease the number of transactions on oursites, thereby harming our business.
We
 have outsourced certain functions to third-party providers, including some customer support and product development functions, which arecritical
 to  our  operations.  If  our  service  providers  do  not  perform  satisfactorily,  our  operations  could  be  disrupted,  which  could  result  in  userdissatisfaction and could harm our business.
There
 can be no assurance that third parties who provide services directly to us or our sellers will continue to do so on acceptable terms, or atall.
 If any third parties were to stop providing services to us or our sellers on acceptable terms, including as a result of bankruptcy, we may beunable to procure alternatives from other third parties in a timely and efficient manner an
d on acceptable terms, or at all.Our developer platforms, which are open to merchants and third-party develop
ers, subject us to additional risks.We
 provide third-party developers with access to application programming interfaces, software development kits and other tools designed toallow
 them to produce applications for use, with a particular focus on mobile applications. There can be no assurance that merchants or third-partydevelopers
 will develop and maintain applications and services on our open platforms on a timely basis or at all, and a number of factors couldcause
 such  third-party  developers  to  curtail  or  stop  development  for  our  platforms.  In  addition,  our  business  is  subject  to  many  regulatoryrestrictions.
 It is possible that merchants and third-party developers who utilize our development platforms or tools could violate these regulatoryrestrictions and we may be held responsible for such vio
lations, which could harm our business. 
We could incur significant liabil
ity if the Distribution is determined to be a taxable transaction.We
 have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the Distribution qualifies as a transaction that is described in Sections355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of
 the Internal Revenue Code. The opinion relies on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from PayPaland
 us  regarding  the  past  and  future  conduct  of  the  companies’  respective  businesses  and  other  matters.  If  any  of  these  facts,  assumptions,representations
 or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, our shareholders and we may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel andcould
 be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel we have received, the IRS could determine on audit that theDistribution
 is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated orif
 it  disagrees  with  the  conclusions  in  the  opinion.  If  the  Distribution  is  determined  to  be  taxable  for  U.S.  federal  income  tax  purposes,  ourshareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and we coul
d incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.We may be exposed to claims and liabilities as a resu
lt of the Distribution.We
 entered  into  a  separation  and  distribution  agreement  and  various  other  agreements  with  PayPal  to  govern  the  Distribution  and  therelations
hip of the two companies going forward. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputesbetween
 us and PayPal. The indemnity rights we have against PayPal under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us. In addition, ourindemnity obligations to PayPa
l may be significant and these risks could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.27

ITEM 2: PROPERTIES     We
 own  and  lease  various  properties  in  the  U.S.  and  35  other  countries  around  the  world.  We  use  the  properties  for  executive  andadministrative
 offices, data centers, product development offices, fulfillment centers and customer service offices. Our headquarters are located inSan Jose, California and occupy approximately 0.5
 million square feet. Our owned data centers are solely located in Utah. As of December 31, 2017 , our owned and leased properties provid
ed us with aggregate square footage as follows (in millions): 
United States   Other Countries  Total Owned facilities
1.1  —  1.1 Leased facilities
0.8  4.0  4.8 Total facilities
1.9  4.0  5.9 From time to time we consider various alternatives related to long-term facilities needs. While w
e believe that our existing facilities areadequate to meet our immediate needs, it may become necessary to develo
p and improve land that we own or lease or acquire additional oralternative space to accommodate any future growth.

ITEM 3: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS     Litigation and Other Legal Matters
Overview
We
 are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings on an ongoing basis. Many of these proceedings are in early stages and may seek anindeterminate
 amount of damages. If we believe that a loss arising from such matters is probable and can be reasonably estimated, we accrue theestimated
 liability in our financial statements. If only a range of estimated losses can be determined, we accrue an amount within the range that, inour
 judgment, reflects the most likely outcome; if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue thelow
 end  of  the  range.  For  those  proceedings  in  which  an  unfavorable  outcome  is  reasonably  possible  but  not  probable,  we  have  disclosed  anestimate of the reasonably possible loss or
 range of losses or we have concluded that an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of lossesarising
 directly from the proceeding (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) are not material. If we cannot estimate theprobable
 or reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising from a proceeding, we have disclosed that fact. In assessing the materiality of aproceedi
ng, we evaluate, among other factors, the amount of monetary damages claimed, as well as the potential impact of non-monetary remediessought
 by plaintiffs (e.g., injunctive relief) that may require us to change our business practices in a manner that could have a material adverseimpact
 on our business. With respect to the matters disclosed in this Item 3, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses thatcould potentially result from the application of such n
on-monetary remedies.Amounts
 accrued  for  legal  and  regulatory  proceedings  for  which  we  believe  a  loss  is  probable  were  not  material  for  the  year  endedDecember
 31, 2017 .  Except as otherwise noted for the proceedings described in this Item 3, we have concluded, based on currently availableinformation,
 that  reasonably  possible  losses  arising  directly  from  the  proceedings  (i.e.,  monetary  damages  or  amounts  paid  in  judgment  orsettlement)
 in excess of our recorded accruals are also not material. However, legal and regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable andsubject
 to significant uncertainties. If one or more matters were resolved against us in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’sexpectations, the impact on our operating results or financial co
ndition for that reporting period could be material.General Matte
rsOther
 third parties have from time to time claimed, and others may claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights.We
 are subject to patent disputes, and expect that we will increasingly be subject to additional patent infringement claims involving various aspectsof
 our business as our products and services continue to expand in scope and complexity. Such claims may be brought directly or indirectly againstour
 companies and/or against our customers (who may be entitled to contractual indemnification under their contracts with us), and we are subjectto
 increased exposure to such claims as a result of our acquisitions and divestitures and in cases where we are entering new lines of business. Wehave
 in  the  past  been  forced  to  litigate  such  claims.  We  may  also  become  more  vulnerable  to  third-party  claims  as  laws  such  as  the  DigitalMillennium
 Copyright Act, the Lanham Act and the Communications Decency Act are interpreted by the courts, and as we expand the scope of ourbusiness
 (both  in  terms  of  the  range  of  products  and  services  that  we  offer  and  our  geographical  operations)  and  become  subject  to  laws  injurisdictions
 where  the  underlying  laws  with  respect  to  the  potential  liability  of  online  intermediaries  like  ourselves  are  either  unclear  or  lessfavorable.
 We believe that additional lawsuits alleging that we have violated patent, copyright or trademark laws will be filed against us. Intellectualproperty
 claims, whether meritorious or not, are time consuming and costly to defend and resolve, could require expensive changes in our methodsof doing business or could require us to enter into costly royalty or lice
nsing agreements on unfavorable terms.From
 time to time, we are involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business, including suits by ourusers
 (individually or as class actions) alleging, among other things, improper disclosure of our prices, rules or policies, that our practices, prices,rules,
 policies or customer/user agreements violate applicable law or that we have acted unfairly and/or not acted in conformity with such prices,rules,
 policies or agreements. Further, the number and significance of these disputes and inquiries are increasing as the political and regulatorylandsca
pe changes and, as we have grown larger, our businesses have expanded in scope (both in terms of the range of products and services thatwe
 offer and our geographical operations) and our products and services have increased in complexity. Any claims or regulatory actions against us,whether
 meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, damage awards (including statutory damages for certain causes ofaction
 in certain jurisdictions), injunctive relief or increased costs of doing business through adverse judgment or settlement, require us to changeour business
30

practices  in  expensive  ways,  require  significant  amounts  of  management  time,  result  in  the  diversion  of  significant  operational  resources  orotherwise harm our business.
Indemnification Provisions
We
 entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements with PayPal to govern the separation and relationshipof the two
 companies going forward. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between usand
 PayPal,  which  may  be  significant.  In  addition,  the  indemnity  rights  we  have  against  PayPal  under  the  agreements  may  not  be  sufficient  toprotect us and our indemnity obligations to PayP
al may be significant.In
 addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors, executive officers and certain other officers. Theseagreements require
 us to indemnify such individuals, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, for certain liabilities to which they may becomesubject as a result of their affiliation with us.
In the ordinary course of business, we have included limited indemnificat
ion provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with which wehave
 commercial relations, including our standard marketing, promotions and application-programming-interface license agreements. Under thesecontracts,
 we generally indemnify, hold harmless and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnifiedparty
 in connection with claims by a third party with respect to our domain names, trademarks, logos and other branding elements to the extent thatsuch
 marks  are  applicable  to  our  performance  under  the  subject  agreement.  In  certain  cases,  we  have  agreed  to  provide  indemnification  forintellectual
 property  infringement.  It  is  not  possible  to  determine  the  maximum  potential  loss  under  these  indemnification  provisions  due  to  ourlimited
 history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. To date, losses recordedin our consolidated statement of income in connection with our indemnification provis
ions have not been significant, either individually or collectively.ITEM 4:

In  July 2016, our Board authorized a $2.5 billion stock repurchase program and in July 2017, our Board authorized an additional $3.0 billion stock repurchase program.These stock repurchase programs have no expiration from the date of authorization.
Our
 stock repurchase programs are intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditionsand
 other factors, to make opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock to reduce our outstanding share count. Any share repurchases under ourstock
 repurchase  programs  may  be  made  through  open  market  transactions,  block  trades,  privately  negotiated  transactions  (including  accelerated  share  repurchasetransactions) or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives.
During
 the three months ended December  31, 2017 ,  we repurchased approximately  $922 million  of  our common stock under our July 2017 stock repurchase program.As
 of December  31, 2017 ,  a total of approximately $1.7  billion remained  available for future repurchases of our common stock under our July 2017 stock repurchaseprogram. In January 2018, our Board authorized a $6.0 billion stock repurchase program. The stock repurchase program has no expiration from the date of authorization.
We
 expect, subject to market conditions and other uncertainties, to continue making opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock. However, ourstock
 repurchase programs may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety offactors, including corporate and regulatory requirements, price and other market conditions and management’s determination as to the appropriate use of our cash.

Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange RatesOur commerce platforms operate globally, resulting in certain revenues that are den
ominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound, euro,
 Korean won and Australian dollar ,  subjecting us to foreign currency risk which may impact our financial results. Because of this and the factthat we
 generated a majority of our net revenues internationally during the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 ,  we are subject to therisks related to doing business in foreign cou
ntries as discussed under “Item 1A: Risk Factors.”In addition to
 the corresponding measures under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management uses non-GAAP measuresin reviewing our financial results.
 The foreign exchange neutral (“FX-Neutral”), or constant currency, net revenue amounts discussed below are non-GAAP
 financial measures and are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, the FX-Neutral
 information appearing in the following discussion of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information provided in“Non-GAAP
 Measure of Financial Performance,” which includes reconciliations of FX-Neutral financial measures to the most directly comparableGAAP measures. We
 calculate the year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements using prior period foreign currency rates applied to currentyear transactional currency amounts.
The
 effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements during 2017 was due to strengthening of the U.S. dollar, in the first half of the year,against
 other currencies, primarily the British pound and euro, partially offset by weakening of the U.S. dollar in the second half of the year, againstother currencies, primarily the euro.
Fiscal Year Highlights
Net
 revenues  increased   7%  to   $9.6  billion  in  2017  compared  to  2016,  primarily  driven  by  Marketplace  net  transaction  revenues  andClassifi
eds marketing services and other revenues. FX-Neutral net revenues increased 7% in 2017 compared to 2016. Operating margin decreasedto 23.7% in 2017 compared to 25.9% in 2016.
In
 the fourth quarter of 2017, we recognized a provisional income tax charge of $3.1 billion related to  the enactment of the Tax Cuts and JobsAct.
 In addition, in the first quarter of 2017, related to the continued realignment of our legal structure, we achieved a step-up in the tax basis of theintangible assets in our foreign Class
ifieds platforms and recognized a tax benefit of $695 million.In 2017,
 we also received a 5.44% ownership interest in Flipkart in exchange for our eBay India business and a $500 million cash investment,resulting
 in a cost method investment of $725 million. The gain on disposal of our eBay India business of $167 million was recorded in interest andother, net on our consolidated statement of income.
Also
 in  2017,  we  issued  unsecured  notes  in  an  aggregate  principal  amount  of  $2.5  billion.  In  addition,  $1.5  billion  of  previously  issuedunsecured notes due in 2017 matured an
d were repaid.Diluted
 earnings per share from continuing operations decreased to a loss per share of $0.95 in  2017 compared to earnings per share of$6.37 
in 2016. We generated cash flow from continuing op erating activities of $3.1 billion in 2017 compared to  $2.8 billion  in 2016. 38

RESULTS OF OPERATIONSNet Revenues
We
 generate  two  types  of  net  revenues:  net  transaction  revenues  and  marketing  services  and  other  (“MS&O”)  revenues.  Net  transactionrevenues
 are derived principally from final value fees (which are fees payable on transactions closed on our Marketplace and StubHub platforms),listing
 fees  and  other  service  fees.  MS&O  revenues  consists  of  Marketplace,  StubHub  and  Classifieds  revenue  principally  from  the  sale  ofadvertisements,
 vehicles classifieds listing on Marketplace platforms, revenue sharing arrangements, classifieds fees, marketing service fees andlead
 referral fees. Revenues are attributed to U.S. and international geographies primarily based upon the country in which the seller, platform thatdisplays advertising, other service provider or customer
, as the case may be, is located. To drive traffic to our platforms, we provide incentives to ourusers in the form of coupons and buyer and seller rewards. These ince
ntives are generally treated as reductions in revenue.The following table presents net revenu

(1)We  define Gross Merchandise Volume (“GMV”) as the total value of all successfully closed transactions between users on our Marketplace and StubHub platforms duringthe
 applicable period regardless of whether the buyer and seller actually consummated the transaction. We believe that GMV provides a useful measure of the overallvolume
 of  closed  transactions  that  flow  through  our  platforms  in  a  given  period,  notwithstanding  the  inclusion  in  GMV  of  closed  transactions  that  are  not  ultimatelyconsummated.

We define Marketplace transaction take rate as Marketplace net transaction revenues divided by Marketplace GMV. (3)
We define StubHub transaction take rate as StubHub net transaction revenues divided by StubHub GMV.(4)

 increase in net transaction revenues in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in Marketplace GMV. Total transactiontake rate was flat in 2017 compared to 2016.
The
 increase  in  net  transaction  revenues  in  2016  compared  to  2015  was  primarily  driven  by  an  increase  in  StubHub  GMV  and  a  highertransactio
n take rate, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar. The total transaction takerate was
 higher in 2016 compared to 2015 due to an increase in our StubHub transaction take rate, partially offset by a decrease in our Marketplacetransaction take rate.
Net
 transaction  revenues  earned  internationally  totaled $4.0  billion , $3.8  billion and $3.8  billion in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 ,  respectively,representing 
53% , 54% and 55% of  total net transaction revenues in the respective  periods. The decrease in net transaction  revenues earnedinternationally as a percentage of total
 net transaction revenue in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by growth in net transaction revenuesearned
 domestically  and  an  unfavorable  impact  from  foreign  currency  movements  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar.  The  decrease  in  net  transactionrevenues
 earned internationally as a percentage of total net transaction revenue in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by an unfavorableimpact from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar.

 increase in Marketplace net transaction revenues in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to Marketplace GMV growth, partiallyoffset
 by hedging activity and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar. Marketplace transaction take ratein 2017 compared to 2016 was relatively flat.
The
 increase  in  Marketplace  net  transaction  revenues  in  2016  compared  to  2015  was  primarily  driven  by  an  increase  in  volume  in  localcurrencies
 on our Marketplace platforms internationally, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency movements relative to theU.S.
 dollar. The increase in FX-Neutral Marketplace net transaction revenue was less than the increase in FX-Neutral Marketplace GMV due to alower Marketplace transaction
 take rate. The Marketplace transaction take rate was lower in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a shift in sellermix and an increase in our buyer and seller inc
entives.StubHub Net Transaction Revenues

 increase in StubHub net transaction revenues in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in StubHub take rate andStubHub
 GMV. The increase in StubHub transaction take rate in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to pricing strategies and a decrease inour
 buyer incentives, which are accounted for as a reduction of revenue. The increase in StubHub GMV in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarilydriven by Theater and Concerts, partially offset by Sports.
The
 increase in StubHub net transaction revenues in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by an increase in Sports, Concerts andTheater transactio
ns on our platform, as well as a higher StubHub transaction take rate. The increase in StubHub transaction take rate was primarilydue
 to a change in mix of events and sellers on the StubHub platforms. The increase in StubHub net transaction revenue was greater than theincrease in StubHub GMV due to the higher StubH

 increase in total MS&O revenues in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by an increase in Classifieds MS&O revenues and afavorable
 impact from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar. The increase in total MS&O revenues in 2016 compared to 2015 wasprimarily
 attributable to an increase in Classifieds MS&O revenues and Marketplace MS&O revenues, partially offset by an unfavorable impact fromforeign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar.
Marketplace MS&O Revenues
The
 increase in Marketplace MS&O revenues in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by an increase in revenues attributable to ourfirst-party
 inventory program in Korea and, to a lesser extent, our Brands4friends online shopping community. The increase in Marketplace MS&Orevenues
 in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by increased fees earned for referral services and increased revenue from our revenueshare
 programs, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar. The increase in fees earnedfor
 referral services primarily consisted of fees for customers acquired and incentives for the usage of PayPal Holdings, Inc. (“PayPal”) products oncertain Marketplace platforms, which
 were not included in marketing services and other revenues prior to the distribution of 100% of the outstandingcommon stock of PayPal to our stockholders (the “Distribution”).
Classifieds MS&O Revenues
The
 increase  in  Classifieds  MS&O  revenues  in  2017  compared  to  2016  was  primarily  driven  by  increased  revenue  from  our  Classifiedsplatforms
 in Germany. The increase in Classifieds MS&O revenues in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by increased revenue from ourClassifieds
 platforms in our developed markets of Germany, Canada and Australia, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currencymovements relative to the U.S. dollar.
Cost of Net Revenues
Cost
 of  net  revenues  primarily  consists  of  costs  associated  with  customer  support,  site  operations,  and  payment  processing.  Significantcomponents
 of these costs include employee compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs, depreciation of equipment and amortization expense,bank
 transaction  fees,  and  credit  card  interchange  and  assessment  fees.  The  following  table  presents  cost  of  net  revenues  (in  millions,  exceptpercentages):

23.2 %    22.4 %    20.6 %The
 increase in cost of net revenues in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in costs of goods sold driven by our first-party inventory program in Korea and our Brands4friends on

and increased investments in site operations. The increase in cost of net revenues in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to our continuedinvestment in site operations and data centers and an i
ncrease in transaction fees for payment services. 
Cost
 of net revenues, net of  $3  million  from  hedging  activities,  was  unfavorably  impacted  by  $19  million  attributable  to  foreign  currencymovements
 relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar  in 2017 compared  to  2016. Cost  of net  revenues,  net of  $4 million from  hedging activities,  was favorablyimpacted by $16 million due to foreign currency movements relativ

16 compared to 2015.Sales and Marketing
 
Sales
 and  marketing  expenses  primarily  consist  of  advertising  and  marketing  program  costs  (both  online  and  offline),  employeecompensation,
 contractor  costs,  facilities  costs  and  depreciation  on  equipment.  Online  marketing  expenses  represent  traffic  acquisition  costs  invarious
 channels  such  as  paid  search,  affiliates  marketing  and  display  advertising.  Offline  advertising  primarily  includes  brand  campaigns  andbuyer/seller communications.
The
 increase in sales and marketing expense in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in brand spend and employee-related costs.
 The increase in sales and marketing expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to an increase in marketing program costs(both online and offline programs) partially offset by a favorable imp
act from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar.Product Development
 
Product
 development expenses primarily consist of employee compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs and depreciation on equipment.Product
 development  expenses  are  net  of  required  capitalization  of  major  platform  and  other  product  development  efforts,  including  thedevelopment
 of our platform architecture, migration of certain platforms, and seller tools. Our top technology priorities include artificial intelligence,voice and image technology, virtual an
d augmented reality and distributed commerce.Capitalized internal use
 and platform development costs were $140 million and $137 million in 2017 and 2016 , respectively, and are primarily reflected as a cost of net revenues when amortized in future periods.
The
 increase in product development expenses in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs. Theincrease in product development expe
nses in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due43

to higher employee-related costs driven by increased headcount; and increased depreciation on equipment driven by capital expenditures as wecontinued to invest in our platform.
General and Administrative
 
General and administrative expenses primarily co
nsist of employee compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs, depreciation of equipment,employer
 payroll  taxes  on  stock-based  compensation,  legal  expenses,  restructuring,  insurance  premiums  and  professional  fees.  Our  legalexpenses, including those relate
d to various ongoing legal proceedings, may fluctuate substantially from period to period.The
 increase in general and administrative expenses in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to increased data, information security andemployee-related costs, as well as costs related to the integration of prior perio
d acquisitions and ongoing realignment of our legal structure.The
 decrease in general and administrative expenses in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to restructuring expenses from our globalworkforce reduction,
 costs related to the Distribution and expenses related to litigation proceedings in 2015 that did not recur in 2016. The reductionin these expenses were partially offset by
 an increase in corporate costs in 2016 due to a reduction in synergies that existed prior to the Distribution.  
Provision for Transaction Losses
Provision
 for transaction losses primarily consists of transaction loss expense associated with our customer protection programs, fraud andbad
 debt expense associated with our accounts receivable balance. We expect our provision for transaction losses to fluctuate depending on manyfactors, including changes to our customer protection programs and the impact of regulatory cha
nges.The increase in provision for
 transaction losses in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to higher customer protection program costs andan
 increase in costs related to uncollectible accounts. The decrease in provision for transaction losses in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarilydriven by lower customer protection program costs.
Interest and Other, Net
 
Interest
 and  other,  net  primarily  consists  of  interest  earned  on  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  investments,  as  well  as  foreign  exchangetransaction
 gains and losses, our portion of operating results from investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting, investmentgain/loss
 on  acquisitions  or  disposals  and  interest  expense,  consisting  of  interest  charges  on  any  amounts  borrowed  and  commitment  fees  onunborrowed
 amounts  under  our  credit  agreement  and  interest  expense  on  our  outstanding  debt  securities  and  commercial  paper,  if  any.  Thefollowing table presents interest and other, net (in milli

The
 increase in interest and other, net in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the $1.3 billion pre-tax gain from the sale of our equityholdings
 of MercadoLibre, Inc., and our hedging strategy, partially offset by an increase in interest expense related to the issuance of senior notesduring the first quarter of 2016.

Income Tax ProvisionThe following table presents provisi
on for income taxes (in millions, except percentages): 
Year Ended December 31,  
2017   2016   2015 Income tax provision (benefit)
$ 3,288  $(3,634 )  $459 Effective tax rate
144.5 %   (99.5 )%   19.1 %The
 increase in our effective tax rate in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to a $3.1 billion tax charge for the impacts of the Tax Cutsand
 Jobs Act (the “Act” or “U.S. tax reform”), enacted on December 22, 2017. Additionally, the 2017 effective tax rate was impacted by the increasein our
 foreign tax rate as we no longer benefit from certain tax rulings and a noncash income tax charge of $376 million due to the foreign exchangeremeasureme
nt of our deferred tax assets, partially offset by the recognition in the first quarter of 2017 of deferred tax assets of approximately $695million 
.The
 decrease  in  our  effective  tax  rate  in  2016  compared  to  2015  was  primarily  due  to  the  recognition  in  2016  of  deferred  tax  assets  ofapproximately
 $4.6 billion as a result of the realignment of our legal structure and the associated tax agreements. This was partially offset by the$485 million tax effect on the $1.3 billion g
ain on the sale of our equity holdings of MercadoLibre, Inc. 
During
 the fourth quarter of 2016, we began the process of realigning our legal structure, subsequent to the distribution of PayPal Holdings,Inc.,
 to better reflect how we manage and operate our platforms. We consider many factors in effecting this realignment, including foreign exchangeexposures,
 long-term cash flows and cash needs of our platforms, capital allocation considerations and the associated tax effects. As a result, weachieved
 a substantial step-up in the tax basis of the intangible assets in our foreign eBay platforms in 2016. The step-up in tax basis of our foreigneBay platforms
 resulted from our election to terminate an existing tax ruling and finalize a new agreement with the foreign tax authority. In the fourthquarter
 of 2016, we recognized a tax benefit of $4.6 billion, which represented the income tax effect of this step-up in tax basis. During the first halfof 2017, we recognized a noncash inc
ome tax charge of $376 million caused by the foreign exchange remeasurement of the associated deferred taxasset.
 In the first quarter of 2017, we achieved a step-up in the tax basis of the intangible assets in our foreign Classifieds platforms as a result ofvoluntary domiciling our Classifie
ds intangible assets into a new jurisdiction and recognized a tax benefit of $695 million.As
 a result of the realignment, we no longer benefit from tax rulings previously concluded in several different jurisdictions. Without the benefitof
 the  rulings,  the  noncash  tax  impacts  of  the  realignment  in  our  foreign  eBay  and  Classifieds  platforms  have  increased  our  income  tax  rate  incertain
 foreign  jurisdictions,  most  significantly  Switzerland.  The  higher  rate  results  from  eBay  being  subject  to  a  higher  enacted  tax  rate  for  theforeseeable future.
While
 we  experienced  a  higher  tax  rate,  the  realignment  allows  us  to  achieve  certain  cash  tax  benefits  due  to  the  step-up  in  tax  basisachieved
 in certain foreign jurisdictions. We expect these foreign cash tax benefits to remain consistent, subject to the performance of our foreignplatforms 
,  for  a  period  in  excess  of  10  years.  The  realignment  is  expected  to  extend  into  2018  and  primarily  impact  our  international  entities.However,
 U.S.  tax  reform  and  the  new  U.S.  minimum  tax  on  foreign  earnings  discussed  below  will  reduce  our  expected  consolidated  cash  taxbenefits.

 tax  reform,  among  other  things,  reduces  the  U.S.  federal  income  tax  rate  to  21%  from  35%  in  2018,  institutes  a  dividends  receiveddeductio
n for foreign earnings with a related tax for the deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings, and creates a new U.S. minimum tax onearnings
 of foreign subsidiaries. We have not completed our accounting for the effects of the Act; however, we have made reasonable estimates ofthose effects.
 Accordingly, we have recognized a provisional income tax charge of $3.1 billion ,  which is included as a component of the income taxprovision on our consolidated statement of income.
Included
 in  the  provisional  amount  is  $1.4  billion  for  the  income  tax  on  the  deemed  repatriation  of  unremitted  foreign  earnings.  We  havecomputed
 the amount based on information available to us; however, there is still uncertainty as to the application of the Act. Further, we have notyet completed our analysis of the components of the tax computation.
45

The  remaining  provisional  amount  of  $1.7  billion  is  for  the  deferred  income  tax  effects  of  the  Act,  primarily  the  impact  of  the  new  U.S.minimum
 tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by the reversal of our existing deferred tax liability associated with repatriation ofunremitted
 foreign  earnings.  We  have  computed  the  amount  based  on  information  available  to  us;  however,  there  is  still  uncertainty  as  to  theapplication of the Act. Further,
 we have not yet completed our analysis of the components of the tax computation, including a complete reconciliationof
 the book and tax bases in our foreign subsidiaries .  As we complete our analysis of U.S. tax reform in 2018, we may make adjustments to theprovisional
 amounts, which may materially impact our provision for income taxes from continuing operations in the period in which the adjustmentsare made.
Our
 provision for income taxes differs from the provision computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to lowertax
 rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in certain lower-tax jurisdictions outside the U.S. The impact on our provision forincome taxes of foreign income being taxed at different rates than the U.S. federal statutory rate was a benefit of approximate
ly $217 million in 2017,$451
 million in 2016 and $549 million in 2015. The foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates that had the most significant impact on our provision forincome
 taxes in the periods presented include Switzerland. See “Note 15 - Income Taxes” to the consolidated financial statements included in thisreport for more information on our tax rate reconciliation.
Our
 relative pretax earnings and revenues attributable to the U.S. as compared to the rest of the world may differ over time. In general,these
 differences are attributable to higher amortization of U.S. based intangible assets, larger stock-based compensation expense recorded in theU.S. for
 U.S. based employees, overhead related to our corporate operations which are primarily U.S. based and higher average margins earned bynon-U.S.
 businesses.  For  the  year  ended  December  31,  2017,  our  U.S.  share  of  pretax  income  and  net  revenues  was 18.4% and 42.8% , respectively.
 The difference in relative pretax income and net revenues attributable to the U.S. as compared to the rest of the world for 2017 wasprimarily
 due to the general drivers discussed above. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our U.S. share of pretax income and net revenueswas 
41.9% and 43.1% ,  respectively. The difference in relative pretax income and net revenues attributable to the U.S., as compared to the rest ofthe
 world for 2016, was primarily related to the general drivers discussed above, as well as a $979 million gain on the sale of the U.S. portion of ourequity holdings of MercadoLibre, Inc. in 2016.
From
 time to time we engage in certain intercompany transactions. We consider many factors when evaluating these transactions. Thesetransactions
 may impact our tax rate and/or result in additional cash tax payments. The impact in any period may be significant. These transactionsare complex and the impact of such transactions on future periods may be difficult to estimate.
We
 are regularly under examination by tax authorities both domestically and internationally. We believe that adequate amounts have beenreserved
 for any adjustments that may ultimately result from these examinations, although we cannot assure you that this will be the case given theinherent uncertainties in these examinations. Due to 
the ongoing tax examinations, we believe it is impractical to determine the amount and timing ofthese adjustments.
Non-GAAP Measure of Financial Performance
To
 supplement  our  consolidated  financial  statements  presented  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  we  use  FX-Neutral
 net revenues, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Management uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures in reviewing our financialresults.
 We define FX-Neutral net revenues as net revenues minus the exchange rate effect. We define exchange rate effect as the year-over-yearimpact of foreign currency movements using prior period foreign currency rates appli
ed to current year transactional currency amounts.These
 non-GAAP  measures  are  not  in  accordance  with,  or  an  alternative  to,  measures  prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP  and  may  bedifferent
 from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set ofaccounting
 rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results ofoperations
 as determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction withthe corresponding GAAP measures.
These
 non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors’ overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospectsfor
 the future. Specifically, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding theforeign
 currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook. In addition, because we havehistorically reported
46

certain non-GAAP results to investors, we believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP measures provide consistency in our financial reporting.The

Continuing Operating Activities
The
 net cash provided by continuing operating activities of  $3.1  billion in 2017  was  primarily due to $1.1 billion of changes in assets andliabilities,
 net  of  acquisition  effects,  and  a  net  loss  of  $1.0  billion  offset  by  adjustments  of  $1.7  billion  in  deferred  income  taxes,  $676  million  indepreciation and amortization and $
483 million in stock-based compensation.The net cash
 provided by continuing operating activities of $2.8 billion in 2016 was primarily due to net income of $7.3 billion with adjustmentsfor
 $682 million in depreciation and amortization, $416 million in stock-based compensation and $20 million in changes in assets and liabilities, netof
 acquisition  effects,  partially  offset  by  a  decrease  of  $4.6  billion  related  to  deferred  income  taxes  and  $1.2  billion  related  to  gain  on  sale  ofinvestments.
The net cash
 provided by continuing operating activities of $2.9 billion in 2015 was due primarily to net income of $1.7 billion with adjustmentsfor
 loss from discontinued operations of $222 million, $687 million in depreciation and amortization, $379 million in stock-based compensation and$271
 million in provision for transaction losses and a decrease of $195 million related to gain on sale of investments and $106 million in changes inassets and liabilities, net of acquisitio
n effects.Cash paid for income taxes in 
2017 , 2016 and 2015 was $308 million , $492 million and $256 million , respectively. Continuing Investing Activities
The
 net cash used in continuing investing activities of $1.3  billion in 2017 was  primarily due to cash paid for property and equipment of $666 million 
and cash paid for our equity investment in Flipkart of $514 mill ion.The
 net cash used in continuing investing activities of $2.0 billion in 2016 was primarily due to cash paid for investments of $11.2 billion,property
 and equipment of $626 million and net cash paid for acquisition of businesses of $212 million, partially offset by proceeds of $10.1 billionfrom the maturities and sales of investments.
The net cash used in continuing inv
esting activities of $673 million in 2015 was due primarily to cash paid for purchases of investments of $6.7billion,
 purchases  of  property  and  equipment  of  $668  million  and  net  cash  paid  for  acquisition  of  businesses  of  $24  million,  partially  offset  byproceeds of $6.8 billion from the maturities and sales of investments.
The
 largely  offsetting  effects  of  purchases  of  investments  and  maturities  and  sale  of  investments  results  from  the  management  of  ourinvestments. As our immediate cash needs change, purchase a
nd sale activity will fluctuate.48

Continuing Financing ActivitiesThe
 net  cash  used  in  continuing  financing  activities  of $1.8  billion in 2017 was  primarily  due  to  $2.7  billion  of  cash  used  to  repurchasecommon stock and $1.5 billion of cash used to repay outstand
ing debt, partially offset by $2.5 billion of cash proceeds from debt issuances.The net cash used in continuing fina
ncing activities of $744 million in 2016 was primarily due to $2.9 billion of cash paid to repurchasecommon stock, partially offset by $2.2 billion of proceeds from debt issuances.
The
 net cash used in continuing financing activities of $3.0 billion in 2015 was due primarily to cash outflows from $2.1 billion to repurchasecommon
 stock, $850 million payment of debt upon maturity and cash paid for tax withholdings in the amount of $245 million related to net sharesettlements
 of  restricted  stock  units and awards.  These cash outflows  were partially  offset  by cash inflows of  $221 million from  the  issuance ofcommon stock in connection with the exercise of stock options and the effect of $74 milli
on of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.The
 favorable effect of exchange rate movements on cash and cash equivalents was due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against othercurrencies,
 primarily the euro and Korean won, during 2017. The unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates on our cash and cash equivalentsduring
 2016  was  due  to  the  strengthening  of  the  U.S.  dollar  against  other  currencies,  primarily  the  euro.  The  unfavorable  impact  of  currencyexchang
e rates on our cash and cash equivalents during 2015 was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, primarily theeuro.
Stock Repurchases
In
 July  2016,  our  Board  authorized  a  $2.5  billion  stock  repurchase  program  and  in  July  2017,  our  Board  authorized  an  additional  $3.0billion
 stock  repurchase  program.  These  stock  repurchase  programs  have  no  expiration  from  the  date  of  authorization.  Our  stock  repurchaseprograms
 are intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditionsand
 other factors, to make opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock to reduce our outstanding share count. Any sharerepurchases
 under our stock repurchase programs may be made through open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions(including
 accelerated share repurchase transactions) or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and will befunded from our working capital or other financing alternativ
es.During 
2017 ,  we repurchased approximately  $2.7  billion  of  our common stock under our stock repurchase programs. As of December 31, 2017 
,  a total of approximately $1.7 billion remained  available for future repurchases of our common stock under our July 2017 repurchase programand
 no amounts remained under our July 2016 repurchase program. In January 2018, our board of directors authorized an additional  $6.0 billion  stock repurchase program, with no expiration from the date of authorization.
We
 expect,  subject  to  market  conditions  and  other  uncertainties,  to  continue  making  opportunistic  and  programmatic  repurchases  of  ourcommon
 stock.  However,  our  stock  repurchase  programs  may  be  limited  or  terminated  at  any  time  without  prior  notice.  The  timing  and  actualnumber
 of  shares  repurchased  will  depend  on  a  variety  of  factors,  including  corporate  and  regulatory  requirements,  price  and  other  marketconditions and management’s determin
ation as to the appropriate use of our cash.  Shelf Registration Statement and Long-Term Debt
As
 of December  31, 2017 ,  we had an effective shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission that allowsus to
 issue various types of debt securities, as well as common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares representing fractional interest inshares
 of  preferred  stock,  purchase  contracts  and  units  from  time  to  time  in  one  or  more  offerings.  Each  issuance  under  the  shelf  registrationstatement
 will  require  the  filing  of  a  prospectus  supplement  identifying  the  amount  and  terms  of  the  securities  to  be  issued.  The  registrationstatement
 does not limit the amount of securities that may be issued thereunder. Our ability to issue securities is subject to market conditions andother factors including, in the case of our debt securities, our credit ratings and compli
ance with the covenants in our credit agreement.Senior Notes
As
 of December  31, 2017 ,  we had floating- and fixed-rate senior notes outstanding for an aggregate principal amount of $10.1  billion . The net proceeds from the issuances of these senior notes are used for general corporate
49

purposes,  including,  among  other  things,  capital  expenditures,  share  repurchases,  repayment  of  indebtedness  and  possible  acquisitions.  Thefloating rate notes are
 not redeemable prior to maturity. On and after March 1, 2021, we may redeem some or all of the 6.000% fixed rate notes due 2056
 at  any  time  and  from  time  to  time  prior  to  their  maturity,  at  a  redemption  price  equal  to  100%  of  the  principal  amount  of  the  notes  to  beredeemed,
 plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may redeem some or all of the other fixed rate notes of each series at any time and from time totime
 prior to their maturity, generally at a make-whole redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest. If a change of control triggering eventoccurs
 with respect to the 2.500% fixed rate notes due 2018, the 2.150% fixed rate notes due 2020, the 3.800% fixed rate notes due 2022, thefloating rate
 notes due 2023, the 2.750% fixed rate notes due 2023, the 3.600% fixed rate notes due 2027 or the 6.000% fixed rate notes due 2056,we
 must, subject to certain exceptions, offer to repurchase all of the notes of the applicable series at a price equal to 101% of the principal amountplus
 accrued  and  unpaid  interest.  For  additional  details  related  to  our  senior  notes,  please  see  “Note  11  –  Debt”  to  the  consolidated  financialstatements included in this report.
To
 help achieve our interest rate risk management objectives, in connection with the previous issuance of certain senior notes, we enteredinto
 interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted $2.4 billion of the fixed rate notes to floating rate debt based on the London InterBankOffered
 Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a spread. These swaps were designated as fair value hedges against changes in the fair value of certain fixed ratesenior notes resulting from changes in interest rates.
The
 indenture  pursuant  to  which  the  senior  notes  were  issued  includes  customary  covenants  that,  among  other  things  and  subject  toexceptions,
 limit our ability to incur, assume or guarantee debt secured by liens on specified assets or enter into sale and lease-back transactionswith respect to specified properties, and also inclu
des customary events of default.Commercial Paper
We have an up to 
$1.5 billion commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue commercial pap er notes with maturities of up to 397 days
 from the date of issue in an aggregate principal amount at maturity of up to $1.5  billion outstanding  at any time. As of December  31, 2017 , there were no commercial paper notes outstanding.
Credit Agreement
In
 November 2015, we entered into a credit agreement that provides for an unsecured $2  billion five-year  revolving credit facility. We mayalso,
 subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders, increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to an aggregate amountof 
$1 billion .  Funds borrowed under the credit agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other generalcorporate purposes.
As of 
December 31, 2017 ,  no borrowings were outstanding under our $2 billion credit agreement.  However, as described above, we have anup
 to $1.5  billion commercial  paper program and therefore maintain $1.5  billion of  available borrowing capacity under our credit agreement in orderto repay commercial paper borrowings in the event we are una
ble to repay those borrowings from other sources when they become due. As a result,$500 million 
of borrowing capacity was availabl e as of December 31, 2017 for other purposes permitted by the credit agreement.  Loans
 under the credit agreement bear interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin (based on our public debt credit ratings) ranging from 0.875 percent
 to 1.5 percent or (ii) a formula based on the agent bank’s prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5 percent or LIBOR plus 1.0 percent, plus a
 margin (based on our public debt credit ratings) ranging from zero percent to 0.5 percent. The credit agreement will terminate and allamounts
 owing thereunder will be due and payable on November 9, 2020, unless (a) the commitments are terminated earlier, either at our requestor,
 if an event of default occurs, by the lenders (or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy-related events of default), or (b) the maturity dateis
 extended  upon  our  request,  subject  to  the  agreement  of  the  lenders.  The  credit  agreement  includes  customary  representations,  warranties,affirmative
 and  negative  covenants,  including  financial  covenants,  events  of  default  and  indemnification  provisions  in  favor  of  the  banks.  Thenegative
 covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and subsidiary indebtedness, in each case, subject to certain exceptions.The
 financial covenants require us to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and a maximumconsolidated
 leverage ratio. The events of default include the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the credit agreement) with respect tous.
We were in compliance with all covena
nts in our outstanding debt instruments for the period ended December 31, 2017 . 50

Credit RatingsAs
 of December  31, 2017 ,  we were rated investment grade by Standard and Poor’s Financial Services, LLC (long-term rated BBB+, short-term
 rated  A-2,  with  a  stable  outlook),  Moody’s  Investor  Service  (long-term  rated  Baa1,  short-term  rated  P-2,  with  a  stable  outlook),  and  FitchRatings,
 Inc. (long-term  rated BBB, short-term  rated F-2, with a stable outlook). We disclose these ratings to enhance the understanding of oursources
 of liquidity and the effects of our ratings on our costs of funds. Our borrowing costs depend, in part, on our credit ratings and any furtheractions taken by these credit rating agencies to lower our credit ratings, as descri
bed above, will likely increase our borrowing costs. Commitments and Contingencies
We
 have  certain  fixed  contractual  obligations  and  commitments  that  include  future  estimated  payments  for  general  operating  purposes.Changes
 in  our  business  needs,  contractual  cancellation  provisions,  fluctuating  interest  rates,  and  other  factors  may  result  in  actual  paymentsdiffering
 from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments. The following table summarizes ourfixed contractual obligations and commitments (in milli

  $13,551   $311  $651  $14,513 The significant assumptions used in our determin
ation of amounts presented in the above table are as follows:•
Debt amounts include the principal and interest amounts of the respective debt instruments. For additional details related to our debt,please
 see  “Note  11  –  Debt”  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in  this  report.  This  table  does  not  reflect  any  amountspayable
 under our $2 billion revolving credit facility or $1.5 billion commercial paper program, for which no borrowings were outstandingas of 
December 31, 2017 . •
Lease amounts include minimum rental payments under our non-cancelable operating leases for office facilities, fulfillment centers, aswell
 as computer and office equipment that we utilize under lease arrangements. The amounts presented are consistent with contractualterms
 and  are  not  expected  to  differ  significantly  from  actual  results  under  our  existing  leases,  unless  a  substantial  change  in  ourheadcount needs requires us to expan
d our occupied space or exit an office facility early.•
Purchase  obligation  amounts  include  minimum  purchase  commitments  for  advertising,  capital  expenditures  (computer  equipment,software
 applications,  engineering  development  services,  construction  contracts)  and  other  goods  and  services  entered  into  in  theordinary course of business.
As
 we  are  unable  to  reasonably  predict  the  timing  of  settlement  of  liabilities  related  to  unrecognized  tax  benefits,  net,  the  table  does  notinclude $481 million of such n
on-current liabilities included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 . Liquidity and Capital Resou
rce RequirementsAs
 of December  31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 ,  we had assets classified as cash and cash equivalents, as well as short-term and long-term
 non-equity  investments,  in  an  aggregate  amount  of $11.3  billion and $11.0  billion ,  respectively.  As  of December  31,  2017 ,  this  amountincluded assets held in certain of our foreign o
perations totaling approximately $9.1 billion . As a result of U.S. tax reform, the $9.1 billion held by our non-U.S.
 subsidiaries was subject to current tax in the U.S. in 2017. As of December  31, 2017 ,  we had not repatriated any of these funds to theU.S. However, to the extent we repatriate these funds to the U.S., we will be required to pay income taxes in certai
n U.S.51

states and applicable foreign withholding taxes on those amounts during the period when such repatriation occurs. We have accrued provisionaldeferred taxes for the tax effect of repatriating the funds to the U.S.
We
 actively monitor all counterparties that hold our cash and cash equivalents and non-equity investments, focusing primarily on the safety ofprincipal
 and  secondarily  on  improving  yield  on  these  assets.  We  diversify  our  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  investments  among  variouscounterparties
 in  order  to  reduce  our  exposure  should  any  one  of  these  counterparties  fail  or  encounter  difficulties.  To  date,  we  have  notexperienced
 any material  loss or lack of access  to our invested cash,  cash equivalents  or short-term  investments;  however, we can provide noassurances
 that access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financialmarkets.
 At any point  in time  we have funds  in our operating  accounts  and customer  accounts  that  are  deposited and invested  with third  partyfinancial institutions.
We
 believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments, together with cash expected to be generatedfrom
 operations,  borrowings  available  under  our  credit  agreement  and  commercial  paper  program,  and  our  access  to  capital  markets,  will  besufficient to fund our operating activities, anticipated cap
ital expenditures and stock repurchases for the foreseeable future. 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of 
December 31, 2017 ,  we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future materialeffect on our consolidated financial con
dition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.We
 have  a  cash  pooling  arrangement  with  a  financial  institution  for  cash  management  purposes.  This  arrangement  allows  for  cashwithdrawals
 from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the same financial institution (“AggregateCash Deposits”). This arrangement also
 allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the Aggregate Cash Deposits up to an agreed-upon limit. The netbalance
 of the withdrawals and the Aggregate Cash Deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expenseor
 income  under  the  arrangement.  As  of December  31,  2017 ,  we  had  a  total  of $1.9  billion in  cash  withdrawals  offsetting  our $2.1  billion in Aggregate Cash Deposits held w
ithin the financial institution under the cash pooling arrangement.Indemnification Provisions
We
 entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements with PayPal to govern the separation and relationshipof the two
 companies going forward. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between usand
 PayPal,  which  may  be  significant.  In  addition,  the  indemnity  rights  we  have  against  PayPal  under  the  agreements  may  not  be  sufficient  toprotect us and our indemnity obligations to PayP
al may be significant.In
 addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors, executive officers and certain other officers. Theseagreements require
 us to indemnify such individuals, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, for certain liabilities to which they may becomesubject as a result of their affiliation with us.
In the ordinary course of business, we have included limited indemnificat
ion provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with which wehave
 commercial relations, including our standard marketing, promotions and application-programming-interface license agreements. Under thesecontracts,
 we generally indemnify, hold harmless and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnifiedparty
 in connection with claims by a third party with respect to our domain names, trademarks, logos and other branding elements to the extent thatsuch
 marks  are  applicable  to  our  performance  under  the  subject  agreement.  In  certain  cases,  we  have  agreed  to  provide  indemnification  forintellectual
 property  infringement.  It  is  not  possible  to  determine  the  maximum  potential  loss  under  these  indemnification  provisions  due  to  ourlimited
 history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. To date, losses recordedin our consolidated statement of income in connection with our indemnification provis
ions have not been significant, either individually or collectively.52

Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and EstimatesGeneral
The
 preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions thataffect
 the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We have basedour
 estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results ofwhich
 form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Oursenior management has discussed the deve
lopment, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
An accounting policy is considered to be
 critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that arehighly
 uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accountingestimates
 that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. We believe the followingcritical
 accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.The
 following  descriptions  of  critical  accounting  policies,  judgments  and  estimates  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  our  consolidated  financialstatements and related notes and other disclosures incl
uded in this report.Revenue Recognition
We
 may  enter  into  certain  revenue  transactions,  primarily  related  to  certain  advertising  contracts,  that  are  considered  multiple  elementarrangements (arrangements with more
 than one deliverable). We also may enter into arrangements to purchase goods and/or services from certaincustomers.
 As a result, significant interpretation and judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for these transactionsincluding: (1)
 how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among potential multiple deliverables; (2) developing an estimate of the stand-alone
 selling price of each deliverable; (3) whether revenue should be reported gross (as eBay is acting as a principal), or net (as eBay is acting asan
 agent); (4) when we provide cash consideration to our customers, determining whether we are receiving an identifiable benefit that is separablefrom the customer’s purchase of our products and/or services and for which we can reasonably estimate fair val
ue; and (5) whether the arrangementwould
 be characterized as revenue or reimbursement of costs incurred. Changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimatescould impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition.
Income Taxes
Our
 annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions inwhich
 we  operate.  Tax  laws  are  complex  and  subject  to  different  interpretations  by  the  taxpayer  and  respective  government  taxing  authorities.Significant judgment is required in determining our 
tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review ourtax
 positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax ratesthat
 apply to our foreign earnings. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, our income tax rate depends on the extent that our earningsare
 indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s judgment about and intentions concerning ourfuture
 operations. As a result of U.S. tax reform and the current U.S. taxation of deemed repatriated earnings, management has no specific plans toindefinitely reinvest the undistributed e
arnings of our foreign subsidiaries at the balance sheet date.Deferred
 tax  assets  represent  amounts  available  to  reduce  income  taxes  payable  on  taxable  income  in  future  years.  Such  assets  arisebecause
 of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and taxcredit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverabil
ity of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxableincome
 from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies.These
 sources of income rely heavily on estimates that are based on a number of factors, including our historical experience and short-range andlong-range
 business forecasts. As of December  31, 2017 ,  we had a valuation allowance on certain loss carryforwards based on our assessmentthat it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
53

We  recognize  and  measure  uncertain  tax  positions  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  in  the  U.S.,  or  GAAP,pursuant to which we only recognize the tax
 benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained onexamination
 by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements fromsuch
 positions  are  then  measured  based  on  the  largest  benefit  that  has  a  greater  than  50  percent  likelihood  of  being  realized  upon  ultimatesettlement.
 We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.GAAP
 further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings inthe quarter in which such change occurs. We recognize interest an
d penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.We
 file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain taxposition
 is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolutionof
 any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome. We adjust these reserves, aswell
 as the related interest, where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position could require theuse of cash.
The following table illustrates our effective tax rates for 
2017 , 2016 and 2015 :  
Year Ended December 31,  
2017  2016  2015

 future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutoryrates
 and  higher  than  anticipated  in  countries  where  we  have  higher  statutory  rates,  by  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  orliabil
ities, or by changes or interpretations in tax laws, regulations or accounting principles. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examinationof
 our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service, as well as various state and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood ofadverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the ade
quacy of our provision for income taxes.Based
 on  our  results  for  the  year  ended December  31,  2017 ,  a  one-percentage  point  change  in  our  provision  for  income  taxes  as  apercentage
 of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the provision of approximately $23  million ,  resulting in anapproximate 
$0.02 change in diluted earnings  per share.We
 have accounted for the tax effects of The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, on a provisional basis. Our accountingfor
 certain income tax effects is incomplete, but we have determined reasonable estimates for those effects. Our reasonable estimates are includedin
 our financial statements as of December 31, 2017.  We expect to complete our accounting during the one year measurement period from theenactment date.
Goodwill and Intangible As
setsThe
 purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business withthe
 residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. The determination of the value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgmentsand
 estimates.  These  judgments  can  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  the  cash  flows  that  an  asset  is  expected  to  generate  in  the  future  and  theappropriate weighted average cost of capita
l.As
 of December  31, 2017 ,  our goodwill totaled $4.8  billion and  our identifiable intangible assets, net totaled $69  million .  We assess theimpairment
 of goodwill of our reporting units annually, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may notbe
 recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it ismore
 likely  than  not  that  the  fair  value  of  the  reporting  unit  is  less  than  its  carrying  value.  If  the  reporting  unit  does  not  pass  the  qualitativeassessment,
 then the reporting unit’s carrying value is compared to its fair value. The fair values of the reporting units are estimated using marketand
 discounted  cash  flow  approaches.  Goodwill  is  considered  impaired  if  the  carrying  value  of  the  reporting  unit  exceeds  its  fair  value.  Thediscounted
 cash flow approach uses expected future operating results. The market approach uses comparable company information to determinerevenue and earnings multiples to val
ue our reporting54

units. Failure to achieve these expected results or market multiples may cause a future impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit. We conductedour
 annual impairment test of goodwill as of August 31, 2017 and 2016 .  Additionally, we evaluated impairment based on the significant activitiesregarding
 the  Distribution  and  Enterprise  divestiture  in  2015.  See  “Note  4  -  Discontinued  Operations”  to  the  consolidated  financial  statementsincluded in this report for further detail. As of 
December 31, 2017 , we determined that no further impairment of the carrying value of goodw ill for anyreporting units was required. See “Note 5 - Goodwill an
d Intangible Assets” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.Legal Contingencies
In
 connection with certain pending litigation and other claims, we have estimated the range of probable loss, net of expected recoveries, andprovided
 for such losses through charges to our consolidated statement of income. These estimates have been based on our assessment of thefacts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are sub
ject to change based upon new information and future events.From
 time to time, we are involved in disputes and regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business. We are currently involvedin
 legal  proceedings,  some  of  which  are  discussed  in  “Item  1A:  Risk  Factors,”  “Item  3:  Legal  Proceedings”  and  “Note  12  -  Commitments  andContingencies”
 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims againstus,
 and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously. However, even if successful, our defense against certain actions will be costly and could requiresignificant
 amounts of management’s time and result in the diversion of significant operational resources. If the plaintiffs were to prevail on certainclaims,
 we might be forced to pay significant damages and licensing fees, modify our business practices or even be prohibited from conducting asignificant
 part of our business. Any such results could materially harm our business and could result in a material adverse impact on the financialposition, results of operations or cash flows.
Recent Accounting Pronoun
cementsSee "Note 1 - The Company and Summary of Significant Accounti
ng Policies" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report,regarding the impact of certain recent accounting pronou
ncements on our consolidated financial statements.55

ITEM 7A: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARK ET RISKInterest Rate Risk
We
 are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investments and outstanding debt. We seek to reduce earnings volatility that may resultfrom changes in interest rates.
As of 
December 31, 2017 , approximately 17% of our  total cash and investments was held in cash and cash equivalents. As such, changes ininterest
 rates will impact interest income. As discussed below, fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a risein interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to chang
es in interestrates.
 
As
 of December  31,  2017 ,  the  balance  of  our  corporate  debt  and  government  bond  securities  was $9.2  billion ,  which  representedapproximately 
75% of  our  total  cash  and investments.  Investments  in both fixed-rate  and floating-rate  interest-earning  instruments  carry  varyingdegrees
 of interest rate risk. The fair market value of our fixed-rate investment securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates.In
 general, fixed-rate securities with longer maturities are subject to greater interest-rate risk than those with shorter maturities. While floating ratesecurities
 generally are subject to less interest-rate risk than fixed-rate securities, floating-rate securities may produce less income than expected ifinterest
 rates decrease and may also suffer a decline in market value if interest rates increase. Due in part to these factors, our investment incomemay
 fall short of expectations or we may suffer losses in principal if we sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interestrates.
 A  100  basis  point  increase  or  decrease  in  interest  rates  would  not  have  a  material  impact  on  our  financial  assets  or  liabilities  as  ofDecember 31, 2017 
. As of 
December  31, 2017 ,  we have an aggregate principal amount of $10.1 billion of  outstanding senior notes, of which 92% bore interest at fixed
 rates. We entered into $2.4 billion of interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligationsassociated
 with $1.15 billion of our 2.200% senior notes due July 2019, $750 million of our 2.875% senior notes due July 2021, and $500 million ofour
 3.450% senior notes due July 2024 so that the interest payable on those notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR plus a spread.Further
 changes in interest rates will impact interest expense on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which bear interest at floatingrates,
 and the interest rate on any commercial paper borrowings we make and any debt securities we may issue in the future and, accordingly, willimpact
 interest expense. For additional details related to our debt, please see “Note 11 – Debt” to the consolidated financial statements included inthis report.
 
Investment Risk
The
 primary  objective  of  our  investment  activities  is  to  preserve  principal  while  at  the  same  time  improving  yields  without  significantlyincreasing
 risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments in a variety of asset types,including bank depos
its, government bonds and corporate debt securities.As
 of December  31, 2017 ,  our cost and equity method investments totaled $885  million ,  which represented approximately 7% of our totalcash
 and  investments,  and  were  primarily  related  to  cost  method  investments  in  privately  held  companies.  We  review  our  investments  forimpairment
 when  events  and  circumstances  indicate  a  decline  in  fair  value  of  such  assets  below  carrying  value  is  other-than-temporary.  Ouranalysis
 includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the securities in which we have invested and otherpublicly available data.
Foreign Currency Risk
Our
 commerce platforms operate globally, resulting in certain revenues and costs that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily theBritish
 pound, euro, Korean won and Australian dollar ,  subjecting us to foreign currency risk which may adversely impact our financial results. Wetransact
 business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues as well as costs. In addition, we charge our internationalsubsidiaries
 for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services we provide. Our cash flow, results of operationsand certain of our
 intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations and we mayrecord significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuati
ons and related hedging activities.56

We  have  a  foreign  exchange  exposure  management  program  designed  to  identify  material  foreign  currency  exposures,  manage  theseexposures
 and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flows and results of operations through thepurchase
 of foreign currency exchange contracts. The effectiveness of the program and resulting usage of foreign exchange derivative contracts isat
 times limited by our ability to achieve cash flow hedge accounting. For additional details related to our derivative instruments, please see “Note 9– Derivative Instruments” to our consolidated financial statements incl
uded in this report.We
 use foreign exchange derivative contracts to help protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from adverse changes in foreigncurrency
 exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements.Most
 of these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. For qualifying cash flow hedges, the effective portion of thederivative’s gain or loss is initially rep
orted as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified intoearnings
 in  the  same  period  the  forecasted  transaction  affects  earnings.  The  ineffective  portion  of  the  unrealized  gains  and  losses  on  thesecontracts,
 if any, is recorded immediately in earnings. For contracts not designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes, the derivative’sgain or
 loss is recognized immediately in earnings in our consolidated statement of income. However, only certain revenue and costs are eligible forcash flow hedge accounting.
The
 following table illustrates the fair values of outstanding foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges and the before-taxeffect
 on  fair  values  of  a  hypothetical  adverse  change  in  the  foreign  exchange  rates  that  existed  as  of December  31, 2017 .  The sensitivity forforeign currency contracts is based on a 20% adverse change i
n foreign exchange rates, against relevant functional currencies.

 our risk management programs are highly effective, the potential loss in value described above would be largely offset by changes inthe value of the underlying exposure.
Subsequent
 to the distribution of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal to our stockholders, fewer of our currency flows met theGAAP
 criteria for cash flow hedge accounting, thus requiring us to use a combination of foreign exchange derivative contracts and investing non-U.S.
 cash in U.S. denominated investments to help protect our forecasted U.S. dollar equivalent earnings from adverse changes in foreign currencyexchange
 rates. The recent realignment of our legal structure has resulted in an increase in currency flows, beginning in the third quarter of 2017,that
 met the GAAP criteria for cash flow hedge accounting, thus minimizing the need to invest non-U.S. cash in U.S. denominated investments toprotect
 both  our  forecasted  revenue  flows  and  U.S.  dollar  equivalent  earnings  from  adverse  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.Accordingly, $28 million in qu
alifying hedging activity was netted against marketplace net transaction revenues in the second half of 2017.In addition, we use foreign
 exchange contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies otherthan
 the  functional  currency  of  our  subsidiaries.  These  contracts  reduce,  but  do  not  entirely  eliminate,  the  impact  of  currency  exchange  ratemovements
 on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on the assets and liabilities are recorded in interest and other, net,which are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign exch
ange contracts.We
 considered  the  historical  trends  in  currency  exchange  rates  and  determined  that  it  was  reasonably  possible  that  adverse  changes  inexchange
 rates  of  20%  for  all  currencies  could  be  experienced  in  the  near  term.  These  changes  would  have  resulted  in  an  adverse  impact  onincome before income taxes of approximately $11 milli
on as of December 31, 2017 taking into consideration the offsetting effect of foreign exchange forwards in place as of 
December 31, 2017 . 57

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Board of Directors and Stockho
lders of eBay Inc.Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Cont
rol over Financial ReportingWe
 have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of  eBay  Inc.  and  its  subsidiaries  as  of  December  31,  2017  and  2016,  and  the  relatedconsolidated
 statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,2017,
 including  the  related  notes  and  schedule  of  valuation  and  qualifying  accounts  for  each  of  the  three  years  in  the  period  ended  December  31,  2017appearing
 under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control overfinancial
 reporting  as  of  December  31,  2017,  based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control  -  Integrated  Framework  (2013)  issued  by  the  Committee  ofSponsoring Organizations 
of the Treadway Commission (COSO).In
 our  opinion,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  referred  to  above  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the  financial  position  of  the  Company  as  ofDecember
 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 inconformity
 with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,effective internal control o
ver financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issuedby the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s
 management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and forits
 assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s annual report on internal controlover financial reporting. 
Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control overfinancial
 reporting  based  on  our  audits.  We  are  a  public  accounting  firm  registered  with  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)(“PCAOB”)
 and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules andregulations of the S
ecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We
 conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonableassurance
 about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internalcontrol over financial repor
ting was maintained in all material respects.Our
 audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financialstatements,
 whether  due  to  error  or  fraud,  and  performing  procedures  that  respond  to  those  risks.  Such  procedures  included  examining,  on  a  test  basis,evidence
 regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles usedand
 significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internalcontrol
 over  financial  reporting  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weaknessexists,
 and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performingsuch other procedures as we cons
idered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal 
Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal cont
rol over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation
 of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  A  company’s  internal  control  overfinancial reporting includes
 those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions
 and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparationof
 financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only inaccordance with

eBay Inc.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1 – The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The Company
eBay
 Inc.  is  a  global  commerce  leader,  which  includes  our  Marketplace,  StubHub  and  Classifieds  platforms.  Our  Marketplace  platformsinclude
 our online marketplace located at www.ebay.com, its localized counterparts and the eBay mobile apps. Our StubHub platforms include ouronline
 ticket platform located at www.stubhub.com, the StubHub mobile apps and Ticketbis. Our Classifieds platforms include a collection of brandssuch as Mobile.de, Kijiji, Gumtree, Marktplaats, eBay Kleinanz
eigen and others. When
 we  refer  to  “we,”  “our,”  “us”  or  “eBay”  in  this  document,  we  mean  the  current  Delaware  corporation  (eBay  Inc.)  and  its  Californiapredecessor, as well as all of our consolidate
d subsidiaries, unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires.In
 2015, we completed the distribution of 100% of  the outstanding common stock of PayPal Holdings, Inc. (“PayPal”) to our stockholders (the“Distribution”)
 and closed the sale of our former Enterprise segment (“Enterprise”). As a result, the financial results and related assets and liabilitiesof
 PayPal  and  Enterprise  were  retrospectively  reflected  as  discontinued  operations  in  our  consolidated  statement  of  income  and  consolidatedbalance sheet. See “Note 4 - Discontinued Operati
ons” for additional information.Use of estimates
The
 preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (“GAAP”)  requiresmanagement
 to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets andliabilities at the date of the consolidate
d financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On anongoing
 basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to provisions for transaction losses, legal contingencies, income taxes, revenuerecognition,
 stock-based compensation, goodwill and the recoverability of intangible assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and onvarious other assumptions that we believe to be reason
able under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Principles of consolidation and basis of presentation
The
 accompanying financial statements are consolidated and include the financial statements of eBay Inc., our wholly and majority-ownedsubsidiaries
 and  variable  interest  entities  (“VIE”)  where  we  are  the  primary  beneficiary.  All  intercompany  balances  and  transactions  have  beeneliminated
 in consolidation. Minority interests are recorded as a noncontrolling interest. A qualitative approach is applied to assess the consolidationrequirement
 for VIEs. Investments in entities where we hold at least a 20% ownership  interest and have the ability to exercise significant influence,but not
 control, over the investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. For such investments, our share of the investees’ resultsof operations is included in interest and oth
er, net and our investment balance is included in long-term investments. Investments in entities where wehold less
 than a 20% ownership  interest are generally accounted for using the cost method of accounting, and our share of the investees’ results ofoperations is included in our cons
olidated statement of income to the extent dividends are received.Certain
 prior period amounts have been reclassified on our consolidated balance sheet to conform with current year presentation. We haveevaluated all subseque
nt events through the date the consolidated financial statements were issued.F-8

eBay Inc.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Revenue recognition
We
 generate net transaction revenues primarily from final value fees and listing fees paid by sellers. Final value fee revenues are recognizedat
 the time that the transaction is successfully closed, while listing fee revenues are recognized ratably over the estimated period of the listing. Anauction
 transaction is considered successfully closed when at least one buyer has bid above the seller’s specified minimum price or reserve price,whichever is higher, at the end of the transaction term.
Our
 marketing  services  revenues  are  derived  principally  from  the  sale of  advertisements,  revenue  sharing  arrangements,  classifieds  fees,marketing
 service fees and lead referral fees. Our advertising revenues are derived principally from the sale of online advertisements. The durationof
 our advertising contracts has ranged from one week to five years, but is generally one week to one year. Advertising revenues on contracts arerecognized as “impressions” (i.e., 
the number of times that an advertisement appears in pages viewed by users of our platforms) are delivered, or as“clicks” (which
 are generated each time users on our platforms click through our advertisements to an advertiser’s designated website) are providedto
 advertisers. For contracts with minimum monthly or quarterly advertising commitments where the fee and commitments are fixed throughout theterm,
 we  recognize  revenue  ratably  over  the  term  of  the  agreement.  We  also  may  enter  into  arrangements  to  purchase  services  from  certaincustomers
 and if the service is not considered an identifiable benefit that is separable from the customer’s purchase of our services or for which wecannot
 reasonably estimate fair value, the fees paid to the customer are recorded as a reduction in revenue. Some of our advertising contractsconsist
 of  multiple  elements  which  generally  include  a  blend  of  various  impressions  and  clicks  as  well  as  other  marketing  deliverables.  Whereneither
 vendor-specific  objective  evidence  nor  third-party  evidence  of  selling  price  exists,  we  use  management’s  best  estimate  of  selling  price(“BESP”)
 to allocate arrangement consideration on a relative basis to each element. BESP is generally based on the selling prices of the variouselements
 when they are sold to customers of a similar nature and geography on a stand-alone basis or estimated stand-alone pricing when theelement
 has  not  previously  been  sold  on  a  stand-alone  basis.  These  estimates  are  generally  based  on  pricing  strategies,  market  factors  andstrategic
 objectives.  Revenues  related  to  revenue  sharing  arrangements  are  recognized  based  on  revenue  reports  received  from  our  partners,provided
 that collectability is reasonably assured. Revenues related to fees for listing items on our Classifieds platforms are recognized over theestimated
 period of the classified listing. Lead referral fee revenue is generated from lead referral fees based on the number of times users clickthrough
 to a merchant’s website from our platforms. Lead referral fees are recognized in the period in which a user clicks through to the merchant’swebsite.
Our
 other revenues are derived principally from contractual arrangements with third parties that provide services to our users. Revenues fromcontractual arrangements with third parties are recognized as the contracted servic
es are delivered to end users.To
 drive traffic to our platforms, we provide incentives to our users in the form of coupons and buyer and seller rewards. These incentives aregenerally treated as reductions in revenue.
Internal use software and platform development costs
Direct
 costs incurred to develop software for internal use and platform development costs are capitalized and amortized over an estimateduseful
 life of one to five years. During the years ended December  31, 2017 and 2016 ,  we capitalized costs, primarily related to labor and stock-based
 compensation, of $140  million and $137 million ,  respectively. Amortization of previously capitalized amounts was $156  million , $149 millionand 
$110  million for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 ,  respectively.  Costs  related  to  the  design  or  maintenance  of  internal  use  software  and  platformdevelopment are expensed as incurred.
Advertising expense
We
 expense the costs of producing advertisements at the time production occurs and expense the cost of communicating advertisements inthe
 period during which the advertising space or airtime is used, in each case as sales and marketing expense. Internet advertising expenses arerecognized based on the terms of
 the individual agreements, which are generally over the greater of the ratio of the number of impressions deliveredover
 the  total  number  of  contracted  impressions,  on  a  pay-per-click  basis,  or  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  term  of  the  contract.  Advertisingexpense totaled 
$1.3 billion , $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. F-9

eBay Inc.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Stock-based compensation
We
 have equity incentive plans under which we grant equity awards, including stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance-based
 restricted  stock  units,  and  performance  share  units,  to  our  directors,  officers  and  employees.  We  primarily  issue  RSUs.  We  determinecompensation
 expense  associated  with  RSUs  based  on  the  fair  value  of  our  common  stock  on  the  date  of  grant.  We  determine  compensationexpense
 associated with stock options based on the estimated grant date fair value method using the Black-Scholes valuation model. We generallyrecognize
 compensation  expense  using  a  straight-line  amortization  method  over  the  respective  vesting  period  for  awards  that  are  ultimatelyexpected
 to vest. Accordingly, stock-based compensation expense for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 has  been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Whenestimating
 forfeitures, we consider voluntary termination behaviors as well as trends of actual option forfeitures. We recognize a benefit or provisionfrom
 stock-based compensation in earnings as a component of income tax expense to the extent that an incremental tax benefit or deficiency isrealized
 by  following  the  ordering  provisions  of  the  tax  law.  In  addition,  we  account  for  the  indirect  effects  of  stock-based  compensation  on  theresearch tax credit and the foreign tax credit through our consolidated statement of income.
Provision for transaction losses
Provision
 for transaction losses consists primarily of losses resulting from our customer protection programs, fraud and bad debt expenseassociated
 with  our  accounts  receivable  balance.  Provisions  for  these  items  represent  our  estimate  of  actual  losses  based  on  our  historicalexperience
 and many other factors including changes to our customer protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes as well as economicconditions.
Income taxes
We
 account  for  income  taxes  using an  asset  and liability  approach,  which  requires  the  recognition  of  taxes  payable  or  refundable  for  thecurrent
 year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statementsor
 tax returns. The measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax laws; the effects of futurechanges in
 tax laws or rates are not anticipated. If necessary, the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by the amount of any tax benefitsthat are not expected to be realized based on avai
lable evidence.We
 report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Werecognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unreco
gnized tax benefits in income tax expense.We
 have accounted for the tax effects of The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, on a provisional basis. Our accountingfor
 certain income tax effects is incomplete, but we have determined reasonable estimates for those effects. Our reasonable estimates are includedin
 our financial statements as of December 31, 2017.  We expect to complete our accounting during the one year measurement period from theenactment date.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash
 and cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased and areprimarily comprised of bank deposits and certificates of deposit.
Allowance for doubtful accounts and authorized credits
We
 record our allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our assessment of various factors. We consider historical experience, the age ofthe
 accounts receivable balances, current economic conditions and other factors that may affect our customers’ ability to pay. The allowance fordoubtful accounts and authorized credits was 
$102 million and $81 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Investments
Short-term
 investments,  which  may  include  marketable  equity  securities,  time  deposits,  certificates  of  deposit,  government  bonds  andcorporate debt securities with original maturities
 of greater than three months but less than one year when purchased, are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value using the specific
F-10

eBay Inc.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
identific
ation method. Unrealized gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss),net of related estimated income tax provisions or benefits.
Long-term
 investments may include marketable government bonds and corporate debt securities, time deposits, certificates of deposit andcost and
 equity method investments. Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value using the specific identificationmethod.
 Unrealized  gains  and  losses  on  our  available-for-sale  investments  are  excluded  from  earnings  and  reported  as  a  component  of  othercomprehensive income (loss), net of related estimated income tax provisions or be
nefits.Our
 equity method investments are primarily investments in privately-held companies. Our consolidated results of operations include, as acomponent
 of  interest  and  other,  net,  our  share  of  the  net  income  or  loss  of  the  equity  method  investments.  Our  share  of  investees’  results  ofoperations
 is not  significant  for  any period  presented.  Our  cost  method  investments  consist  of  investments  in privately  held companies  and arerecorded at cost. Amounts received from our cost method investees were not material to any period presented.
We
 assess whether an other-than-temporary impairment loss on our investments has occurred due to declines in fair value or other marketconditio
ns. With respect to our debt securities, this assessment takes into account the severity and duration of the decline in value, our intent to sellthe security, whether it is
 more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, and whether weexpect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security (that is, whether a credit loss exists).
Property and equipment
Property
 and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line methodover the estimated useful lives of
 the assets, generally, one to three years for computer equipment and software,  up to thirty  years for buildings and building
 improvements,  the  shorter  of five years  or  the  term  of  the  lease  for  leasehold  improvements  and three years  for  furniture,  fixtures  andvehicles.
 
Goodwill and intangible assets
Goodwill
 is tested for impairment at a minimum on an annual basis. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A qualitativeassessment
 can be performed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Ifthe
 reporting unit does not pass the qualitative assessment, then the reporting unit’s carrying value is compared to its fair value. The fair values ofthe
 reporting units are estimated using income and market approaches. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unitexceeds
 its  fair  value.  The  discounted  cash  flow  method,  a  form  of  the  income  approach,  uses  expected  future  operating  results  and  a  marketparticipant
 discount rate. The market approach uses comparable company prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions(either
 publicly traded entities or merger and acquisitions) to develop pricing metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating resultsof
 our  reporting  units.  Failure  to  achieve  these  expected  results,  changes  in  the  discount  rate  or  market  pricing  metrics  may  cause  a  futureimpairment
 of goodwill at the reporting unit. We conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill as of August 31, 2017 and 2016 . Additionally, we evaluated impairment based on the sign
ificant activities regarding the Distribution and Enterprise divestiture during 2015. See “Note 4 - DiscontinuedOperations”
 for further detail. As a result of this test, we determined that no further adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill for any reportingunits was required. 
Intangible
 assets consist of purchased customer lists and user base, marketing related, developed technologies and other intangible assets,including
 patents and contractual agreements. Intangible assets are amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight-line methodand estimated useful lives ranging from 
one to five years. No significant residual value is estimated for intangible assets.Impairment of long-lived assets
We
 evaluate long-lived assets (including intangible assets) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances  indicate that thecarrying
 amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. An asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the undiscountedfuture net cash flow the asset is expected to generate. In 
2017 , 2016 and 2015 , no impairment was noted. F-11

 into  U.S.  dollars  using  exchange  rates  prevailing  at  the  balance  sheet  date,  while  revenues  and  expenses  are  translated  at  averageexchange
 rates during the year. Gains and losses resulting from the translation of our consolidated balance sheet are recorded as a component ofaccumulated other comprehensive income.
Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are recognized as interest an
d other, net.Derivative instruments
We
 use derivative financial instruments, primarily forwards, options and swaps, to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures.We
 may also use other derivative instruments not designated as hedges, such as forwards to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. Wedo
 not  use  derivative  financial  instruments  for  trading  purposes.  See  “Note  9  -  Derivative  Instruments”  for  a  full  description  of  our  derivativeinstrument activities and related accounting po
licies.Concentration of credit risk
Our
 cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable and derivative instruments are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Cash andcash
 equivalents are placed with financial institutions that management believes are of high credit quality. Our accounts receivable are derived fromrevenue earned from customers. In each of
 the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 , no  customer accounted for more than 10% of netrevenues.
 Our  derivative  instruments  expose  us  to  credit  risk  to  the  extent  that  our  counterparties  may  be  unable  to  meet  the  terms  of  theagreements.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In
 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued new guidance to revise certain aspects of stock-based compensationguidance
 which  includes  income  tax  consequences,  classification  of  awards  as  equity  or  liabilities,  and  classification  on  the  statement  of  cashflows.
 We  adopted  the  new  standard  in  the  first  quarter  of  2017.  Adoption  of  this  standard  did  not  have  a  material  impact  on  our  consolidatedfinancial statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In
 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. This new standard will replace all current GAAP guidanceon
 this topic and eliminate all industry-specific guidance. The new revenue recognition guidance provides a unified model to determine when andhow
 revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services tocustomers
 in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In 2016,the
 FASB issued several amendments to the standard, including principal versus agent considerations when another party is involved in providinggoods or services to a customer and the application of identifyi
ng performance obligations.The Company will adopt the standard effective Jan
uary 1, 2018 using the full retrospective transition method and recast each prior reportingperiod presented.
Under
 the new standard, we identified one performance obligation related to the core service offered to sellers in our Marketplace platformand
 believe  additional  services  mainly  to  promote  or  feature  listings  at  the  option  of  sellers  are  not  distinct  within  the  context  of  the  contract.Accordingly,
 certain  fees  paid  by  sellers  for  these  services  will  be  recognized  when  the  single  performance  obligation  is  satisfied  or  when  thecontract
 expires resulting, in some cases, in a change in the timing of recognition from current guidance. In addition, we made the policy election toconsider
 delivery of tickets in our StubHub business to be fulfillment activities and consequently, the performance obligation is considered to besatisfied
 upon payment to sellers. We believe the impact of this policy election will allow an acceleration of revenue recognition for certain users . The total
 impact resulting from the change in timing of recognition for both the Marketplace and StubHub platforms is expected to be a net decreasein
 transaction revenue of less than $2  million for  fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively and increase in deferred revenue of $20  million and $19million

as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Revenue recognit
ion related to our marketing services and other revenue derived principally from the sale of advertisements, revenue sharingarrangements,
 and  marketing  services  fees  will  substantially  remain  unchanged  partially  due  to  the  fact  that  the  principal  versus  agentconsiderations
 under  ASU  2016-08 Revenue  from  Contracts  with  Customers  (Topic  606):  Principal  versus  Agent  Considerations  (ReportingRevenue
 Gross versus Net) will  not materially change how we currently present revenue. Further, we believe certain incentives such as couponsand
 rewards provided to certain users from which we do not earn revenue within the context of the identified contract of $363  million and $322million 
for  fiscal year 2017 and 2016, respectively, should be recognized as sales and marketing expense, which historically were recorded as areduction of revenue under current guidance.
Adoption
 of  this  guidance  is  expected  to  have  the  following  impact  on  select  financial  statement  line  items  for  the  periods  presented  (inmillions):

 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and thepresentation
 and  disclosure  requirements  for  financial  instruments.  In  addition,  the  FASB  clarified  guidance  related  to  the  valuation  allowanceassessment
 when  recognizing  deferred  tax  assets  resulting  from  unrealized  losses  on  available-for-sale  debt  securities.  The  new  standard  iseffective
 for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. We anticipate that the adoption of thenew
 standard  will  increase  the  volatility  of  our  other  income  (expense),  net,  as  a  result  of  the  remeasurement  of  our  equity  and  cost  methodinvestments.
 The Company will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2018 with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements atadoption.
In
 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to accounting for leases. The new guidance requires the recognition of lease assets andlease
 liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The new standard is effective for fiscal years,and
 interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. We are evaluating the impact of adopting this new accountingguidance on our consolid
ated financial statements.In
 2016, the FASB issued new guidance that requires credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to be presented atthe
 net  amount  expected  to  be  collected,  not  based  on  incurred  losses.  Further,  credit  losses  on  available-for-sale  debt  securities  should  berecorded
 through an allowance for credit losses limited to the amount by which fair value is below amortized cost. The new standard is effective forfiscal
 years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption for fiscal years, and interim periodswithin
 those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018 is permitted. We are evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidanceon our consolidated 
financial statements.F-13

In
 2016, the FASB issued new guidance that clarifies the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cashflows,
 including debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, settlement of contingent consideration arising from a business combination, insurancesettlement
 proceeds, and distributions from certain equity method investees. Additionally, the FASB issued new guidance to include restricted cashwith
 cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-the-period and end-of-the-period total amounts shown on the statement of cashflows.
 The new standards are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. We willadopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2018 with no material impact on o
ur consolidated financial statements.In
 2016, the FASB issued new guidance that requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset,other than inventory, when the
 transfer occurs. This removes the exception to postpone recognition until the asset has been sold to an outside party.This
 standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those annualreporting periods, with
 early adoption permitted. It is required to be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustmentto the balance sheet as
 of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. We will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2018 with no material impacton our consolidated financia
l statements at adoption.In
 2017,  the  FASB  issued  new  guidance  that  narrows  the  application  of  when  an  integrated  set  of  assets  and  activities  is  considered  abusiness
 and provides a framework to assist entities in evaluating whether both an input and a substantive process are present to be considered abusiness.
 It is expected that the new guidance will reduce the number of transactions that would need to be further evaluated and accounted for asa
 business. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods withinthose
 annual  reporting  periods,  with  early  adoption  permitted.  We  anticipate  that  the  adoption  of  the  new  guidance  will  impact  management’sconsideration
 of strategic investments upon adoption in the first quarter of 2018 with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements atadoption.
In
 2017,  the  FASB  issued  new  guidance  to  simplify  the  subsequent  measurement  of  goodwill  by  removing  the  requirement  to  perform  ahypothetical
 purchase price allocation to compute the implied fair value of goodwill to measure impairment. Instead, any goodwill impairment willequal
 the  amount  by  which  a  reporting  unit’s  carrying  value  exceeds  its  fair  value,  not  to  exceed  the  carrying  amount  of  goodwill.  Further,  theguidance
 eliminates the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment and, if itfails
 that qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. This standard is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairmenttest
 in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017. We donot expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our conso
lidated financial statements.In
 2017, the FASB issued new guidance to clarify the scope and application of the sale or transfer of nonfinancial assets to noncustomers,including
 partial sales and also defines what constitutes an “in substance nonfinancial asset” which can include financial assets. The new guidanceeliminat
es several accounting differences between transactions involving assets and transactions involving businesses. Further, the guidance alignsthe
 accounting for derecognition of a nonfinancial asset with that of a business. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginningafter
 December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. We will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of2018 with no material impact on our consolid
ated financial statements at adoption.In
 2017, the FASB issued new guidance that will shorten the amortization period for certain callable debt securities held at a premium to theearliest
 call date to more closely align with expectations incorporated in market pricing. The new guidance will not impact debt securities held at adiscount.
 Adoption  of  this  standard  will  be  made  on  a  modified  retrospective  basis  through  a  cumulative-effect  adjustment  directly  to  retainedearnings
 as of the beginning of the period of adoption. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018,including
 interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods, with early adoption permitted. While we continue to assess the potentialimpact of this standard, we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on o
ur consolidated financial statements.In
 2017,  the  FASB  issued  new  guidance  to  amend  the  scope  of  modification  accounting  for  share-based  payment  arrangements.  Theamendments
 in the update provide guidance on types of changes to the terms or conditions of share-based payment awards would be required toapply
 modification  accounting  under  ASC  718,  Compensation-Stock  Compensation.  The  amendments  are  effective  for  annual  reporting  periodsbeginning after December 15, 2017 with e

 reporting  of  hedging  relationships  by  allowing  entities  to  better  align  its  risk  management  activities  and  financial  reporting  for  hedgingrelationships
 through  changes  to  both  designation  and  measurement  for  qualifying  hedging  relationships  and  the  presentation  of  hedge  results.Further,
 the new guidance allows more flexibility in the requirements to qualify and maintain hedge accounting. The new standard is effective forfiscal

Basic
 net  income  (loss)  per  share  is  computed  by  dividing  net  income  (loss)  for  the  period  by  the  weighted  average  number  of  commonshares
 outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weightedaverage
 number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive common stock outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of outstandingoptions and equity
 incentive awards is reflected in diluted net income (loss) per share by application of the treasury stock method. The calculation ofdiluted net income (loss) per share excludes all a
nti-dilutive common shares.The following table presents the computatio

On
 June  26,  2015,  our  Board  approved  the  separation  of  PayPal  through  the  Distribution.  To  consummate  the  Distribution,  our  Boarddeclared
 a pro rata dividend of PayPal Holdings, Inc. common stock to eBay’s stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 8, 2015(the “Record
 Date”). Each eBay stockholder received one ( 1 ) share of PayPal Holdings, Inc. common stock for every share of eBay common stockheld at the close of
 business on the Record Date. The Distribution occurred on July 17, 2015. Immediately following the Distribution, PayPal becamean
 independent, publicly traded company listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market under the ticker “PYPL.” eBay continues to trade on The NASDAQStock
 Market under the ticker “EBAY.” We classified the financial results of PayPal as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement  ofincome.
 Additionally, the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations were classified as discontinued operations in ourconsolidated
 balance sheet. In connection with the Distribution, we reviewed our capital allocation strategy to ensure that each of PayPal and eBaywould be well capitaliz
ed at Distribution. As part of this strategy, we contributed approximately $3.8 billion of cash to PayPal in 2015. In
 2015, our Board approved a plan to sell Enterprise. Based on the expected sales proceeds, we recorded a goodwill impairment of $786 million 
in 2015. On July 16, 2015, we signed a defin itive agreement to sell Enterprise for $925 million and on November 2, 2015, the sale closed. We recorded
 a loss  of $35  million upon  closing  included  within  income  (loss)  from  discontinued  operations,  net  of  income  taxes.  We  classified  theresults
 of  Enterprise  as  discontinued  operations  in  our  consolidated  statement  of  income.  Additionally,  the  related  assets  and  liabilities  wereclassified as discon

 cash is held primarily in interest bearing accounts for letters of credit primarily related to our global sabbatical program and variouslease
 arrangements.  Our  fixed-income  investments  consist  of  predominantly  investment  grade  corporate  debt  securities  and  government  andagency
 securities. The corporate debt and government and agency securities that we invest in are generally deemed to be low risk based on theircredit ratings from the major rating agencies.
The
 longer the duration of these securities, the more susceptible they are to changes in market interest rates and bond yields. As interestrates
 increase,  those  securities  purchased  at  a  lower  yield  show  a  mark-to-market  unrealized  loss.  The  unrealized  losses  are  due  primarily  tochanges
 in credit spreads and interest rates. We regularly review investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment using both qualitativeand
 quantitative criteria. We presently do not intend to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position and expect to realize the full value ofall these investments upon maturity or sale.
Investment
 securities in a continuous loss position for greater than 12 months had an estimated fair value $360  million and  an immaterialamount of
 unrealized losses as of December 31, 2017 and an  estimated fair value of $123 million and an immaterial amount  of unrealized losses asof 
December 31, 2016 .  As of December  31, 2017 ,  these securities had a weighted average remaining duration of approximately 12 months. Referto “Note 17 - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income” for amounts reclassified to earnings from unrealiz
ed gains and losses.In
 the  fourth  quarter  of  2016,  we  sold  our  equity  holdings  of  MercadoLibre,  Inc.,  which  was  included  in  our  short-term  marketable  equityinstruments
 for net proceeds of $1.3  billion .  The pre-tax gain of $1.3  billion was  reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income intointerest and other, net on our consolidated statement of income.

 financial assets and liabilities are valued using market prices on both active markets (Level 1) and less active markets (Level 2). Level 1instrument
 valuations are obtained from real-time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets. Level 2 instrumentvaluations
 are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical instruments in less active markets, or modelsusing market
 observable inputs. The majority of our derivative instruments are valued using pricing models that take into account the contract termsas well as multiple inputs where applic
able, such as equity prices, interest rate yield curves, option volatility and currency rates. We did not have anytransfers of financial instruments between valuation lev
els during 2017 or 2016 . Other
 financial  instruments,  including  accounts  receivable  and  accounts  payable  are  carried  at  cost,  which  approximates  their  fair  valuebecause of the short-term nature of these instruments.
Note 9 – Derivative Instruments
Our
 primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currencyexchange
 rates and interest rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse foreign exchange rate andinterest rate movements. We do not use any of our derivative instruments for trading purposes.
We
 use  foreign  currency  exchange  contracts  to  reduce  the  volatility  of  cash  flows  related  to  forecasted  revenues,  expenses,  assets  andliabilities
 denominated in foreign currencies. These contracts are generally one month to one year in duration, but with maturities up to 18 months.The objective of
 the foreign exchange contracts is to better ensure that ultimately the U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows are not adversely affected bychanges
 in  the  applicable  U.S.  dollar/foreign  currency  exchange  rate.  We  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  our  foreign  exchange  contracts  on  aquarterly basis.
We
 use interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on our fixed rate notes issued in July 2014 and maturing in 2019, 2021 and 2024.These
 interest rate swaps had the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with $2.4  billion of  these notes so that theinterest
 payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on London InterBank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a spread. The durationof these interest rate contracts matches the duration of the fixed rate notes due 2019, 2021 and 202

Cash Flow Hedges
For
 derivative instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported asa
 component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period the forecastedtransaction
 affects  earnings.  The  ineffective  portion  of  the  unrealized  gains  and  losses  on  these  contracts,  if  any,  is  recorded  immediately  inearnings.
 Derivative  instruments  designated  as  cash  flow  hedges  must  be  de-designated  as  hedges  when  it  is  probable  the  forecasted  hedgedtransaction
 will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Unrealized gains and losses in AOCIassociated
 with  such  derivative  instruments  are  immediately  reclassified  into  earnings .  As  of December  31,  2017 ,  we  have  estimated  thatapproximately 
$53  million of  net  derivative  loss  related  to  our  cash  flow  hedges  included  in  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  will  bereclassified into earnings within the n
ext 12 months.The
 amounts recognized in earnings related to the ineffective portion of our derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges were notmaterial
 in 2017 and 2016. We did not exclude any component of the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments from the assessment ofhedge effectiveness.
Fair Value Hedges
We
 have designated the interest rate swaps used to manage interest rate risk on our fixed rate notes issued in July 2014 and maturing in2019, 2021 and 2024 as qualifying hedg
ing instruments and are accounting for them as fair value hedges. These transactions are designated as fairvalue
 hedges for financial accounting purposes because they protect us against changes in the fair value of certain of our fixed rate borrowings dueto
 benchmark interest rate movements. Changes in the fair values of these interest rate swap agreements are recognized in other assets or otherliabilities
 with  a  corresponding  increase  or  decrease  in  long-term  debt.  Each  quarter  we  pay  interest  based  on  LIBOR  plus  a  spread  to  thecounterparty
 and  on  a  semi-annual  basis  receive  interest  from  the  counterparty  per  the  fixed  rate  of  these  senior  notes.  The  net  amount  isrecognized as interest expense in interest and oth
er, net.Non-Designated Hedges
Our
 derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we primarily use to hedge monetaryassets
 or  liabilities,  including  intercompany  balances  denominated  in  non-functional  currencies.  The  gains  and  losses  on  our  derivatives  notdesignated
 as hedging instruments are recorded in interest and other ,  net, partially offset by the foreign currency gains and losses on the relatedassets and liabilities that are also recorded i
n interest and other, net.F-24

Our derivatives
 expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the arrangement. We seek tomitigate
 such risk by limiting our counterparties to, and by spreading the risk across, major financial institutions. In addition, the potential risk of losswith
 any one counterparty  resulting  from  this type of credit  risk  is monitored  on an ongoing basis.  To further  limit  credit  risk,  we also enter  intocollateral
 security arrangements related to certain interest rate derivative instruments whereby collateral is posted between counterparties if the fairvalue
 of the derivative instrument exceeds certain thresholds. Additional collateral would be required in the event of a significant credit downgradeby either
 party. We are not required to pledge, nor are we entitled to receive, collateral related to our foreign exchange derivative transactions. As ofDecember 31, 2017

In 2017, we
 issued senior unsecured notes, or senior notes, in an aggregate principal amount of  $2.5 billion . The issuance consisted of $400 million 
 of floating rate notes due 2023,  $500 million  of  2.150%  fixed rate notes due 2020, $750 million  of  2.750%  fixed rate notes due 2023 and $850

n 2017.In 2016, we issued
 senior unsecured notes, or senior notes, in an aggregate principal amount of $2.3 billion . The issuance consisted of  $750 million 
 aggregate  principal amount of  2.500%  fixed  rate notes due 2018,  $750  million  aggregate  principal amount of  3.800%  fixed  rate notesdue 2022 and  
$750 million  aggregate principal amount of  6.000%  fixed rate notes due 2056. F-28

None of the floating rate notes are redeemable prior to maturity. On and after March 1, 2021, we may redeem some or all of the 6.000% fixed rate notes due 205
6 at any time and from time to time prior to their maturity at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpai
d interest. We may redeem some or all of the other fixed rate notes of each series at any time and from timeto time prior to their maturity, generally at a make-whole redemption price, plus accrued and un
paid interest.If a
 change of control triggering event occurs with respect to the 2.500% fixed rate  notes due 2018, the 2.150% fixed rate notes due 2020, the 3.800% 
fixed rate  notes due 2022, the floating rate notes due 2023, the 2.750% fixed rate  notes due 2023, the 3.600% fixed rate  notes due 2027 orthe 
6.000% fixed  rate notes due 2056, we must, subject to certain exceptions, offer to repurchase all of the notes of the applicable series at a priceequal to 
101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unp aid interest.The
 indenture  pursuant  to  which  the  senior  notes  were  issued  includes  customary  covenants  that,  among  other  things  and  subject  toexceptions,
 limit our ability to incur, assume or guarantee debt secured by liens on specified assets or enter into sale and lease-back transactionswith respect to specified properties, and also inclu
des customary events of default.To
 help achieve our interest rate risk management objectives, in connection with the previous issuance of certain senior notes, we enteredinto
 interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted $2.4 billion of  our fixed rate notes to floating rate debt based on LIBOR plus a spread.These
 swaps were designated as fair value hedges against changes in the fair value of certain fixed rate senior notes resulting from changes ininterest
 rates. The gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps substantially offset changes in the fair value of thehedged portion of the underlying d
ebt that are attributable to changes in market interest rates.The
 effective interest rates for our senior notes include the interest payable, the amortization of debt issuance costs and the amortization ofany
 original  issue  discount  on  these  senior  notes.  Interest  on  these  senior  notes  is  payable  either  quarterly  or  semiannually.  Interest  expenseassociated
 with these senior notes, including amortization of debt issuance costs, during the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 was approximately 
$307  million , $254 million and $178 million ,  respectively. As of December  31, 2017 and 2016 ,  the estimated fair value of thesesenior notes, using Level 2 inputs, was approx
imately $10.1 billion and $8.9 billion , respectively. Commercial Paper
We have an up to 
$1.5 billion commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue commercial pap er notes with maturities of up to 397 days
 from  the  date  of  issue  in  an  aggregate  principal  amount  at  maturity  of  up  to $1.5  billion outstanding  at  any  time  outstanding.  As  ofDecember 31, 2017 
, there were no commercial paper notes outstanding.Credit Agreement
In
 November 2015, we entered into a credit agreement that provides for an unsecured $2  billion five -year revolving credit facility. We mayalso,
 subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders, increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to an aggregate amountof 
$1 billion .  Funds borrowed under the credit agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other generalcorporate purposes.
As of 
December 31, 2017 , no borrowings were outstanding under our $2 billion credit agreement.  However, as described above, we have anup
 to $1.5  billion commercial  paper program and therefore maintain $1.5  billion of  available borrowing capacity under our credit agreement in orderto repay commercial paper borrowings in the event we are una
ble to repay those borrowings from other sources when they become due. As a result,$500 million 
of borrowing capacity was availabl e as of December 31, 2017 for other purposes permitted by the credit agreement.  Loans
 under the credit agreement bear interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin (based on our public debt credit ratings) ranging from 0.875 percent
 to 1.5 percent or (ii) a formula based on the agent bank’s prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5 percent or LIBOR plus 1.0 percent, plus a

eBay Inc.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
We
 have  a  cash  pooling  arrangement  with  a  financial  institution  for  cash  management  purposes.  This  arrangement  allows  for  cashwithdrawals
 from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the same financial institution (“AggregateCash Deposits”). This arrangement also
 allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the Aggregate Cash Deposits up to an agreed-upon limit. The netbalance
 of the withdrawals and the Aggregate Cash Deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expenseor
 income  under  the  arrangement.  As  of December  31,  2017 ,  we  had  a  total  of $1.9  billion in  cash  withdrawals  offsetting  our $2.1  billion in Aggregate Cash Deposits held w
ithin the financial institution under the cash pooling arrangement.Litigation and Other Legal Matters
 
Overview
We
 are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings on an ongoing basis. Many of these proceedings are in early stages and may seek anindeterminate
 amount of damages. If we believe that a loss arising from such matters is probable and can be reasonably estimated, we accrue theestimated
 liability in our financial statements. If only a range of estimated losses can be determined, we accrue an amount within the range that, inour
 judgment, reflects the most likely outcome; if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue thelow
 end  of  the  range.  For  those  proceedings  in  which  an  unfavorable  outcome  is  reasonably  possible  but  not  probable,  we  have  disclosed  anestimate
 of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses or we have concluded that an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range arisingdirectly
 from  the  proceeding  (i.e.,  monetary  damages  or  amounts  paid  in  judgment  or  settlement)  are  not  material.  If  we  cannot  estimate  theprobable
 or reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising from a proceeding, we have disclosed that fact. In assessing the materiality of aproceedi
ng, we evaluate, among other factors, the amount of monetary damages claimed, as well as the potential impact of non-monetary remediessought
 by plaintiffs (e.g., injunctive relief) that may require us to change our business practices in a manner that could have a material adverseimpact
 on our business. With respect to the matters disclosed in this Note 12, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses thatcould potentially result from the application of such n
on-monetary remedies.Amounts
 accrued for legal and regulatory proceedings for which we believe a loss is probable were not material for the twelve months ended December
 31, 2017 .  Except as otherwise noted for the proceedings described in this Note 12, we have concluded, based on currently availableinformation,
 that  reasonably  possible  losses  arising  directly  from  the  proceedings  (i.e.,  monetary  damages  or  amounts  paid  in  judgment  orsettlement)
 in excess of our recorded accruals are also not material. However, legal and regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable andsubject
 to significant uncertainties. If one or more matters were resolved against us in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’sexpectations, the impact on our operating results or financial co
ndition for that reporting period could be material.General Matte
rsOther
 third parties have from time to time claimed, and others may claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights.We
 are subject to patent disputes, and expect that we will increasingly be subject to additional patent infringement claims involving various aspectsof
 our business as our products and services continue to expand in scope and complexity. Such claims may be brought directly or indirectly againstour
 companies and/or against our customers (who may be entitled to contractual indemnification under their contracts with us), and we are subjectto
 increased exposure to such claims as a result of our acquisitions and divestitures and in cases where we are entering new lines of business. Wehave
 in  the  past  been  forced  to  litigate  such  claims.  We  may  also  become  more  vulnerable  to  third-party  claims  as  laws  such  as  the  DigitalMillennium
 Copyright Act, the Lanham Act and the Communications Decency Act are interpreted by the courts, and as we expand the scope of ourbusiness
 (both  in  terms  of  the  range  of  products  and  services  that  we  offer  and  our  geographical  operations)  and  become  subject  to  laws  injurisdictions
 where  the  underlying  laws  with  respect  to  the  potential  liability  of  online  intermediaries  like  ourselves  are  either  unclear  or  lessfavorable.
 We believe that additional lawsuits alleging that we have violated patent, copyright or trademark laws will be filed against us. Intellectualproperty
 claims, whether meritorious or not, are time consuming and costly to defend and resolve, could require expensive changes in our methodsof doing business or could require us to enter into costly royalty or lice
nsing agreements on unfavorable terms.From
 time to time, we are involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business, including suits by ourusers
 (individually or as class actions) alleging, among other things, improper disclosure of our prices, rules or policies, that our practices, prices,rules, policies or customer/user agreements violate applic
ableF-31

eBay Inc.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
law
 or  that  we  have  acted  unfairly  and/or  not  acted  in  conformity  with  such  prices,  rules,  policies  or  agreements.  Further,  the  number  andsignificance
 of these disputes and inquiries are increasing as the political and regulatory landscape changes and, as we have grown larger, ourbusinesses
 have expanded in scope (both in terms of the range of products and services that we offer and our geographical operations) and ourproducts
 and  services  have  increased  in  complexity.  Any  claims  or  regulatory  actions  against  us,  whether  meritorious  or  not,  could  be  timeconsuming,
 result in costly litigation, damage awards (including statutory damages for certain causes of action in certain jurisdictions), injunctiverelief
 or increased costs of doing business through adverse judgment or settlement, require us to change our business practices in expensive ways,require significant amounts of management time, result in the diversion of sig
nificant operational resources or otherwise harm our business.Indemnification Provisions
We
 entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements with PayPal to govern the separation and relationshipof the two
 companies going forward. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between usand
 PayPal,  which  may  be  significant.  In  addition,  the  indemnity  rights  we  have  against  PayPal  under  the  agreements  may  not  be  sufficient  toprotect us and our indemnity obligations to PayP
al may be significant.In
 addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors, executive officers and certain other officers. Theseagreements require
 us to indemnify such individuals, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, for certain liabilities to which they may becomesubject as a result of their affiliation with us.
In the ordinary course of business, we have included limited indemnificat
ion provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with which wehave
 commercial relations, including our standard marketing, promotions and application-programming-interface license agreements. Under thesecontracts,
 we generally indemnify, hold harmless and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnifiedparty
 in connection with claims by a third party with respect to our domain names, trademarks, logos and other branding elements to the extent thatsuch
 marks  are  applicable  to  our  performance  under  the  subject  agreement.  In  certain  cases,  we  have  agreed  to  provide  indemnification  forintellectual
 property  infringement.  It  is  not  possible  to  determine  the  maximum  potential  loss  under  these  indemnification  provisions  due  to  ourlimited
 history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. To date, losses recordedin
 our  consolidated  statement  of  income  in  connection  with  our  indemnification  provisions  have  not  been  significant,  either  individually  orcollectively.

Note 13 – Stockholders’ Equity
Preferred Stock
We
 are authorized, subject to limitations prescribed by Delaware law, to issue preferred stock in one or more series; to establish the numberof
 shares included within each series; to fix the rights, preferences and privileges of the shares of each wholly unissued series and any relatedqualifications,
 limitations or restrictions; and to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series (but not below the number of shares of aseries then
 outstanding) without any further vote or action by our stockholders. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , there were 10 million shares of $0.001 
 par value preferred stock authorized for issuance, and no shares issued or outstanding.Common Stock
Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes us to issu
e 3.6 billion shares of common stock. Stock Repurchase Programs
Our
 stock repurchase programs are intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and,subject
 to market conditions and other factors, to make opportunistic repurchases of our common stock to reduce our outstanding share count. Anyshare
 repurchases  under  our  stock  repurchase  programs  may  be  made  through  open  market  transactions,  block  trades,  privately  negotiatedtransactions
 (including  accelerated  share  repurchase  transactions)  or  other  means  at  times  and  in  such  amounts  as  management  deemsappropri
ate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives. Our stock repurchase programs may be limited or terminatedat
 any time without prior notice. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including corporate andregulatory requirements, price and other market conditions and mana
gement’s determination as to the appropriate use of our cash.  In
 July 2016, our Board authorized a $2.5  billion stock  repurchase program and in July 2017 our Board authorized an additional $3.0 billion stock repurchase program. These stock repurchase programs have no expiration from the date of
 authorization. The stock repurchase activity underour stock repurchase programs during 2017 was as follows (in mil

Note 14 – Employee Benefit Plans
Equity Incentive Plans
 
We
 have equity incentive plans under which we grant equity awards, including stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance-based
 restricted  stock  units  (“PBRSUs”),  stock  payment  awards  and  performance  share  units,  to  our  directors,  officers  and  employees.  As  ofDecember 31, 2017 
, 755 million shares were authorized under our equity ince ntive plans and 76 million shares were available for future grant. Stock
 options granted under these plans generally vest 12.5% six months from the date of grant (or 25% one  year from the date of grant forgrants
 to new employees) with the remainder vesting at a rate of 2.08%  per  month thereafter, and generally expire seven to ten  years from thedate
 of grant. RSU awards granted to eligible employees under our equity incentive plans generally vest in annual or quarterly installments over aperiod of 
three to five years, are subject to the employees’ continuing service to us and do not have an expiration date.In 
2017 , 2016 and 2015 ,  certain executives were eligible to receive PBRSU. PBRSU awards are subject to performance and time-basedvesting
 requirements.  The  target  number  of  shares  subject  to  the  PBRSU  award  are  adjusted  based  on  our  business  performance  measuredagainst the
 performance goals approved by the Compensation Committee at the beginning of the performance period. Generally, if the performancecriteria
 is satisfied, one-half of the award vests in March following the end of the performance period and the other half of the award vests in Marchof the following year.
Deferred Stock Units
Prior
 to  December  31,  2016,  we  granted  deferred  stock  units  to  each  non-employee  director  (other  than  Mr.  Omidyar)  at  the  time  of  ourannual
 meeting of stockholders and to new non-employee directors upon their election to the Board. Each deferred stock unit award granted to anew
 non-employee director upon election to the Board vests 25% one  year from the date of grant, and at a rate of 2.08%  per  month thereafter. Inaddition,
 directors were permitted to elect to receive, in lieu of annual retainer and committee chair fees and at the time these fees would otherwisebe
 payable, fully vested deferred stock units with an initial value equal to the amount based on the fair market value of common stock at the date ofgrant.
 Following termination of a non-employee director’s service on the Board of Directors, deferred stock units granted prior to August 1, 2013 arepayable
 in  stock  or  cash  (at  our  election),  while  deferred  stock  units  granted  on  or  after  August  1,  2013  are  payable  solely  in  stock.  As  ofDecember
 31, 2017 ,  there were approximately 259,632 deferred  stock units outstanding, which are included in our restricted  stock unit activitybelow. As of December 31, 2016, we no longer grant deferred stock un
its.Employee Stock Purchase Plan
We
 have  an  Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan  (“ESPP”)  for  all  eligible  employees.  Under  the  plan,  shares  of  our  common  stock  may  bepurchased
 over  an  offering  period  with  a  maximum  duration  of two years  at 85% of  the  lower  of  the  fair  market  value  on  the  first  day  of  theapplicable
 offering period or on the last day of the six-month purchase period. Employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 10% of their eligible compensation duri
ng an offering period. During 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , employees purchased approximately 4 million , 4 million and 4
 million shares  under this plan at average prices of $22.32 , $18.97 and $30.83 per  share, respectively. As of December  31, 2017 , approximately 16 million 
shares of common stock were reserved for future issuance. Stock Option Activity
No stock options were granted in 2017 and an immaterial amount of stock
 options were granted during 2016 and 2015. The weighted averagegrant-date fair value of options granted during 
2016 and 2015 was $5.40 and $6.84 , respectively. During 
2017 , 2016 and 2015 , the  aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised under our equity incentive plans was $26 million , $16 millionand 
$130 million , respectively, determined as of the date of option exercise. As of December 31, 2017 , we had options to purchase 3 million shares of our common stock outstanding and in-the-money.

 2021. If there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested awards, we may be required to accelerate,  increase orcancel
 all or a portion of the remaining unearned stock-based compensation expense. Future unearned stock-based compensation will increase tothe
 extent we grant additional equity awards, change the mix of grants between stock options and restricted stock units or assume unvested equityawards in connection wi
th acquisitions.Modifications of Stock-Based Awards
During
 2015, in connection with the Distribution, restricted and deferred stock awards and employee stock option awards were modified andconverted
 into new equity awards using conversion ratios designed to preserve the value of these awards to the holders immediately prior to theDistribution.
 On  July  17,  2015,  employees  holding  stock  options,  restricted  stock  awards  or  units,  deferred  stock  awards,  and  ESPP  awardsdenominated
 in  pre-Distribution  eBay  stock  received  a  number  of  otherwise-similar  awards  in  post-Distribution  eBay  stock  and/or  PayPal  stockbased on the conversion ratios outlined for
 each group of employees in the Employee Matters Agreement that we entered into in connection with theDistribution.
 Adjustments  to  our  outstanding  stock  based  compensation  awards,  including  ESPP  awards,  resulted  in  additional  compensationexpense of approximately  
$68 million to be recognized over the remaining vesting life of the un derlying awards.F-35

Employee Savings Plans
We
 have a defined contribution  plan, which is qualified under  Section 401(k)  of  the Internal  Revenue Code.  Participating  employees  maycontribute
 up to 50% of  their eligible compensation, but not more than statutory limits. In 2017 , 2016 and 2015 ,  we contributed one dollar for eachdollar

 of December  31, 2017 ,  our federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $15 million 
, $58 million and $106 million ,  respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various limitations underSection
 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable state tax laws. If not utilized, the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards willboth
 begin to expire in 2018. The carryforward periods on our foreign net operating loss carryforwards are as follows: $32 million do  not expire, $16 million 
are  subject to valuation allowance and begin to expire in 2019, and $58 million are  not subject to valuation allowance but will begin to expirein
 2024. As of December  31, 2017 ,  state tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $106  million .  Most of the state taxcredits carry forward indefinitely.
As of 
December  31, 2017 and 2016 ,  we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to certain of our deferred tax assets relating primarilyto operating losses in certain non-U.S. jurisdictio
ns that we believe are not likely to be realized.On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
 (the “Act” or “U.S. tax reform”) was enacted. U.S. tax reform, among other things, reducesthe
 U.S. federal income tax rate to 21% from 35% in  2018, institutes a dividends received deduction for foreign earnings with a related tax for thedeemed
 repatriation  of  unremitted  foreign  earnings  and  creates  a  new  U.S.  minimum  tax  on  earnings  of  foreign  subsidiaries.  We  have  notcompleted
 our  accounting  for  the  effects  of  the  Act;  however,  we  have  made  a  reasonable  estimate  of  those  effects.  Accordingly,  we  haverecognized
 a provisional  income tax charge of $3.1  billion ,  which  is  included  as  a  component  of  the  income  tax  provision  on  our  consolidatedstatement of income.
Included
 in  the  provisional  amount  is $1.4  billion for  the  income  tax  on  the  deemed  repatriation  of  unremitted  foreign  earnings.  We  havecomputed
 the amount based on information available to us; however, there is still uncertainty  as to the application of the Act, in particular  as itrelates
 to state income taxes. Further, we have not yet completed our analysis of the components of the computation, including the amount of ourforeign
 earnings subject to U.S. income tax, and the portion of our foreign earnings held in cash or other specified assets. We will elect to pay theliability
 for the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings in installments, as specified by the Act. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2017, $1.2 billion of our liability for deemed repatriation of foreign earni
ngs was included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.The remaining provisional
 amount of $1.7 billion is for the deferred income tax effects of the Act on our U.S. and foreign subsidiar ies, primarilythe impact of the new U.S. minimum tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries, partial

 by  the  reversal  of  our  existing  deferred  tax  liability  associated  with  repatriation  of  unremitted  foreign  earnings.  In  addition,  the  provisionalamount includes the
 remeasurement of certain U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities, foreign withholding taxes and other outside basis differences.We
 have computed the amount based on information available to us, including our expectation that existing foreign basis differences will affect theamount
 of  U.S.  minimum  tax  upon  reversal;  however,  there  is  still  uncertainty  as  to  the  application  of  the  Act.  We  have  not  yet  completed  ouranalysis
 of the components of the tax computation, including a complete reconciliation of the book and tax bases in our foreign subsidiaries. As wecomplete
 our analysis of U.S. tax reform in 2018, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts, which may materially impact our provisionfor income taxes from continuing operations in the period in w
hich the adjustments are made.During
 the fourth quarter of 2016, we began the process of realigning our legal structure, subsequent to the distribution of PayPal Holdings,Inc.,
 to better reflect how we manage and operate our platforms. We consider many factors in effecting this realignment, including foreign exchangeexposures,
 long-term cash flows and cash needs of our platforms, capital allocation considerations and the associated tax effects. As a result, weachieved
 a substantial step-up in the tax basis of the intangible assets in our foreign eBay platforms in 2016. The step-up in tax basis of our foreigneBay platforms
 resulted from our election to terminate an existing tax ruling and finalize a new agreement with the foreign tax authority. In the fourthquarter of
 2016, we recognized a tax benefit of $4.6 billion ,  which represented the income tax effect of this step-up in tax basis. During the first halfof 2017, we recognized a noncash inc
ome tax charge of $376 million caused by the foreign exchange remeasurement of the associ ated deferred taxasset.
 In the first quarter of 2017, we achieved a step-up in the tax basis of the intangible assets in our foreign Classifieds platforms as a result ofvoluntary domiciling our Classifie
ds intangible assets into a new jurisdiction and recognized a tax benefit of $695 million .   
As
 a result of the realignment, we no longer benefit from tax rulings previously concluded in several different jurisdictions. Without the benefitof
 the  rulings,  the  noncash  tax  impacts  of  the  realignment  in  our  foreign  eBay  and  Classifieds  platforms  have  increased  our  income  tax  rate  incertain
 foreign  jurisdictions,  most  significantly  Switzerland.  The  higher  rate  results  from  eBay  being  subject  to  a  higher  enacted  tax  rate  for  theforeseeable future.
While
 we experienced a higher tax rate, the realignment allows us to achieve certain foreign cash tax benefits due to the step-up in tax basisachieve
d in certain foreign jurisdictions. We expect these cash tax benefits to remain consistent, subject to the performance of our foreign platforms, 
for a period in excess of 10 years. The realignment is expected to extend into 2018 and primarily impact our international entities. However, U.S.tax reform and the new U.S. minimum tax on foreign earnings will reduce our expecte
d consolidated cash tax benefits.The following table reflects changes i
n unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 (in millions):

 within our gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits of $487  million as  of December 31, 2017 is $100 million of  unrecognized taxbenefits indemnified by
 PayPal. If the remaining balance of unrecognized tax benefits were realized in a future period, it would result in a tax benefitof 
$420 million .  Of this amount, approximately $95  million of  unrecognized tax benefit is indemnified by PayPal and a corresponding receivablewould
 be reduced upon a future realization. As of December  31, 2017 ,  our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits were included in other liabilitieson our consolidated balance
 sheet.We
 recognize  interest  and/or  penalties  related  to  uncertain  tax  positions  in  income  tax  expense.  In 2017 , $3 million was  included in taxexpense for
 interest and penalties. The amount of interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was approximately $43 million and 
$54 million , respectively.

eBay Inc.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
We
 are  subject  to  both  direct  and  indirect  taxation  in  the  U.S.  and  various  states  and  foreign  jurisdictions.  We  are  under  examination  bycertain
 tax  authorities  for  the  2008  to  2013  tax  years.  We  believe  that  adequate  amounts  have  been  reserved  for  any  adjustments  that  mayultimately
 result from these or other examinations. The material jurisdictions where we are subject to potential examination by tax authorities for taxyears after 2007 include, among others, the U.S. (Federal and Californ
ia), Germany, Korea, Israel, Switzerland, United Kingdom and Canada. 
Although
 the  timing  of  the  resolution  and/or  closure  of  audits  is  highly  uncertain,  it  is  reasonably  possible  that  the  balance  of  grossunrecognized
 tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. However, given the number of years remaining subject to examinationand
 the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognizedtax benefits.
 
On July
 27, 2015, in Altera  Corp. v. Commissioner ,  the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion invalidating the regulations relating to the treatmentof
 stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. A final decision was issued by the Tax Court in December2015.
 The IRS is appealing the decision and filed its arguments opposing the Tax Court decision in June 2016. Due to the uncertainty surroundingthe status
 of the current regulations, questions related to the scope of potential benefits or obligations, and the risk of the Tax Court’s decision beingoverturned
 upon  appeal,  we  have  not  recorded  any  benefit  or  expense  as  of December  31,  2017 .  We  will  continue  to  monitor  ongoingdevelopments and potential impacts to our conso
lidated financial statements.Note 16 – Interest and Other, Net
