Business ABOUT US
Netflix, Inc. (“Netflix
”, “the Company”, “we”, or “us”) is the world’s leading internet television network with over 117 million streaming memberships inover 
190 countries enjoying more than 140 million hours of TV shows and movies per day, including original series, documentaries and feature films. Ourmembers can watch as much 
as they want, anytime, anywhere, on nearly any internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all withoutcommercials or com
mitments. Additionally, in the United States ("U.S."), our members can receive DVDs delivered quickly to their homes.We are a pioneer in th
e internet delivery of TV shows and movies, launching our streaming service in 2007. Since this launch, we have developed anecosystem for interne
t-connected screens and have added increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy TV shows and movies directly on theirinternet-connected s
creens. As a result of these efforts, we have experienced growing consumer acceptance of, and interest in, the delivery of TV shows andmovies directly over th
e internet.Our core strategy is to grow our st
reaming membership business globally within the parameters of our profit margin targets. We are continuously improvingour members' experienc
e by expanding our streaming content with a focus on a programming mix of content that delights our members. In addition, we arecontinuously enhancing our user in
terface and extending our streaming service to more internet-connected screens. Our members can download a selection of titlesfor offline viewing.
We continue to grow our strea
ming service both domestically and internationally. We began our international expansion with Canada in 2010 and have sincelaunched our service globa
lly, with the exception of The People's Republic of China and territories where U.S. companies are not allowed to operate. We have alsoexpanded our streaming cont
ent offering to include more exclusive and original programming, including several Emmy, Golden Globe and Academy Awardwinning original series and docu
mentaries. Our original programming increasingly includes content that we produce.BUSINESS SEGMENTS
The Company has three reportab
le segments: Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD. The Domestic streaming segment derivesrevenues from monthly me
mbership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members in the United States. The International streamingsegment derives revenues 
from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members outside the United States. TheDomestic DVD segment derives revenu
es from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of DVD-by-mail. For additional information regarding oursegments, including inform
ation about our financial results by geography, see Note 11 Segment Information in the accompanying notes to ou r consolidatedfinancial statem
ents included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.1

Table of ContentsCOMPETITION
The market for entertainment vi
deo is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete against other entertainment video providers, such asmultichannel video progr
amming distributors ("MVPDs"), internet-based content providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providersand DVD retailers and more broad
ly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete againstentertainment video p
roviders and content producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed streaming content and for original content projects.While consumers may ma
intain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments offree time. We have o
ften referred to this choice as our objective of "winning moments of truth." In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, weare continually improv
ing our service, including both our technology and our content, which is increasingly exclusive and curated, and includes our own originalprogramming.
SEASONALITY
Our membership growth exhibits a s
easonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internet-connected screens and when they tend to increasetheir viewing. Historical
ly, the first and fourth quarters (October through March) represent our greatest membership growth across our Domestic and Internationalstreaming segments. Increasi
ngly, our membership growth is impacted by the release of certain high-profile original content. Internationally, we expect eachmarket to demonstrat
e more predictable seasonal patterns as our service offering in each market becomes more established and we have a longer history to assesssuch patterns.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We regard our trademarks, 
service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectualproperty as important to ou
r success. We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect ourproprietary intellectual property
. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounterdisputes over rights and obliga
tions concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.EMPLOYEES
As of 
December 31, 2017 , we had approximately 5,500 total employees. Of these employees, approximately 5,400 were full-time, inc luding approximately600 
categorized as temporary.OTHER INFORMATION

Risk Factors If any of the following risks ac
tually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of ourcommon stock could decline, and you could 
lose all or part of your investment.Risks Related to Our Business
If our efforts to attract and re
tain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.We have experienced sign
ificant membership growth over the past several years. Our ability to continue to attract members will depend in part on our abilityto consistently provide our m
embers with compelling content choices, as well as a quality experience for selecting and viewing TV shows and movies.Furthermore, the relative ser
vice levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract andretain memberships. Compe
titors include other entertainment video providers, such as MVPDs, internet-based movie and TV content providers (including thosethat provide pirated con
tent) and DVD retailers. If consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existingfeatures, adjust pric
ing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract andretain members. In add
ition, many of our members rejoin our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts to satisfyour existing members ar
e not successful, we may not be able to attract members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adverselyaffected. Members c
ancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, the need to cut household expenses,availability of content is 
unsatisfactory, competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved. Wemust continually add new memb
erships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. If we do not grow asexpected, given, in parti
cular that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures orincrease our (per me
mbership) revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operation may be adverselyimpacted. If we are unab
le to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing memberships and attracting new memberships,our business will be adversely a
ffected. Further, if excessive numbers of members cancel our service, we may be required to incur significantly higher marketingexpenditures than we curren
tly anticipate to replace these members with new members.Changes in competitive offerings for ent
ertainment video, including the potential rapid adoption of piracy-based video offerings, could adversely impactour business.
The market for enter
tainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers haveincreasing options to acc
ess entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported andpiracy-based models. 
All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damageour business, as its fundamenta
l proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. Furthermore, in light ofthe compelling consumer p
roposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters andcable network operators, as we
ll as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their internet-based video offerings. Several of thesecompetitors have long oper
ating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may securebetter terms from supp
liers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions andmarketing. New entrants may 
enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainmentvideo. Companies also may ente
r into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. If we are unable to successfully or profitablycompete with current and n
ew competitors, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues orprofitability.
The long-term and fixed cost nature of our content com
mitments may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity and results ofoperations.
In connection with licensing s
treaming content, we typically enter into multi-year commitments with studios and other content providers. We also enter intomulti-year commi
tments for content that we produce, either directly or through third parties, including elements associated with these production such as non-cancelable commitments under talent
 agreements. The payment terms of these agreements are not tied to member usage or the size of our membership base (“fixedcost”) but may be deter
mined by costs of production or tied to such factors as titles licensed and/or theatrical exhibition receipts. Such commitments, to the extentestimable under accoun
ting standards, are included in the Contractual Obligations section of Part II,3

Table of ContentsItem 7, "Management's Discussion 
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 5, Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consol
idated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report onForm 10-K. Given the multiple-ye
ar duration and largely fixed cost nature of content commitments, if membership acquisition and retention do not meet ourexpectations, our margins 
may be adversely impacted. Payment terms for certain content commitments, such as content we directly produce, will typically requiremore up-front cash paymen
ts than other content licenses or arrangements whereby we do not cashflow the production of such content. To the extent membershipand/or revenue growth do not mee
t our expectations, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content commitments andaccelerated payment requirements of
 certain agreements. In addition, the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our flexibility inplanning for, or reacting 
to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate. If we license and/or produce content that is not favorablyreceived by consumers in a 
territory, or is unable to be shown in a territory, acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the long-term and fixedcost nature of our content 
commitments, we may not be able to adjust our content offering quickly and our results of operation may be adversely impacted.We face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liabil
ity in connection with content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute through ourservice.
As a producer and distributor of 
content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright and trademark infringement, or other claims based on the natureand content of materials that
 we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute. We also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service,including marketing ma
terials. We are devoting more resources toward the development, production, marketing and distribution of original programming,including TV series and movies. W
e believe that original programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings, enhance our brand and otherwiseattract and reta
in members. To the extent our original programming does not meet our expectations, in particular, in terms of costs, viewing and popularity, ourbusiness, including our brand and resu
lts of operations may be adversely impacted. As we expand our original programming, we have become responsible forproduction costs and other expens
es, such as ongoing guild payments. We also take on risks associated with production, such as completion and key talent risk.Negotiations or renewals re
lated to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements could negatively impact timing and costs associated with ourproductions. To the extent we cr
eate and sell physical or digital merchandise relating to our original programming, and/or license such rights to third parties, wecould become subject to
 product liability, intellectual property or other claims related to such merchandise. We may decide to remove content from our service, notto place licensed or produ
ced content on our service or discontinue or alter production of original content if we believe such content might not be well received byour members or could be dam
aging to our brand.To the extent we do not accura
tely anticipate costs or mitigate risks, including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on or is removedfrom our service, or if we b
ecome liable for content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute, our business may suffer. Litigation to defend these claims couldbe costly and the expenses and da
mages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations. We may not be indemnifiedagainst claims or costs o
f these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims.If studios, content providers or other rights holders r
efuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could beadversely affected.
Our ability to provide our me
mbers with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights to distributesuch content and certain 
related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and theterms and conditions of such l
icenses vary. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us contentupon terms acceptable 
to us, our ability to stream content to our members will be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for contentprovide for the studios or othe
r content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions as well as other actions wemay take, content avai
lable through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we may see the cost of programming increase. As weseek to differentia
te our service, we are increasingly focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are alsofocused on programming an over
all mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles weadd and renew to our service. I
f we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our membership acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.Music and certain authors' p
erformances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, weengage in negotiations with co
llection management organizations (“CMOs”) that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in connection with streamingcontent into various ter
ritories. If we are unable to reach4

Table of Contentsmutually acceptabl
e terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which couldadversely impact our busin
ess. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation as well as negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in variousterritories could adv
ersely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, andthereby adversely impa
ct our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us topotential liability for copyri
ght infringement or otherwise increase our costs.If we are not able to manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected.
We are expanding our opera
tions internationally, scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members andfeatures related 
to our service, ramping up our ability to produce original content, as well as continuing to operate our DVD service within the U.S. As ourinternational offe
ring evolves, we are managing and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings, consumer customs and practices, in particular thosedealing with e-commer
ce and internet video, as well as differing legal and regulatory environments. As we scale our streaming service, we are developingtechnology and utilizing th
ird-party “cloud” computing services. As we ramp up our original content production, we are building out expertise in a number ofdisciplines, including cr
eative, marketing, legal, finance, licensing, merchandising and other resources related to the development and physical production ofcontent. If we are not abl
e to manage the growing complexity of our business, including improving, refining or revising our systems and operational practicesrelated to our strea
ming operations and original content, our business may be adversely affected.We could be subject to economic, politica
l, regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations.Operating in international
 markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic and political risksthat may be differen
t from or incremental to those in the U.S. In addition to the risks that we face in the U.S., our international operations involve risks that couldadversely affect our bus
iness, including:•
the need to adapt our content and user interfaces for specific cultural and language differences, including licensing a certain portion of our content assetsbefore we have developed a fu
ll appreciation for its performance within a given territory;•
difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;•
management distraction;•
political or social unrest and economic instability;•
compliance with U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, export controls and economic sanctions, and local laws prohibiting corruptpayments to government off
icials;•
difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions;•
regulatory requirements or government action against our service, whether in response to enforcement of actual or purported legal and regulatoryrequirements or otherwis
e, that results in disruption or non-availability of our service or particular content in the applicable jurisdiction;•
less favorable foreign intellectual property laws;•
adverse tax consequences such as those related to changes in tax laws or tax rates or their interpretations, and the related application of judgment indetermining our global 
provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities or other tax liabilities given the ultimate tax determination isuncertain;
•
fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which we do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge against and which could impactrevenues and expenses of our int
ernational operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk;•
profit repatriation and other restrictions on the transfer of funds;•
differing payment processing systems as well as consumer use and acceptance of electronic payment methods, such as payment cards;•
new and different sources of competition;•
censorship requirements that cause us to remove or edit popular content, leading to consumer disappointment or dissatisfaction with our service;•
low usage and/or penetration of internet-connected consumer electronic devices;5

Table of Contents•
different and more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy and other laws, including data localization requirements;•
availability of reliable broadband connectivity and wide area networks in targeted areas for expansion;•
integration and operational challenges as well as potential unknown liabilities in connection with companies we may acquire or control; and•
differing, and often more lenient, laws and consumer understanding/attitudes regarding the illegality of piracy.Our failure to manage any o
f these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business, and results of our operations.We are subject to taxation relat
ed risks in multiple jurisdictions.We are a U.S.-based multina
tional company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining ourglobal provision for income 
taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. While we believe our tax positions areconsistent with the tax laws in 
the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible that these positions may be overturned by jurisdictional taxauthorities, which may have 
a significant impact on our global provision for income taxes.Tax laws are dynamic and subje
ct to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. The U.S. recently enactedsignificant tax refo
rm, and certain provisions of the new law may adversely affect us. In addition, governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the taxpositions of companies. Many count
ries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development, ar
e actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in countries where we dobusiness. If U.S. or other foreign tax 
authorities change applicable tax laws, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition or results ofoperations may be adverse
ly impacted.If we fail to maintain or, in newer markets 
establish, a positive reputation with consumers concerning our service, including the content we offer, we maynot be able to attract or retain m
embers, and our operating results may be adversely affected.We believe that a posi
tive reputation with consumers concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members who have a number of choicesfrom which to obtain enter
tainment video. To the extent our content, in particular, our original programming, is perceived as low quality, offensive or otherwisenot compelling to consumers, ou
r ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted. To the extent our content is deemedcontroversial or offens
ive by government regulators, we may face direct or indirect retaliatory action or behavior, including being required to remove such contentfrom our service, our ent
ire service could be banned and/or become subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny across our business and operations. Furthermore, tothe extent our marketing,
 customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative consumer reaction, our ability to establish and maintaina positive reputation m
ay likewise be adversely impacted. With newer markets, we also need to establish our reputation with consumers and to the extent we arenot successful in creat
ing positive impressions, our business in these newer markets may be adversely impacted.Changes in how we market our service could adversely affect our 
marketing expenses and membership levels may be adversely affected.We utilize a broad m
ix of marketing and public relations programs, including social media sites, to promote our service to potential new members. We maylimit or discontinue use
 or support of certain marketing sources or activities if advertising rates increase or if we become concerned that members or potentialmembers deem certain marketing practice
s intrusive or damaging to our brand. If the available marketing channels are curtailed, our ability to attract new membersmay be adversely affected.
Companies that promote our se
rvice may decide that we negatively impact their business or may make business decisions that in turn negatively impact us.For example, if they decid
e that they want to compete more directly with us, enter a similar business or exclusively support our competitors, we may no longerhave access to their m
arketing channels. We also acquire a number of members who rejoin our service having previously cancelled their membership. If we areunable to maintain or r
eplace our sources of members with similarly effective sources, or if the cost of our existing sources increases, our member levels andmarketing expenses may be 
adversely affected.6

Table of ContentsWe utilize marke
ting to promote our content and drive viewing by our members. To the extent we promote our content inefficiently or ineffectively, we maynot obtain the expected a
cquisition and retention benefits and our business may be adversely affected.We rely upon a number of partners to make our service avai
lable on their devices.We currently offer 
members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internet-connected screens, including TVs, digital video players,television set-top boxe
s and mobile devices. We have agreements with various cable, satellite and telecommunications operators to make our service availablethrough the television set
-top boxes of these service providers. In many instances, our agreements also including provisions by which the partner bills consumersdirectly for the Netf
lix service or otherwise offers services or products in connection with offering our service. We intend to continue to broaden our relationshipswith existing partners and to 
increase our capability to stream TV shows and movies to other platforms and partners over time. If we are not successful inmaintaining existing and 
creating new relationships, or if we encounter technological, content licensing, regulatory, business or other impediments to deliveringour streaming content to ou
r members via these devices, our ability to retain members and grow our business could be adversely impacted.Our agreements with our partn
ers are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if, upon expiration, anumber of our partners do not con
tinue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us, which terms may include the degree ofaccessibility and prom
inence of our service. Furthermore, devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than Netflix and while these entities should beresponsible for the devic
es' performance, the connection between these devices and Netflix may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward Netflix andsuch dissatisfaction could 
result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business. In addition, technology changes to our streaming functionalitymay require that par
tners update their devices. If partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices, our service and our members' use and enjoyment couldbe negatively impacted.
Any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer syste
ms or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including thoserelating to cybersecurity or a
rising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized disclosure of data, including memberand corporate information, or theft of int
ellectual property, including digital content assets, which could adversely impact our business.Our reputation and ability 
to attract, retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems andthose of third parties th
at we utilize in our operations. These systems may be subject to damage or interruption from earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, othernatural disasters, te
rrorist attacks, power loss, telecommunications failures, and cybersecurity risks. Interruptions in these systems, or with the internet in general,could make our service unav
ailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver streaming content or fulfill DVD selections. Service interruptions, errorsin our software or the unavai
lability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our membership service to existing andpotential members.
Our computer systems and those of 
third parties we use in our operations are vulnerable to cybersecurity risks, including cyber-attacks, both from state-sponsored and individual activ
ity, such as computer viruses, denial of service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. These systemsperiodically experi
ence directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of data orintellectual property. An
y attempt by hackers to obtain our data (including member and corporate information) or intellectual property (including digital contentassets), disrupt our servic
e, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy anddamage our reputation. W
e have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems. From time to time, we haveexperienced an unauthori
zed release of certain digital content assets, however, to date these unauthorized releases have not had a material impact on our service orsystems. There is no assurance 
that hackers may not have a material impact on our service or systems in the future. Our insurance does not cover expenses relatedto such disruptions or unauthoriz
ed access. Efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to implementand may limit the func
tionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems. Any significant disruption to our service or access to oursystems could result in a loss o
f memberships and adversely affect our business and results of operation.We utilize our own communi
cations and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a third-party Web hosting provider. Inaddition, we utilize thi
rd-party “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations. We also utilize our own and third-party content deliverynetworks to help us stream TV shows and movies 
in high volume to Netflix members over the internet. Problems faced by us or our third-party Web hosting,“cloud” computing, or other n
etwork providers, including technological or business-related disruptions, as well as cybersecurity threats, could adversely impact theexperience of our members.

Table of ContentsWe rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate cer
tain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the Amazon WebServices operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.
Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) prov
ides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a"cloud" computing service. W
e have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing, storage capabilities and other servicesprovided by AWS. Currently, we run the vast m
ajority of our computing on AWS. Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS operationsto another cloud provider, any d
isruption of or interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.While the retail s
ide of Amazon competes with us, we do not believe that Amazon will use the AWS operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantageagainst our service.
If the technology we use in operating our business fails, is unavailable, or does not opera
te to expectations, our business and results of operation could beadversely impacted.
We utilize a combin
ation of proprietary and third party technology to operate our business. This includes the technology that we have developed torecommend and merchand
ise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of content to our members and their various consumerelectronic devices. For 
example, we have built and deployed our own content-delivery network (“CDN”). To the extent Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”) do notinterconnect with our CDN, or if we expe
rience difficulties in its operation, our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our streaming content to our memberscould be adversely impac
ted and our business and results of operation could be adversely affected. Likewise, if our recommendation and merchandisingtechnology does n
ot enable us to predict and recommend titles that our members will enjoy, our ability to attract and retain members may be adversely affected.We also utilize thi
rd party technology to help market our service, process payments, and otherwise manage the daily operations of our business. If our technologyor that of third parti
es we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly, including as a result of “bugs” in our development and deployment ofsoftware, our ability to ope
rate our service, retain existing members and add new members may be impaired. Any harm to our members' personal computers orother devices caused by softwa
re used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.If government regulations relating to 
the internet or other areas of our business change, we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct ourbusiness, or incur greater operating expenses.
The adoption or modificat
ion of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the mannerin which we currently conduct our bus
iness. As our service and others like us gain traction in international markets, governments are increasingly looking tointroduce new or extend lega
cy regulations to these services, in particular those related to broadcast media and tax. In addition, the continued growth anddevelopment of the mark
et for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws, which may impose additional burdens on us. If we arerequired to comply with new regu
lations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation, this compliance could cause us to incuradditional expenses or al
ter our business model.Changes in laws or regulations tha
t adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the internet, including laws impacting net neutrality, could decrease thedemand for our service and 
increase our cost of doing business. Certain laws intended to prevent network operators from discriminating against the legal trafficthat traverse thei
r networks have been implemented in many countries, including across the European Union. In others, the laws may be nascent or non-existent.Furthermore, favorable 
laws may change, including for example, in the United States where net neutrality regulations were recently repealed. Given uncertaintyaround these rules, including 
changing interpretations, amendments or repeal, coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local networkoperators, we could experien
ce discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expense or otherwisenegatively affect ou
r business.Changes in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across the
ir networks could adversely impact our business.We rely upon the ability o
f consumers to access our service through the internet. If network operators block, restrict or otherwise impair access to our serviceover their networks, our servi
ce and business could be negatively affected. To the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing, includingmeaningful bandwidth caps, or oth
erwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers, we could incur greater operating expenses and ourmembership acquisition an
d retention could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, to the extent network operators create tiers of internet access service and eithercharge us for or prohibit us f
rom being available through these tiers, our business could be negatively impacted.8

Table of ContentsMost network operators that prov
ide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming. As such,many network operators have an 
incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success. While we believe thatconsumer demand, regulato
ry oversight and competition will help check these incentives, to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferentialtreatment to thei
r data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices, our business could be negatively impacted. Theextent to which these
 incentives limit operator behavior differ across markets.Privacy concerns could limit our abili
ty to collect and leverage our membership data and disclosure of membership data could adversely impact ourbusiness and reputation.
In the ordinary course of busin
ess and in particular in connection with content acquisition and merchandising our service to our members, we collect andutilize data supplied by ou
r members. We currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information. Other businesses havebeen criticized by pr
ivacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regardingusers' browsing and other habits. Inc
reased regulation of data utilization practices, including self-regulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability tocollect, transfer 
and use data, could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, if we were to disclose data about our members in a manner that wasobjectionable to them, ou
r business reputation could be adversely affected, and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results.Internationally, we may b
ecome subject to additional and/or more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of customer and other personal information,such as laws regarding data lo
calization and/or restrictions on data export. Failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability, and to the extentthat we need to alter our bus
iness model or practices to adapt to these obligations, we could incur additional expenses.Our reputation and relationships with members would be harmed if our membe
rship data, particularly billing data, were to be accessed by unauthorizedpersons.
We maintain personal d
ata regarding our members, including names and billing data. This data is maintained on our own systems as well as that of thirdparties we use in our operat
ions. With respect to billing data, such as credit card numbers, we rely on encryption and authentication technology to secure suchinformation. We take 
measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our members' data. Despite these measures we, our payment processing services orother third party servi
ces we use such as AWS, could experience an unauthorized intrusion into our members' data. In the event of such a breach, current andpotential members m
ay become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to become members. Additionally, we could face legal claims orregulatory fines or pena
lties for such a breach. The costs relating to any data breach could be material, and we currently do not carry insurance against the risk of adata breach. We also m
aintain employment and personal information concerning our employees, including those on our own productions. Should an unauthorizedintrusion into our members' o
r employees' data occur, our business could be adversely affected and our larger reputation with respect to data protection could benegatively impacted.
We are subject to payment processing risk.
Our members pay for our servi
ce using a variety of different payment methods, including credit and debit cards, gift cards, direct debit and online wallets.We rely on internal syst
ems as well as those of third parties to process payment. Acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rulesand regulations and requir
e payment of interchange and other fees. To the extent there are disruptions in our payment processing systems, increases in paymentprocessing fees, mater
ial changes in the payment ecosystem, such as large re-issuances of payment cards, delays in receiving payments from payment processorsand/or changes to rules or r
egulations concerning payment processing, our revenue, operating expenses and results of operation could be adversely impacted. Incertain instances, we l
everage third parties such as our cable and other partners to bill subscribers on our behalf. If these third parties become unwilling or unable tocontinue processing payments on ou
r behalf, we would have to find alternative methods of collecting payments, which could adversely impact member acquisitionand retention. In addition, 
from time to time, we encounter fraudulent use of payment methods, which could impact our results of operation and if not adequatelycontrolled and managed cou
ld create negative consumer perceptions of our service.9

Table of ContentsIf our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequate
ly protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors, the value of our brandand other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affect
ed.We rely and expect to con
tinue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties withwhom we have relationships, as well 
as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforceour proprietary rights th
rough court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications.Nevertheless, these appli
cations may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties mayknowingly or unknowingly infringe our inte
llectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantialexpense to us. If the protec
tion of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and otherintangible assets may be d
iminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the perception of our business andservice to members and p
otential members may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected.We currently hold various do
main names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect ourreputation and brand and mak
e it more difficult for users to find our Web site and our service. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent thirdparties from acquir
ing domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.Intellectual property claims aga
inst us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our Web site, streamingtechnology, our recommendation and merchandising technology, tit
le selection processes and marketing activities.Trademark, copyright, pat
ent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. Our intellectual property rights extend to ourtechnology, business processes and th
e content we produce and distribute through our our Web site. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creatingsome of our content, merch
andising our products and marketing our service through contractual and other rights. From time to time, third parties allege that wehave violated their in
tellectual property rights. If we are unable to obtain sufficient rights, successfully defend our use, or develop non-infringing technology orotherwise alter our business p
ractices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third-partyintellectual prope
rty rights, our business and competitive position may be adversely affected. Many companies are devoting significant resources to developingpatents that could potent
ially affect many aspects of our business. There are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on theinternet. We have not se
arched patents relative to our technology. Defending ourselves against intellectual property claims, whether they are with or without meritor are determined in ou
r favor, results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. It also may result in our inability to use our currentWeb site, streaming t
echnology, our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products. We may alsohave to remove content f
rom our service. As a result of a dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, enter into royalty or licensing agreements,adjust our content, merch
andising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable onterms acceptable to us.
We are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unfores
een expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our management's timeand attention.
From time to time, we ar
e subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. As we have grown, wehave seen a rise in the numb
er of litigation matters against us. These matters have included copyright and other claims related to our content, patent infringementsas well as consumer and secur
ities class actions, each of which are typically expensive to defend. Litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses,result in content unavai
lability, service disruptions and otherwise occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention, any of which couldnegatively affect ou
r business operations and financial position.We may seek additional capital that may result 
in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders.From time to time, we may s
eek to obtain additional capital, either through equity, equity-linked or debt securities. Our cash flows provided by our operatingactivities have been negative
 in each of the last three years, primarily as a result of our decision to increase the amount of original streaming content available onour service. To the extent ou
r cash flows from10

Table of Contentsoperations continue to be neg
ative, we anticipate seeking additional capital. The decision to obtain additional capital will depend on, among other things, ourbusiness plans, operating perfo
rmance and condition of the capital markets. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debtsecurities, those secur
ities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution. Anylarge equity or equity-
linked offering could also negatively impact our stock price.We have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obliga
tions, which could adversely affect our financialposition.
We have a substantial a
mount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations. Moreover, we expect to incur substantialadditional indebtedness in 
the future and to incur other obligations, including additional streaming content obligations. As of December 31, 2017 , we had $6.5 billion 
aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding (“Notes”). In addition, we have entered into a revolving credit agreement that provides for a $500.0 million 
unsecured revolving credi t facility. As of December 31, 2017 , we have not borrowed any amount under th is revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2017 
, we had approximately $7.5 billion of total content liab ilities as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. Such amount does not include streaming contentcommitments that do not meet
 the criteria for liability recognition, the amounts of which are significant. For more information on our streaming contentobligations, including those not on ou
r consolidated balance sheet, see Note 5, Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to ou r consolidatedfinancial statem
ents included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our substantial indebtednessand other obligations, includ
ing streaming content obligations, may:•
make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our Notes and our otherobligations;
•
limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;•
limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general businesspurposes;
•
require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments and pay our other obligations when due;•
limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;•
place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and•
increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.Our streaming obligations in
clude large multi-year commitments. As a result, we may be unable to react to any downturn in the economy or reduction in ourcash flows from operations by r
educing our streaming content obligations in the near-term. This could result in our needing to access the capital markets at anunfavorable time, which m
ay negatively impact our stock priceWe may not be able to generate suffici
ent cash to service our debt and other obligations.Our ability to make paymen
ts on our debt, including our Notes, and our other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which issubject to prevailing e
conomic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. In each of the last three years,our cash flows from operating 
activities have been negative. We may be unable to attain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us topay the principal, prem
ium, if any, and interest on our debt, including the Notes, and other obligations, including amounts due under our streaming contentobligations.
If we are unable to servi
ce our debt and other obligations from cash flows, we may need to refinance or restructure all or a portion of such obligations prior tomaturity. Our ability to 
refinance or restructure our debt and other obligations will depend upon the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition atsuch time. Any refinancing or 
restructuring could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could furtherrestrict our business oper
ations. If our cash flows are insufficient to service our debt and other obligations, we may not be able to refinance or restructure any ofthese obligations on comme
rcially reasonable terms or at all and any refinancing or restructuring could have a material adverse effect on our business, results ofoperations, or financia
l condition.If our cash flows are insuff
icient to fund our debt and other obligations and we are unable to refinance or restructure these obligations, we could facesubstantial liquidity prob
lems and may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell material assets or operations to meet our debtand other obligations. We c
annot assure you that we would be able to implement any of these alternative measures on satisfactory terms or at all or that theproceeds from such
11

Table of Contentsalternatives would be adequ
ate to meet any debt or other obligations then due. If it becomes necessary to implement any of these alternative measures, ourbusiness, results of operations, o
r financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.We may lose key employees or may be unable to hire quali
fied employees.We rely on the continued se
rvice of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Reed Hastings, members of our executiveteam and other key employ
ees and the hiring of new qualified employees. In our industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly-skilledbusiness, product development, t
echnical and other personnel. We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existingpersonnel, which may be disruptiv
e to our operations.If our Domestic DVD segment declines faster 
than anticipated, our business could be adversely affected.The number of memberships to ou
r DVD-by-mail offering is declining, and we anticipate that this decline will continue. We believe, however, that thedomestic DVD business will continue to gen
erate significant contribution profit for our business. The contribution profit generated by our domestic DVD businesswill help provide capita
l resources to fund growth or our streaming service. To the extent that the rate of decline in our DVD-by-mail business is greater than weanticipate, our business cou
ld be adversely affected. We do not anticipate increasing resources to our DVD operations and the technology used in its operationswill not be meaningfully i
mproved. To the extent that we experience service interruptions or other degradations in our DVD-by-mail service, members' satisfactioncould be negatively impa
cted and we could experience an increase in DVD-by-mail member cancellations, which could adversely impact our business.If the U.S. Postal Service were to in
crease postal delivery rates or implement other changes to improve its financial position, such as closing mail processingfacilities or serv
ice reductions, such changes could lead to a decrease in customer satisfaction and our Domestic DVD segment's contribution profit could beadversely affected.
Risks Related to Our Stock Ownership
Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that s
tockholders may consider favorable.Our charter documents may d
iscourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they:•
authorize our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;•
provide for a classified board of directors;•
prohibit our stockholders from acting by written consent;•
establish advance notice requirements for proposing matters to be approved by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and•
prohibit stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders.As a Delaware corporation, we ar
e also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in abusiness combination with any holde
r of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board ofdirectors has approved the 
transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.In addition, a merger or 
acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our Amended and Restated ExecutiveSeverance and Retention Inc
entive Plan, thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction.Our stock price is volatile.
The price at which our common s
tock has traded has fluctuated significantly. The price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including thefollowing, some of which are beyond our 
control:•
variations in our operating results, including our membership acquisition and retention, revenues, contribution profits, net income and free cash flow;•
variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community;•
announcements of developments affecting our business, systems or expansion plans by us or others;12

Table of Contents•
competition, including the introduction of new competitors, their pricing strategies and services;•
market volatility in general;•
the level of demand for our stock, including the amount of short interest in our stock; and•
the operating results of our competitors.As a result of these and other 
factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price.Following certain peri
ods of volatility in the market price of our securities, we became the subject of securities litigation. We may experience more suchlitigation following futu
re periods of volatility. This type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources.Preparing and forecasting our financial results r
equires us to make judgments and estimates which may differ materially from actual results. Given the dynamic nature of ou
r business, and the inherent limitations in predicting the future, forecasts of our revenues, operating margins, net income andnumber of total and pai
d membership additions and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results. Such discrepancies could cause adecline in the trading p
rice of our common stock. In addition, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principlesgenerally accepted in the 
United States of America also requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets andliabilities, disclosu
res of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during thereported periods. We base su
ch estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, butactual results may di
ffer from these estimates. For example, we estimate the period of use, beginning with the month of first availability, of any particular licensedor produced television ser
ies or movie based upon factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns in order to amortize these content assets. If we revisesuch estimates it could 
reduce the amortization period or result in impairment charges for the relevant content assets resulting in greater in-period expenses, whichcould cause us to miss our earn
ings guidance or negatively impact the results we report which could negatively impact our stock price.Item 1B.

ear ended December 31, 2017 increased 32% , including an increase of 21% and 58% in revenues in the Domestic s treamingand International str
eaming segments, respectively, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 . International revenu es as of the end of December 31, 2017accounted for 
44% of consolidated revenue fo r the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 36% of consolidated revenues fo r the year ended December 31,2016. The increase in consolida
ted revenues was primarily driven by the growth in the average number of paid streaming memberships globally, the majority ofwhich was growth in our internationa
l memberships. Average paid international streaming memberships accounted for 49% of total average paid streaming memberships as of 
December 31, 2017 , as compared to 43% of total average paid streamin g memberships as of December 31, 2016 . The impact from membership growth was coupled with an 
increase in global streaming average monthly revenue per paying membership resulting from price changes and plan mix.The increase in operat
ing income is due primarily to increased revenues partially offset by increased content expenses as we continue to acquire, license andproduce content, including mo
re Netflix originals. This increase in content expenses includes a $39.1 million expense related to unreleased content that we haveabandoned. Headcount costs to support con
tinued improvements in our streaming service, our international expansion and increased content production activitiesalso increased. The incr
ease in net income was comprised of an increase in operating income and an increase in the tax benefit primarily due to the adoption ofASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of 2017, pa
rtially offset by an increase in interest expense primarily due to the higher principal of notes outstanding and anincrease in foreign ex
change losses primarily due to the remeasurement of our euro denominated senior notes.We offer three types o
f streaming membership plans. Our "basic" plan includes access to standard definition quality streaming on a single screen at a time.Our "standard" plan is our most popula
r streaming plan and includes access to high definition quality streaming on two screens concurrently. Our "premium" planincludes access to high def
inition and ultra-high definition quality content on four screens concurrently. As of December 31, 2017 , pricing on our plans ranged in the U.S. from $7.99 to $13.99 per month and inte
rnationally from the U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $4 to $20 per month. We expect that from time totime the prices of our 
membership plans in each country may increase.The following represents the k
ey elements to our segment results of operations:•
We define contribution profit (loss) as revenues less cost of revenues and marketing expenses incurred by the segment. We believe this is an importantmeasure of our operating s
egment performance as it represents each segment's performance before global corporate costs. As markets within ourInternational streaming segment
 become profitable, we increasingly focus on our global operating margin as a measure of profitability.•
For the Domestic and International streaming segments, amortization of the streaming content assets makes up the vast majority of cost of revenues.Increasingly, we obtai
n multi-territory or global rights for our streaming content and allocate these rights between Domestic and International streamingsegments based on estimat
ed fair market value. Expenses associated with the acquisition, licensing and production of streaming content, streamingdelivery costs and other ope
rations costs make up the remainder of cost of revenues. We have built our own global content delivery network ("OpenConnect") to help us effici
ently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet. Streaming delivery expenses, therefore, includeequipment costs relat
ed to Open Connect and all third-party costs, such19

Table of Contentsas cloud computing costs, associ
ated with delivering streaming content over the internet. Other operations costs include customer service and paymentprocessing fees, including thos
e we pay to our integrated payment partners, as well as other costs incurred in making our content available to members.•
For the Domestic and International streaming segments, marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to ourmarketing partners, in
cluding consumer electronics manufacturers, MVPD's, mobile operators and ISP's. Advertising expenses include promotionalactivities such as digi
tal and television advertising. Marketing expenses are incurred by our Domestic and International streaming segments given ourfocus on building consumer awaren
ess of the streaming offerings, and in particular our original content.Segment Results

er paying membership. The increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership resulted from our price changes and plan mix.Our standard plan continues to be

ates. We launched our streaming service in Canada in September 2010 and have expanded our services internationally as shownbelow.
The 
increase in our international r evenues was due to the 43% growth in the average number o f paid international memberships and an  11%  increase in average monthly revenue p
er paying membership. The increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership resulted from our price changes and plan mix,coupled with favorable flu
ctuations in foreign exchange rates. We estimate that international revenues would have been approximately $21.9 million lower in the year ended 
December 31, 2017 if foreign exchange ra tes had remained consistent with those for the year ended December 31, 2016 . If 21

Table of Contentsforeign currency exchang
e rates fluctuate more than expected, revenues and average revenue per paying membership may differ from our expectations.The 
increase in international cost o f revenues was primarily due to a $990.3 million increase in content a mortization relating to our existing and newstreaming content, inc
luding more exclusive and original programming. Other costs increased $236.2 million primarily due to increases i n our streaming deliveryexpenses, costs associated with ou
r customer service call centers and payment processing fees, all driven by our growing member base, partially offset bydecreases resulting from exc

eting expenses increased mainly due to increased advertising and public relations as well as increased payments to our partners.International contr

cember 31, 2015The increase in our inte
rnational revenues was due to the 57% growth in the average number o f paid international memberships and a  4%  increase inaverage monthly revenue p
er paying membership. The increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership resulted from our price changes and plan mix,offset partially by unf
avorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. We estimate that international revenues would have been approximately $174.0 million higher in the year ended 
December 31, 2016 if foreign exchange ra tes had remained consistent with those for the year ended December 31, 2015 . If foreign currency exchange rat
es fluctuate more than expected, revenues and average revenue per paying membership may differ from our expectations.The increase in intern
ational cost of revenues was primarily due to a $998.5 million increase in content exp enses relating to our existing and new streamingcontent, including more ex
clusive and original programming. Other costs increased $132.5 million primarily due to incr eases in our streaming delivery expenses,costs associated with our custo
mer service call centers and payment processing fees, all driven by our growing member base, partially offset by decreases resultingfrom exchange rate
fluctuations.
International mark
eting expenses increased mainly due to expenses for territories launched in the last eighteen months.International contr

cember 31, 2016At the beginning of 2017, we underwent a corpo
rate restructuring that better aligns our corporate structure with how our business operates. As a result of thisrestructuring and our inc
reasing international income, there is now significantly more income being taxed at rates lower than the U.S. tax rate.The decrease in our eff
ective tax rate is mainly due to the recognition of excess tax benefits attributable to the adoption of ASU 2016-09 and an increase inforeign income taxed a
t rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate. In 2017, the difference between our (15)% effective tax rate and the Fe deral statutory rate of 35% was 
$(243.5) million primarily due to the r ecognition of excess tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes, an increase in foreign income taxedat rates lower than the U.S. sta
tutory rate and Federal and California research and development credits (“R&D”), partially offset by state taxes and non-deductibleexpenses as well as the provision
al impact of changes to tax law.On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (th
e “Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code.Changes include, 
but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax y ears beginning after December 31, 2017 , the transition of U.S international taxation 
from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulativeforeign earnings as of Dece
mber 31, 2017. We have calculated our best estimate of the impact of the Act in our year end income tax provision in accordance withour understanding of the Act and guid
ance available as of the date of this filing and as a result have recorded $79.1 million as additional income t ax expense in thefourth quarter of 
2017 , the period in which the legis lation was enacted. The provisional amount related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets andliabilities, based on th
e rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, was $46.9 million . The provisional amount rel ated to the one-time transition taxon the mandatory deemed r
epatriation of foreign earnings was $32.2 million based on cumulative fore ign earnings of $484.9 million . We also recorded a $66.5 million 
benefit related to foreign taxes expensed in prior years that may now be claimed as a Foreign Tax Credit. We have determined there is sufficient foreignsource income projected to
 utilize these credits.Year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended De
cember 31, 2015The increase in our eff
ective tax rate is mainly due to a $13.4 million release of tax rese rves in 2015 and an increase in foreign taxes. In 2016, the differencebetween our 
28% effective tax rate and the Fe deral statutory rate of 35 % was $17.3 million primarily due to the 2016 Fede ral and California R&D credits partiallyoffset by state income 
taxes, foreign taxes, and nondeductible expenses.25

Long-term Debt in the accompanying notes to ou r consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements andSupplementary Data" of this Annual Repo
rt on Form 10-K for additional information about long-term debt. We anticipate financing our capital needs in the debtmarket, as we believe our 
after-tax cost of debt is lower than our cost of equity. Our ability to obtain any additional financing that we may choose to, or need to,obtain will depend on, among other 
things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time weseek financing. We may not b
e able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debtsecurities, those secur
ities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.Our primary uses of cash includ
e the acquisition, licensing and production of content, streaming delivery, marketing programs and personnel-related costs.For licensed content, cash pay
ment terms have historically been in line with the amortization period. Investments in original content, and in particular content thatwe produce and own, require more c
ash upfront relative to licensed content. For example, production costs are paid as the content is created, well in advance ofwhen the content is availab
le on the service and amortized. We expect to significantly increase our investments in global streaming content, particularly in originalcontent, which will impact ou
r liquidity and result in future negative free cash flows for many years. We currently anticipate that cash flows from operations,available funds and acc
ess to financing sources, including our revolving credit facility, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the nexttwelve months.
Free Cash Flow
We define free cash 
flow as cash provided by (used in) operating and investing activities excluding the non-operational cash flows from purchases, maturitiesand sales of short-term 
investments. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cashgenerated that is ava
ilable to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations, includinginvestments in global str
eaming content. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of, or as asubstitute for, net incom
e, operating income, cash flow used in operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented inaccordance with GAAP.
In assessing liquidity in re
lation to our results of operations, we compare free cash flow to net income, noting that the three major recurring differences areexcess content payments ove
r amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense and other working capital differences. Working capital differencesinclude deferred revenue, ta
xes and semi-annual interest payments on our outstanding debt. Our receivables from members generally settle quickly and deferredrevenue is a source of cash 
flow.26

As of December 31, 2017 , streaming content oblig ations were comprised of $4.2 billion included in "Current content liabilities" and $3.3 billion of "Non- current content liab
ilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $10.2 billion of obligations that are no t reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets asthey did not then meet
 the criteria for recognition.Streaming content obliga
tions increased $3.2 billion from $14.5 billion as of December 31, 2016 to $17.7 billion as of December 31, 2017 primarily due to multi-year commi
tments associated with the continued expansion of our exclusive and original programming.Streaming content obliga
tions include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of streaming content. An obligation for the production ofcontent includes non-canc
elable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of contentis incurred at the time we
 enter into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the ConsolidatedBalance Sheets. Certain agr
eements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yetdeterminable as of th
e reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired isunknown, are examples of these typ
es of agreements. The contractual obligations table above does not include any estimated obligation for the unknownfuture titles, paymen
t for which could range from less than one year to more than five years. However, these unknown obligations are expected to besignificant and we believ
e could include approximately $3 billion to $5 billion over the next three yea rs, with the payments for the vast majority of suchamounts expected to occur 
after the next twelve months. The foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts maydiffer. Once we know the title 
that we will receive and the license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above.

Other purchase obligati ons include all other non-cancelable contractual obligations. These contracts are primarily related to streaming delivery and DVDcontent acquisition.
As of 
December 31, 2017 , we had gross unrecognized tax bene fits of $42.9 million which was classified in “Other non -current liabilities” and a reduction todeferred tax assets which was 
classified as "Other non-current assets" in the consolidated balance sheets. At this time, an estimate of the range of reasonablypossible adjustments to the b

The preparation of con
solidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requiresmanagement to make es
timates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dateof the financial sta
tements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") hasdefined a company’s cri
tical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations,and which require a company to 
make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies andjudgments addressed below. We bas
e our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under thecircumstances. Actual result
s may differ from these estimates.Streaming Content
We acquire, license 
and produce content, including original programing, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of TV shows and films. The contentlicenses are for a f
ixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cashpayments relative to the amortizati
on expense. Payments for content, including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classifiedwithin "Net cash used in operating 
activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.For licenses, we capitali
ze the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost ofthe title is known and the ti
tle is accepted and available for streaming. The portion available for streaming within one year is recognized as “Current content assets,net” and the remaining po
rtion as “Non-current content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.For productions, we capitaliz
e costs associated with the production, including development cost, direct costs and production overhead. We include theseamounts in "Non-current conten
t assets, net" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization ofproduction costs.
Based on factors including histo
rical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on theConsolidated Statements of Oper
ations, over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with themonth of first availab
ility. The amortization is on an accelerated basis as we typically expect more upfront viewing, for instance due to additional merchandisingand marketing efforts. We re
view factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. Our estimates related to these factors requireconsiderable managem
ent judgment.Our business model is subscription bas
ed as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Therefore, content assets, both licensed andproduced, are reviewed in agg
regate at the operating segment level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness. Todate, we have not identifi
ed any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be statedat the lower of unamorti
zed cost, net realizable value or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned arewritten off.

Table of ContentsIncome Taxes
We record a provision for 
income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method.Deferred income taxes are reco
gnized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carryingamounts of existing assets and 
liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assetsand liabilities of a 
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, ifnecessary, by a valuation a
llowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.Although we believe our assumptions, judg
ments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of anytax audits could signific
antly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.In evaluating our abili
ty to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our pastoperating results, and our fo
recast of future earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized indetermining future t
axable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.Actual operating results 
in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates. However, we believe that it is more likely than not thatmost of the deferred t
ax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets will ultimately be realized. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred taxassets to the net amount th
at we believe is more likely than not to be realized. At December 31, 2017 the valuation allowance of $49.4 million was related toforeign tax credits that 
we are not expected to realize.We did not recognize ce
rtain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. We may recognize a tax benefit only if it ismore likely than not the 
tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefitsrecognized in the financial 
statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. At 
December 31, 2017 , our estimated gross unrecogn ized tax benefits were $42.9 million of which $37.9 million , if recognized, would favorab lyimpact our future ea
rnings. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may changeand the actual tax benefits
 may differ significantly from the estimates.On 
December 22, 2017 , the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act” ) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code.Changes include, 
but are not limited to, a federal corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning af ter December 31, 2017 , the transition of U.S international taxati
on from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreignearnings. We have estim
ated our provision for income taxes in accordance with the Act and guidance available as of the date of this filing and as a result haverecorded 
$79.1 million as additional income t ax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 , the period in which the legis lation was enacted. The provisional amountrelated to the remeasurement of certai
n deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, was $46.9 million . The provisional amount rel
ated to the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was $32.2 million based on cumulativeforeign earnings of $484.9 mil
lion.On December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulle
tin No. 118 ("SAB 118") was issued to address the application of US GAAP in situations when a registrantdoes not have the 
necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certainincome tax effects o
f the Act. In accordance with SAB 118, we have determined that the $46.9 million of the deferred tax expense recorded in connection with theremeasurement of c
ertain deferred tax assets and liabilities and the $32.2 million of current tax expense recorded in connection with the transition tax on themandatory deemed repa
triation of foreign earnings was a provisional amount and a reasonable estimate at December 31, 2017. Additional work is necessary for amore detailed analys
is of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our historical foreign earnings as well as potential correlative adjustments. Any subsequentadjustment to these amoun
ts will be recorded to current tax expense in the quarter of 2018 when the analysis is complete.See Note 9 to the consolidated f
inancial statements for further information regarding income taxes.Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Ma rket RiskWe are exposed to marke
t risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our debt and foreign currencyfluctuations. In July 2017, we sold al
l short-term investments.Interest Rate Risk
At 
December 31, 2017 , our cash equivalents were gen erally invested in money market funds, which are not subject to market risk because the interest paidon such funds fluctuates with the p
revailing interest rate.As of 
December 31, 2017 , we had $6.6 billion of debt, consisting of fixed r ate unsecured debt in seven tranches due between 2021 and 2028. Refer to Note 4to the consolidated finan
cial statements for details about all issuances. The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing inperiods of declining rat
es of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. The fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on changes inforeign currency rat
es, as discussed below.Foreign Currency Risk
International revenu
es and cost of revenues account for 44% and 54% , respectively, of consolid ated amounts for the year ended December 31, 2017 . The majority of interna
tional revenues and a smaller portion of expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and we therefore have foreigncurrency risk relat
ed to these currencies, which are primarily the euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Japanese yen and theBrazilian real.
Accordingly, changes in exchange 
rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue andcontribution profit (loss
) of our International streaming segment as expressed in U.S. dollars. For the year ended December 31, 2017 , we believe our internat ionalrevenues would have been approxim
ately $21.9 million lower had foreign currency exchange rates remained consistent with those for the year ended December 31, 2016 
. We have also experienc
ed and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the remeasurementof monetary assets and li
abilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency. In the year ended December 31, 2017 , we recognized a $127.9 million 
foreign exchange loss which resu lted primarily from the remeasurement of our €1,300.0 million Senior Notes and was partially offset by theremeasurement of sign
ificant content liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currencies of our European and U.S. entities.In addition, the effec
t of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents in the year ended December 31, 2017 was an increase of $29.8 million . We do not use foreign exchange 
contracts or derivatives to hedge any foreign currency exposures. The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factorsthat we cannot forecast wi
th reliable accuracy. Our continued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result suchfluctuations could have a s
ignificant impact on our future results of operations.Item 8.

Controls and Procedures (a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the par
ticipation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controlsand procedures (as defined 
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by thisAnnual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evalua
tion, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls andprocedures as of the end of th
e period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required tobe disclosed by us in reports tha
t we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reportedwithin the time periods spe
cified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated toour management, including ou
r Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.Our management, including our Chi
ef Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or ourinternal controls will p
revent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,assurance that the obje
ctives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and thebenefits of controls must b
e considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provideabsolute assurance that 
all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Netflix have been detected. 
(b)
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsibl
e for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 as 
amended (the Exchange Act)). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as ofDecember 31, 2017 
. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the TreadwayCommission (“COSO”) in 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessm ent under the framework in Internal Control— Integrated Framework 
(2013 framework), our manage ment concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017 . The effectiveness of our 
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independ ent registeredpublic accounting firm, 
as stated in their report that is included herein. 
(c)
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There was no change in our intern
al control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2017 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
 to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

The Board of Directors and Stockholde
rs of Netflix, Inc.Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited Netflix,
 Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 , based on criteria est ablished in Internal Control - IntegratedFramework issued by the Committe
e of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Netflix,Inc. (the Company) mai
ntained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 , based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balancesheets of the Company as of 
December 31, 2017 and 2016 , and the related consolid ated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity andcash flows for each of the th
ree years in the period ended December 31, 2017 of the Company and our report dat ed January 29, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company's management is respons
ible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internalcontrol over financia
l reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is toexpress an opinion on the Company’s int
ernal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB andare required to be indep
endent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of theSecurities and Exchange Commiss
ion and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in a
ccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assuranceabout whether effectiv
e internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internalcontrol over financia
l reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal controlbased on the assessed risk, and per
forming such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonablebasis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over F
inancial ReportingA company’s internal contro
l over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation of financial statement
s for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financialreporting includes tho
se policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions and dispositions o
f the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation offinancial statements in accordance
 with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only inaccordance with authori
zations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, us
e, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent l
imitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to futu
re periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate.

companying consolidated balance sheets of Netflix, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , and the related consolid atedstatements of operat
ions, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 . In our opinion, the financial 
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , and the consolidated results o
f its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting pr
inciples.We also have audited, in a

ements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based onour audits. We are a publi
c accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with theU.S. federal securities l

ccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance about whet
her the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures toassess the risks of mater

ining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating theaccounting principles u
sed and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believethat our audits provide a r
easonable basis for our opinion.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1.
Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business
Netflix, Inc. (the “Company”
) was incorporated on August 29, 1997 and began operations on April 14, 1998. The Company is the world’s leading internettelevision network with over 
117 million streaming memberships in over 190 countries enjoying more than 140 million hours of TV shows and movies per day,including original seri
es, documentaries and feature films. Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on nearly any internet-connected screen.Members can play, pause and r
esume watching, all without commercials or commitments. Additionally, in the United States ("U.S."), members can receive DVDs.The Company has 
three reportable segments: Dom estic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD, all of which derive revenue from monthlymembership fees. See Note 11 to 
the consolidated financial statements for further detail on the Company's segments.Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financi
al statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions havebeen eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of con
solidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requiresmanagement to make es
timates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date ofthe financial stat
ements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates andassumptions include the str
eaming content asset amortization policy and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. The Company basesits estimates on histor
ical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis,the Company evaluates these 
assumptions, judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates.Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
In March 2016, the Financial Accoun
ting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting 
, which amends Accounting Standards Codifi cation ("ASC") Topic 718,  Compensation – Stock Compensation . ASU 2016-09 simplifies several 
aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equityor liabilities, and c
lassification on the statement of cash flows. Under the new standard, all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies are recorded as a component ofthe provision for income t
axes in the reporting period in which they occur. Additionally, ASU 2016-09 requires that the Company present excess tax benefits onthe Statement of Cash Flows as an oper
ating activity. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods withinthose fiscal years. The Company 
adopted ASU 2016-09 in fiscal year 2017 and elected to apply this adoption prospectively. Prior periods have not been adjusted.See Note 9 to the consolidated f
inancial statements for information regarding the impact on the Company’s financial statements.In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01,  
Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying th e Definition of a Business . The standard provides guidance to assist entit
ies with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. If substantially all ofthe fair value of the g
ross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single asset or a group of similar assets, the assets acquired (or disposed of) are notconsidered a business. ASU 2017-01 is effec
tive for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (including interim periods within those periods) with earlyadoption permitted. The Company 
early adopted the standard in the third quarter of 2017 on a prospective basis and the impact on its consolidated financialstatements was not material.
Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) which amended the existing a ccounting standards forrevenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 establ
ishes principles for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount thatreflects the expec
ted consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date for annual reportingperiods beginning after Dec
ember 15, 2017 (including interim reporting periods within those periods). The amendments may be applied45

Table of Contentsretrospectively to each prior
 period (full retrospective) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application (modifiedretrospective). The Company wi
ll adopt ASU 2014-09 in the first quarter of 2018 and apply the modified retrospective approach. Because the Company's primarysource of revenues is from 
monthly membership fees which are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period, the Company does not expect the impacton its consolidated fi
nancial statements to be material.In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, 
Leases (Topic 842) in order to increase t ransparency and comparability among organizations byrecognizing lease asse
ts and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. ASU 2016-02 requires that alessee should recognize a 
liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the leaseterm on the balance she
et. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 (including interim periods within those periods) using amodified retrospect
ive approach and early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-02 in the first quarter of 2019. Although the Company is inthe process of evaluating 
the impact of adoption of the ASU on its consolidated financial statements, the Company currently believes the most significant changeswill be related to the 
recognition of new right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the Company's balance sheet for real estate operating leases.In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, 
Restricted Cash , which requires amounts gener ally described as restricted cash and restricted cashequivalents be included with 
cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the total beginning and ending amounts for the periods shown on the statement of cashflows. ASU 2016-08 is effective for fis
cal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (including interim periods within those periods) using a retrospective transitionmethod to each period pres
ented. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-18 in the first quarter of 2018 and does not expect the impact on its consolidated financialstatements to be material.
In January 2018, the FASB released guidance on 
the accounting for tax on the global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") provisions of the Tax Cuts andJobs Act (the "Act"). The GILTI provisions i
mpose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. The guidanceindicates that eith
er accounting for deferred taxes related to GILTI inclusions or to treat any taxes on GILTI inclusions as period cost are both acceptable methodssubject to an accounting pol
icy election. Effective the first quarter of 2018, the Company will elect to treat any potential GILTI inclusions as a period cost as weare not projecting any material
 impact from GILTI inclusions and any deferred taxes related to any inclusion would be immaterial.Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments
The Company considers investments 
in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. The Company alsoclassifies amounts in tran
sit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card transactions as cash equivalents.In July 2017, the Company sold all short-
term investments. The Company classified short-term investments, which consisted of marketable securities withoriginal maturiti
es in excess of 90 days as available-for-sale. Short-term investments were reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in“Accumulated other comp
rehensive loss” within Stockholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amortization of premiums and discounts on theinvestments, realiz
ed gains and losses, and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in “Interest and otherincome (expense)” in the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company used the specific identification method to determine cost in calculating realizedgains and losses upon the sale of shor
t-term investments.Short-term investments we
re reviewed periodically to identify possible other-than-temporary impairment. When evaluating the investments, the Companyreviewed factors such as th
e length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, the Company’s intent tosell, or whether it would be mor
e likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the investments before the recovery of their amortized cost basis.Streaming Content
The Company acquires, licenses 
and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited viewing of TV shows and films.The content licenses ar
e for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require moreupfront cash payments rel
ative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities, areclassified within "Net cash us
ed in operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.For licenses, the Company capit
alizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins,the cost of the title 
is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. The portion available for streaming within one year is recognized as “Currentcontent assets, net” and th
e remaining portion as “Non-current content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.46

Table of ContentsFor productions, the Company capita
lizes costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead. Theseamounts are included in "Non-cu
rrent content assets, net" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with theamortization of produc
tion costs.Based on factors including histo
rical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues”on the Consolidated Statements o
f Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or 10 years, beginningwith the month of first ava
ilability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as the Company typically expects more upfront viewing, for instance due toadditional merchandis
ing and marketing efforts. The Company reviews factors impacting the amortization of the content assets on an ongoing basis. TheCompany's estimates rela
ted to these factors require considerable management judgment. The Company's business model is subscript
ion based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Therefore, content assets, bothlicensed and produced, are 
reviewed in aggregate at the operating segment level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expectedusefulness of the content or 
that the net realizable value or fair value may be less than amortized cost. To date, the Company has not identified any such event orchanges in circumstanc
es. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost, net realizablevalue or fair value. In 
addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.Property and Equipment
Property and equipme
nt are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of theestimated useful liv
es of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years , or the lease term fo r leasehold improvements, if applicable. Leased buildings arecapitalized and inc
luded in property and equipment when the Company was involved in the construction funding and did not meet the “sale-leaseback” criteria.Revenue Recognition
The Company's primary source of r
evenues are from monthly membership fees. Members are billed in advance of the start of their monthly membership andrevenues are recognized ratabl
y over each monthly membership period. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that are collected from members and remitted togovernmental authorit
ies. Deferred revenue consists of membership fees billed that have not been recognized and gift and other prepaid memberships that have notbeen redeemed.
Marketing
Marketing expenses consist pr
imarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to the Company’s partners, including consumer electronics (“CE”)manufacturers, mult
ichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), mobile operators and internet service providers (“ISPs”). Advertising expenses includepromotional activit
ies such as digital and television advertising. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $1,091.1 million , $842.4million 
and $714.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Research and Development
Research and development exp
enses are included within "Technology and Development" on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations andprimarily consist of pay
roll and related costs incurred in making improvements to our service offerings. Research and development expenses were $981.3 million , $768.3 million 
and $570.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Income Taxes
The Company records a provision for 
income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liabilitymethod. Deferred income ta
xes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statementcarrying amounts of exist
ing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferredtax assets and liabili
ties of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets isreduced, if necessary, by a v
aluation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.The Company did not recognize ce
rtain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. The Company may recognize a taxbenefit only if it is mo
re likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.The tax benefits recogni
zed in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon

cognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. See Note 9 to the consolidated finan cialstatements for further informatio
n regarding income taxes.Foreign Currency
The functional currency 
for the Company's subsidiaries is determined based on the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. TheCompany translates the asse
ts and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end ofeach period. Revenues and expenses 
for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from thesetranslations are re
cognized in cumulative translation adjustment included in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" in Stockholders’ equity on the ConsolidatedBalance Sheets.
Prior to January 1, 2015, the function
al currency of certain of the Company's European entities was the British pound. The Company changed the functionalcurrency of these enti
ties to the euro effective January 1, 2015 following the redomiciliation of the European headquarters and the launch of the Netflix service inseveral significant Eu
ropean countries. The change in functional currency was applied prospectively from January 1, 2015. Monetary assets and liabilities havebeen remeasured to the eur
o at current exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities have been remeasured to the euro using the exchange rate effective forthe period in which the balan
ce arose. As a result of this change of functional currency, the Company recorded a $21.8 million cumulative transla tion adjustmentincluded in other compreh
ensive loss for year ended December 31, 2015 . The Company remeasure
s monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the end of eachperiod. Gains and losses from thes
e remeasurements are recognized in interest and other income (expense). Foreign currency transactions resulted in a loss of$127.9 million 
for the year ended December 31, 2017 and a gain of $22.8 million and a loss of $37.3 million for the years ended Decemb er 31, 2016 and 2015respectively.
Earnings Per Share
In June 2015, the Company's Board of Directors d
eclared a seven -for-one stock split in th e form of a stock dividend that was paid on July 14, 2015 to allshareholders of record as o
f July 2, 2015 ("Stock Split"). Outstanding share and per-share amounts disclosed for all periods provided have been retroactivelyadjusted to reflect the effects 
of the Stock Split. Basic earnings per share is 
computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock during the period. Diluted earnings pershare is computed using the weigh
ted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock and, when dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during theperiod. Potential common sha
res consist of incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options. The computation of earnings per share is asfollows:

hat is related to workers compensation deposits and letter of credit agreements.Fair value is a market
-based measurement that should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset orliability. The hiera
rchy level assigned to each security in the Company’s available-for-sale portfolio and cash equivalents is based on its assessment of thetransparency and reliability 
of the inputs used in the valuation of such instrument at the measurement date. The fair value of available-for-sale securities and cashequivalents included in th
e Level 1 category is based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market. The fair value of available-for-sale securities inc
luded in the Level 2 category is based on observable inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets at the measurement date; quoted prices inmarkets that are not active; or
 other inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These values were obtained from an independent pricing service andwere evaluated using pric
ing models that vary by asset class and may incorporate available trade, bid and other market information and price quotes from well-established independent pr
icing vendors and broker-dealers. The Company’s procedures include controls to ensure that appropriate fair values are recorded, such ascomparing prices obtain
ed from multiple independent sources. See Note 4 to the consolidated fina ncial statements for further information regarding the fair valueof the Company’s senior notes.

101% of the principal plus ac crued interest. The Company may redeem the Notes prior to maturity in whole or in part at an amount equal to the principal amountthereof plus accrued and unp
aid interest and an applicable premium. The Notes include, among other terms and conditions, limitations on the Company's ability tocreate, incur or allow certain
 liens; enter into sale and lease-back transactions; create, assume, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness of certain of theCompany's subsidiaries; and consolid
ate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of the Company's and its subsidiaries assets, to anotherperson. As of 
December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , the Company was in compliance with all related covenants.Revolving Credit Facility
In 
July 2017 , the Company entered into a  $500.0 million  unsecured revolving credi t facility (“Revolving Credit Agreement”), with an uncommittedincremental facility to increase the am
ount of the revolving credit facility by up to an additional  $250.0 million , subject to certain t erms and conditions. Revolvingloans may be borrowed, repaid and 
reborrowed until July 27, 2022, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. The Company may use the proceeds offuture borrowings under the Revolving Cr
edit Agreement for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of  December 31, 2017 , no amounts have been borrowed under the Revolving Credit Agre
ement.The borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agr
eement bear interest, at the Company’s option, of either a floating rate equal to a base rate (the “AlternateBase Rate”) or (ii) a r
ate equal to an adjusted London interbank offered rate (the “Adjusted LIBO Rate”), plus a margin of  0.75% . The Alternate Base Rate is defined as the greates
t of (A) the rate of interest published by the Wall Street Journal, from time to time, as the prime rate, (B) the federal funds rate, plus  0.500%  and (C) the Adjusted LIBO Rate for a one-
month interest period, plus  1.00% . The Adjusted LIBO Rate is defined as the London interbank offered rate fordeposits in U.S. dollars, for the re
levant interest period, adjusted for statutory reserve requirements, but in no event shall the Adjusted LIBO Rate be less than 0.00% 
 per annum. The Company is also obligated to pay 
a commitment fee on the undrawn amounts of the Revolving Credit Agreement at a rate of  0.10% . The Revolving Credit Agreement requir
es the Company to comply with certain covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict the ability of the Company’s subsidiaries toincur debt and limit or 
restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to grant liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and, in the case of theCompany or a guarantor, merge, 
consolidate, liquidate, dissolve or sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of the51

agreements. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time the Company enters into an agreement toobtain future titles. Onc
e a title becomes available, a content liability is generally recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include theobligation to license r
ights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional filmoutput deals, or certain TV se
ries license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of such license agreements. The Companydoes not include any estima

ties under non-cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through 2027 . Several lease agree ments contain rentescalation clauses or 
rent holidays. For purposes of recognizing minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases, the Company usesthe date of initial poss
ession to begin amortization, which is generally when the Company enters the space and begins to make improvements in preparation forintended use. For scheduled rent 
escalation clauses during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy, theCompany records minimum ren
tal expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company hasthe option to extend or renew mos
t of its leases which may increase the future minimum lease commitments.Because the terms of the Comp
any’s facilities lease agreements for its original Los Gatos, California headquarters site required the Company’s involvementin the construction funding of 
the buildings, the Company is the “deemed owner” (for accounting purposes only) of these buildings. Accordingly, the Companyrecorded an asset of 
$40.7 million , representing the tota l costs of the buildings and improvements, including the costs paid by the lessor (the legal owner of thebuildings), with corresponding li
abilities. Upon completion of construction of each building, the Company did not meet the sale-leaseback criteria for de-recognition of the building 
assets and liabilities. Therefore the leases are accounted for as financing obligations. At December 31, 2017 , the lease financing obligation balance was 
$29.5 million , the majority of which is r ecorded in “Other non-current liabilities,” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remainingfuture minimum paymen
ts under the lease financing obligation are $15.6 million . The lease financing oblig ation balance at the end of the lease term will beapproximately 
$21.8 million which approximates the net book v alue of the buildings to be relinquished to the lessor.52

Table of ContentsIn addition to the lease 
financing obligation, future minimum lease payments include $508.3 million as of December 31, 2017 related to non-cancelable operating leases for th
e expanded headquarters in Los Gatos, California and the new office space in Los Angeles, California.Future minimum payments unde

From time to time, in th
e normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims, including claims relating to employeerelations, business pract
ices and patent infringement. Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complexlegal proceedings are d
ifficult to predict and the Company's view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. TheCompany expenses legal fees as 
incurred. The Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and theamount of the loss can be re
asonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company's operationsor its financial posit
ion, liquidity or results of operations.The Company is involved in litiga
tion matters not listed herein but does not consider the matters to be material either individually or in the aggregate at thistime. The Company's view of the ma
tters not listed may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold.6.
Guarantees—Indemnification Obligations In the ordinary course of busin
ess, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements under which it has agreed to provide indemnification of varyingscope and terms to business par
tners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company’s breach ofsuch agreements and o
ut of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In these circumstances, payment may be conditional on the other partymaking a claim pursuant t
o the procedures specified in the particular contract.The Company’s obligations under thes
e agreements may be limited in terms of time or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourseagainst third parties 
for certain payments. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and certain of its officers thatwill require it, among oth
er things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The termsof such obligations vary.
It is not possible to make a 
reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to theconditional nature of th
e Company’s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. No amount has been accrued in theaccompanying financial statement
s with respect to these indemnification guarantees.53

actors in determining the suboptimal exercise factor, including the historical and estimated option exercise behavior.The Company calculates expe
cted volatility based solely on implied volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility of publicly traded options in itscommon stock is more ref
lective of market conditions, and given consistently high trade volumes of the options, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicatorof expected volatili
ty than historical volatility of its common stock.In valuing shares issued under th
e Company’s employee stock option plans, the Company bases the risk-free interest rate on U.S. Treasury zero-couponissues with terms simila
r to the contractual term of the options. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and thereforeuses an expected dividend yie
ld of  zero  in the option valuation mode l. The Company does not use a post-vesting termination rate as options are fully vested upongrant date.

$ (73,608 )  $73,829  $19,244 At the beginning of 2017, the Company underwent 
a corporate restructuring that better aligns its corporate structure with how its business operates. As aresult of this restruc
turing and the Company's increasing international income, there is now significantly more income being taxed at rates lower than the U.S. taxrate.
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (th
e “Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code.Changes include, 
but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax y ears beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition ofU.S international taxation 
from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulativeforeign earnings as of Dece
mber 31, 2017. The Company has calculated its best estimate of the impact of the Act in its year end income tax provision inaccordance with its unders
tanding of the Act and guidance available as of the date of this filing and as a result has recorded $79.1 million as an additional income tax expense in the fourth qua
rter of 2017, the period in which the legislation was enacted. The provisional amount related to the remeasurement of certain deferredtax assets and liabili
ties based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future was $46.9 million . The provisional amount rel ated to the one-timetransition tax on the mand
atory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was $32.2 million based on cumulative fore ign earnings of $484.9 million . On December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulle
tin No. 118 ("SAB 118") was issued to address the application of US GAAP in situations when a registrantdoes not have the 
necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certainincome tax effects o
f the Act. In accordance with SAB 118, the Company has determined that the $46.9 million of the deferred tax exp ense recorded in connectionwith the remeasurement of certai
n deferred tax assets and liabilities and the $32.2 million of current tax expense r ecorded in connection with the transition tax onthe mandatory deemed r
epatriation of foreign earnings was a provisional amount and a reasonable estimate at December 31, 2017. Additional work is necessary todo a more detailed ana
lysis of historical foreign earnings as56

elative adjustments. Any subsequent adjustment to these amounts will be recorded to current tax expense in the quarter of 2018 when theanalysis is complete.
The Company recorded a 
$66.5 million benefit related to foreign taxes expensed in prior years that may now be claimed as a Foreign Tax Credit. TheCompany has determine
d there is sufficient foreign source income projected to utilize these credits.Due to the adoption of ASU 2016-09 in 2017, all excess 
tax benefits and deficiencies are recognized as income tax expense in the Company’s ConsolidatedStatement of Operations. This wi
ll result in increased volatility in the Company’s effective tax rate.A reconciliation of the p
rovision for income taxes, with the amount computed by applying the statutory Federal income tax rate to income before incometaxes is as follows:

and foreign tax returns. The Company is currently under examination by the IRS and the state of California for theyears 2014 and 2015. The 2016 Federal tax r
eturn remains subject to examination by the IRS. The years 2010 through 2013 and 2016 remain subject toexamination by the stat
e of California. The Company has no significant foreign jurisdiction audits underway. The years 2012 through 2016 remain subject toexamination by foreign ju
risdictions.Given the potential outcom
e of the current examinations as well as the impact of the current examinations on the potential expiration of the statute oflimitations, it is r
easonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next twelve months. However, an estimateof the range of reasonably poss

Employee Benefit Plan The Company maintains a 401(k) sav
ings plan covering substantially all of its employees. Eligible employees may contribute up to 60% of their annual salary through payroll deduc
tions, but not more than the statutory limits set by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company matches employee contributions at thediscretion of the Board. During 
2017 , 2016 and 2015 , the Company’s matching contr ibutions totaled $20.2 million , $15.7 million and $11.2 million , respectively.

Segment Information The Company has 
three reportable segments: Dom estic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD. Segment information is presented in thesame manner that the Comp
any’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) reviews the operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. TheCompany’s CODM reviews revenue and contribut
ion58

Table of Contentsprofit (loss) for each o
f the reportable segments. Contribution profit (loss) is defined as revenues less cost of revenues and marketing expenses incurred by thesegment. The Company has aggregat
ed the results of the International operating segments into one reportable segment because these operating segments sharesimilar long-term economic and
 other qualitative characteristics.The Domestic streaming seg
ment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to the members in theUnited States. The Internat
ional streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content tomembers outside of the Unit
ed States. The Domestic DVD segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of DVD-by-mail. Revenues and the rel
ated payment card fees are attributed to the operating segment based on the nature of the underlying membership (streaming or DVD)and the geographic region f
rom which the membership originates. There are no internal revenue transactions between the Company’s segments.Amortization of strea
ming content assets makes up the vast majority of cost of revenues. The Company obtains multi-territory or global rights for itsstreaming content and allocate
s these rights between Domestic and International streaming segments based on estimated fair market value. Amortization of contentassets and other expenses assoc
iated with the acquisition, licensing, and production of streaming content for each streaming segment thus includes both expensesdirectly incurred by th
e segment as well as an allocation of expenses incurred for global or multi-territory rights. Other costs of revenues such as delivery costs areprimarily attribu
ted to the operating segment based on amounts directly incurred by the segment. Marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses andcertain payments mad
e to marketing partners, including CE manufacturers, MVPDs, mobile operators and ISPs, which are generally included in the segment inwhich the expenditures are d
irectly incurred.The Company's long-lived tangible
