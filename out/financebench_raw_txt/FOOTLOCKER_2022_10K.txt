CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”) includes “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do
not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They often include words such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,”
“estimates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “continues,” “feels,” “forecasts,” or words of similar meaning, or future or
conditional verbs, such as “will,” “should,” “could,” “may,” “aims,” “intends,” or “projects.” Statements may be forward
looking even in the absence of these particular words.
Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our financial position,
business strategy, and other plans and objectives for our future operations, and generation of free cash flow. These
forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and
their potential effect on us. The forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report are largely based on our
expectations for the future, which reflect certain estimates and assumptions made by our management. These
estimates and assumptions reflect our best judgment based on currently known market conditions, operating trends,
and other factors. Although we believe such estimates and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently
uncertain and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control. As such, management’s
assumptions about future events may prove to be inaccurate. For a more detailed description of the risks and
uncertainties involved, see “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.”
We do not intend to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future
events, changes in circumstances, or otherwise. These cautionary statements qualify all forward-looking statements
attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf. Management cautions you that the forward-looking statements
contained herein are not guarantees of future performance, and we cannot assure you that such statements will be
realized or that the events and circumstances they describe will occur. Factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements herein include, but are not limited to a
change in the relationship with any of our key suppliers, including the unavailability of premium products at
competitive prices, a change in negotiated volume discounts, cooperative advertising, markdown allowances, or the
ability to cancel orders and return excess or unneeded merchandise; our ability to fund our planned capital
investments; volatility in the financial markets or other global economic factors; difficulties in appropriately allocating
capital and resources among our strategic opportunities; our ability to realize the expected benefits from recent or
future acquisitions; business opportunities and expansion; investments; expenses; dividends; share repurchases;
liquidity; cash flow from operations; use of cash and cash requirements; borrowing capacity and use of proceeds;
repatriation of cash to the United States; supply chain issues, including delays in merchandise receipts and increasing
cost pressure caused by higher oceanic shipping and freight costs; labor shortages; expectations regarding increased
wages; inflation; consumer spending levels; the effect of governmental assistance programs; social unrest; the direct
and indirect effects of all variants of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) on our business, including any adverse
effects of COVID-19 vaccine mandates or other safety protocols; expectations regarding increasing global taxes; the
effect of government regulation, including changes in law; the effect of the adverse outcome of any material litigation
against us or judicial decisions that affect us or our industry generally; the effects of weather; climate change;
increased competition; the financial effect of accounting regulations and critical accounting policies; credit risk relating
to the risk of loss as a result of non-performance by our counterparties; and any other factors set forth in the section
entitled “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report.
All written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by this
cautionary statement. A forward-looking statement is neither a prediction nor a guarantee of future events or
circumstances, and those future events or circumstances may not occur. You should not place undue reliance on
forward-looking statements, which speak to our views only as of the date of this filing. Additional risks and
uncertainties that we do not presently know about or that we currently consider to be insignificant may also affect our
business operations and financial performance. The Company does not undertake to update any particular forward-
looking statement included in this document. See “Risk Factors” included in this Annual Report for discussion of
certain risks relating to our businesses and investment in our securities. We are including this cautionary note to make
applicable, and take advantage of, the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
for forward-looking statements.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
Risks Related to Our Business and Industry
Our inability to implement our long-range strategic plan may adversely affect our future results.
Our ability to successfully implement and execute our long-range strategic plan is dependent on many factors. Our
strategies may require significant capital investment and management attention. Additionally, any new initiative is
subject to certain risks including customer acceptance of our products and renovated store designs, competition,
product differentiation, the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, and our ability to successfully integrate our
acquisitions and implement technological initiatives. If we cannot successfully execute our strategic growth initiatives or
if the long-range plan does not adequately address the challenges or opportunities we face, our financial condition and
results of operations may be adversely affected. Additionally, failure to meet shareholder expectations, particularly with
respect to sales, supplier diversification, cost-cutting programs, operating margins, and earnings per share, would likely
result in volatility in the market value of our stock.
The retail athletic footwear and apparel business is highly competitive.
Our athletic footwear and apparel operations compete primarily with athletic footwear specialty stores, sporting goods
stores, department stores, traditional shoe stores, mass merchandisers, and online retailers, as well as our merchandise
vendor suppliers direct-to-customers channels. Although we sell an increasing proportion of our merchandise online, a
significantly faster shift in customer buying patterns to purchasing athletic footwear, athletic apparel, and sporting goods
online could have a material adverse effect on our business results. In addition, all of our significant suppliers operate
retail stores and distribute products directly through the internet and others may follow. Should this continue to occur or
accelerate, and if our customers decide to purchase directly from our suppliers, it could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
The principal competitive factors in our markets are selection of merchandise, customer experience, reputation, store
location, advertising, and price. We cannot assure that we will continue to be able to compete successfully against
existing or future competitors. Our expansion into markets served by our competitors, and entry of new competitors or
expansion of existing competitors into our markets, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.
A change in the relationship with any of our key suppliers or the unavailability of key products at competitive
prices could affect our financial health.
Our business is dependent to a significant degree upon our ability to obtain premium product and the ability to purchase
brand-name merchandise at competitive prices from a limited number of suppliers. In addition, we have negotiated
volume discounts, cooperative advertising, and markdown allowances with our suppliers, as well as the ability to cancel
orders and return excess or unneeded merchandise. We cannot be certain that such terms with our suppliers will
continue in the future.
We purchased 87% of our merchandise in 2021 from our top five suppliers and we expect to continue to obtain a
significant percentage of our athletic product from these suppliers in future periods. Approximately 68% of all
merchandise purchased in 2021 was purchased from one supplier — Nike, Inc. (“Nike”). Each of our banners are highly
dependent on Nike. Individually, they purchased between 50% and 75% of their merchandise from Nike during the year.
Merchandise that is high profile and in high demand is allocated by our suppliers based upon their own criteria.
Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2022, we do not expect any one supplier to represent more than 55% of
merchandise purchases. We cannot be certain that our suppliers will allocate sufficient amounts to us in the future or
whether our suppliers will choose to further sell such merchandise through their own direct-to-customers channel.
2021 Form 10-K Page 5Our inability to obtain merchandise in a timely manner from major suppliers as a result of business decisions by our
suppliers, or any disruption in the supply chain, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, and results of operations. Because of the high proportion of purchases from Nike, any adverse development
in Nike’s reputation, financial condition or results of operations, or the inability of Nike to develop and manufacture
products that appeal to our target customers could also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and
results of operations. We cannot be certain that we will be able to acquire merchandise at competitive prices or on
competitive terms in the future. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
and results of operations.
The industry in which we operate is dependent upon fashion trends, customer preferences, product
innovations, and other fashion-related factors.
The athletic footwear and apparel industry, especially at the premium end of the price spectrum, in which we operate, is
subject to changing fashion trends and customer preferences. In addition, retailers in the athletic industry rely on their
suppliers to maintain innovation in the products they develop. We cannot guarantee that our merchandise selection will
accurately reflect customer preferences when it is offered for sale or that we will be able to identify and respond quickly
to fashion changes, particularly given the long lead times for ordering much of our merchandise from suppliers. A
substantial portion of our highest margin sales are to young males (ages 12–25), many of whom we believe purchase
athletic footwear and athletic apparel as a fashion statement and are frequent purchasers. Our failure to anticipate,
identify or react appropriately in a timely manner to changes in fashion trends that would make athletic footwear or
athletic apparel less attractive to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.
If we do not successfully manage our inventory levels, our operating results will be adversely affected.
We must maintain sufficient inventory levels to operate our business successfully. However, we also must guard against
accumulating excess inventory. For example, we order most of our athletic footwear four to six months prior to delivery
to us. If we fail to anticipate accurately either the market for the merchandise or our customers’ purchasing habits, we
may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess or slow-moving inventory, which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and is expected to continue to disrupt our business, which could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition for an extended period of
time.
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected our business as the uncertainty, volatility, and disruption of a new public
health crisis emerged in 2020. We experienced disruption to our normal business operations from a number of factors,
including stay at home orders, fully closing our stores, rapidly adopting new health and safety measures, and
uncertainty around regulatory, economic, and market conditions.
We continue to monitor COVID-19, as well as new strains of the virus, and other closures, capacity limitations, social
distancing requirements, and reduced operating hours which may be required to help ensure the health and safety of
our team members and our customers. Businesses and consumers have been adjusting their plans to comply with
renewed and evolving mask and vaccine mandates, symptom and temperature check requirements, travel restrictions,
and delayed office reopenings. We are also continuing to communicate with our suppliers regarding the flow of product.
To the extent one or more of our suppliers is negatively affected by COVID-19, including due to the closure of their
distribution centers or manufacturing facilities, we may be unable to maintain adequate inventory in our stores or
distribution centers. COVID-19 has also caused disruption in transportation, such as shipping port congestion, which
has adversely affected our ability to receive merchandise on a timely basis.
The full extent of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance is uncertain and will depend on
many factors beyond our control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic;
the availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines; the spread of new variants of COVID-19; the continued and
renewed imposition of protective public safety measures such as masks and vaccine mandates; and the continuing
global disruption in supply chains in our industries and the effect of the pandemic on the global economy, inflation, and
demand for consumer products. Even after the pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience material and
adverse effects to our business, operating results, and financial condition as a result of the pandemic’s lasting global
economic effect, including any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future in our industries or continuing
inflationary concerns.
2021 Form 10-K Page 6We are affected by mall traffic and our ability to secure suitable store locations, both in malls and off-malls.
Many of our stores, especially in North America where only 21% of our locations are off-mall, are located primarily in
enclosed regional and neighborhood malls. Our sales are affected, in part, by the volume of mall traffic. Mall traffic may
be adversely affected by, among other factors, economic downturns, the closing or continued decline of anchor
department stores and/or specialty stores, and a decline in the popularity of mall shopping among our target customers.
Further, any terrorist act, natural disaster, public health issue, such as COVID-19, flu or other pandemics, or safety
concern that decreases the level of mall traffic, or that affects our ability to open and operate stores in such locations,
could have a material adverse effect on our business.
To take advantage of customer traffic and the shopping preferences of our customers, we need to maintain or acquire
stores in desirable locations, such as in regional and neighborhood malls, as well as high-traffic urban retail areas and
high streets. We cannot be certain that desirable locations will continue to be available at favorable rates. Some
traditional enclosed malls are experiencing significantly lower levels of customer traffic, driven by economic conditions,
public health issues, the closure of certain mall anchor tenants, and changes in customer shopping preferences, such
as online shopping. Further, some malls have closed, and others may close in the future. While we seek to obtain
suitable locations off-mall, there is no guarantee that we will be able to secure such locations.
Several large landlords dominate the ownership of prime malls and because of our dependence upon these landlords
for a substantial number of our locations, any significant erosion of their financial condition or our relationships with
them could negatively affect our ability to obtain and retain store locations. Additionally, further landlord consolidation
may negatively affect our ability to negotiate favorable lease terms.
Our business could be materially harmed if we fail to adequately integrate the operations of the businesses we
have acquired, or may acquire.
We have recently made, and may continue to make, acquisitions in the future based on available opportunities in the
market. Acquisitions involve numerous inherent challenges, such as properly evaluating acquisition opportunities,
properly evaluating risks and other diligence matters, ensuring adequate capital availability, and balancing other
resource constraints. There are risks and uncertainties related to acquisitions, including difficulties integrating
operations, personnel, and financial and other systems; unrealized sales expectations from the acquired business;
unrealized synergies and cost savings; unknown or underestimated liabilities; diversion of management attention from
running our existing businesses; and potential loss of key management or customers of the acquired business.
During the third quarter of 2021, we acquired Eurostar, Inc., a Delaware corporation, operating as WSS, a U.S.-based
athletic footwear and apparel retailer. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we acquired certain entities collectively
operated as atmos, primarily based in Japan. The acquisitions of WSS and atmos involve a number of risks, which
could significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including failure of
the acquired businesses to achieve the results that we expect; diversion of management’s attention from existing
operational matters; difficulties integrating the operations and personnel; and failure to retain key personnel.
Our future growth may depend on our ability to expand operations in international markets.
Our future growth will depend, in part, on our ability to expand our business in additional international markets. As we
expand into new international markets, we may have only limited experience in operating our business in such markets.
In other instances, we may have to rely on the efforts and abilities of foreign business partners in such markets. In
addition, business practices in these new international markets may be unlike those in the other markets we serve, and
we may face increased exposure to certain risks. Our future growth may be materially adversely affected if we are
unsuccessful in our international expansion efforts. Our inability to expand in international markets could have a material
adverse effect on our business.
We may experience fluctuations in, and cyclicality of, our comparable-store sales results.
Our comparable-store sales have fluctuated significantly in the past, on both an annual and a quarterly basis, and we
expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future. A variety of factors affect our comparable-store sales results,
including, among others, fashion trends, product innovation, promotional events, the highly competitive retail sales
environment, economic conditions, timing of income tax refunds, changes in our merchandise mix, calendar shifts of
holiday periods, declines in foot traffic, supply chain disruptions, and weather conditions. Many of our products
represent discretionary purchases. Accordingly, customer demand for these products could decline in an economic
downturn or if our customers develop other priorities for their discretionary spending. These risks could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
2021 Form 10-K Page 7The effects of natural disasters, terrorism, acts of war, acts of violence, and public health issues may adversely
affect our business.
Natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes may affect store and distribution center
operations. In addition, acts of terrorism, acts of war, and military action both in the United States and abroad can have
a significant effect on economic conditions and may negatively affect our ability to purchase merchandise from suppliers
for sale to our customers. Any act of violence, including active shooter situations and terrorist activities, that are targeted
at or threatened against shopping malls, our stores, offices or distribution centers, could result in restricted access to our
stores and/or store closures in the short-term and, in the long-term, may cause our customers and employees to avoid
visiting our stores. Recently, Russian troops invaded Ukraine. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the retaliatory
measures taken by the U.S., NATO, and other countries have created global security concerns and economic
uncertainty that could have a lasting effect on regional and global economies.
Public health issues, such as COVID-19, flu, or other pandemics, whether occurring in the United States or abroad,
could disrupt our operations and result in a significant part of our workforce being unable to operate or maintain our
infrastructure or perform other tasks necessary to conduct our business. Additionally, public health issues may disrupt,
or have an adverse effect on, our suppliers’ operations, our operations, our customers, or result in significantly lower
traffic to or closure of our stores, or customer demand.
Our ability to mitigate the adverse effect of these events depends, in part, upon the effectiveness of our disaster
preparedness and response planning as well as business continuity planning. However, we cannot be certain that our
plans will be adequate or implemented properly in the event of an actual disaster.
Any significant declines in public safety or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect customer
spending habits could have a material adverse effect on customer purchases of our products. We may be required to
suspend operations in some or all of our locations and incur significant costs to remediate concerns which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Riots, vandalism, and other crimes and acts of violence may affect the markets in which we operate, our
customers, delivery of our products and customer service, and could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, or financial condition.
Our business may be adversely affected by instability, disruption, or destruction, regardless of cause, including riots,
civil insurrection or social unrest, and manmade disasters or crimes. Such events may result in property damage and
loss and may also cause customers to suspend their decisions to shop in our stores, interrupt our supply chain, and
cause restrictions, postponements, and cancellations of events that attract large crowds and public gatherings, such as
store marketing events.
Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may
adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.
Risks Related to Technology, Data Security, and Privacy
We are subject to technology risks including failures, security breaches, and cybersecurity risks that could
harm our business, damage our reputation, and increase our costs in an effort to protect against these risks.
Information technology is a critical part of our business operations. We depend on information systems to process
transactions, make operational decisions, manage inventory, operate our websites, purchase, sell and ship goods on a
timely basis, and maintain cost-efficient operations. There is a risk that we could experience a business interruption,
theft of information, or reputational damage as a result of a cyber-attack, such as an infiltration of a data center or data
leakage of confidential information, either internally or through our third-party providers. In addition, cybersecurity
researchers anticipate an increase in cyberattack activity in connection with the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
We may experience operational problems with our information systems as a result of system failures, system
implementation issues, viruses, malicious hackers, sabotage, or other causes. We invest in security technology to
protect the data stored by us, including our data and business processes, against the risk of data security breaches and
cyber-attacks. Our data security management program includes enforcement of standard data protection policies such
as Payment Card Industry compliance and other regulatory requirements. Additionally, we evaluate our major
technology suppliers and any outsourced services through accepted security assessment measures. We maintain and
routinely test backup systems and disaster recovery, along with external network security penetration testing by an
independent third party as part of our business continuity preparedness.
2021 Form 10-K Page 8While we believe that our security technology and processes follow appropriate practices in the prevention of security
breaches and the mitigation of cybersecurity risks, given the ever-increasing abilities of those intent on breaching
cybersecurity measures and given the necessity of our reliance on the security procedures of third-party vendors, the
total security effort at any point in time may not be completely effective.
Any security breaches and cyber incidents could adversely affect our business. Failure of our systems, either internally
or at our third-party providers, including failures due to cyber-attacks that would prevent the ability of systems to function
as intended, could cause transaction errors, loss of customers and sales, and negative consequences to us, our
employees, and those with whom we do business. A cyberattack on a communications network or power grid could
cause operational disruption resulting in loss of revenues. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss, or
other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information by us could also severely damage our reputation, expose us to
the risks of litigation and liability, increase operating costs associated with remediation, and harm our business. While
we carry insurance that would mitigate the losses, insurance may be insufficient to compensate us fully for potentially
significant losses.
Risks associated with digital operations.
Our digital operations are subject to numerous risks, including risks related to the failure of the computer systems that
operate our websites, mobile sites, and apps and their related support systems, computer viruses, cybersecurity risks,
telecommunications or power failures, denial of service attacks, bot attacks, and similar disruptions. Also, to sustain,
keep current, or grow our digital commerce business we will need to make additional investments. Risks related to
digital commerce include those associated with credit card fraud, the need to keep pace with rapid technological
change, governmental regulation, and legal uncertainties with respect to internet regulatory compliance. If any of these
risks materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Privacy and data security concerns and regulation could result in additional costs and liabilities.
The protection of customer, employee, and Company data is critical. The regulatory environment surrounding
information security and privacy is demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements. In
addition, customers appear increasingly to have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal
information. Any actual or perceived misappropriation or breach involving this data could attract negative media
attention, cause harm to our reputation or result in liability (including but not limited to fines, penalties or lawsuits), any of
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position, and cash flows.
Regulatory scrutiny of privacy, user data protection, use of data and data collection is increasing on a global basis. We
are subject to a number of privacy and similar laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate and these laws
and regulations will likely continue to evolve over time, both through regulatory and legislative action and judicial
decisions.
The European Union (“E.U.”) adopted a comprehensive General Data Privacy Regulation (the “GDPR”), which requires
companies to satisfy requirements regarding the handling of personal and sensitive data, including its use, protection,
and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete data about themselves. Failure to comply with GDPR
requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue.
Data protection legislation and enforcement is also becoming increasingly common in the Asia Pacific region and in the
United States at both the federal and state level. For example, the State of California enacted the California Consumer
Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”), which became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, requires
companies that process information of California residents to make disclosures to consumers about their data collection,
use and sharing practices, allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provides a new
cause of action for data breaches. Additionally, effective starting January 1, 2023, the California Privacy Rights Act (the
“CPRA”) will revise and significantly expand the scope of the CCPA. The CPRA, among other things, also creates a new
California data protection agency authorized to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA, which could result in
increased privacy and information security enforcement. Other U.S. states have considered and/or enacted similar
privacy laws, including Virginia and Colorado, which passed new consumer privacy laws in 2021 that take effect in
2023. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state
consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. The
burdens imposed by the CCPA, CPRA, and other similar laws that may be enacted at the federal and state level may
require us to further modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial expenditures in order to
comply. The laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security are evolving, can be subject to significant change
and may result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement, sanctions, and
private litigation.
2021 Form 10-K Page 9The technology enablement of omni-channel in our business is complex.
We continue to invest in initiatives designed to deliver a high-quality, coordinated shopping experience online, in stores,
and on mobile devices, which requires substantial investment in technology, information systems, and employee
training, as well as significant management time and resources. Our omni-channel retailing efforts include the
integration and implementation of new technology, software, and processes to be able to fulfill orders from any point
within our system of stores and distribution centers, which is extremely complex and may not meet customer
expectations for timely and accurate deliveries. These efforts involve substantial risk, including risk of implementation
delays, cost overruns, technology interruptions, supply and distribution delays, and other issues that can affect the
successful implementation and operation of our omni-channel initiatives. If our omni-channel initiatives are not
successful, or we do not realize the return on our omni-channel investments that we anticipate, our financial
performance and future growth could be materially adversely affected.
Risks Related to our Operations and Supply Chain
Complications in our distribution centers and other factors affecting the distribution of merchandise may affect
our business.
We operate multiple distribution centers worldwide to support our businesses. In addition to the distribution centers that
we operate, we have third-party arrangements to support our operations in the United States, Canada, England,
Australia, New Zealand, and Asia.
If complications arise with any facility or third-party arrangements, or if any facility is severely damaged or destroyed,
our other distribution centers may be unable to support the resulting additional distribution demands. We also may be
affected by disruptions in the global transportation network caused by events including delays caused by the COVID-19
pandemic, port disruption, port strikes, weather conditions, work stoppages, or other labor unrest. These factors may
adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory on a timely basis. We depend upon third-party carriers for shipment of
merchandise. Any interruption in service by these carriers for any reason could cause disruptions in our business, a loss
of sales and profits, and other material adverse effects.
Manufacturer compliance with our social compliance program requirements.
We require our independent manufacturers to comply with our policies and procedures, which cover many areas
including human rights policy, labor, health and safety, and environmental standards. We monitor compliance with our
policies and procedures using internal resources, as well as third-party monitoring firms. Although we monitor their
compliance with these policies and procedures, we do not control the manufacturers or their practices. Any failure of our
independent manufacturers to comply with our policies and procedures or local laws in the country of manufacture could
disrupt the shipment of merchandise to us, force us to locate alternate manufacturing sources, reduce demand for our
merchandise, or damage our reputation.
Our reliance on key management.
Future performance will depend upon our ability to attract, retain, and motivate our executive and senior management
teams. Our executive and senior management teams have substantial experience and expertise in our business and
have made significant contributions to our success. Our future performance depends, to a significant extent, both upon
the continued services of our current executive and senior management teams, as well as our ability to attract, hire,
motivate, and retain additional qualified management in the future. While we believe that we have adequate succession
planning and executive development programs, competition for key executives in the retail industry is intense, and our
operations could be adversely affected if we cannot retain and attract qualified executives.
Risks associated with attracting and retaining store and field team members.
Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to attract, develop, and retain a sufficient number of qualified store and
field team members. The turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high. If we are unable to attract and retain
quality team members, our ability to meet our growth goals or to sustain expected levels of profitability may be
compromised.
During 2021, we experienced unusually low availability of workers, which we believe was primarily attributable to
COVID-19 pandemic related factors and in turn has created increased competition in labor markets. Our ability to meet
our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage
rates, minimum wage legislation, and overtime regulations.
2021 Form 10-K Page 10Risks Related to our Investments
If our long-lived tangible assets and operating lease right-of-use assets, or goodwill become impaired, we may
need to record significant non-cash impairment charges.
We review our long-lived tangible assets, operating lease right-of-use assets, and goodwill when events indicate that the
carrying value of such assets may be impaired. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment if impairment indicators arise and,
at a minimum, annually. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test, which consists of either a
qualitative assessment on a reporting unit level, or a quantitative impairment test, if necessary. The determination of
impairment charges is significantly affected by estimates of future operating cash flows and estimates of fair value. Our
estimates of future operating cash flows are identified from our long-range strategic plans, which are based upon our
experience, knowledge, and expectations; however, these estimates can be affected by factors such as our future
operating results, future store profitability, and future economic conditions, all of which are difficult to predict accurately.
Any significant deterioration in macroeconomic conditions could affect the fair value of our long-lived assets, operating
lease right-of-use assets, and goodwill and could result in future impairment charges, which would adversely affect our
results of operations.
We do not have the ability to exert control over our minority investments, and therefore, we are dependent on
others in order to realize their potential benefits.
At January 29, 2022 we hold $781 million of non-controlling minority investments in various entities and we may make
additional strategic minority investments in the future. Such minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of
control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational, and compliance risks
associated with the investments. Other investors in these entities may have business goals and interests that are not
aligned with ours or may exercise their rights in a manner in which we do not approve. These circumstances could lead
to delayed decisions or disputes and litigation with those other investors, all of which could have a material adverse
impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.
If our investees seek additional financing to fund their growth strategies, these financing transactions may result in
further dilution of our ownership stakes and these transactions may occur at lower valuations than the investment
transactions through which we acquired such interests, which could significantly decrease the fair values of our
investments in those entities. Additionally, if our investees are unable to obtain additional financing, those entities could
need to significantly reduce their spending in order to fund their operations or result in their insolvency. These actions
likely would result in reduced growth forecasts, which also could significantly decrease the fair values of our investments
in those entities.
Risks Related to Shareholder Activism, Geopolitics, Regulations, and Other External Risks
We may face risks associated with shareholder activism.
Publicly traded companies are subject to campaigns by shareholders advocating corporate actions related to matters
such as corporate governance, operational practices, and strategic direction. We may become subject in the future to
such shareholder activity and demands. Such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our business plans, be
costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, and divert the attention of management, any of which could have an
adverse effect on our business or stock price.
Economic or political conditions in other countries, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
and tax rates may adversely affect our operations.
A significant portion of our sales and operating income for 2021 was attributable to our operations outside of the United
States. As a result, our business is subject to the risks associated with doing business outside of the United States such
as local customer product preferences, political unrest, disruptions or delays in shipments, changes in economic
conditions in countries in which we operate, foreign currency fluctuations, real estate costs, and labor and employment
practices in non-U.S. jurisdictions that may differ significantly from those that prevail in the United States. In addition,
because our suppliers manufacture a substantial amount of our products in foreign countries, our ability to obtain
sufficient quantities of merchandise on favorable terms may be affected by governmental regulations, trade restrictions,
labor, and other conditions in the countries from which our suppliers obtain their product.
Fluctuations in the value of the euro and the British Pound may affect the value of our European earnings when
translated into U.S. dollars. Similarly, our earnings in other jurisdictions may be affected by the value of currencies when
translated into U.S. dollars.
2021 Form 10-K Page 11Except for our business in the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”), our international subsidiaries conduct most of their business
in their local currency. Inventory purchases for our U.K. business are generally denominated in euros, which could result
in foreign currency transaction gains or losses.
Our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions.
Fluctuations in tax rates and duties and changes in tax legislation or regulation could have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations and financial condition.
Our stock price may be volatile, and the value of our common stock has declined and may continue to decline.
The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and may fluctuate or decline substantially as a result of a
variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including without limitation:
• a change in the relationship with any of our key suppliers or the unavailability of key products at
competitive prices;
• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition or results of operations;
• variance in our financial performance from expectations of securities analysts and securities analysts may
issue unfavorable research about us;
• changes in our projected operating and financial results;
• announcements by us or our competitors of significant business developments, acquisitions, or new
offerings;
• significant data breaches;
• material litigation;
• future sales of our common stock by us or our shareholders, or the perception that such sales may occur;
• changes in senior management or key personnel;
• the trading volume of our common stock;
• changes in the anticipated future size and growth rate of our market; and
• general macroeconomic, geopolitical, and market conditions beyond our control.
Broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, regulatory, and market conditions, such
as recessions, interest rate changes, or international currency fluctuations, may also negatively affect the market price
of our common stock. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have
been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future, which could
result in substantial expenses and divert our management’s attention.
Macroeconomic developments may adversely affect our business.
Our performance is subject to global economic conditions and the related effects on consumer spending levels.
Continued uncertainty about global economic conditions, including the COVID-19 pandemic, poses a risk as consumers
and businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, unemployment, negative financial news, and/or
declines in income or asset values, which could have a material negative effect on demand for our products. The
invasion of Ukraine by Russia has created global security concerns and economic uncertainty.
As a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending, our results of operations are sensitive to changes
in macroeconomic conditions. Our customers may have less money for discretionary purchases as a result of job
losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies, increased fuel and energy costs, higher interest rates, higher taxes, reduced access
to credit, and lower home values. These and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products,
which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
Significant developments stemming from the U.K.’s withdrawal from the E.U. could have a material adverse
effect on the Company.
The U.K. formally exited the European Union on January 31, 2020 (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) and entered into a
new trade agreement with the European Union on December 24, 2020. Despite the U.K.’s December 2020 trade
agreement, many potential future effects of Brexit remain unclear and could adversely affect certain areas of our
business, including, but not limited to, an increase in duties and delays in the delivery of products, and adverse effects
to our suppliers.
2021 Form 10-K Page 12We have significant operations in both the U.K. and the E.U., and we are highly dependent on the free flow of labor and
goods in those regions. In response to Brexit, in February 2020 we engaged with a third-party logistics provider within
England to mitigate supply chain risks. Uncertainty surrounding Brexit could cause a slowdown in economic activity in
the U.K., Europe or globally, which could adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects. In addition, Brexit
could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U.
laws to replace or replicate, including data protection regulation. Compliance with any new laws and regulations may be
cumbersome, difficult, or costly.
There remains substantial uncertainty surrounding the ultimate effect of Brexit and outcomes could disrupt the markets
we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This uncertainty creates challenges (particularly in the near term)
with respect to trading relationships between our U.K. subsidiary and other E.U. nations. These possible effects of Brexit
could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Imposition of tariffs and export controls on the products we buy may have a material adverse effect on our
business.
A significant portion of the products that we purchase, including the portion purchased from U.S.-based suppliers, as
well as most of our private brand merchandise, is manufactured abroad. We may be affected by potential changes in
international trade agreements or tariffs, such as new tariffs imposed on certain Chinese-made goods imported into the
U.S. Furthermore, China or other countries may institute retaliatory trade measures in response to existing or future
tariffs imposed by the U.S. that could have a negative effect on our business. If any of these events occur as described,
we may be obligated to seek alternative suppliers for our private brand merchandise, raise prices, or make changes to
our operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability, results of operations,
and financial condition.
Increasing inflation could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows.
Inflation, as well as some of the measures taken by or that may be taken by the governments in countries where we
operate in an attempt to curb inflation may have negative effects on the economies of those countries generally. If the
United States or other countries where we operate experience substantial inflation in the future, our business may be
adversely affected. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations,
or cash flows.
Instability in the financial markets may adversely affect our business.
Uncertainty surrounding the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic helped create volatility in financial markets
around the world. In addition, the global macroeconomic environment could be negatively affected by, among other
things, instability in global economic markets, increased U.S. trade tariffs and trade disputes with other countries,
instability in the global credit markets, supply chain weaknesses, instability in the geopolitical environment as a result of
Brexit, the Russian invasion of the Ukraine and other political tensions, and foreign governmental debt concerns. Such
challenges have caused, and may continue to cause, uncertainty and instability in local economies and in global
financial markets.
LIBOR is in the process of being phased out and may be replaced by other benchmark rates; at this time, the future of
LIBOR remains uncertain, and any changes in the methods by which LIBOR is determined or regulatory activity related
to LIBOR’s phase out could cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist. The phase out of
LIBOR could cause market volatility or disruption and may adversely affect our access to the capital markets and cost of
funding. Our 2020 Credit Agreement provides for alternative methods of calculating the interest rate payable on
indebtedness thereunder.
This volatility may affect our future access to the credit and debt security markets, leading to higher borrowing costs, or,
in some cases, the inability to obtain additional financing. Although we currently have a revolving credit agreement in
place until July 14, 2025, tightening of credit markets could make it more difficult for us to access funds, refinance our
existing indebtedness, enter into agreements for new indebtedness, or obtain funding through the issuance of the
Company’s securities.
2021 Form 10-K Page 13Material changes in the market value of the securities we hold may adversely affect our results of operations
and financial condition.
At January 29, 2022 our cash and cash equivalents totaled $804 million. The majority of our investments were short-
term deposits in highly-rated banking institutions. We regularly monitor our counterparty credit risk and mitigate our
exposure by making short-term investments only in highly-rated institutions and by limiting the amount we invest in any
one institution. We continually monitor the creditworthiness of our counterparties. At January 29, 2022, all investments
were in investment grade institutions. Despite an investment grade rating, it is possible that the value or liquidity of our
investments may decline due to any number of factors, including general market conditions and bank-specific credit
issues.
Our U.S. pension plan trust holds assets totaling $631 million at January 29, 2022. The fair values of these assets held
in the trust are compared to the plan’s projected benefit obligation to determine the pension funding liability. We attempt
to mitigate funding risk through asset diversification, and we regularly monitor investment risk of our portfolio through
quarterly investment portfolio reviews and periodic asset and liability studies. Despite these measures, it is possible that
the value of our portfolio may decline in the future due to any number of factors, including general market conditions and
credit issues. Such declines could affect the funded status of our pension plan and future funding requirements.
Our financial results may be adversely affected by tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities.
We are a U.S. based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our provision for
income taxes is based on a jurisdictional mix of earnings, statutory rates, and enacted tax rules, including transfer
pricing. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in evaluating our tax positions
on a worldwide basis. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including shifts in the
mix of pretax results by tax jurisdiction, changes in tax laws or related interpretations in the jurisdictions in which we
operate, and tax assessments and related interest and penalties resulting from income tax audits.
Changes in employment laws or regulation could harm our performance.
Various foreign and domestic labor laws govern our relationship with our employees and affect our operating costs.
These laws include minimum wage requirements, overtime and sick pay, paid time off, work scheduling, healthcare
reform and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, unemployment
tax rates, workers’ compensation rates, European works council requirements, and union organization.
A number of factors could adversely affect our operating results, including additional government-imposed increases in
minimum wages, overtime and sick pay, paid leaves of absence, mandated health benefits, and changing regulations
from the National Labor Relations Board or other agencies. Complying with any new legislation or reversing changes
implemented under existing law could be time-intensive and expensive and may affect our business.
Legislative or regulatory initiatives related to climate change concerns may negatively affect our business.
Greenhouse gases may have an adverse effect on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and
severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Global climate change could result in certain types of natural
disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events could make it difficult or impossible for us
to deliver products to our customers, create delays, and inefficiencies in our supply chain. Following an interruption to
our business, we could require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and
lose significant sales. Concern over climate change may result in new or additional legal, legislative, and regulatory
requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment, which could result in future tax,
transportation, and utility increases, which could adversely affect our business. There is also increased focus, including
by investors, customers, and other stakeholders, on these and other sustainability matters, such as worker safety, the
use of plastic, energy consumption, and waste.
We face reputational, regulatory, human capital, and business development risks from a perceived or actual
failure to effectively manage our material ESG risks and opportunities.
Our reputation could be damaged if we do not, or are perceived to not, act responsibly with respect to ESG matters,
which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Our global ESG
program is focused on the following four pillars through which we believe we may significantly impact our stakeholders,
or which may pose a material risk or opportunity for our business: (1) Leveraging the Power of Our People and
Communities, (2) Strengthening the Sustainability of Our Supply Chain, (3) Managing and Reducing Our Environmental
Impacts, and (4) Operating Ethically and Transparently.
2021 Form 10-K Page 14These focus areas could prove to be the wrong focus areas, or not the most material focus areas, for our business.
In light of increasing regulatory, customer, team member, investor, and societal scrutiny of businesses’ management of
material ESG issues, we may face a number of related risks, including making insufficient progress on or failing to
identify all material ESG issues, resulting in potentially significant negative impacts on our stakeholders and related
reputational harm; being perceived as having a superficial commitment to ESG without meaningfully addressing
stakeholder impacts, risks, and opportunities, thereby potentially reducing important stakeholders’ willingness to be
associated with, do business with, or be employed by us; an inability to control or avoid stakeholders politicizing our
ESG positions, causing potential reputational harm among segments of our important stakeholders; or failing to comply
with rapidly developing regulation on ESG in various jurisdictions, which may compromise our credibility, cause
reputational harm, or lead to legal proceedings against us.
Increasing attention to ESG matters may also cause certain institutional investors to be discouraged from investing in
us. Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, and other influential investors are also
increasingly focused on ESG practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the implications and
social cost of their investments. Regardless of the industry, investors’ increased focus and activism related to ESG and
similar matters may hinder access to capital, as investors may decide to reallocate capital or to not commit capital as a
result of their assessment of a company’s ESG practices. Companies which do not adapt to or comply with investor or
stakeholder expectations and standards, which are evolving, or which are perceived to have not responded
appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, may
suffer from reputational damage and the business, financial condition, and/or stock price of such a company could be
materially and adversely affected. In addition, the importance of ESG scoring evaluations is becoming more broadly
accepted by shareholders. Certain organizations have developed scores and ratings to evaluate companies based upon
certain ESG metrics. Many shareholders focus on positive ESG business practices and scores when making
investments and may consider a company’s score as a reputational or other factor in making an investment decision.
In addition, certain investors, particularly institutional investors, use these scores to benchmark companies against their
peers and if a company is perceived as lagging, these investors may engage with companies to require improved ESG
disclosure or performance. We may face reputational damage in the event our ESG procedures or standards do not
meet the standards set by various constituencies. A low score could result in a negative perception of us, or exclusion of
our common stock from consideration by certain investors. In addition, the cost of compliance to receive high ESG
scores may be considerable.
We may be adversely affected by regulatory and litigation developments.
We are exposed to the risk that federal or state legislation may negatively affect our operations. Changes in federal or
state wage requirements, employee rights, health care, social welfare or entitlement programs, including health
insurance, paid leave programs, or other changes in workplace regulation could increase our cost of doing business or
otherwise adversely affect our operations. Additionally, we are regularly involved in litigation, including commercial, tort,
intellectual property, customer, employment, wage and hour, data privacy, anti-corruption, and other claims, including
purported class action lawsuits. The cost of defending against these types of claims against us or the ultimate resolution
of such claims, whether by settlement, mediation, arbitration, or adverse court or agency decision, may harm our
business.
We operate in many different jurisdictions and we could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws.
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery
Act of 2010, which is broader in scope than the FCPA, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from
making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our internal
policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. Despite our training and compliance programs, we cannot
be assured that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts
committed by our employees or agents. Our continued expansion outside the United States, including in developing
countries, could increase the risk of FCPA violations in the future. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such
violations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
2021 Form 10-K Page 15Failure to fully comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could negatively affect our business,
market confidence in our reported financial information, and the price of our common stock.
We continue to document, test, and monitor our internal control over financial reporting in order to satisfy the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. During 2021, we closed on the acquisitions of WSS
and atmos and we excluded both of these businesses from the scope of management’s report on internal control over
financial reporting and will include them in scope, if necessary, for the year ending January 28, 2023. This process may
result in additions or changes to our internal control over financial reporting. However, we cannot be assured that our
disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting will prove to be completely adequate
in the future. Failure to fully comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could negatively affect our
business, market confidence in our reported financial information, and the price of our common stock.
International intellectual property protection can be uncertain and costly.
Uncertainty in intellectual property protection can result from conducting business outside the United States, particularly
in jurisdictions that do not have comparable levels of protection for our assets such as intellectual property, copyrights,
and trademarks. Continuing to operate in such foreign jurisdictions where the ability to enforce intellectual property
rights is limited increases our exposure to risk.
Risks Related to our Indebtedness and our Credit Facility
Our recent debt offering may cause an adverse effect on our business.
During the third quarter of 2021, we completed the sale of $400 million of 4% Senior Notes due 2029. Our inability to
generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our debt obligations could adversely affect
our business, financial condition, results of operations, capital expenditures, and other corporate requirements, requiring
us to direct a substantial portion of our future cash flow toward payments on our indebtedness, which would reduce the
amount of cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate requirements, limiting
our ability to respond to business opportunities and subjecting us to financial and other restrictive covenants, the failure
of which to satisfy could result in a default of our indebtedness.
We may be unable to draw on our credit facility in the future.
Borrowings and letters of credit under our credit facility are not permitted to exceed a borrowing base, which is tied to
our level of inventory. Therefore, reductions in the value of our inventory would result in a reduction in our borrowing
base, which would reduce the amount of financial resources available to meet our operating requirements. Also, if we
do not comply with our financial covenants and we do not obtain a waiver or amendment from our lenders, the lenders
may elect to cause any amounts then owed to become immediately due and payable or may decline to renew our credit
facility. In that event, we would seek to establish a replacement credit facility with one or more other lenders, including
lenders with which we have an existing relationship, potentially on less desirable terms. There can be no guarantee that
replacement financing would be available at commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments
None
Item 2. Properties
Our properties consist of land, leased stores, administrative facilities, and distribution centers. Gross square footage and
total selling area for our store locations at the end of 2021 were approximately 13.28 and 7.91 million square feet,
respectively. These properties, which are primarily leased, are located in the United States and its territories, Canada,
various European countries, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand.
We currently operate six distribution centers, of which two are owned and four are leased, occupying an aggregate of
3.2 million square feet. Four of these distribution centers are located in the United States, one in Canada, and one in the
Netherlands. We also own a manufacturing facility and operate a leased warehouse in the United States, which support
our Team Edition apparel business.
We believe that all leases of properties that are material to our operations may be renewed, or that alternative properties
are available, on terms similar to existing leases. Currently, WSS operates one leased distribution center and in 2022
we expect to open a second distribution center in Texas to support the planned sales growth for that business. Also, we
expect to open for operations our new distribution center in Nevada in the back half of 2022.

Business Overview
Foot Locker, Inc. leads the celebration of sneaker and youth culture around the globe through a portfolio of brands
including Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Champs Sports, Eastbay, atmos, WSS, Footaction, and
Sidestep. As of January 29, 2022, we operated 2,858 primarily mall-based stores, as well as stores in high-traffic urban
retail areas and high streets, in 28 countries across the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and
Asia, as well as websites and mobile apps. Our purpose is to inspire and empower youth culture around the world, by
fueling a shared passion for self-expression and creating unrivaled experiences at the heart of the global sneaker
community.
Foot Locker, Inc. uses its omni-channel capabilities to bridge the digital world and physical stores, including order-in-
store, buy online and pickup-in-store, and buy online and ship-from-store, as well as e-commerce. We operate websites
and mobile apps aligned with the brand names of our store banners including footlocker.com, kidsfootlocker.com,
champssports.com, atmosusa.com, shopwss.com and related e-commerce sites in the various international countries
that we operate. These sites offer some of the largest online product selections and provide a seamless link between e-
commerce and physical stores. We also operate the websites for eastbay.com and eastbayteamsales.com.
Segment Reporting
Our operating segments are identified according to how our business activities are managed and evaluated by our chief
operating decision maker, our CEO. We have three operating segments, North America, Europe, Middle East, and
Africa (“EMEA”), and Asia Pacific. Our North America operating segment includes the results of the following banners
operating in the U.S. and Canada: Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker, Champs Sports, WSS, and
Footaction, including each of their related e-commerce businesses, as well as our Eastbay business that includes
internet, catalog, and team sales. Our EMEA operating segment includes the results of the following banners operating
in Europe: Foot Locker, Sidestep, and Kids Foot Locker, including each of their related e-commerce businesses. Our
Asia Pacific operating segment includes the results of Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker operating in Australia, New
Zealand, and Asia as well as the related e-commerce businesses. The Asia Pacific operating segment also includes the
operations of our newly acquired atmos business operating primarily in Japan. We have further aggregated these
operating segments into one reportable segment based upon their shared customer base and similar economic
characteristics.
COVID-19 Update
COVID-19 had a significant effect on overall economic conditions in the various geographic areas in which we have
operations. We have made best efforts to comply with all precautionary measures as directed by health authorities and
local, state, and national governments. The following represents a summary of the percentage of time that our stores
were open, although there were significant regional variances by quarter and other restrictions that reduced operating
hours as well:
Period 2021 2020
First Quarter 76% 48%
Second Quarter 90% 70%
Third Quarter 94% 93%
Fourth Quarter 97% 87%
Full Year 89% 75%
We continue to monitor the outbreak of COVID-19 and other closures, or closures for a longer period of time, reduced
operating hours, capacity limitations, and social distancing may be required to help ensure the health and safety of our
team members and our customers. COVID-19 has and may continue to have an effect on ports and trade, as well as
global travel.
2021 Form 10-K Page 21Given the dynamic nature of these circumstances, the duration of business disruption, and reduced customer traffic, the
related financial affect cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but may materially affect our business for the
foreseeable future.
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures
In addition to reporting our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we
report certain financial results that differ from what is reported under GAAP. In the following tables, we have presented
certain financial measures and ratios identified as non-GAAP such as Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (“EBIT”),
adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBIT margin, adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted net income, adjusted net income
margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, Return on Invested Capital (“ROIC”), and free cash flow.
We present these non-GAAP measures because we believe they assist investors in comparing our performance across
reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that are not indicative of our core business or which affect
comparability. These non-GAAP measures are also useful in assessing our progress in achieving our long-term financial
objectives.
Additionally, we present certain amounts as excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, which are also
considered non-GAAP measures. Throughout the following discussions, where amounts are expressed as excluding the
effects of foreign currency fluctuations, such changes are determined by translating all amounts in both years using the
prior-year average foreign exchange rates. Presenting amounts on a constant currency basis is useful to investors
because it enables them to better understand the changes in our businesses that are not related to currency
movements.
We estimate the tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments by applying a marginal rate to each of the respective items.

Notes on Non-GAAP Adjustments:
(1) For 2021, 2020, and 2019, we recorded impairment and other charges of $172 million ($130 million after tax), $117  million ($93 million after tax),
and $65 million ($49 million after tax), respectively . See the Impairment and Other Charges  section for further information.
(2) During 2021 and 2020, we recorded non-cash gains of $290 million ($214 million after tax) and $190 million, ($140 million after-tax), respectively ,
related to our minority inves tment in GOA T. Our investment in GOA T is measured using the fair value measurement alternative and received
additional funding at higher valuations than our initial investment.  Also, in 2021, we made a minority investment in a public entity , Retailors Ltd.
This investment was at a discount of $9 million ($7 million after tax) to the initial public of fering price. Due to the infrequent and nonrecurring nature
of the gains related to GOA T and discount on the initial public offering of our Retailors Ltd investment, the income was removed to arrive at non-
GAAP earnings. This caption  also included $7 million ($5 million after tax) related to the finalization of the insurance claim associated with the prior
year social unrest. In 2019, Other income, net represented a gain recorded in connection with acquisition of a Canadian distribution center lease
and related assets. The tax expense related to this transa ction was largely offset by the release of a valuation allowance. See the Other Income,
net section for further information.
(3) We recorded tax charges related to the revaluation of certain intellectual property rights, pursuant to a non-U.S. advance pricing agreement of $11
million and $25 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively . 
(4) We recognized tax benefits of $1 million, $5 million, and $2 million during the fourth quarters of 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively , in connection
with tax law changes in the Netherlands.
(5) On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation that included a broad range of busines s tax provisions. In 2017, we
recognized a $99 million provisional charge for the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign sourced net earnings and a corresponding change in
our permanent reinvestment assertion under ASC 740-30. During 2018, we reduced the provisional amounts by $28 million. This adjustment
represented a $21 million reduction in the deemed repatriation tax and a $7 million benefit related to IRS accounting method changes and timing
difference adjustments. In 2019, we recorded a charge for $2 million, which reflected an adjustment to U.S. tax on foreign income. We exclude the
discrete U.S. tax reform ef fect from our Adjusted diluted EPS as it does not reflect our ongoing tax obligations under U.S. tax reform.
(6) Valuation allowances were established against deferred tax assets associated with certain foreign tax losses.
Return on Invested Capital
ROIC is presented below and represents a non-GAAP measure. We believe ROIC is a meaningful measure because it
quantifies how efficiently we generated operating income relative to the capital we have invested in the business. ROIC,
subject to certain adjustments, is also used as a measure in executive long-term incentive compensation.
The closest U.S. GAAP measure to ROIC is Return on Assets (“ROA”) and is also presented below. ROA is calculated
as net income attributable to Foot Locker, Inc. in the fiscal year divided by the two-year average of total assets. ROA
increased to 11.8% as compared with 4.7% in the prior year. This increase reflected higher profit in 2021, partially offset
by higher average total assets.
2021 Form 10-K Page 23Our ROIC increased to 17.4% in 2021, as compared with 8.6% in the prior year. The overall increase in ROIC reflected
an increase in adjusted return after taxes as the prior year was negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

2021 Form 10-K Page 24Highlights of our 2021 financial performance include:
●We delivered the highest sales in Foot Locker’s history as an athletic retailer, despite COVID-19’s continued
effect on overall economic conditions in the various geographic areas in which we have operations. In
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, stores across all of our brands in North America, EMEA, and Asia Pacific
were temporarily closed for various periods during the year. As a result, our stores were open for approximately
89% of operating days in 2021, as compared with 75% in 2020.
●Apparel and accessory sales penetration increased to 20% as compared with 16% last year, our footwear
sales represented 80% of sales, down from last year’s penetration as we had increased success with branded
and private-label apparel offerings.
●Our stores channel sales rebounded well from the extensive store closures in 2020 as customer traffic returned
to shopping centers and malls.
●Sales per square foot increased to $540, increasing from $510 per square foot in 2019.
●Our direct-to-customers sales channel decreased to 21.5% of total sales in 2021 as shoppers began returning
to our stores. Despite the decrease, this penetration exceeded the 16.1% in 2019. Our ongoing investments in
our omnichannel ecosystem, including consumer experience and supply chain capabilities, have been
instrumental in delivering a seamless customer experience.
●As noted in the table below, sales and comparable sales both increased in 2021. Our stores generated
significant increases, which more than offset the reduction in the direct-to-customers channel.
    2021     2020     2019  
Sales increase/(decrease)   18.7%   (5.7)%   0.8%
Comparable-store sales increase/(decrease)   15.4%   (5.9)%   2.2%
●Gross margin, as a percentage of sales, increased to 34.4% as a result of decreased promotions, in part due to
increased demand and relatively short supply of certain merchandise.  
●SG&A expenses were 20.7% of sales, a decrease of 30 basis points as compared with the prior year. The
decrease reflected higher sales in the current year, partially offset by the effect of prior-year COVID-19 payroll
subsidies from local governments and higher incentive compensation.
●Net income attributable to Foot Locker, Inc. was $893 million, or $8.61 diluted earnings per share, both of
which were record highs in the Company’s history as an athletic retailer. The $570 million increase from the
prior-year period reflected higher sales and gross margin which outpaced increases in expenses, as well as an
increase in other income primarily from fair value adjustments to our minority investments. Adjusted net income
was $807 million, or $7.77 diluted earnings per share, as compared with adjusted net income of $296 million,
or $2.81 diluted earnings per share, in the prior year.
Highlights of our financial position for the year ended January 29, 2022 include:
●Our financial performance allowed us to use capital to strengthen our business through the strategic
acquisitions of WSS and atmos.
●We ended the year in a strong financial position. At year end, we had $347 million of cash and cash
equivalents, net of debt. Cash and cash equivalents at January 29, 2022 were $804 million. Our ending cash
balance declined, in part, due to the $1,056 million paid for the WSS and atmos acquisitions.
●Net cash provided by operating activities was $666 million as compared with $1,062 million last year.
●During the year we amended our $600 million asset-based revolving credit facility to reduce the interest rate
and commitment fees. No amounts were outstanding at January 29, 2022.
●In 2021, we completed the sale of $400 million of 4% Senior Notes due 2029 for net proceeds of $395 million
and repaid the remaining $98 million of our 8.5% debentures.
●Cash capital expenditures during 2021 totaled $209 million and were primarily directed to the remodeling or
relocation of 182 stores, the build-out of 57 new stores, and conversion of 63 Footaction stores to other
banners, as well as other technology and infrastructure projects.
●During 2021, we returned $449 million of cash to our shareholders. Dividends totaling $101 million were
declared and paid during 2021, and 7,545,544 shares were repurchased under our share repurchase program
at a cost of $348 million. In February 2022, our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase to $0.40 per
share payable on April 29, 2022, and authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $1.2 billion. These
initiatives demonstrate our commitment to delivering meaningful returns to our shareholders.
2021 Form 10-K Page 25Sales
All references to comparable-store sales for a given period relate to sales of stores that were open at the period-end
and had been open for more than one year. The computation of consolidated comparable sales also includes direct-to-
customers sales. Stores opened or closed during the period are not included in the comparable-store base; however,
stores closed temporarily for relocation or remodeling are included. Stores that were temporarily closed due to the
COVID-19 pandemic are also included in the computation of comparable-store sales. Computations exclude the effect
of foreign currency fluctuations.
Sales from acquired businesses that include inventory are included in the computation of comparable-store sales after
15 months of operations. Accordingly, sales of WSS and atmos have been excluded from the computation of
comparable-store sales.
The information shown below represents certain sales metrics by sales channel:

% of total sales  21.5%  27.8%  16.1%
Comparable sales (decrease)/increase  (10.6)%  62.8%  5.6%
In 2021, sales increased by 18.7% to $8,958 million from sales of $7,548 million in 2020. Excluding the effect of foreign
currency fluctuations, sales increased by 17.8% as compared with 2020. Sales from our newly acquired WSS and
atmos banners totaled $244 million for 2021 since their respective acquisition dates.
The comparisons to 2020 were significantly affected by the closures necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, as most
of the stores were closed during the first quarter of 2020 when our stores were only open for 48% of the total available
operating days. While our operating days improved overall, there remained geographic differences throughout 2021.
Our stores in Canada and Europe were heavily affected in the first quarter and into the second quarter, while Asia
Pacific experienced significant closures during the third quarter. During 2021, EMEA and Asia Pacific stores operated
76% of the available days, whereas North America operated 95% of the available days.
While sales increased significantly compared with 2020, we also exceeded 2019 sales. Excluding the effect of foreign
exchange rate fluctuations, sales increased by 10.3%, as compared with 2019 and excluding the sales from acquired
businesses, sales increased 7.3% as compared with 2019.
Comparable sales increased by 15.4% as compared with the prior year, by operating segment the increases were
13.7%, 21.7%, and 21.3% for North America, EMEA, and Asia Pacific, respectively. Our stores channel generated
significant increases for both the quarter and year-to-date periods, which was a result of the temporary closure of our
stores across all of our banners around the world during the first half of 2020, partially offset by a decline in our direct-to-
customer channel as shopping navigated back to physical locations. While our digital penetration declined as compared
with 2020, our penetration is higher than our historical levels. We continue to leverage our technology platforms to
improve the digital experience for our customers. Our significant improvement also reflected increased consumer
demand for exciting and new product offerings and the effect of government stimulus.
For the combined channels, sales excluding foreign currency fluctuations increased in all operating segments. North
America increased by 15.8%, EMEA increased by 19.9%, and Asia Pacific increased by 51.9%, as compared with 2020.
Our North American operating segment’s sales, while strong, were negatively affected by our decision to wind down our
Footaction banner in 2021. Sales growth in North America was led by Foot Locker, Champs Sports, and Kids Foot
Locker. WSS contributed sales of $195 million. Within EMEA, sales for the Foot Locker banner increased, partially offset
by a decline due to the Runners Point shutdown. Sidestep’s sales increased slightly as pressure from the COVID-19
closures was less significant and aided by growth in e-commerce sales.
2021 Form 10-K Page 26Asia Pacific generated a significant increase in 2021 from strong performance in both Australia and New Zealand,
coupled with growth in Asia, based on expansion in that region including the acquisition of atmos during the fourth
quarter. Our e-commerce growth in this region was significant, partially as a result of atmos’ business which has a high
digital penetration.
From a product perspective for the combined channels, the sales increase in 2021 was across all families of business -
footwear, apparel, and accessories. Footwear sales benefited from increases in sales across all wearer segments, led
by kids and women’s shoes. Similarly, apparel sales increased across the board, with men’s and kids’ apparel sales
driving the most significant gains. The continued athleisure and fitness trend, coupled with exciting product offerings,
drove the significant increase in apparel sales as compared with last year.

Components of the change:    
Merchandise margin rate improvement/(decline)   450  (340) 
Lower occupancy and buyers’ compensation expense
rate   100  50 
Gross margin is calculated as sales minus cost of sales. Cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise, freight,
distribution costs including related depreciation expense, shipping and handling, occupancy and buyers’ compensation.
Occupancy costs include rent (including fixed common area maintenance charges and other fixed non-lease
components), real estate taxes, general maintenance, and utilities.
The gross margin rate increased in 2021 by 550 basis points as compared to the prior year, reflecting a higher
merchandise margin rate since we were significantly less promotional than a year ago, due to increased demand and
relatively short supply of certain merchandise.
The occupancy rates in 2021 and 2020 were affected by COVID-19 related rent abatements. Upon agreement with our
landlord partners, we secured $16 million of rent savings due to rent abatements in 2021, as compared with $67 million
in the prior year. We record rent abatements in occupancy expense when the negotiations are completed and the leases
are modified. Excluding the rent savings, occupancy and buyers’ compensation expense rate would have been lower in
the current year due to the strong sales.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A)
($ in millions) 2021     2020     2019

% Change   16.6%    (3.8)%   
SG&A as a percentage of sales   20.7%    21.0%    20.6%
SG&A increased by $264 million, or 16.6%, in 2021, as compared with the prior year. As a percentage of sales, the
SG&A rate decreased by 30 basis points as compared with 2020. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations,
SG&A increased by $247 million, or 15.6%, as compared with the prior year. WSS, which was acquired in mid-
September 2021, and atmos, acquired at the beginning of the fourth quarter, contributed $54 million to SG&A.
SG&A, as a percentage of sales, was affected by the higher sales in the current year and the effect of prior-year
COVID-19 related matters. SG&A in 2021 and 2020 included payroll subsidies from local governments of $16 million
and $71 million, respectively. The higher prior year amounts related to the fact that we continued to pay our employees
throughout most of the first quarter of 2020 despite the temporary store closures. In 2021, personal protective
equipment expense decreased by $8 million, as compared with the prior year.
Incentive compensation expense increased by $14 million in 2021, as compared with the prior year, as we outperformed
the targeted results in 2021.
Excluding the above-mentioned items and the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, SG&A increased primarily
representing variable expenses associated with higher sales.
2021 Form 10-K Page 27Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization $  197 $  176 $  179
$ Change $  21 $  (3)
% Change   11.9%    (1.7)%   
Depreciation and amortization increased by $21 million and excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations,
depreciation and amortization increased by $20 million as compared with the prior year. The increase was related to the
additions of WSS and atmos which contributed $11 million, as well as acceleration of depreciation and amortization
associated with the Footaction closures.
Operating Results
Division profit was $1,161 million, or 13.0% of sales in 2021. This compares with $491 million, or 6.5% of sales, for the
prior year. The significant increase in sales, due primarily to store closures in the prior year, resulted in expense
leverage and coupled with gross margin improvement generated a meaningful increase in our results. The division profit
results from our recent acquisitions were accretive but not significant to the overall results.
Impairment and Other Charges
During the second quarter of 2021, we conducted an impairment review of Footaction stores as a result of our decision
to convert part of the stores to other existing banner concepts and close the remaining stores. We evaluated the long-
lived assets, including the right-of-use assets and recorded non-cash charges to write down store fixtures, leasehold
improvements, and right-of-use assets for approximately 60 locations, and accelerated tenancy charges for leases we
expect to terminate prior to the end of the lease term. In connection with this, we recorded charges totaling $66 million.
During the fourth quarter of 2021, we conducted an impairment review for approximately 100 underperforming stores.
We evaluated the long-lived assets, including the right-of-use assets and recorded non-cash charges of $26 million to
write down store fixtures, leasehold improvements, and right-of-use assets for approximately 55 of these stores.
During 2021, we recorded non-cash charges of $42 million related to the write-down of certain minority investments
representing full write downs on three of the Company’s minority investments due to the investee’s continued losses
and updated estimate of value.
In connection with the acquisitions, we recorded acquisition and integration costs of $24 million, which primarily
represented investment banking and integration consulting fees related to the WSS and atmos acquisitions.
In 2021, we recorded $15 million of lease termination costs related to the closure of certain stores. We also recorded $4
million of reorganization expense related to Footaction and certain support functions, as well as $2 million of intangible
asset impairment on the Footaction tradename.
Losses related to social unrest represented inventory losses, damages to store property, repairs, and other costs
incurred in connection with the riots that affected certain parts of the United States and Canada during the second
quarter of 2020. In addition to the $10 million of insurance settlement income we recorded in 2020, in 2021, we reached
a final insurance settlement for an additional $13 million, of which $7 million is classified in impairment and other
charges, as it relates to the book value of property losses recorded in 2020.
See Note 4, Impairment and Other Charges for additional information.
Corporate Expense

Corporate expense $  129 $  71 $  74
$ Change $  58 $  (3) 
Corporate expense consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses as well as depreciation and
amortization related to our corporate headquarters, centrally managed departments, unallocated insurance and benefit
programs, certain foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, and other items. Depreciation and amortization
included in corporate expense was $34 million, $24 million, and $19 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
2021 Form 10-K Page 28The allocation of corporate expense to the operating divisions is adjusted annually based upon an internal study;
accordingly, the allocation increased by $19 million in 2021, thus reducing corporate expense. Excluding the corporate
allocation change, corporate expense increased by $77 million as compared with 2020. The increase was primarily due
to higher information technology and support expenses coupled with higher incentive compensation expense.

We recorded net interest expense of $14 million in 2021 as compared with $7 million in 2020. Interest income
decreased as a result of lower average interest rates and a reduction in our cash and cash equivalents. Additionally,
interest expense increased due to the issuance of the 4% Senior Notes due 2029 coupled with the interest associated
with the WSS finance lease obligations.

One of our minority investments, GOAT, which is measured using the fair value alternative, received funding at higher
valuations in both 2021 and 2020 resulting in non-cash gains of $290 million and $190 million, respectively. As of
January 29, 2022, the fair value of our investment in GOAT totaled $613 million.
During 2021, we invested $68 million to take a common stock minority stake in a public entity, Retailors, Ltd., which is
traded on the Tel Aviv stock exchange. This investment was at a discount of $9 million to the initial public offering price,
resulting in a non-cash gain of $9 million. Changes in fair value represented on our Retailors, Ltd. investment also
generated non-cash gains of $68 million during the year.
Other income, net also included $10 million in royalty income, $7 million of net benefit income related to our pension
and postretirement programs, $7 million of insurance recoveries in excess of the losses sustained in the prior year
related to the social unrest, and $3 million of income related to our equity method investments.

Provision for income taxes $  348 $  171 $  181
Effective tax rate   28.1%    34.5%  27.0%
Our effective tax rate for 2021 was 28.1%, as compared with 34.5% in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to
significantly higher pretax income earned in the United States reducing the effect of nondeductible expenses on the
effective tax rate. We recorded a $11 million tax charge in 2021 related to the revaluation of certain intellectual property
rights pursuant to a non-U.S. advance pricing agreement. During 2020, a $25 million tax charge was recognized in
connection with the revaluation. Additionally, during the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2020, we recorded tax benefits of $1
million and $5 million, respectively, in connection with tax law changes in the Netherlands.
We regularly assess the adequacy of provisions for income tax contingencies in accordance with the applicable
authoritative guidance on accounting for income taxes. As a result, reserves for unrecognized tax benefits may be
adjusted due to new facts and developments, such as changes to interpretations of relevant tax law, assessments from
taxing authorities, settlements with taxing authorities, and lapses of statutes of limitations. The changes in the tax
reserves were not significant in 2021 and 2020.
2021 Form 10-K Page 29Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
Our primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operations, while the principal uses of cash have been to fund
inventory and other working capital requirements; finance capital expenditures related to store openings, store
remodelings, internet and mobile sites, information systems, and other support facilities; quarterly dividend payments;
and interest payments; and fund other cash requirements to support the development of our short-term and long-term
operating strategies.
We generally finance real estate with operating leases. We believe our cash, cash equivalents, future cash flow from
operations, and amounts available under our credit agreement will be adequate to fund these requirements.
We may also repurchase our common stock through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or
otherwise. Such repurchases if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual
restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. On February 24, 2022, the Board of Directors
approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $1.2 billion of its common
stock replacing the prior authorization. The new share repurchase program does not have an expiration date.
On February 24, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share to be paid on
April 29, 2022. This dividend represents a 33% increase from the previous quarterly per share amount of $0.30 per
share and represents a return to the rate in effect prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.
On October 5, 2021, Foot Locker, Inc. completed the sale of $400 million 4% Senior Notes due 2029. We received net
proceeds from the offering of $395 million, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount. The proceeds will be used for
general corporate purposes.
Any material adverse change in customer demand, fashion trends, competitive market forces, or customer acceptance
of our merchandise mix and retail locations, uncertainties related to the effect of competitive products and pricing, our
reliance on a few key suppliers for a significant portion of our merchandise purchases and risks associated with global
product sourcing, economic conditions worldwide, the effects of currency fluctuations, uncertainties caused by COVID-
19, as well as other factors listed under the heading “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” could affect
our ability to continue to fund our liquidity needs from business operations.
Maintaining access to merchandise that we consider appropriate for our business may be subject to the policies and
practices of our key suppliers. Therefore, we believe that it is critical to continue to maintain satisfactory relationships
with these key suppliers. We purchased 87% and 91% of our merchandise from our top five suppliers in 2021 and 2020,
respectively. Approximately 68% and 75% was purchased from one supplier, Nike, Inc., in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2022, we do not expect any one supplier to represent more than 55% of
merchandise purchases.
Planned capital expenditures in 2022 are $275 million. Included in the planned amount is $190 million dedicated to real
estate projects designed to elevate our customers’ in-store experience. The real estate total includes the remodeling or
expansion of approximately 100 existing stores, as well as the planned opening of approximately 110 new stores,
primarily representing the continued expansion of our off-mall community-based and “power” store formats, which
provide pinnacle retail experiences that deliver connected customer interactions through service, experience, product,
and a sense of community. The real estate total includes continued expansion in Asia and funding for 30 WSS stores.
Finally, the capital plan for 2022 also includes $85 million primarily for digital and supply chain initiatives. We have the
ability to revise and reschedule some of the anticipated capital expenditure program should our financial position require
it.
Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities $  666 $  1,062 $  696
$ Change $  (396)$  366
The amount provided by operating activities reflects income adjusted for non-cash items and working capital changes.
Adjustments to net income for non-cash items include non-cash gains, non-cash impairment and other charges,
depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, and share-based compensation expense. The decrease in cash
provided by operating activities in 2021 as compared with the prior year reflected higher outflows associated with
working capital changes, partially offset by higher net income and non-cash gains.
2021 Form 10-K Page 30Our merchandise inventory levels last year were significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and during the
current year we experienced some easing of the inventory shortages, however slowdowns in the supply chain
environment were challenging and we expect this to continue during 2022.
During 2021 and 2020, we did not make any contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan, as compared with
$55 million made in 2019. No U.S. qualified pension plan contributions were required due to the strong funded position
of the plan. The amounts and timing of pension contributions are dependent on several factors, including asset
performance.
As of January 29, 2022, we have withheld $12 million of lease and lease-related payments as we continue to negotiate
rent deferrals or abatements with our landlords for the period that our stores were closed due to the COVID-19
pandemic.
Cash paid for income taxes was $387 million, $100 million, and $201 million for 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
Investing Activities
($ in millions)     2021     2020     2019
Net cash used in investing activities $  (1,376)$  168 $  235
$ Change $  (1,544)$  (67)
Net cash used in investing activities increased significantly in 2021 primarily due our acquisitions of WSS and atmos.
During the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of WSS for $737 million, net of cash acquired and in the fourth
quarter, we completed the acquisition of atmos for $319, net of cash acquired.
Capital expenditures in 2021 increased to $209 million from $159 million in the prior year. During 2021, we completed
the remodeling or relocation of 182 existing stores, the build-out of 57 new stores, and conversion of 63 Footaction
stores to other banners.
Additionally, we invested $118 million in other companies primarily comprised of an additional $33 million investment in
GOAT, a $68 million investment in a public entity (Retailors Ltd.), and $9 million invested in various limited partner
venture capital funds managed by Black fund managers, who are committed to advancing diverse-led businesses as
part of our Leading in Education and Economic Development (LEED) initiative.
In connection with the shutdown of the Runners Point banner completed last year, during the first quarter of 2021, we
sold the former headquarters, resulting in proceeds of $3 million. As noted above, related to our insurance claim from
the social unrest in 2020, we received proceeds of $4 million related to property and equipment loss.

Cash provided by financing activities included of the sale of $400 million aggregate principal amount of our 4% Senior
Notes due 2029, for which we received $395 million in proceeds, net of the initial purchasers’ discount. During the fourth
quarter of 2021, we repaid $98 million of principal related to the 8.5% debentures as well as paying $4 million related to
our finance lease obligations.
During 2021, we repurchased 7,545,544 shares of common stock for $348 million under our share repurchase program,
whereas in the prior year we spent $37 million to repurchase shares. We also declared and paid $101 million in
dividends representing quarterly rates of $0.20 per share for the first two quarters of 2021 and an increase to $0.30 per
share for the third and fourth quarters.
2021 Form 10-K Page 31We paid $11 million to satisfy tax withholding obligations relating to the vesting of share-based equity awards during
2021. Offsetting this amount were proceeds received in connection with employee stock programs of $17 million.
Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure)
In addition to net cash provided by operating activities, we use free cash flow as a useful measure of performance and
as an indication of our financial strength and our ability to generate cash. We define free cash flow as net cash provided
by operating activities less capital expenditures (which is classified as an investing activity). We believe the presentation
of free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from
underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. Free cash flow is not defined under U.S.
GAAP. Therefore, it should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with
U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. It should not be inferred
that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures.
The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly
comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow.

Capital Structure
On July 14, 2020, we amended our then-existing revolving credit agreement to provide for a $600 million asset-based
revolving credit facility that is scheduled to mature on July 14, 2025 (as amended, “2020 Credit Agreement”). Under the
2020 Credit Agreement interest was determined, at our option, by either (1) the eurodollar rate, which is determined by
reference to LIBOR, plus a margin of 1.75% to 2.25% per annum, or (2) the base rate, which is determined by reference
to the federal funds rate, plus a margin of 0.75% to 1.25%, in each case. In addition, the commitment fee was 0.50%
per annum on the unused portion of the commitments under the 2020 Credit Agreement.
In 2021, we entered into an amendment to the 2020 Credit Agreement (“Amended Credit Agreement”). The amendment
provides for, among other things, (i) reducing the interest rates and commitment fees applicable to the loans and
commitments, respectively, as described below, and (ii) reducing the “floor” applicable. The amendment provides that
the interest rate applicable to loans drawn under the credit facility will be equal to, at our option, either a base rate,
determined by reference to the federal funds rate, plus a margin of 0.25% to 0.75% per annum, or a Eurodollar rate,
determined by reference to LIBOR, plus a margin of 1.25% to 1.75% per annum, in each case, depending on availability
under the Amended Credit Agreement. In addition, we will pay a commitment fee of 0.25% per annum on the unused
portion of the commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement. On October 1, 2021, WSS became a party to, and
bound by the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement and other applicable Loan Documents (as defined in the
Amended Credit Agreement) as guarantor. No events of default occurred during 2021.
Credit Rating
As of March 24, 2022, our corporate credit ratings from Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service are BB+ and
Ba1, respectively. In addition, Moody’s Investors Service has rated our senior unsecured notes Ba2.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities that expose us to material continuing risks,
contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity. Also, our financial
policies prohibit the use of derivatives for which there is no underlying exposure.
In connection with the sale of various businesses and assets, we may be obligated for certain lease commitments
transferred to third parties and pursuant to certain normal representations, warranties, or indemnifications entered into
with the purchasers of such businesses or assets. Although the maximum potential amounts for such obligations cannot
be readily determined, we believe that the resolution of such contingencies will not significantly affect our consolidated
financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.
We also operate certain stores for which lease agreements are in the process of being negotiated with landlords.
Although there is no contractual commitment to make these payments, it is likely that leases will be executed.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our responsibility for integrity and objectivity in the preparation and presentation of the financial statements requires
application of appropriate accounting policies. Generally, our accounting policies and methods are those specifically
required by U.S. GAAP. Included in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies note in “Item 8. Consolidated
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” is a summary of the most significant accounting policies. In some
cases, we are required to calculate amounts based on estimates for matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe
the following to be the most critical of those accounting policies that necessitate subjective judgments.
Merchandise Inventories and Cost of Sales
Merchandise inventories for our stores are valued at the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method
(“RIM”). The RIM is used by retail companies to value inventories at cost and calculate gross margins due to its
practicality. Under the RIM, cost is determined by applying a cost-to-retail percentage across groupings of similar items,
known as departments. The cost-to-retail percentage is applied to ending inventory at its current owned retail valuation
to determine the cost of ending inventory on a department basis.
The RIM is a system of averages that requires estimates and assumptions regarding markups, markdowns and shrink,
among others, and as such, could result in distortions of inventory amounts. Judgment is required for these estimates
and assumptions, as well as to differentiate between promotional and other markdowns that may be required to
correctly reflect merchandise inventories at the lower of cost or market. Reserves are established based on current
selling prices when the inventory has not been marked down to market. The failure to take permanent markdowns on a
timely basis may result in an overstatement of cost under the retail inventory method. The decision to take permanent
markdowns includes many factors, including the current retail environment, inventory levels, and the age of the item. We
believe this method and its related assumptions, which have been consistently applied, to be reasonable.
Leases  
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the
commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term for those arrangements where
there is an identified asset and the contract conveys the right to control its use. Our lease term includes options to
extend or terminate a lease only when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.
As most of our leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rates based on the
remaining lease term to determine the present value of future lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate for a
lease is the rate of interest we would have to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease
payments under similar terms. Our incremental borrowing rate is calculated as the weighted average risk-free
(sovereign) rate plus a spread to reflect our current unsecured credit rating plus the fees to borrow under our credit
facility. The weighted average risk-free (sovereign) rates were based on the Treasury BVAL rates curve in Bloomberg. In
the regions that we have stores, rates were developed for 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15 years. The weighting given to each region
was determined by the number of stores in each region.
2021 Form 10-K Page 33The spread to reflect our current credit rating represented the spread between U.S. Treasury rates and Bloomberg’s
USD BVAL curve for non-financial companies with the Company’s credit rating. The fees to borrow represent the facility
fees paid on the Company’s revolving credit facility.
Impairment of Long-Lived Tangible Assets and Right-of-Use Assets
We perform an impairment review when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived tangible assets and
right-of-use assets may not be recoverable (“a triggering event”). Our policy for determining whether a triggering event
exists comprises the evaluation of measurable operating performance criteria and qualitative measures at the lowest
level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of cash flows of other assets and liabilities, which is
generally at the store level. We also evaluate for triggering events at the banner level. If an impairment review is
necessitated by the identification of a triggering event, we determine the fair value of the asset using assumptions
predominately identified from our historical performance and our long-range strategic plans. To determine if an
impairment exists, we compare the carrying amount of the asset with the estimated future undiscounted cash flows
expected to result from the use of the asset group. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated
undiscounted future cash flows, we measure the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the
asset group with its estimated fair value.
The estimation of fair value is measured by discounting expected future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate
and by using a market approach to determine current lease rates. Future expected cash flows are based upon
estimates that, if not achieved, may result in significantly different results.
During the second quarter of 2021, we conducted an impairment review of Footaction stores as a result of our decision
to convert part of the stores to other existing banner concepts and close the remaining stores. We evaluated the long-
lived assets, including the right-of-use assets and recorded non-cash charges to write down store fixtures, leasehold
improvements, and right-of-use assets for approximately 60 locations, and accelerated tenancy charges for leases we
expect to terminate prior to the end of the lease term. In connection with this, we recorded charges totaling $66 million
in 2021. Additionally, we performed an impairment review for certain underperforming stores during the fourth quarter
and recorded non-cash impairment charges totaling $26 million for approximately 55 stores.
Business Combinations
We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is
obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of
acquisition. Additionally, contingent consideration is recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and classified as a
liability. We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible, intangible assets, and contingent
consideration based, in part, upon internal estimates of cash flows and considering the report of a third-party valuation
expert retained to assist the Company and requires a significant amount of management judgment. The determination
of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities as well as contingent consideration requires estimates and the use of
valuation techniques when market value is not readily available. For intangible assets acquired in a business
combination, we typically determine the fair value based on the discounted cash flow model, specifically the relief from
royalty method for intangible assets related to a tradename. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets
and contingent consideration include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates,
customer attrition rates, discount rates and useful lives. Changes to the assumptions used to estimate the fair value
could affect the recorded amounts of the assets acquired and the resultant goodwill, as well as the depreciation and
amortization expense recorded in future periods.
Recoverability of Goodwill
We review goodwill for impairment annually during the first quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if impairment
indicators arise. The review of impairment consists of either using a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more
likely than not that the fair value of the assets is less than their respective carrying values or a one-step qualitative
impairment test.
In performing the qualitative assessment, we consider many factors in evaluating whether the carrying value of goodwill
may not be recoverable, including declines in our stock price and market capitalization in relation to the book value of
the Company and macroeconomic conditions affecting retail. If, based on the results of the qualitative assessment, it is
concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, additional
quantitative impairment testing is performed. The quantitative test requires that the carrying value of each reporting unit
be compared with its estimated fair value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, a goodwill
impairment charge will be recorded for the difference (up to the carrying value of goodwill).
2021 Form 10-K Page 34We use a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. The determination of discounted
cash flows of the reporting units and assets and liabilities within the reporting units requires significant estimates and
assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, the discount rate, terminal
growth rates, earnings before depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures forecasts. Due to the inherent
uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. We evaluate the merits
of each significant assumption, both individually and in the aggregate, used to determine the fair value of the reporting
units, as well as the fair values of the corresponding assets and liabilities within the reporting units.
The annual impairment test in 2021 did not result in the recognition of impairment.
Pension and Postretirement Liabilities
We review all assumptions used to determine our obligations for pension and postretirement liabilities annually with our
independent actuaries, taking into consideration existing and future economic conditions and our intentions with regard
to the plans. The assumptions used are:
Long-Term
Rate of Return    The expected rate of return on plan assets is the long-term rate of return expected to be earned
on the plans’ assets and is recognized as a component of pension expense. The rate is based on
the plans’ weighted-average target asset allocation, as well as historical and future expected
performance of those assets. The target asset allocation is selected to obtain an investment
return that is sufficient to cover the expected benefit payments and to reduce the variability of
future contributions. The expected rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually and revised,
as necessary, to reflect changes in the financial markets and our investment strategy.
The weighted-average long-term rate of return used to determine 2021 pension expense was
5.3%.
A decrease of 50 basis points in the weighted-average expected long-term rate of return would
have increased 2021 pension expense by approximately $3 million. The actual return on plan
assets in a given year typically differs from the expected long-term rate of return, and the resulting
gain or loss is deferred and amortized into expense over the average life expectancy of the
inactive participants.
Discount Rate An assumed discount rate is used to measure the present value of future cash flow obligations of
the plans and the interest cost component of pension expense and postretirement income. The
cash flows are then discounted to their present value and an overall discount rate is determined.
The discount rate for our U.S. plans are determined by reference to the Bond:Link interest rate
model based upon a portfolio of highly-rated U.S. corporate bonds with individual bonds that are
theoretically purchased to settle the plan’s anticipated cash outflows. The discount rate selected
to measure the present value of our Canadian benefit obligations is similar to the approach used
for the U.S. plan and was determined by reference to the Canadian Rate:Link interest rate model.
The weighted-average discount rates used to determine the 2021 benefit obligations related to
our pension and postretirement plans was 3.2% for both plans.
Changing the weighted-average discount rate by 50 basis points would have changed the
accumulated benefit obligation of the pension plans at January 29, 2022 by approximately
$30 million and $33 million, depending on if the change was an increase or decrease,
respectively. A decrease of 50 basis points in the weighted-average discount rate would have
increased or decreased the accumulated benefit obligation on the postretirement plan by
approximately $1 million depending on if the change was an increase or decrease, respectively.
Trend Rate We maintain two postretirement medical plans, one covering certain executive officers and key
employees (“SERP Medical Plan”), and the other covering all other team members. With respect
to the SERP Medical Plan, a 100-basis point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate
would not significantly change this plan’s accumulated benefit obligation. With respect to the
postretirement medical plan covering all other team members, there is limited risk to us for
increases in health care costs since, beginning in 2001, new retirees have assumed the full
expected costs and then-existing retirees have assumed all increases in such costs.
2021 Form 10-K Page 35Mortality
AssumptionsThe mortality assumption used to value our 2021 U.S. pension obligations was the Pri-2012
mortality table with generational projection using MP-2021 for both males and females, while in
the prior year the obligation was valued using the Pri-2012 mortality table with generational
projection using MP-2020. We used the 2014 CPM Private Sector mortality table projected
generationally with Scale CPM-B for both males and females to value our Canadian pension
obligations for 2021.
For the SERP Medical Plan, the mortality assumption used to value the 2021 obligation was
updated to the PriH-2012 table with generational projection using MP-2021. Each year we update
this assumption to the most recent study from the Society of Actuaries.
Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, which is established when it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We are required to estimate taxable income for future years
by taxing jurisdiction and to use our judgment to determine whether to record a valuation allowance for part or all of a
deferred tax asset. Estimates of taxable income are based upon our long-range strategic plans. A 1% change in the
overall statutory tax rate for 2021 would have resulted in a change of $5 million to the carrying value of the net deferred
tax liability and a corresponding charge or credit to income tax expense depending on whether the tax rate change was
a decrease or an increase.
We have operations in multiple taxing jurisdictions, and we are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. Tax audits by their
nature are often complex and can require several years to resolve. Accruals of tax contingencies require us to make
estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of tax audits. Actual results could vary from these
estimates.
Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as level and geographic mix of income and losses,
acquisitions, investments, intercompany transactions, foreign currency exchange rates, our stock price, changes in our
deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices,
principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework and other laws and
accounting rules in various jurisdictions.

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
Foot Locker, Inc.:
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Foot Locker, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company)
as of January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive
income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
January 29, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended January 29, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2022, based on criteria
established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission, and our report dated March 24, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness
of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the
U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of
material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the
amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated
financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate
to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our
opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they
relate.
Fair value of asset group related to certain underperforming stores
As discussed in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company performs an impairment review
when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived tangible assets and right-of-use assets may not be
recoverable. The long-lived tangible assets and the right-of-use assets of the Company as of January 29, 2022 were
$917 million and $2,616 million, respectively. If a triggering event is identified, the Company compares the carrying
amount of the asset group with the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group. If the
carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, the Company measures the
amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group with its estimated fair value.
2021 Form 10-K Page 37The estimation of fair value of the asset group is measured by discounting expected future cash flows using a risk-
adjusted discount rate and current market-based information for right-of-use assets. During the year ended
January 29, 2022, the Company recorded impairment charges of $92 million related to certain underperforming stores.
We identified the evaluation of the fair value of the asset group related to certain underperforming stores as a critical
audit matter. The market-based assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the asset group included market rent
estimates for comparable stores that required a high degree of auditor judgment to evaluate and were challenging to
test in the current economic environment, as the COVID-19 shutdowns impacted the retail real estate market
significantly. Changes in the selection of the market rent estimates could have had a significant effect on the
determination of the fair value of the asset group, which impacted the measurement and allocation of the impairment
loss within the asset group.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design
and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s long-lived tangible asset and
right-of-use asset impairment assessment process, including a control related to the estimate of the fair value of the
asset group. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in (1) evaluating
the market rent estimates by assessing comparable retail leasing activity applicable to each location, and (2) assessing
historic leasing activity of the Company in relation to historical store sales performance.
Fair value of tradename intangible assets
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, on September 18, 2021, the Company acquired
Eurostar, Inc., operating as WSS (“WSS”), and on November 1, 2021, the Company acquired certain entities collectively
referred to as atmos. In connection with these business combinations, the Company acquired certain tradename
intangible assets. The preliminary, estimated acquisition-date fair value for the tradename intangible assets of WSS and
atmos was $296 million and $135 million, respectively. The Company used the relief from royalty method to determine
the fair value of the tradename intangible assets.
We identified the assessment of the acquisition-date fair value of the tradename intangible assets acquired in these
business combinations as a critical audit matter. A high degree of subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate
the amount and timing of near-term forecasted revenue, long-term revenue growth rates, the royalty rates, and the
discount rates used to value the tradename intangible assets. Changes in these assumptions could have had a
significant impact on the acquisition-date fair value of the tradename intangible assets. Valuation professionals with
specialized skills and knowledge were also required to assess the long-term growth rates, royalty rates and discount
rates assumptions.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design
and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s acquisition-date valuation
process, including controls related to the assumptions discussed above. We evaluated the amount and timing of near-
term forecasted revenue, and long-term revenue growth rates used by the Company by comparing the near-term
forecasted revenue to historical results of the acquired entities. To assess the impact that changes in certain
assumptions would have had on the Company’s determination of fair value of the tradename intangible assets, we
performed sensitivity analyses over the Company’s near-term forecasted revenue attributable to the tradename, royalty
rates, and discount rates. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in (1)
evaluating the long-term revenue growth rates by comparing them to certain nationwide economic trend data such as
GDP and inflation, and to relevant industry data, and (2) assessing the royalty rates and certain elements of the
discount rates applied by comparing them to publicly available market data.
2021 Form 10-K Page 38Fair value of contingent consideration
As discussed in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, on November 1, 2021, the Company acquired
certain entities collectively referred to as atmos in a business combination for total purchase consideration of
$360 million, including the fair value of contingent consideration initially measured at $35 million, which can reach up to
$111 million based on the achievement of certain revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and
amortization (EBITDA) performance. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability is estimated using an option
pricing model simulation that determines an average projected payment value across numerous iterations. This
technique determines projected payments based on simulated forecasted revenue and EBITDA, adjusted for selected
revenue and EBITDA volatilities and risk premiums based on market data for comparable guideline public companies.
The projected payments are then discounted back to the valuation date at the Company's cost of debt using a term
commensurate with the contractual payment dates.
We identified the assessment of the acquisition-date fair value of the contingent consideration liability resulting from the
atmos business combination as a critical audit matter. A high degree of subjective auditor judgment was required to
evaluate the amount and timing of forecasted revenue, forecasted EBITDA, and the discount rate. Changes in these
assumptions could have had a significant impact on the acquisition-date fair value of the contingent consideration.
Valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge were also required to assess the discount rate.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design
and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s acquisition-date valuation
process, including a control related to the assumptions discussed above. We evaluated the amount and timing of
forecasted revenue and EBITDA by comparing them to historical results of the acquired entity. To assess the impact that
changes in certain assumptions would have had on the Company’s determination of acquisition-date fair value of the
contingent consideration liability, we performed sensitivity analyses over the Company’s forecasted revenue, forecasted
EBITDA, and discount rate. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in
(1) evaluating the long-term revenue growth rates used to forecast revenue and EBITDA by comparing them to certain
nationwide economic trend data such as GDP and inflation, and to relevant industry data, and (2) assessing certain
elements of the discount rate applied by comparing them to publicly available market data.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2021 Form 10-K Page 441. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Foot Locker, Inc. and its domestic and international
subsidiaries, as well as any entities in which we have a controlling voting interest that are required to be consolidated.
All significant intercompany amounts have been eliminated. As used in these Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements the terms “Foot Locker,” “Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us” refer to Foot Locker, Inc. and its consolidated
subsidiaries.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure
of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant public health concerns as well as economic disruption, uncertainty,
and volatility which may negatively affect our business operations.
We considered the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, as well as the assumptions and
estimates used when preparing our financial statements, including inventory valuation, income taxes, and evaluating
the impairment of long-lived tangible assets and right-of-use lease assets. These assumptions and estimates may
change as the current situation evolves or new events occur and additional information is obtained.
The extent to which COVID-19 affects our business, results of operations, or financial condition will depend on future
developments which are outside of our control. This includes, without limitation, the efficacy and public acceptance of
vaccination programs and/or testing mandates in curbing the spread of the virus, the introduction and spread of new
variants of the virus, which may prove resistant to currently approved vaccines, and new or reinstated restrictions or
regulations on our operations.
Reporting Year
Our fiscal year end is a 52-week or 53-week period ending the Saturday closest to the last day in January. Fiscal year
2021, 2020, and 2019 represented the 52 weeks ended January 29, 2022, January 30, 2021, and February 1, 2020,
respectively. References to years in this annual report relate to fiscal years rather than calendar years.
Revenue Recognition
Store revenue is recognized at the point of sale and includes merchandise, net of returns, and excludes taxes.
Revenue from layaway sales is recognized when the customer receives the product, rather than when the initial
deposit is paid. We recognize revenue for merchandise that is shipped to our customers from our distribution centers
and stores upon shipment as the customer has control of the product upon shipment. We account for shipping and
handling as a fulfillment activity. We accrue the cost and recognize revenue for these activities upon shipment date,
therefore total sales recognized includes shipping and handling fees.  
Gift Cards
We sell gift cards which do not have expiration dates. Revenue from gift card sales is recorded when the gift cards
are redeemed by customers. Gift card breakage is recognized as revenue in proportion to the pattern of rights
exercised by the customer, unless there is a legal obligation to remit the value of unredeemed gift cards to the
relevant jurisdictions.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2021 Form 10-K Page 45The table below presents the activity of our gift card liability balance:

Gift card liability   $ 46   $ 41
We elected not to disclose the information about remaining performance obligations since the amount of gift cards
redeemed after 12 months is not significant for both 2021 and 2020.
Advertising Costs and Sales Promotion
Advertising and sales promotion costs are expensed at the time the advertising or promotion takes place, net of
reimbursements for cooperative advertising. Cooperative advertising reimbursements earned for the launch and
promotion of certain products agreed upon with vendors are recorded in the same period as the associated expenses
are incurred.
Digital advertising costs are expensed as incurred, net of reimbursements for cooperative advertising. Digital
advertising includes search engine marketing, such as display ads and keyword search terms, and other various
forms of digital advertising. Reimbursements received in excess of expenses incurred related to specific, incremental,
and identifiable advertising costs are accounted for as a reduction to the cost of merchandise and are reflected in cost
of sales when the merchandise is sold.
Advertising costs, including digital advertising, which are included as a component of SG&A, were as follows:
($ in millions)     2021     2020     2019
Advertising expenses $ 113 $ 69 $ 91
Digital advertising expenses  110  89  95
Cooperative advertising reimbursements  (29) (14) (20)
Net advertising expense $ 194 $ 144 $ 166
Share-Based Compensation
We recognize compensation expense for share-based awards based on the grant date fair value of those awards. We
use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options, which requires the input of
subjective assumptions regarding the expected term, expected volatility, and risk-free interest rate. See Note 21,
Share-Based Compensation, for information on the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of stock options.
Share-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each
vesting tranche of the award. Upon exercise of stock options, issuance of restricted stock or units, or issuance of
shares under the employee stock purchase plan, we will issue authorized but unissued common stock or use
common stock held in treasury.
Awards of restricted stock units cliff vest after the passage of time, generally three years. Performance stock unit
awards are earned only after the attainment of performance goals in connection with the relevant performance period
and vest after an additional one-year period.
Earnings Per Share
We account for earnings per share (“EPS”) using the treasury stock method. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net
income for the period by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding at the end of the period.
Diluted EPS reflects the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period used in the basic
EPS computation plus dilutive common stock equivalents.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2021 Form 10-K Page 46The computation of basic and diluted EPS is as follows:
(in millions, except per share data)     2021     2020     2019
Net income attributable to Foot Locker, Inc. $ 893 $ 323 $ 491
Weighted-average common shares outstanding  102.5  104.3  108.7
Dilutive effect of potential common shares  1.3  0.8  0.4
Weighted-average common shares outstanding
assuming dilution  103.8  105.1  109.1
Earnings per share - basic $ 8.72 $ 3.10 $ 4.52
Earnings per share - diluted $ 8.61 $ 3.08 $ 4.50
Anti-dilutive share-based awards excluded from diluted
calculation  1.8  2.5  2.2
Performance stock units related to our long-term incentive programs of 0.4 million for 2021, 0.4 million for 2020, and
0.5 million for 2019, have been excluded from diluted weighted-average shares. The issuance of these shares are

Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash
Cash consists of funds held on hand and in bank accounts. Cash equivalents include amounts on demand with banks
and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, including money market funds.
Additionally, amounts due from third-party credit card processors for the settlement of debit and credit card
transactions are included as cash equivalents as they are generally collected within three business days. We present
book overdrafts, representing checks issued but still outstanding in excess of bank balances, as part of accounts
payable.
Restricted cash represents cash that is restricted as to withdrawal or use under the terms of various agreements.
Restricted cash includes amounts held in escrow in connection with various leasing arrangements in Europe, and
deposits held in insurance trusts to satisfy the requirement to collateralize part of the self-insured workers’
compensation and liability claims.
The following table provides the reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, as reported on our
consolidated statements of cash flows:

Merchandise Inventories and Cost of Sales
Merchandise inventories for our stores are valued at the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method.
Cost for retail stores is determined on the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) basis for domestic inventories and on the first-in,
first-out (“FIFO”) basis for international inventories. Merchandise inventories of the e-commerce business are valued
at net realizable value using weighted-average cost, which approximates FIFO. Merchandise inventories for our WSS
and atmos businesses are valued at its net realizable value using the weighted average method. Cost is determined
on the FIFO basis.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2021 Form 10-K Page 47The retail inventory method is used by retail companies to value inventories at cost and calculate gross margins due
to its practicality. Under the retail inventory method, cost is determined by applying a cost-to-retail percentage across
groupings of similar items, known as departments. The cost-to-retail percentage is applied to ending inventory at its
current owned retail valuation to determine the cost of ending inventory on a department basis. We provide reserves
based on current selling prices when the inventory has not been marked down to market.
Transportation, distribution center, and sourcing costs are capitalized in merchandise inventories. We expense the
freight associated with transfers between our store locations in the period incurred. We maintain an accrual for
shrinkage based on historical rates.
Cost of sales is comprised of the cost of merchandise, as well as occupancy, buyers’ compensation, and shipping and
handling costs. The cost of merchandise is recorded net of amounts received from suppliers for damaged product
returns, markdown allowances, and volume rebates, as well as cooperative advertising reimbursements received in
excess of specific, incremental advertising expenses.
Minority Investments
We use the equity method to account for investments in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence
over the investee’s operating and financial policies, or in which we hold a partnership or limited liability company
interest in an entity with specific ownership accounts, unless we have virtually no influence over the investee’s
operating and financial policies. As of January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021, we had $56 million and $15 million,
respectively, of investments which are accounted for under the equity method.
Our investments that are not accounted for under the equity method are measured either at cost, adjusted for
changes in observable prices minus impairment under the practicability exception, or at fair value for our investment
in the common stock of an entity that is publicly traded. As of January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021, we had $725
million and $322 million, respectively, of investments which are accounted for under these methods.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Significant additions
and improvements to property and equipment are capitalized. Major renewals or replacements that substantially
extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
Depreciation and amortization are computed on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:
Buildings     Maximum of 50 years
Store leasehold improvements Shorter of the asset useful life or expected term of the lease
Furniture, fixtures, and equipment 3‑10 years
Software 2‑5 years
Internal-Use Software Development Costs
We capitalize certain external and internal computer software and software development costs incurred during the
application development stage. The application development stage generally includes software design and
configuration, coding, testing, and installation activities. Capitalized costs include only external direct cost of materials
and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal-use software, and payroll and payroll-related costs for
employees who are directly associated with and devote time to the internal-use software project. Capitalization of
such costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use.
We generally amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over a period not to exceed five years. Training and
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred, while upgrades and enhancements are capitalized if it is probable that
such expenditures will result in additional functionality. Capitalized software, net of accumulated amortization, is
included as a component of Property and equipment, net and was $103 million and $93 million at January 29, 2022
and January 30, 2021, respectively.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2021 Form 10-K Page 48Impairment of Long-Lived Tangible Assets and Right-of-Use Assets
We perform an impairment review when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived tangible assets
and right-of-use assets may not be recoverable (“a triggering event”). Our policy in determining whether a triggering
event exists comprises the evaluation of measurable operating performance criteria and qualitative measures at the
lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of cash flows for other assets and liabilities,
which is generally at the store level. We also evaluate triggering events at the banner level. In evaluating potential
store level impairment, we compare future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group
to the carrying amount of the asset group. The future cash flows are estimated predominately based on our historical
performance and long-range strategic plans. If the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the estimated
undiscounted future cash flows, we measure the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the
asset group with its estimated fair value. The estimation of fair value is measured by discounting expected future cash
flows using a risk adjusted discount rate and using current market-based information for right-of-use assets. We
estimate fair value based on the best information available using estimates, judgments, and projections as considered
necessary.
Leases
On February 3, 2019, we adopted the new lease accounting standard. Lease liabilities are recognized at the
commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term for those arrangements
where there is an identified asset and the contract conveys the right to control its use. The lease term includes
options to extend or terminate a lease only when we are reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. The
right-of-use asset is measured at the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before
the lease commencement date, initial direct costs, and any tenant improvement allowances received. For operating
leases, right-of-use assets are reduced over the lease term by the straight-line lease expense recognized less the
amount of accretion of the lease liability determined using the effective interest method.
We combine lease components and non-lease components. Given our policy election to combine lease and non-
lease components, we also consider fixed common area maintenance (“CAM”) part of our fixed future lease
payments; therefore, fixed CAM is also included in our lease liability. We recognize rent expense for operating leases
as of the possession date for store leases or the commencement of the agreement for non-store leases. Rental
expense, inclusive of rent holidays, concessions, and tenant allowances are recognized over the lease term on a
straight-line basis. Contingent payments based upon sales and future increases determined by inflation related
indices cannot be estimated at the inception of the lease and, accordingly, are charged to operations as
incurred.
As most of our leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rates based on the
remaining lease term to determine the present value of future lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate for a
lease is the rate of interest we would have to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease
payments under similar terms. 
Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. We recognize lease expense
for short-term leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually during the first quarter of
each fiscal year or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. The review of goodwill impairment consists of either
using a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the assets is less than
their respective carrying values or a one-step quantitative impairment test. In performing the qualitative assessment,
we consider many factors in evaluating whether the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable, including
declines in our stock price and market capitalization in relation to the book value of the Company and macroeconomic
conditions affecting retail. If, based on the results of the qualitative assessment, it is concluded that it is not more
likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, additional quantitative impairment
testing is performed. The quantitative test requires that the carrying value of each reporting unit be compared with its
estimated fair value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, a goodwill impairment charge
will be recorded for the difference (up to the carrying value of goodwill).
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2021 Form 10-K Page 49We use a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. The determination of
discounted cash flows of the reporting units and assets and liabilities within the reporting units requires significant
estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, the discount
rate, terminal growth rates, earnings before depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures forecasts. Due to
the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. We
evaluate the merits of each significant assumption, both individually and in the aggregate, used to determine the fair
value of the reporting units, as well as the fair values of the corresponding assets and liabilities within the reporting
units.
For our 2021 annual impairment review, we concluded the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying
value. Goodwill is net of accumulated impairment charges of $167 million for all periods presented. Refer to Note 2 for
further detail regarding acquisitions during 2021.
Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment if impairment indicators arise and, at a minimum,
annually. The impairment review for intangible assets with indefinite lives consists of either performing a qualitative or
a quantitative assessment. If the results of the qualitative assessment indicate that it is more likely than not that the
fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible is less than its carrying amount, or if we elect to proceed directly to a
quantitative assessment, we calculate the fair value using a discounted cash flow method, based on the relief from
royalty method, and compare the fair value to the carrying value to determine if the asset is impaired. Intangible
assets that are determined to have finite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are measured for impairment
only when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Contingent Consideration
As a result of our purchase of atmos, we recognized contingent consideration, as a component of the purchase
consideration is payable contingent on the achievement of certain sales and EBITDA performance. See Note 2 for
further details. Contingent consideration is classified as a liability when it will be settled in cash or a variable number
of shares (or a combination thereof), and the amount of the payment is not dependent upon the fair value of the
Company's common stock. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability is estimated using an option pricing
model simulation that determines an average projected payment value across numerous iterations. This technique
determines projected payments based on simulated sales and EBITDA derived from an internal forecast, adjusted for
selected revenue and EBITDA volatilities and risk premiums based on market data for comparable guideline public
companies. The projected payments are then discounted back to the valuation date at the Company's cost of debt
using a term commensurate with the contractual payment dates.
The contingent consideration liability will be measured at fair value on a recurring basis until the contingency is
resolved. Changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability will be reflected in operating
income or expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Derivative Financial Instruments
All derivative financial instruments are recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair values. For
derivatives designated as a hedge, and effective as part of a hedge transaction, the effective portion of the gain or
loss on the hedging derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income/loss or as a
basis adjustment to the underlying hedged item and reclassified to earnings in the period in which the hedged item
affects earnings. The effective portion of the gain or loss on hedges of foreign net investments is generally not
reclassified to earnings unless the net investment is disposed of. To the extent derivatives do not qualify or are not
designated as hedges, or are ineffective, their changes in fair value are recorded in earnings immediately, which may
subject us to increased earnings volatility.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2021 Form 10-K Page 50Income Taxes
We account for our income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax
assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial
statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the differences
between the financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for
the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are recognized for tax credits and net
operating loss carryforwards, reduced by a valuation allowance, which is established when it is more likely than not
that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred
tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
We recognize net deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe these assets are more likely than not to be
realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future
reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and
results of recent operations. If we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in
excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance,
which would reduce the provision for income taxes.
A taxing authority may challenge positions that we adopted in our income tax filings. Accordingly, we may apply
different tax treatments for transactions in filing our income tax returns than for income tax financial reporting. We
regularly assess our tax positions for such transactions and record reserves for those differences when considered
necessary.
Tax positions are recognized only when it is more likely than not, based on technical merits, that the positions will be
sustained upon examination. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are measured using a
probability weighted approach as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being
realized upon settlement. Whether the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is met for a tax position is a matter
of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all available
evidence. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within income tax expense in the
accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related
tax liability line in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Pension and Postretirement Obligations
Pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using actuarial assumptions. Two key
assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return
on plan assets. The discount rate for the U.S. plans is determined by reference to the Bond:Link interest rate model
based upon a portfolio of highly-rated U.S. corporate bonds with individual bonds that are theoretically purchased to
settle the plan’s anticipated cash outflows. The cash flows are discounted to their present value and an overall
discount rate is determined. The discount rate selected to measure the present value of the Canadian benefit
obligations was developed by using that plan’s bond portfolio indices, which match the benefit obligations. We
measure our plan assets and benefit obligations using the month-end date that is closest to our fiscal year end. The
expected return on plan assets assumption is derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension
plan assets and considering historical as well as expected performance of those assets. 
Insurance Liabilities
We are primarily self-insured for health care, workers’ compensation, and general liability costs. Accordingly,
provisions are made for actuarially determined estimates of discounted future claim costs for such risks, for the
aggregate of claims reported, and claims incurred but not yet reported. Self-insured liabilities totaled $14 million for
January 29, 2022, $13 million for January 30, 2021 and $12 million for February 1, 2020. Workers’ compensation and
general liability reserves are discounted using a risk-free interest rate. Imputed interest expense related to these
liabilities was not significant for any of the periods presented.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2021 Form 10-K Page 51Treasury Stock Retirement
We periodically retire treasury shares that we acquire through share repurchases and return those shares to the
status of authorized but unissued. We account for treasury stock transactions under the cost method. For each
reacquisition of common stock, the number of shares and the acquisition price for those shares is added to the
existing treasury stock count and total value. When treasury shares are retired, our policy is to allocate the excess of
the repurchase price over the par value of shares acquired to both retained earnings and additional paid-in capital.
The portion allocated to additional paid-in capital is determined by applying a percentage, which is determined by
dividing the number of shares to be retired by the number of shares issued, to the balance of additional paid-in capital
as of the retirement date.
We retired 5,474,288 and 913,095 shares of our common stock held in treasury during 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The shares were returned to the status of authorized but unissued. As a result, treasury stock decreased by
$260 million and $34 million as of January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021, respectively.
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency of our international operations is the applicable local currency. The translation of the
applicable foreign currency into U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in
effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using the weighted-average rates of
exchange prevailing during the year. The unearned gains and losses resulting from such translation are included as a
separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss (“AOCL”) within shareholders’ equity.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Recently issued accounting pronouncements did not, or are not believed by management to, have a material effect

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
All recently issued accounting pronouncements are not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated
financial statements.
2. Acquisitions
WSS
Effective September 18, 2021, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Foot Locker Retail, Inc., acquired
100% of the shares of Eurostar, Inc., a Delaware corporation operating as WSS (“WSS”). WSS is a U.S.-based off-
mall athletic footwear and apparel retailer, focused on the Hispanic consumer, which operated 93 stores at the
acquisition, primarily on the West Coast. The aggregate purchase price for the acquisition was $807 million
($737 million paid in 2021, net of cash acquired) subject to the finalization of the value of net assets acquired and was
funded with available cash. We believe that this acquisition enhances our growth opportunities in North America and
creates further diversification and differentiation in terms of both customers and products. The results of WSS are
included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date.
atmos
Effective November 1, 2021, the Company, acquired certain entities collectively operated as atmos, headquartered in
Japan. atmos is a digitally led, culturally-connected global brand featuring premium sneakers and apparel, an
exclusive in-house label, collaborative relationships with leading vendors in the sneaker ecosystem, experiential
stores, and a robust omni-channel platform. The aggregate purchase price for the acquisition was $360 million
($319 million paid in 2021, net of cash acquired) subject to adjustment for the finalization of the value of net assets
acquired and was funded with available cash. The preliminary purchase price includes contingent consideration
initially measured at $35 million, which can reach up to $111 million based on achieving certain revenue growth and
EBITDA performance targets. The results of atmos are included in our consolidated financial statements since the
acquisition date.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2021 Form 10-K Page 52The following table represents the preliminary allocation of the purchase price for WSS and includes fair value
adjustments to certain assets and liabilities since our most recent interim report. Goodwill was reduced from
$494 million reported at the end of the third quarter to $401 million, primarily related to higher valuation of the
tradenames. The adjustments did not have a significant effect on the consolidated results of operations. We
determined that the WSS tradename will have an indefinite life and will not be amortized. The proforma effects of the
acquisition have not been presented, as their effects were not significant to the consolidated results of operations.

We have integrated all available shopping channels including stores, websites, apps, social channels, and catalogs.
Store sales are primarily fulfilled from the store’s inventory but may also be shipped from our distribution centers or
from a different store location if an item is not available at the original store. Direct-to-customer orders are generally
shipped to our customers through our distribution centers but may also be shipped from a store or a combination of
our distribution centers and stores depending on the availability of particular items.
Our operating segments are identified according to how our business activities are managed and evaluated by our
chief operating decision maker, our CEO. We have three operating segments, North America, EMEA (Europe, Middle
East and Africa), and Asia Pacific. Our North America operating segment includes the results of the following banners
operating in the U.S. and Canada: Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker, Champs Sports, Footaction, and
WSS, including each of their related e-commerce businesses, as well as our Eastbay business that includes internet,
catalog, and team sales. Our EMEA operating segment includes the results of the following banners operating in
Europe: Foot Locker, Sidestep, and Kids Foot Locker, including each of their related e-commerce businesses. Our
Asia Pacific operating segment includes the results of Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker operating in Australia, New
Zealand, and Asia as well as their related e-commerce businesses. Effective with the acquisition, atmos is included in
our Asia Pacific operating segment. We further aggregated these operating segments into one reportable segment
based upon their shared customer base and similar economic characteristics.
We evaluate performance based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is the banner’s financial
results referred to as division profit. Division profit reflects income before income taxes, impairment and other

During the second quarter of 2021, we conducted an impairment review of Footaction stores as a result of our
decision to convert part of the stores to other existing banner concepts and close the remaining stores. We evaluated
the long-lived assets, including the right-of-use assets and recorded non-cash charges to write down store fixtures,
leasehold improvements, and right-of-use assets for approximately 60 locations, and accelerated tenancy charges for
leases we expect to terminate prior to the end of the lease term. In connection with this, we recorded charges totaling
$66 million. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we conducted an impairment review for approximately 100
underperforming stores. We evaluated the long-lived assets, including the right-of-use assets and recorded non-cash
charges of $26 million to write down store fixtures, leasehold improvements, and right-of-use assets for approximately
55 of these stores.
During 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recorded non-cash charges of $42 million, $4 million and $11 million, respectively,
related to the write-down of certain minority investments. In 2021, due to continued losses and updated estimates of
value, we recorded full write downs on three of the Company’s minority investments. Additionally, one of our
investments experienced a deterioration in their future outlook and due to the underperformance of this investee, we
wrote down our investment in 2020 and 2019. In 2019, we recorded a full write down of our investment in a children’s
athletics startup which filed for bankruptcy.
In connection with the acquisitions, we recorded acquisition and integration costs of $24 million, which primarily
represented investment banking and integration consulting fees related to the WSS and atmos acquisitions.
In 2021, we recorded $15 million of lease termination costs related to the closure of certain stores. We also recorded
$4 million of reorganization expense related to Footaction and certain support functions, as well as $2 million of
intangible asset impairment on the Footaction tradename, due to the store and website closures.

2021 Form 10-K Page 55Losses related to social unrest represented inventory losses, damages to store property, repairs, and other costs
incurred in connection with the riots that affected certain parts of the United States and Canada during the second
quarter of 2020 and resulted in a loss of $18 million. Approximately 140 stores were damaged due to the unrest. The
total charge included inventory losses of $15 million, damages to store property of $1 million, and repairs and other
costs of $2 million.
During the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded a partial insurance recovery of $10 million representing an advance on
our claim. In 2021, we reached a final insurance settlement for an additional $13 million, of which $7 million is
classified in impairment and other charges, as it relates to the book value of property losses recorded in 2020.
Due to COVID-19 and its effect on our actual and projected results, during the first quarter of 2020, we determined
that a triggering event occurred for certain underperforming stores operating in Europe and, therefore, we conducted
an impairment review. We recorded non-cash charges of $15 million to write down store fixtures, leasehold
improvements, and right-of-use assets of 70 stores. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded non-cash charges
of $62 million to write down store fixtures, leasehold improvements, and right-of-use assets for approximately 60
underperforming stores. 
In May 2020, we made the strategic decision to shut down our Runners Point business and to consolidate our
Sidestep support staff into our other operations in Europe. Also, as part of the next phase of the Champs Sports and
Eastbay strategic initiative, we restructured positions and aligned several functions across the banners and
consolidated certain Eastbay operations into the Champs Sports headquarters. We recorded charges of $19 million
related to the shutdown of the Runners Point business and $3 million related to the reorganization associated with
Eastbay. As part of the decision to close the Runners Point banner, certain Runners Point stores have been converted
into other banners and approximately 40 Runners Point and Sidestep stores closed prior to their natural lease
expirations. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded a charge of $4 million in connection with the reorganization of
certain support functions and supply chain operations within our EMEA segment.  
The Company and the Company’s U.S. pension plan were involved in litigation related to the conversion of the plan to
a cash balance plan. The court entered its final judgment in 2018, which required the plan be reformed as directed by
the court order. We recorded charges in 2020 and 2019, related to the pension matter and related plan reformation
totaling $2 million and $4 million, respectively. These charges recorded represented certain costs of the reformation
and related administrative expenses.
During 2019, we performed an impairment review on our Footaction stores, certain other underperforming stores and
a vacant store that had been previously subleased. We evaluated the long-lived assets, including the right-of-use
assets, of these stores and recorded non-cash charges of $37 million to write down right-of-use assets, store fixtures
and leasehold improvements. We also recorded $13 million of lease termination costs related to the closure of our
SIX:02 locations during 2019.
5. Other Income, net
Other income, net was $394 million, $198 million, and $12 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Other
income, net includes non-operating items, such as:
-Franchise royalty income/licensee income,
-gains associated with disposal of property,
-changes in fair value, premiums paid, and realized gains associated with foreign currency option
contracts,
-changes in the market value of our available-for-sale security,
-premiums paid to repurchase and retire bonds,
-changes in value for our investments accounted for using the fair value measurement alternative, which
is at cost adjusted for changes in observable prices minus impairment,
-our share of earnings or losses related to our equity method investments, and
-net benefit expense or income related to our pension and postretirement programs, excluding the
service cost component.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2021 Form 10-K Page 56One of our minority investments, GOAT, which is measured using the fair value alternative, received funding at higher
valuations in both 2021 and 2020 resulting in non-cash gains of $290 million and $190 million, respectively. During
2021, we invested $68 million to take a common stock minority stake in a public entity, Retailors, Ltd., which is traded
on the Tel Aviv stock exchange. This investment was at a discount of $9 million to the initial public offering price,
resulting in a non-cash gain of $9 million. Changes in fair value represented on our Retailors, Ltd. investment also
generated non-cash gains of $68 million during the year.
For 2021 other income, net also included $10 million in royalty income, $7 million of net benefit income related to our
pension and postretirement programs, $7 million of insurance recoveries in excess of the losses sustained in the prior
year related to the social unrest, and $3 million of income related to our equity method investments.
Other income, net in 2020 also included $6 million of royalty income, $5 million of net benefit income relating to our
pension and postretirement programs. This income was partially offset by $2 million in premiums paid in connection
with the repurchase and retirement of bonds and a $1 million loss related to our equity method investments.
During 2019, we recorded $8 million of royalty income, a $4 million gain associated with the acquisition of a Canadian
distribution center lease and related assets from the partial exchange of a note that had previously been written down
to zero, a $2 million gain related to the sale of a building, a $1 million gain on our available-for-sale security, partially
offset by $2 million of net benefit expense relating to our pension and postretirement programs, and $1 million loss
related to our equity method investments.

12. Revolving Credit Facility
On July 14, 2020, we amended our then-existing revolving credit agreement to provide for a $600 million asset-based
revolving credit facility that is scheduled to mature on July 14, 2025 (as amended, “2020 Credit Agreement”). Under
the 2020 Credit Agreement interest was determined, at our option, by either (1) the eurodollar rate, which is
determined by reference to LIBOR, plus a margin of 1.75% to 2.25% per annum, or (2) the base rate, which is
determined by reference to the federal funds rate, plus a margin of 0.75% to 1.25%, in each case. In addition, the
commitment fee was 0.50% per annum on the unused portion of the commitments under the 2020 Credit Agreement.
In the second quarter of 2021, we entered into an amendment to the 2020 Credit Agreement (“Amended Credit
Agreement”). The amendment provides for, among other things, (i) reducing the interest rates and commitment fees
applicable to the loans and commitments, respectively, as described below, and (ii) reducing the “floor” applicable.
The amendment provides that the interest rate applicable to loans drawn under the credit facility will be equal to, at
our option, either a base rate, determined by reference to the federal funds rate, plus a margin of 0.25% to 0.75% per
annum, or a Eurodollar rate, determined by reference to LIBOR, plus a margin of 1.25% to 1.75% per annum, in each
case, depending on availability under the Amended Credit Agreement. In addition, we will pay a commitment fee of
0.25% per annum on the unused portion of the commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement. On October 1,
2021, WSS became a party to, and bound by the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement and other applicable Loan
Documents (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) as guarantor. No events of default occurred during 2021.
We may use letters of credit issued pursuant to the 2020 Credit Agreement to, among other things, support standby
letters of credit in connection with insurance programs. The letters of credit outstanding as of January 29, 2022 were
not significant.
We paid fees of $1 million in connection with the amendment of our credit facility and such costs are amortized over
the life of the facility. The unamortized balance at January 29, 2022 was $4 million. Interest expense, including facility
fees, related to the revolving credit facility was $3 million, $5 million, and $1 million for 2021, 2020, and 2019,
respectively.

(1) In 2009, we terminated an interest rate swap at a gain. This gain was amortized as part of interest expense over the term of the debt using the
effective-yield method.
During 2021 we completed the sale of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4% Senior Notes due 2029 (the
“4% Notes”). We received net proceeds from the offering of $395 million, after deducting the initial purchasers’
discount. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.
The 4% Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture by and among the Company, certain guarantors from time to
time party thereto, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The 4% Notes are the senior unsecured,
unsubordinated obligations of the Company and are guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the Company’s current and,
subject to certain exceptions, future subsidiaries that guarantee the Company’s secured revolving credit facility or
certain other debt of the Company or the guarantors.
Interest expense related to long-term debt and the amortization of the associated debt issuance costs was $12 million
for 2021 and $8 million for both 2020 and 2019.

The majority of our leases are operating leases for our company-operated retail store locations. We also lease,
among other things, distribution and warehouse facilities, and office space for corporate administrative purposes.
 Operating lease periods generally range from 5 to 10 years and generally contain rent escalation provisions. Some of
the store leases contain renewal options with varying terms and conditions.

Total lease costs include fixed operating lease costs, variable lease costs, and short-term lease costs. Most of our
real estate leases require us to pay certain expenses, such as CAM costs, real estate taxes, and other executory
costs, of which the fixed portion is included in operating lease costs. Variable lease costs include non-lease
components which are not fixed and are not included in determining the present value of our lease liability. Variable
lease costs also include amounts based on a percentage of gross sales in excess of specified levels that are
recognized when probable.
Lease costs which relate to retail stores and distribution centers are classified within cost of sales, while non-store
lease costs are included in SG&A. Amortization of leased equipment assets is classified in depreciation and
amortization. The components of lease cost for 2021, 2020, and 2019 were as follows:

Following the enactment of Public Law 115-97 (“Tax Act”) and the one-time transition tax, our historical foreign
earnings are not subject to additional U.S. federal tax upon repatriation. Further, no additional U.S. federal tax will be
due upon repatriation of current foreign earnings because they are either exempt or subject to U.S. tax as earned.
At January 29, 2022, we had accumulated undistributed foreign earnings of approximately $617 million. This amount
consists of historical earnings that were previously taxed under the Tax Act and post-Tax Act earnings. Investments in
our foreign subsidiaries, including working capital, will continue to be permanently reinvested. Cash balances in
excess of working capital needs are considered to be available for repatriation to the United States and foreign
withholding taxes will be accrued as necessary on these amounts.
We have not recorded a deferred tax liability for the difference between the financial statement carrying amount and
the tax basis of our investments in foreign subsidiaries. The determination of any unrecorded deferred tax liability on
this amount is not practicable due to the uncertainty of how these investments would be recovered.

Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income, which are based upon our
long-range strategic plans, management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of
deductible differences, net of the valuation allowances at January 29, 2022, over the periods in which the temporary
differences are anticipated to reverse. However, the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be
adjusted in the future if estimates of taxable income are revised.
As of January 29, 2022, we have a valuation allowance of $80 million to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount
that is more likely than not to be realized. A valuation allowance of $68 million was recorded against tax loss
carryforwards of certain foreign entities. Based on the history of losses and the absence of prudent and feasible
business plans for generating future taxable income in these entities, we believe it is more likely than not that the
benefit of these loss carryforwards will not be realized. As of January 29, 2022, a valuation allowance of $11 million
was established for foreign taxes assessed at rates in excess of the U.S. federal tax rate for which no U.S. foreign tax
credit is available.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2021 Form 10-K Page 64Additionally, since we do not have any reasonably foreseeable sources of Canadian capital gains, a valuation
allowance of $1 million was established since 2019 for a deferred tax asset arising from a capital loss associated with
an uncollectible Canadian note receivable.
At January 29, 2022, we have international minimum tax credit carryforwards with a potential tax benefit of $3 million
and operating loss carryforwards with a potential tax benefit of $114 million, a portion of which will expire between
2022 and 2036 and a portion of which will never expire. We will have, when realized, a capital loss with a potential
benefit of $1 million arising from a Canadian note receivable. The Canadian loss will carryforward indefinitely after
realization. The international operating loss carryforwards include nominal unrecognized tax benefits. We also have
foreign tax credit carrybacks and carryforwards with a potential tax benefit of $15 million that will expire between 2022
and 2031.
We operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit. Audits can involve complex issues that may
require an extended period of time to resolve. A taxing authority may challenge positions that we have adopted in our
income tax filings. Accordingly, we may apply different tax treatments for transactions in filing the income tax returns
than for income tax financial reporting. We regularly assess our tax positions for such transactions and record
reserves for those differences.
The examination of our 2020 U.S. Federal income tax filing was concluded in March 2022. We are participating in the
IRS’s Compliance Assurance Process (“CAP”) for 2022 and 2021. The 2021 CAP is expected to conclude during
2022. We are subject to state and local tax examinations from 2015 to the present. To date, no adjustments have
been proposed in any audits that will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
At January 29, 2022, we had $41 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $35 million would, if recognized,
affect our annual effective tax rate. We classified certain income tax liabilities as current or noncurrent based on
management’s estimate of when these liabilities will be settled. Interest expense and penalties related to
unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense. We recognized $1 million of interest expense in
2021, 2020, and 2019. The total amount of accrued interest and penalties was $3 million, $3 million, and $2 million in
2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
The following table summarizes the activity related to unrecognized tax benefits:

Unrecognized tax benefits at end of year $ 41 $ 47 $ 45
It is reasonably possible that the liability associated with our unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease
within the next twelve months. These changes may be the result of foreign currency fluctuations, ongoing audits, or
the expiration of statutes of limitations. Settlements during 2022 are not expected to be significant based on current
estimates. Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. Although
management believes that adequate provision has been made for such issues, the ultimate resolution could have an
adverse effect on our earnings. Conversely, if these issues are resolved favorably in the future, the related provision
would be reduced, generating a positive effect on earnings.
Due to the uncertainty of amounts and in accordance with our accounting policies, we have not recorded any potential
consequences of these settlements. In addition, to the extent there are settlements in the future for certain foreign
unrecognized tax benefits, the transition tax may also be revised accordingly.

2021 Form 10-K Page 6518. Financial Instruments and Risk Management
We operate internationally and utilize certain derivative financial instruments to mitigate our foreign currency
exposures, primarily related to third-party and intercompany forecasted transactions. As a result of the use of
derivative instruments, we are exposed to the risk that counterparties will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To
mitigate this counterparty credit risk, we have a practice of entering into contracts with major financial institutions
selected based upon their credit ratings and other financial factors. We monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties
throughout the duration of the derivative instrument.
Derivative Holdings Designated as Hedges
For a derivative to qualify as a hedge at inception and throughout the hedged period, we formally document the
nature of the hedged items and the relationships between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as
our risk-management objectives, strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions, and the methods of
assessing hedge effectiveness and ineffectiveness. In addition, for hedges of forecasted transactions, the significant
characteristics and expected terms of a forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must be probable
that each forecasted transaction would occur. If it were deemed probable that the forecasted transaction would not
occur, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument would be recognized in earnings immediately. Gains or losses
recognized in earnings for any of the periods presented were not significant. Derivative financial instruments
qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and
the item being hedged, both at inception and throughout the hedged period, which we evaluate periodically.
The primary currencies to which we are exposed are the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar.
Generally, merchandise inventories are purchased by each geographic area in their respective local currency with the
exception of the United Kingdom, whose merchandise inventory purchases are primarily denominated in euros.
For option and foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges of the purchase of inventory, the
effective portion of gains and losses is deferred as a component of AOCL and is recognized as a component of cost
of sales when the related inventory is sold. The amount reclassified to cost of sales related to such contracts was not
significant for any of the periods presented. The effective portion of gains or losses associated with other forward
contracts is deferred as a component of AOCL until the underlying transaction is reported in earnings. The ineffective
portion of gains and losses related to cash flow hedges recorded to earnings was not significant for any of the periods
presented. When using a forward contract as a hedging instrument, we exclude the time value of the contract from
the assessment of effectiveness.
At January 29, 2022, no contracts were outstanding. The notional value of the contracts outstanding January
30, 2021 was $69 million. The loss in AOCL was not significant for any of the periods presented.
Derivative Holdings Not Designated as Hedges
We enter into certain derivative contracts that are not designated as hedges, such as foreign exchange forward
contracts and currency option contracts. These derivative contracts are used to manage certain costs of foreign
currency-denominated merchandise purchases, intercompany transactions, and the effect of fluctuating foreign
exchange rates on the reporting of foreign currency-denominated earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivative
holdings not designated as hedges, as well as realized gains and premiums paid, are recorded in earnings
immediately within SG&A or Other income, net, depending on the type of transaction. The aggregate amount
recognized for these contracts was not significant for any of the periods presented.
The notional value of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021 was
$99 million and $135 million, respectively. The foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at January 29, 2022
extend less than twelve months into the future.

Business Risk
The retail business is highly competitive. Price, quality, selection of merchandise, reputation, store location,
advertising, and customer experience are important competitive factors in our business. We operate in 28 countries
and purchased 87% of our merchandise in 2021 from our top 5 suppliers. In 2021, we purchased 68% of our athletic
merchandise from one major supplier, Nike, Inc. (“Nike”). Each of our banners are highly dependent on Nike; they
individually purchased 50% to 75% of their merchandise from Nike. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2022, we do
not expect any one supplier to represent more than 55% of merchandise purchases.
Included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at January 29, 2022, are the net assets of our European operations,
which total $505 million and are located in 19 countries, 11 of which have adopted the euro as their functional
currency.
19. Fair Value Measurements
We categorize our financial instruments into a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation
techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs
(Level 3). If the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the category level is
based on the lowest priority level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.
Fair value is determined based upon the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants exclusive of any transaction costs. Our financial assets
recorded at fair value are categorized as follows:
Level 1 -     Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
Level 2 -     Observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, including quoted prices for similar
instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not
active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs or significant value-drivers are
observable in active markets.
Level 3 -     Model-derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs or significant value-drivers are
unobservable.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2021 Form 10-K Page 67During the second quarter of 2021, we invested $68 million to take a common stock minority stake in a public entity,
Retailors, Ltd., which is traded on the Tel Aviv stock exchange. This investment is classified as a Level 1 instrument
since the fair value is readily available in an active market.
Our auction rate security, classified as available-for-sale, is recorded within Other assets on the Consolidated
 Balance Sheet and is recorded at fair value with gains and losses reported in Other income, net in our Consolidated
Statements of Operations. The fair value of the auction rate security is determined by using quoted prices for similar
instruments in active markets and accordingly is classified as a Level 2 instrument.
The fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with the atmos acquisition is estimated using an
option pricing model simulation that determines an average projected payment value across numerous iterations. See
Note 1 for further details.
Our derivative financial instruments are valued using market-based inputs to valuation models. These valuation
models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, and measures of volatility
and therefore are classified as Level 2 instruments.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Assets and liabilities recognized or
disclosed at fair value on the consolidated financial statements on a nonrecurring basis include items such as
property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, goodwill, other intangible assets, and minority
investments that are not accounted for under the equity method of accounting. These assets are measured using
Level 3 inputs, if determined to be impaired. As of January 29, 2022, cumulative impairments on our portfolio of
minority investments were $53 million.
Long-Term Debt
The fair value of long-term debt is determined by using model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs or
significant value-drivers are observable in active markets and therefore are classified as Level 2.

2021 Form 10-K Page 6820. Retirement Plans and Other Benefits
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans
We have defined benefit pension plans covering certain of our North American employees. In May 2019, the U.S.
qualified pension plan was amended such that all employees who were not participants in the plan as of
December 31, 2019, will not become participants after such date. All benefit accruals were frozen as of
December 31, 2019 for all plan participants with less than eleven years of service as of December 31, 2019. For
participants with more than eleven years of service as of December 31, 2019, benefit accruals will be frozen as of
December 31, 2022. Participants will continue to accrue interest at a fixed rate of 6% per year.
We also sponsor postretirement medical and life insurance plans, which are available to most of our retired U.S.
employees. These plans are contributory and are not funded. The measurement date of the assets and liabilities is
the month-end date that is closest to our fiscal year end.
The following tables set forth the plans’ changes in benefit obligations and plan assets, funded status, and amounts
recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets:

The Canadian qualified pension plan’s assets exceeded its accumulated benefit obligation for both 2021 and 2020. In
2021, the U.S. qualified pension plan’s assets exceeded its accumulated benefit obligation. Our non-qualified pension
plans have an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets, as these plans are unfunded. Accordingly, the
table below reflects the U.S. non-qualified plans for 2021 and 2020 and the U.S. qualified plan for 2020.
($ in millions)     2021     2020

2021 Form 10-K Page 69The following table provides the amounts recognized in AOCL on a pre-tax basis:
Pension Postretirement
($ in millions)     Benefits     Benefits
Net actuarial loss (gain) at beginning of year $ 361 $ (2)
Amortization of net loss  (10) —
Gain arising during the year  (31) —
Net actuarial loss (gain) at end of year $ 320 $ (2)
The actuarial gains recognized during 2021 were primarily driven from an increase in discount rates applied against
future expected benefit payments and resulted in a decrease in the benefit obligation for the pension benefit plans.
This was partially offset by lower actual return as compared with the expected return on plan assets.
The following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine the benefit obligations under the plans:
Pension Benefits Postretirement Benefits 
    2021     2020     2021     2020  
Discount rate  3.2%  2.5%  3.2%  2.8%
Rate of compensation increase  3.6%  3.6%       
Pension expense is actuarially calculated annually based on data available at the beginning of each year. The
expected return on plan assets is determined by multiplying the expected long-term rate of return on assets by the
market-related value of plan assets for the U.S. qualified pension plan and market value for the Canadian qualified
pension plan. The market-related value of plan assets is a calculated value that recognizes investment gains and
losses in fair value related to equities over three or five years, depending on which computation results in a market-
related value closer to market value. Market-related value for the U.S. qualified plan was $652 million and
$661 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Assumptions used in the calculation of net benefit cost include the discount rate selected and disclosed at the end of
the previous year, as well as other assumptions detailed in the table below:
Pension Benefits Postretirement Benefits  
    2021    2020    2019    2021    2020    2019 
Discount rate  2.5%  2.9%  4.0%  2.8%  3.0%  4.1%
Rate of compensation increase  3.6%  3.6%  3.6%          
Expected long-term rate of return on
assets  5.3%  5.5%  5.8%          
The expected long-term rate of return on invested plan assets is based on the plans’ weighted-average target asset
allocation, as well as historical and future expected performance of those assets. The target asset allocation is
selected to obtain an investment return that is sufficient to cover the expected benefit payments and to reduce the
variability of our future contributions.
The following are the components of net periodic pension benefit cost and net periodic postretirement benefit income.

2021 Form 10-K Page 70Beginning in 2001, new retirees were charged the expected full cost of the medical plan, and then-existing retirees
will incur 100% of the expected future increases in medical plan costs. Any changes in the health care cost trend
rates assumed would not affect the accumulated benefit obligation or net benefit income, since retirees will incur
100% of such expected future increases.
We maintain a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”), which is an unfunded plan that includes provisions
for the continuation of medical and dental insurance benefits to certain executive officers and other key employees of
the Company (“SERP Medical Plan”). The SERP Medical Plan’s accumulated projected benefit obligation at
January 29, 2022 was $11 million. The following initial and ultimate cost trend rate assumptions were used to
determine the benefit obligations under the SERP Medical Plan:

The mortality assumption used to value the 2021 U.S. pension obligations was the Pri-2012 mortality table with
generational projection using MP-2021 for both males and females, while in the prior year the obligation was valued
using the Pri-2012 mortality table with generational projection using MP-2020. For years ended January 29, 2022 and
January 30, 2021, we used the 2014 CPM Private Sector mortality table projected generationally with Scale CPM-B
for both males and females to value its Canadian pension obligations. For the SERP Medical Plan, the mortality
assumption used to value the 2021 obligation was updated to the PriH-2012 table with generational projection using
MP-2021, while in the prior year the obligation was valued using the PriH-2012 table with generational projection
using MP-2020.
Plan Assets
The target composition of our Canadian qualified pension plan assets is 95% fixed-income securities and 5% equities.
We believe plan assets are invested in a conservative manner with the same overall objective and investment
strategy as noted below for the U.S. pension plan. The bond portfolio is comprised of government and corporate
bonds chosen to match the duration of the pension plan’s benefit payment obligations. This current asset allocation
will limit future volatility with regard to the funded status of the plan.
The target composition of our U.S. qualified pension plan assets is 70% fixed-income securities, 28.5% equities, and
1.5% real estate. We may alter the asset allocation targets from time to time depending on market conditions and the
funding requirements of the pension plan. This current asset allocation has and is expected to limit volatility with
regard to the funded status of the plan, but may result in higher pension expense due to the lower long-term rate of
return associated with fixed-income securities. Due to market conditions and other factors, actual asset allocations
may vary from the target allocation outlined above.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2021 Form 10-K Page 71We believe plan assets are invested in a conservative manner with an objective of providing a total return that, over
the long term, provides sufficient assets to fund benefit obligations, taking into account our expected contributions and
the level of funding risk deemed appropriate. Our investment strategy seeks to diversify assets among classes of
investments with differing rates of return, volatility, and correlation in order to reduce funding risk. Diversification within
asset classes is also utilized to ensure that there are no significant concentrations of risk in plan assets and to reduce
the effect that the return on any single investment may have on the entire portfolio.
Valuation of Investments
Significant portions of plan assets are invested in commingled trust funds. These funds are valued at the net asset
value of units held by the plan at year end. Stocks traded on U.S. and Canadian security exchanges are valued at
closing market prices on the measurement date. The fair values of the Canadian pension plan assets at

Savings Plans
We have two qualified savings plans, a 401(k) plan that is available to employees whose primary place of
employment is the U.S., and another plan that is available to employees whose primary place of employment is in
Puerto Rico. Eligible team members may contribute to the plans following 28 days of employment and are eligible for
matching contributions upon completion of one year of service consisting of at least 1,000 hours. As of
January 1, 2022, the savings plans allow eligible employees to contribute up to 40% of their compensation on a pre-
tax basis, subject to a maximum of $20,500 for the U.S. plan and $15,000 for the Puerto Rico plan. Prior to January 1,
2020, we matched 25% of employees’ pre-tax contributions on up to the first 4% of the employees’ compensation
(subject to certain limitations). Effective January 1, 2020, we match 100% of employees’ pre-tax contributions on up to
the first 1% and 50% of the next 5% of the employees’ compensation (subject to certain limitations). Prior to January
1, 2020, such matching contributions were vested incrementally over the first five years of participation for both plans.
Effective January 1, 2020, matching contributions are vested over two years. The charge to operations for matching
contributions was $14 million, $13 million, and $4 million for 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
With the acquisition of WSS in 2021, we became the sponsor of the 401(k) plan for WSS employees. Eligible team
members may contribute to the plan following three months of employment and are eligible for matching contributions
upon completion of one year of service consisting of at least 1,000 hours. The charge for matching contributions was
an insignificant amount in 2021.
21. Share-Based Compensation
Stock Awards
Under our 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2007 Stock Plan”), stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units,
stock appreciation rights, or other share-based awards may be granted to nonemployee directors, officers and other
employees, including our subsidiaries and operating divisions worldwide. Options for employees become exercisable
in substantially equal annual installments over a three-year period, beginning with the first anniversary of the date of
grant of the option, unless a shorter or longer duration is established at the time of the option grant. The options
terminate ten years from the date of grant. On May 21, 2014, the 2007 Stock Plan was amended to increase the

5,714,498 shares available for issuance under this plan.

2021 Form 10-K Page 73Employees Stock Purchase Plan
Under our 2013 Foot Locker Employees Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), participating employees are able to
contribute up to 10% of their annual compensation, not to exceed $25,000 in any plan year, through payroll
deductions to acquire shares of our common stock at 85% of the lower market price on one of two specified dates in
each plan year. Of the 3,000,000 shares of common stock authorized under this plan, there were 1,974,376 shares
available for purchase as of January 29, 2022. During 2021 and 2020, participating employees purchased 300,788
shares and 104,054 shares, respectively.
Share-Based Compensation Expense
Total compensation expense included in SG&A and the associated tax benefits recognized related to our share-based
compensation plans, were as follows:

Total share-based compensation expense $ 29 $ 15 $ 18
Tax benefit recognized $ 3 $ 2 $ 2
Valuation Model and Assumptions
The Black-Scholes option-pricing model is used to estimate the fair value of share-based awards. The Black-Scholes
option-pricing model incorporates various and subjective assumptions, including expected term and expected
volatility.
We estimate the expected term of share-based awards using our historical exercise and post-vesting employment
termination patterns, which we believe are representative of future behavior. The expected term for the employee
stock purchase plan valuation is based on the length of each purchase period as measured at the beginning of the
offering period, which is one year.
We estimate the expected volatility of our common stock at the grant date using a weighted-average of our historical
volatility and implied volatility from traded options on our common stock. We believe that this combination of historical
volatility and implied volatility provides a better estimate of future stock price volatility.
The risk-free interest rate assumption is determined using the Federal Reserve nominal rates for U.S. Treasury zero-
coupon bonds with maturities similar to those of the expected term of the award being valued. The expected dividend
yield is derived from our historical experience.
The following table shows the assumptions used to compute the share-based compensation expense:

2021 Form 10-K Page 75Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units
Restricted stock units (“RSU”) may be awarded to certain officers, key employees of the Company, and nonemployee
directors. Additionally, performance stock units (“PSU”) are awarded to officers and certain key employees in
connection with our long-term incentive program. Each RSU and PSU represents the right to receive one share of our
common stock provided that the applicable performance and vesting conditions are satisfied.
Generally, RSU awards fully vest after the passage of time, typically three years for employees and one year for
nonemployee directors, provided there is continued service with the Company until the vesting date, subject to the
terms of the award. PSU awards are earned only after the attainment of performance goals in connection with the
relevant performance period and vest after an additional one-year period. No dividends are paid or accumulated on
any RSU or PSU awards.
Compensation expense is recognized using the market value at the date of grant and is amortized over the vesting
period, provided the recipient continues to be employed. RSU and PSU activity is summarized as follows:

The total fair value of awards vested was $23 million, $6 million, and $5 million, for 2021, 2020, and 2019,
respectively. At January 29, 2022, there was $33 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to
nonvested awards.  
22. Shareholder Rights Plan
In 2020, our Board of Directors adopted a shareholder rights plan and declared a dividend distribution of one right for
each outstanding share of common stock to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 18, 2020.
The rights expired in accordance with their terms on December 7, 2021 and the rights plan is no longer effective.
23. Legal Proceedings
Legal proceedings pending against the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries consist of ordinary, routine litigation,
including administrative proceedings, incidental to the business of the Company or businesses that have been sold or
discontinued by the Company in past years. These legal proceedings include commercial, intellectual property,
customer, environmental, and employment-related claims. We do not believe that the outcome of any such legal
proceedings pending against the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries, as described above, would have a
material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, taken as a whole,
based upon current knowledge and taking into consideration current accruals. Litigation is inherently unpredictable.
Judgments could be rendered or settlements made that could adversely affect the Company’s operating results or
cash flows in a particular period.

2021 Form 10-K Page 77Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
There were no disagreements between the Company and its independent registered public accounting firm on
matters of accounting principles or practices.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
(a)Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
The Company’s management performed an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of
the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), of the effectiveness of
the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
Act”)) as of January 29, 2022. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s CEO and CFO concluded that the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information relating to the
Company that is required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms,
and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
(b)Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting (as that term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)). To evaluate the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, the Company uses the framework in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (the “2013 COSO Framework”). Using the 2013 COSO Framework, the Company’s
management, including the CEO and CFO, evaluated the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
and concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
January 29, 2022. KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audits the Company’s
consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, has issued an attestation report on the
Company’s effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, which is included in Item 9A(d).
(c)Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
During 2021, we closed on the acquisitions of WSS and atmos and we excluded both of these businesses
from the scope of management’s report on internal control over financial reporting and will include them in
scope, if necessary, for the year ending January 28, 2023. This process may result in additions or changes to
our internal control over financial reporting.
There were no other changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth
fiscal quarter of 2021 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting.
(d)Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting- the
report appears on the following page.
2021 Form 10-K Page 78REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
Foot Locker , Inc.:
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Foot Locker , Inc. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of
January 29, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control  over financial reporting as of January 29, 2022, based on criteria estab lished in Internal Control –
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the T readway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021, the related
consolidated statements  of operations, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity , and cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended Janua ry 29, 2022, and the related notes (collectively , the consolidated financial
statements), and our report dated March 24, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
statements.
The Company acquired WSS and atmos during 2021, and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness
of the Company’ s intern al control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2022, WSS and atmos’ internal control over
financial reporting associated with approximately 6.4% of total consolidated assets, excluding goodwill and intangibles
assets, which are included within the scope of the assessment, and approximately 2.7% of total consolidated revenues
included in the consolida ted financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended January 29, 2022. Our audit
of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial
reporting of WSS and atmos .
Basis for Opinion
The Compa ny’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’ s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’ s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm regis tered with the PCAOB and
are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards requir e that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in
all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides  a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’ s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’ s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use, or disposition of the company’ s assets that could have a material ef fect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that contro ls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Exhibit 4.1
 
DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT’S SECURITIES
REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES
EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
 
The following description of the common stock of Foot Locker, Inc. (“Foot Locker,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and
“our”) is based on our Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (our “Certificate of Incorporation”) and our Bylaws
(our “Bylaws”). This description is summarized from, and qualified in its entirety by reference to the New York
Business Corporation Law and the complete text of our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws, which are
filed as Exhibits 3.1 and 3.2, respectively, to our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK
Authorized Shares of Capital Stock
Our authorized capital stock consists of:
·      500,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share; and
·      7,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $1.00 par value per share.
Voting Rights
The holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by such shareholder which
has voting power upon the matter in question, including the election of directors. Except as otherwise provided by
law, our Certificate of Incorporation or our Bylaws, matters will generally be decided by the holders of a majority of
shares entitled to vote thereon. Our Bylaws provide that directors must be elected by a majority of the votes cast
in elections for which the number of nominees for election does not exceed the number of directors to be elected.
A plurality vote standard applies to contested elections where the number of nominees exceeds the number of
directors to be elected. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that any incumbent director who does not
receive a majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election is required to tender his or her resignation for
consideration by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board of Directors (“Board”) whether to accept or
reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The director who tenders his or her resignation
will not participate in the Committee’s or the Board’s decision. In determining its recommendation to the Board,
the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider all factors that it deems relevant. Following
such determination, the Company will promptly disclose publicly the Board’s decision, including, if applicable, the
reasons for rejecting the tendered resignation.
Dividends
Subject to preferences that may apply to any preferred stock outstanding, holders of common stock are entitled to
receive dividends out of assets legally available at the time and in the amounts that the Board may determine
from time to time.
Liquidation Rights
In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Foot Locker, the holders of common stock are entitled to
share equally and ratably in the assets of Foot Locker, if any, remaining after the payment of all debts and
liabilities of Foot Locker and the liquidation preference of any outstanding preferred stock.
Other Rights and Preferences
Our common stock has no sinking fund, redemption provisions, or preemptive, conversion, or exchange rights.
Listing
Our common stock is listed on The New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol “FL.”
Transfer Agent and Registrar
The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Computershare Shareholder Services.
ANTI-TAKEOVER EFFECTS OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS
OF OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS
Certain Effects of Authorized but Unissued Stock
Our Board may create and issue series of preferred stock with rights, privileges or restrictions, having the effect of
discriminating against an existing or prospective holder of such securities as a result of such security holder
beneficially owning or commencing a tender offer for a substantial amount of common stock.  One of the effects
of authorized but unissued and unreserved shares of capital stock may be to render more difficult or discourage
an attempt by a potential acquiror to obtain control of Foot Locker by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy
contest or otherwise, and thereby protect the continuity of Foot Locker’s management.
Advance Notice for Shareholder Proposals and Nominations
Our Bylaws contain advance notice provisions with respect to shareholder nominations of candidates for election
as directors and any other business that the shareholder intends to bring at a meeting of shareholders.
No Cumulative Voting
Our Bylaws do not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors. The absence of cumulative voting
may make it more difficult for shareholders owning less than a majority of our common stock to elect any directors
to our Board.
Power of Shareholders to Call Special Shareholders Meeting
Our Bylaws provide that special meetings of shareholders may be called only by the Chairman of our Board, the
Chief Executive Officer, a Vice Chairman of the Board, the President or our Board pursuant to a resolution
adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors.
Anti-Greenmail Provision
Our Certificate of Incorporation includes an “anti-greenmail” provision that prohibits us from repurchasing any
shares of our capital stock at a price above the fair market value of such shares at the time of such repurchase
from an Interested Shareholder (defined as any person, with certain exceptions, who is, or who has announced or
publicly disclosed a plan or intention to become, a beneficial owner of five percent or more of our voting stock) or
certain related parties who have not beneficially owned all of their shares for at least two years, unless such
repurchase is approved by a majority vote of shareholders other than such Interested Shareholder and related
parties.

UNDER THE FOOT LOCKER 2007 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN
Stock Option Grant
The Human Capital and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Foot Locker, Inc. (the “Company”),
a New York corporation, granted you a Nonstatutory Stock Option (the “Option”) on __________ under the Foot
Locker 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock, as set forth
below.  Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, the Option will become exercisable in annual installments over
a __________-year vesting period according to the vesting schedule specified below:  
Name of Participant: __________
Date of Grant: __________
Exercise Price Per Share: $_________
Number of Shares of Stock: __________
Vesting Schedule: __________
Expiration Date: __________
The Option will expire on the Expiration Date, unless, prior to that time, the Option is exercised in full, is
cancelled, or expires due to your death, retirement, or other termination of employment, as provided under the
terms of this Nonstatutory Stock Option Award Agreement (“Award Agreement”) and the Plan.  
The Option is subject to the terms of the Plan, the Prospectus covering the Plan, dated March 31, 2017, any
subsequently issued Prospectus or Appendix covering the Plan, and the terms and conditions set forth in this
Award Agreement.  All of these documents are incorporated herein by this reference and made a part of the
Option.
2[Non-Competition
By accepting this Option, you agree that during the “Non-Competition Period” you will not engage in
“Competition” with the Company or any of its subsidiaries, divisions, or affiliates (the “Control Group”).
As used herein, “Competition” means:
(i) participating, directly or indirectly, as an individual proprietor, stockholder, officer, employee,
director, joint venturer, investor, lender, consultant, or in any capacity whatsoever (within the United States of
America, or in any country where your former employing members of the Control Group does business) in (A) a
business in competition with the retail, catalog, or on-line sale of athletic footwear, athletic apparel, and sporting
goods conducted by the Control Group (the “Athletic Business”) or (B) a business that in the prior fiscal year
supplied product to the Control Group for the Athletic Business having a value of $20 million or more at cost to
the Control Group; provided, however, that such participation shall not include (X) the mere ownership of not
more than 1 percent of the total outstanding stock of a publicly held company; (Y) the performance of services for
any enterprise to the extent such services are not performed, directly or indirectly, for a business in competition
with the Athletic Business or for a business which supplies product to the Control Group for the Athletic Business;
or (Z) any activity engaged in with the prior written approval of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company; and
(ii) intentionally recruiting, soliciting or inducing, any employee or employees of the Control Group
to terminate their employment with, or otherwise cease their relationship with the former employing members of
the Control Group where such employee or employees do in fact so terminate their employment.
As used herein, “Non-Competition” Period means:  the period commencing on the Date of Grant and ending on
the Vesting Date, or any part thereof, during which the Executive is employed by the Control Group and (ii) if the
Executive's employment with the Control Group terminates for any reason during such period, the __________-
year period commencing on the date his employment with the Control Group terminates.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Non-Competition Period shall not extend beyond the date the Executive’s employment with the
Control Group terminates if such termination of employment occurs following a “Change in Control” as defined in
Attachment A hereto.  
You agree that the breach by you of the provisions included herein under the heading “Non-Competition” (the
“Non-Competition Provision”) would result in irreparable injury and damage to the Company for which the
Company would have no adequate remedy at law.  You therefore agree that in the event of a breach or a
threatened breach of the Non-Competition Provision, the Company shall be entitled to (i) an immediate injunction
and restraining order to prevent such breach, threatened breach, or continued breach, including by any and all
persons acting for or with you, without having to prove damages and (ii) any other remedies to which the
Company may be entitled at law or in equity.  The terms of this paragraph shall not prevent the Company from
pursuing any other available remedies for any breach or threatened breach of the Non-Competition Provision,
including, but not limited to, recovery of damages.  
In addition, in the event of your breach of the Non-Competition Provision, any Options that are then unexercised
(whether or not vested) shall be immediately cancelled.
3You and the Company further agree that the Non-Competition Provision is reasonable and that the Company
would not have granted the Options but for the inclusion of the Non-Competition Provision herein.  If any
provision of the Non-Competition Provision is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable
because it extends for too long a period of time or over too great a range of activities or in too broad a geographic
area, it shall be interpreted to extend over the maximum period of time, range of activities, or geographic area as
to which it may be enforceable.  The validity, construction, and performance of the Non-Competition Provision
shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflicts of laws principles.  
For purposes of the Non-Competition Provision, you and the Company consent to the jurisdiction of state and
federal courts in New York County.]

Exhibit 10.9
 
RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT
UNDER THE FOOT LOCKER 2007 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN
This Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement (this "Agreement") is made under the Foot Locker 2007
Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the "Plan"), as of __________, by and between Foot Locker,
Inc., a New York corporation with its principal office located at 330 West 34th Street, New York, New York 10001
(the "Company"), and __________ (the "Executive").  
1. Grant of RSUs.  On __________ (the "Date of Grant"), the Human Capital and Compensation
Committee (the “Human Capital Committee”) of the Board of Directors of the Company granted the Executive an
award of __________ restricted stock units ("RSUs") under the Plan, subject to the terms of the Plan and the
restrictions set forth in this Agreement.  The RSUs granted to the Executive are considered "Other Stock-Based
Awards" under the Plan.  Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of the Company's Common Stock,
par value $.01 per share ("Common Stock"), upon the satisfaction of the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement and the Plan.
2. Vesting and Delivery
(a) The RSUs shall become vested on __________ (the "Vesting Date") and, subject to the terms of
this Agreement and the Plan, __________ shares of Common Stock shall be delivered to the Executive as
described herein if the Executive has been continuously employed by the Company or its subsidiaries within the
meaning of Section 424 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Control Group") from the Date
of Grant until the Vesting Date.  
(b) Other than as may be specifically provided for herein, there shall be no proportionate or partial
vesting in the periods prior to the Vesting Date and all vesting shall occur only on the Vesting Date, subject to the
Executive's continued employment with the Control Group as described in Section 2(a).
(c) In the event of Executive’s termination of employment prior to the Vesting Date by reason of
death, Disability, or Retirement, Executive (or in the event of his death, his estate) shall receive a pro rata portion
of his RSU award.  The pro rata portion shall be determined by multiplying the number of RSUs awarded by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days from the Date of Grant to the date of Executive’s
termination of employment and the denominator of which is the number of days from the Date of Grant to the
Vesting Date.  
(d) If the Company terminates Executive’s employment without Cause or Executive terminates his
employment for Good Reason upon, or within twenty-four (24) months following, a Change in Control as defined
in Appendix A hereto (“Section 2(d) Termination”), the RSUs shall become immediately vested.
2(e) In the event the Executive ceases to be employed by the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate
of the Company as a result of the closing, sale, spin-off or other divestiture of any operation of the Company, the
Human Capital Committee, in its sole discretion, may, but shall not be obligated to, fully vest and not forfeit all or
any portion of the Executive's RSU award.  
(f) Subject to Sections 7 and 11.12, when any RSUs become vested, the Company shall promptly
issue and deliver to the Executive shares of the Company's Common Stock, net of shares withheld by the
Company to cover applicable withholding taxes, within 30 days following the earlier of (i) a termination of
employment by reason of death, Disability, or a Section 2(d) Termination or (ii) the Vesting Date.  For the
avoidance of doubt, payment of RSUs that are vested in connection with the Executive’s Retirement as provided
under Section 2(c) shall be made within 30 days following the Vesting Date.  
3. Forfeiture.  Other than as specifically provided for herein, in the event of the Executive's
termination of employment for any reason, including without limitation, resignation, termination with or without
Cause, or the Executive's breach of the non-competition provision in Section 9, the Executive shall forfeit to the
Company, without compensation, all unvested RSUs.  The Human Capital Committee, or a sub-committee
thereof, may, in its sole discretion, at any time fully vest and not forfeit all or any portion of the Executive's RSUs.
4. Adjustments.  RSUs shall be subject to the adjustment provisions included in Section 5(e) of the
Plan.  In the event of any such adjustment, the adjusted award shall be subject to the same vesting schedule as
the RSUs, as set forth in Section 2.
5. Withholding.  The Executive agrees that:
(a) The Company shall have the right to withhold the number of shares of stock from the
award sufficient to satisfy any federal, state, international, or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld
with respect to the vesting of any RSUs which shall have become so vested, as calculated by the Company.
(b) The Company shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct from any
payment of any kind otherwise due to the Executive any federal, state, international or local taxes of any kind
required by law to be withheld with respect to any RSUs which shall have become so vested.  
6. Special Incentive Compensation.  The Executive agrees that the award of the RSUs is special
incentive compensation and that the RSUs will not be taken into account as "salary" or "compensation" or "bonus"
in determining the amount of any payment under any pension, retirement or profit-sharing plan of the Company or
any life insurance, disability or other benefit plan of the Company, except as specifically provided in any such
plan.
7. Delivery Delay.  Notwithstanding anything herein, the delivery of any shares of Common Stock
for vested RSUs may be postponed by the Company for such period as may be required for it to comply with any
applicable federal or state securities law, or any national securities exchange listing requirements and the
Company is not obligated to issue or deliver any securities if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, the
issuance of such shares shall constitute a violation by the Executive or the Company of any provisions of any law
or of any regulations of any governmental authority or any national securities exchange.
38. Restriction on Transfer of RSUs.  The Executive shall not sell, negotiate, transfer, pledge,
hypothecate, assign, or otherwise dispose of the RSUs.  Any attempted sale, negotiation, transfer, pledge,
hypothecation, assignment or other disposition of the RSUs in violation of the Plan or this Agreement shall be null
and void.
[9. Non-Competition.
9.1 Competition.  By accepting this award of RSUs, as provided below, the Executive
agrees that during the "Non-Competition Period" he will not engage in "Competition" with the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, divisions, or affiliates (the "Control Group").  As used herein, "Competition" means:
(a) participating, directly or indirectly, as an individual proprietor, stockholder,
officer, employee, director, joint venturer, investor, lender, or in any capacity whatsoever within __________ or in
any other country where any of the Executive's former employing members of the Control Group does business in
(A) a business in competition with the retail, catalog, or on-line sale of athletic footwear, athletic apparel and
sporting goods conducted by the Control Group (the "Athletic Business"), or (B) a business that in the prior fiscal
year supplied product to the Control Group for the Athletic Business having a value of $20 million or more at cost
to the Control Group; provided, however, that such participation shall not include (X) the mere ownership of not
more than 1 percent of the total outstanding stock of a publicly held company; (Y) the performance of services for
any enterprise to the extent such services are not performed, directly or indirectly, for a business in competition
with the Athletic Business or for a business which supplies product to the Control Group for the Athletic Business;
or (Z) any activity engaged in with the prior written approval of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company; or
(b) intentionally recruiting, soliciting, or inducing, any employee or employees of
the Control Group to terminate their employment with, or otherwise cease their relationship with the former
employing members of the Control Group where such employee or employees do in fact so terminate their
employment.
9.2 "Non-Competition Period."  As used herein, "Non-Competition" Period means:  the
period commencing on the Date of Grant and ending on the Vesting Date, or any part thereof, during which the
Executive is employed by the Control Group, and (ii) if the Executive's employment with the Control Group
terminates for any reason during such period, the __________-year period commencing on the date his
employment with the Control Group terminates.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Non-Competition Period shall
not extend beyond the date the Executive's employment with the Control Group terminates if such termination of
employment occurs following a "Change in Control" as defined in Attachment A hereto.
9.3 Breach of Non-Competition Provision.  The Executive agrees that the breach by him of
the provisions included herein under Section 9 under the heading "Non-Competition" (the "Non-Competition
Provision") would result in irreparable injury and damage to the Company for which the Company would have no
adequate remedy at law.  The Executive therefore agrees that in the event of a breach or a threatened breach of
the Non-Competition Provision, the Company shall be entitled to (i) an immediate injunction and restraining order
to prevent such breach, threatened breach, or continued breach, including by any and all persons acting for or
with him, without having to prove damages and (ii) any other remedies to which the Company may be entitled at
law or in equity.  The terms of this paragraph shall not prevent the Company from pursuing any other available
remedies for any breach or threatened breach of the Non-Competition Provision, including, but not limited to,
4recovery of damages.  In addition, in the event of the Executive's breach of the Non-Competition Provision, the
RSUs covered by this Agreement that are then unvested shall be immediately forfeited.  The Executive and the
Company further agree that the Non-Competition Provision is reasonable and that the Company would not have
granted the award of RSUs provided for in this Agreement but for the inclusion of the Non-Competition Provision
herein.  If any provision of the Non-Competition Provision is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be
unenforceable because it extends for too long a period of time or over too great a range of activities or in too
broad a geographic area, it shall be interpreted to extend over the maximum period of time, range of activities, or
geographic area as to which it may be enforceable.  The validity, construction, and performance of the Non-
Competition Provision shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflicts of
laws principles.  For purposes of the Non-Competition Provision, the Executive and the Company consent to the
jurisdiction of state and federal courts in New York County.]
10. Not an Employment Agreement.  
The award of RSUs hereunder does not constitute an agreement by the Company to continue to employ
the Executive during the entire, or any portion of the, term of this Agreement, including but not limited to any
period during which the RSUs are outstanding.
11. Miscellaneous.
11.1 In no event shall any dividend equivalents accrue or be paid on any RSUs.
11.2 This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon all parties hereto and
their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors, and assigns.
11.3 This Agreement shall be subject to any compensation recoupment policy that the
Company may adopt.
11.4 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and cannot be
changed or terminated orally.  No modification or waiver of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless in
writing and signed by the party against whom it is sought to be enforced.
11.5 This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which taken
together shall constitute one contract.
11.6 The failure of any party hereto at any time to require performance by another party of
any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the right of such party to require performance of that provision,
and any waiver by any party of any breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver
of any continuing or succeeding breach of such provision, a waiver of the provision itself, or a waiver of any right
under this Agreement.
11.7 This Agreement is subject, in all respects, to the provisions of the Plan, and to the
extent any provision of this Agreement contravenes or is inconsistent with any provision of the Plan, the
provisions of the Plan shall govern.
511.8 The headings of the sections of this Agreement have been inserted for convenience of
reference only and shall in no way restrict or modify any of the terms or provisions hereof.

of Common Stock.  You shall earn the number of PSUs set forth above for achievement at the maximum
performance goal as specified in Appendix A attached hereto, subject to adjustment for achievement below the
maximum performance goal in accordance with the provisions of Appendix A attached hereto.  If the threshold
performance level set forth in Appendix A is not achieved, none of the PSUs granted to you shall be earned.  The
Human Capital Committee shall certify the level of achievement of the performance goals during the Company’s

__________ (the “Vesting Date”).  Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Plan, shares of Common Stock
equal to the number of PSUs you earn shall be delivered to you as described below if you have been
continuously employed by the Company or its subsidiaries within the meaning of Section 424 of the Code (the
“Control Group”) from the Date of Grant until the Vesting Date.  
(b) Other than as specifically provided herein, there shall be no proportionate or partial

the achievement of the performance goal, you shall be entitled to receive a pro rata portion of the PSUs that you
would have been entitled to receive based on the actual performance level achieved for any completed year in
the Performance Period and the achievement of a target performance level for the remainder of the Performance
Period, as set forth in Appendix A,  such PSUs shall become immediately vested upon your Termination and shall
be paid in accordance with Section 3(f).  The pro rated portion shall be determined by multiplying the number of
PSUs you would have been entitled to receive if you had not incurred such Termination by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days from __________ to the earlier of your date of Termination or the last
day of the Performance Period and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the Performance
Period.

numerator of which is the number of days from __________ to the date of your Termination and the denominator
of which is the total number of days in the Performance Period, and shall vest on the Vesting Date and shall be

Committee’s certification of the goals for the Performance Period.  
(b) Except as expressly set forth in Section 3(e), in the event of your Termination prior to
the Vesting Date or your breach of the Non-Competition Provision in Section 10, all unvested PSUs shall be
forfeited to the Company, without compensation.
5. Adjustments.  PSUs shall be subject to the adjustment provisions included in Section 5(e) of the
Plan.  In the event of any such adjustment, the adjusted award shall be subject to the same vesting schedule as
the PSUs, as set forth in Section 3.
6. Withholding.  You agree that:
(a) The Company shall have the right to withhold the number of shares of stock from the

with respect to the vesting of any PSUs which shall have become so vested, as calculated by the Company; and
3(b) The Company shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct from any
payment of any kind otherwise due to you any federal, state, foreign, or local taxes of any kind required by law to
be withheld with respect to any PSUs which shall have become so vested.  
7. Special Incentive Compensation.  You agree that the award of the PSUs is special incentive

determining the amount of any payment under any pension, retirement, or profit-sharing plan of the Company or
any life insurance, disability, or other benefit plan of the Company, except as specifically provided in any such
plan.
8. Delivery Delay.  Notwithstanding anything herein, the delivery of any shares of Common Stock
for vested PSUs may be postponed by the Company for such period as may be required for it to comply with any
applicable federal or state securities law, or any national securities exchange listing requirements and the
Company is not obligated to issue or deliver any securities if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, the
issuance of such shares shall constitute a violation by you or the Company of any provisions of any law or of any
regulations of any governmental authority or any national securities exchange.
9. Restriction on Transfer of PSUs.  You shall not sell, negotiate, transfer, pledge, hypothecate,
assign, or otherwise dispose of the PSUs.  Any attempted sale, negotiation, transfer, pledge, hypothecation,

null and void.
10. [Non-Competition.
(a) Competition.  By accepting this award of PSUs, as provided below, you agree that
during the “Non-Competition Period” you will not engage in “Competition” with the Control Group.  As used herein,
“Competition” means:
(i) participating, directly or indirectly, as an individual proprietor, stockholder,
officer, employee, director, joint venturer, investor, lender, or in any capacity whatsoever within the United States
of America or in any other country where any of your former employing members of the Control Group does
business, in (A) a business in competition with the retail, catalog, or on-line sale of athletic footwear, athletic
apparel and sporting goods conducted by the Control Group (the “Athletic Business”), or (B) a business that in the
prior fiscal year supplied product to the Control Group for the Athletic Business having a value of $20 million or
more at cost to the Control Group; provided, however, that such participation shall not include (X) the mere
ownership of not more than 1 percent of the total outstanding stock of a publicly held company; (Y) the
performance of services for any enterprise to the extent such services are not performed, directly or indirectly, for
a business in competition with the Athletic Business or for a business which supplies product to the Control Group

Officer of the Company; or
(ii) intentionally recruiting, soliciting or inducing, any employee or employees of the
Control Group to terminate their employment with, or otherwise cease their relationship with the former employing
members of the Control Group where such employee or employees do in fact so terminate their employment.

terminates.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Non-Competition Period shall not extend beyond the date your
employment with the Control Group terminates if such termination of employment occurs following a “Change in
Control” as defined in Attachment B hereto.
4(c) Breach of Non-Competition Provision.  You agree that your breach of the provisions
included herein under Section 10 under the heading “Non-Competition” (the “Non-Competition Provision”) would
result in irreparable injury and damage to the Company for which the Company would have no adequate remedy
at law.  You agree, therefore, that in the event of a breach or a threatened breach of the Non-Competition
Provision, the Company shall be entitled to (i) an immediate injunction and restraining order to prevent such
breach, threatened breach, or continued breach, including by any and all persons acting for or with you, without
having to prove damages, and (ii) any other remedies to which the Company may be entitled at law or in equity.
 The terms of this paragraph shall not prevent the Company from pursuing any other available remedies for any
breach or threatened breach of the Non-Competition Provision, including, but not limited to, recovery of damages.
 In addition, in the event of your breach of the Non-Competition Provision, the PSUs covered by this Agreement
that are then unvested shall be immediately forfeited.  You and the Company further agree that the Non-
Competition Provision is reasonable and that the Company would not have granted the award of PSUs provided
for in this Agreement but for the inclusion of the Non-Competition Provision herein.  If any provision of the Non-
Competition Provision is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because it extends for
too long a period of time or over too great a range of activities or in too broad a geographic area, it shall be
interpreted to extend over the maximum period of time, range of activities, or geographic area as to which it may
be enforceable.  The validity, construction, and performance of the Non-Competition Provision shall be governed
by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflicts of laws principles.  For purposes of the Non-
Competition Provision, you and the Company consent to the jurisdiction of state and federal courts in New York
County, New York.]
11. Not an Employment Agreement.  
The award of PSUs hereunder does not constitute an agreement by the Company to continue to employ
you during the entire, or any portion of the term of this Agreement, including but not limited to any period during
which the PSUs are outstanding.

their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors, and assigns.
(c) This Agreement shall be subject to any compensation recoupment policy that the
Company may adopt.

changed or terminated orally.  No modification or waiver of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless in
writing and signed by the party against whom it is sought to be enforced.
(e) This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which taken
together shall constitute one contract.
(f) The failure of any party hereto at any time to require performance by another party of
any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the right of such party to require performance of that provision,
and any waiver by any party of any breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver
of any continuing or succeeding breach of such provision, a waiver of the provision itself, or a waiver of any right
under this Agreement.
(g) This Agreement is subject, in all respects, to the provisions of the Plan, and to the
extent any provision of this Agreement contravenes or is inconsistent with any provision of the Plan, the
provisions of the Plan shall govern.
