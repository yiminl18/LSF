For more information about the significant risks that could affect the outcome of the forward-looking statements and PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s future
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Form 10-Q and the 2021 Form 10-K and a detailed discussion
of these matters contained in Item 2. MD&A in the 2021 Form 10-K and this Form 10-Q. PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not undertake any obligation to
update forward-looking statements, whether in response to new information, future events, or otherwise.
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and proxy statements, are
available free of charge on both PG&E Corporation’s website, www.pgecorp.com, and the Utility's website, www.pge.com, as promptly as practicable after they are
filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. Additionally, PG&E Corporation and the Utility routinely provide links to the Utility’s principal regulatory proceedings before
the CPUC and the FERC at http://investor.pgecorp.com, under the “Regulatory Filings” tab, so that such filings are available to investors upon filing with the
relevant agency. PG&E Corporation and the Utility also routinely post or provide direct links to presentations, documents, and other information that may be of
interest to investors , including regarding dividends, at http://investor.pgecorp.com, under the “Chapter 11,” “Wildfire and Safety Updates,” “News & Events:
Events & Presentations,” and “Shareholders: Dividend Information” tabs, respectively, in order to publicly disseminate such information. Specifically, within two
hours during business hours or four hours outside of business hours of the determination that an incident is attributable or allegedly attributable to the Utility’s
electric facilities and has resulted in property damage estimated to exceed $50,000, a fatality or injury requiring overnight in-patient hospitalization, or significant
public or media attention, the Utility is required to submit an electric incident report including information about such incident. The information included in an
electric incident report is limited and may not include important information about the facts and circumstances about the incident due to the limited scope of the
reporting requirements and timing of the report and is necessarily limited to information to which the Utility has access at the time of the report. Ignitions are also
reportable under CPUC Decision 14-02-015 when they involve self-propagating fire of material other than electrical or communication facilities; the fire traveled
greater than one linear meter from the ignition point; and the Utility has knowledge that the fire occurred. It is possible that any of these filings or information
included therein could be deemed to be material information. The information contained on such website is not part of this or any other report that PG&E
Corporation or the Utility files with, or furnishes to, the SEC. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are providing the address to this website solely for the information
of investors and do not intend the address to be an active link.

PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION
ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
OVERVIEW
This is a combined quarterly report of PG&E Corporation and the Utility and should be read in conjunction with each company’s Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements and the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1. It should also be read in conjunction with the 2021
Form 10-K.
Key Factors Affecting Financial Results
PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe that their financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows may be materially affected by the following
factors:
•The Uncertainties in Connection with Any Future Wildfires, Wildfire Insurance, and AB 1054. While PG&E Corporation and the Utility cannot predict the
occurrence, timing or extent of damages in connection with future wildfires, factors such as environmental conditions (including weather and vegetation
conditions) and the efficacy of wildfire risk mitigation initiatives and third-party suppression efforts are expected to influence the frequency and severity
of future wildfires. To the extent that future wildfires occur in the Utility’s service territory, the Utility may incur costs associated with the investigations of
the causes and origins of such fires, even if it is subsequently determined that such fires were not caused by the Utility’s facilities. The financial impact of
future wildfires could be mitigated through insurance, the Wildfire Fund, or other forms of cost recovery. However, the Utility may not be able to obtain
sufficient wildfire insurance coverage at a reasonable cost, or at all, and any such coverage may include limitations that could result in substantial
uninsured losses depending on the amount and type of damages resulting from covered events, including coverage limitations applicable to different
insurance layers. The Utility will not be able to obtain any recovery from the Wildfire Fund for wildfire-related losses in any Wildfire Fund coverage year
(“Coverage Year”) that do not exceed the greater of $1.0 billion in the aggregate and the amount of insurance coverage required under AB 1054. In
addition, the policy reforms contemplated by AB 1054 are likely to affect the financial impact of future wildfires on PG&E Corporation and the Utility
should any such wildfires occur. The Wildfire Fund is available to the Utility to pay eligible claims for liabilities arising from wildfires and serves as an
alternative to traditional insurance products, provided that the Utility satisfies the conditions to the Utility’s ongoing participation in the Wildfire Fund set
forth in AB 1054 and that the Wildfire Fund has sufficient remaining funds. See “Loss Recoveries” in Note 11 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 1.
However, the impact of AB 1054 on PG&E Corporation and the Utility is subject to numerous uncertainties, including the Utility’s ability to demonstrate
to the CPUC that wildfire-related costs paid from the Wildfire Fund were just and reasonable and therefore not subject to reimbursement, and whether the
benefits of participating in the Wildfire Fund ultimately outweigh its substantial costs. Finally, even if the Utility satisfies the ongoing eligibility and other
requirements set forth in AB 1054, for eligible claims against the Utility arising from wildfires that occurred between July 12, 2019 and the Utility’s
emergence from Chapter 11 on July 1, 2020, the availability of the Wildfire Fund to pay such claims would be capped at 40% of the allowed amount of
such claims. See “Wildfire Fund under AB 1054” in Note 11 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1.
•The Costs, Effectiveness, and Execution of the Utility’s Wildfire Mitigation Initiatives. In response to the wildfire threat facing California, PG&E
Corporation and the Utility have taken aggressive steps to mitigate the threat of catastrophic wildfires, the spread of wildfires should they occur, and the
impact of PSPS events.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have incurred substantial expenditures in connection with the 2020-2022 WMP. For more information, see Note 4 of the
Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. The Utility expects that its wildfire mitigation initiatives will continue to involve
substantial and ongoing expenditures. The extent to which the Utility will be able to recover these expenditures and potential other costs through rates is
uncertain.
11
The Utility has implemented operational changes and investments that reduce wildfire risk, including the EPSS, PSPS, vegetation management, asset
inspection, and system hardening programs. These programs, particularly the PSPS and EPSS programs, have been the subject of scrutiny and criticism by
various stakeholders, including the California governor, the CPUC, and the court that oversaw the Utility’s probation. The PSPS and EPSS programs have
had an adverse impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s reputation with customers, regulators, and policymakers, and future PSPS and EPSS
events may increase these negative perceptions.
The Utility is subject to a number of legal and regulatory requirements related to its wildfire mitigation efforts, which require periodic inspections of
electric assets and ongoing reporting related to this work. Although the Utility believes that it has complied substantially with these requirements, it is
undertaking a review and has identified instances of noncompliance. The Utility intends to update the CPUC and OEIS as its review progresses. The
Utility could face fines, penalties, enforcement action, or other adverse legal or regulatory consequences for the late inspections or other noncompliance
related to wildfire mitigation efforts. See “Self-Reports to the CPUC” in “Regulatory Matters” below.
While PG&E Corporation and the Utility are committed to taking aggressive wildfire mitigation actions, if additional requirements are imposed that go
beyond current expectations, such requirements could have a substantial impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of
operations, liquidity, and cash flows. The success of the Utility’s wildfire mitigation efforts depends on many factors, including on whether the Utility is
able to retain or contract for the workforce necessary to execute its wildfire mitigation actions.
•The Timing and Outcome of Ratemaking and Other Proceedings. The Utility’s financial results may be impacted by the timing and outcome of its FERC
TO18 rate case and the resulting impact on the TO19 and TO20 rate cases, 2023 GRC, 2020 and 2021 WMCE, and cost of capital applications and its
ability to timely recover costs not currently in rates, including costs already incurred and future costs tracked in its CEMA, WEMA, WMPMA, FRMMA,
CPPMA, VMBA, WMBA, and RTBA. The Utility’s financial results may be impacted by the timing and outcome of its application to transfer its non-
nuclear generation assets to Pacific Generation and the potential sale of a minority interest in Pacific Generation. The outcome of regulatory proceedings
can be affected by many factors, including intervening parties’ testimonies, potential rate impacts, the regulatory and political environments, and other
factors. See Notes 4 and 12 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 and “Regulatory Matters” below.
•The Impact of Wildfires. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s liabilities for the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, and the 2022
Mosquito fire are significant and may be excluded from any potential amounts recoverable under applicable insurance policies, the WEMA, FERC TO
rates, or the Wildfire Fund under AB 1054. Recorded liabilities in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire and the 2021 Dixie fire have already exceeded
potential amounts recoverable under applicable insurance policies. Liabilities in excess of recoverable amounts for these wildfires could have a material
impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.
As of September 30, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility had recorded an aggregate liability of $950 million, $375 million, $1.15 billion, and
$100 million for claims in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, and the 2022 Mosquito fire, respectively, and in
each case before available insurance, and, in the case of the 2021 Dixie fire and the 2022 Mosquito fire, other probable cost recoveries. These liability
amounts correspond to the lower end of the range of reasonably estimable probable losses, but do not include all categories of potential damages and
losses. Claims related to the 2019 Kincade fire that were not satisfied in full as of the Emergence Date were not discharged in connection with emerging
from Chapter 11.
On September 24, 2021, the Shasta County District Attorney’s Office charged the Utility with 11 felonies and 20 misdemeanors in connection with the
2020 Zogg fire and three other fires in Shasta County, California. If the Utility were to be convicted of certain charges in the Zogg Complaint, the Utility
could be subject to material fines, penalties, and restitution, as well as non-monetary remedies such as oversight requirements, and accordingly the Utility
currently believes that, depending on which charges it were to be convicted of, its total losses associated with the 2020 Zogg fire would materially exceed
the $375 million of aggregate liability that PG&E Corporation and the Utility have recorded.
12
If the eligible claims for liabilities arising from wildfires were to exceed $1.0 billion in any Coverage Year, the Utility may be eligible to make a claim
against the Wildfire Fund under AB 1054 for such excess amount, except that recoveries for the 2019 Kincade fire would be subject to the 40% limitation
on the allowed amount of claims arising before emergence from bankruptcy, and recoveries for each of these fires would also be subject to the other
limitations and requirements under AB 1054. As of September 30, 2022, the Utility has recorded insurance receivables of $430 million for the 2019
Kincade fire, $347 million for the 2020 Zogg fire, $553 million for the 2021 Dixie fire, and $40 million for the 2022 Mosquito fire. As of September 30,
2022, the Utility has recorded regulatory recovery and Wildfire Fund receivables of $473 million and $150 million, respectively, for the 2021 Dixie fire.
As of September 30, 2022, the Utility has recorded regulatory recovery of $60 million for the 2022 Mosquito fire. The Utility’s recorded receivables for
regulatory recovery and with respect to the Wildfire Fund take into account the revised prudency standard and the presumption of reasonableness of the
Utility’s conduct under AB 1054. The revised prudency standard under AB 1054 has not been interpreted or applied by the CPUC and it is possible that the
CPUC could interpret the standard or apply it to the relevant facts differently from how the Utility has interpreted and applied the standard, in which case
the Utility may not be able to recover all or a portion of expenses that it has recorded as receivable. There can be no assurance that such amounts will
ultimately be recovered, and the Utility does not expect that any of its liability insurance would cover restitution payments, if such payments were ordered
by the court presiding over the criminal proceeding in connection with the 2020 Zogg fire. See “2019 Kincade Fire,” “2020 Zogg Fire,” “2021 Dixie Fire,”
and “2022 Mosquito Fire” in Note 11 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 for more information.
•The Outcome of Other Enforcement, Litigation, and Regulatory Matters, and Other Government Proposals. The Utility’s financial results may continue to
be impacted by the outcome of other current and future enforcement, litigation, and regulatory matters, including those described above as well as the
outcome of the Safety Culture OII, and potential penalties in connection with the Utility’s WMP and safety and other self-reports. See Note 14 of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of the 2021 Form 10-K. In addition, the Utility’s business profile and financial results could be
impacted by the outcome of recent calls for municipalization of part or all of the Utility’s businesses, actions by municipalities and other public entities to
acquire the electric assets of the Utility within their respective jurisdictions and calls for state intervention, including the possibility of a state takeover of
the Utility. See “Jurisdictions may attempt to acquire the Utility’s assets through eminent domain.” in Item 1A. Risk Factors for more information. PG&E
Corporation and the Utility cannot predict the nature, occurrence, timing or extent of any such scenario, and there can be no assurance that any such
scenario would not involve significant ownership or management changes to PG&E Corporation or the Utility, including by the state of California.
•The Uncertainties in Connection with the Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process. On April 15, 2021, the CPUC placed the Utility in step 1 of the
EOEP. As a result, the Utility is subject to additional reporting requirements, monitoring, and oversight by the CPUC. See “Enhanced Oversight and
Enforcement Process” in “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” below.
•The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows have
been and could continue to be significantly affected by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the Utility continues to experience
increased arrearages. The principal areas of near-term impact include liquidity, financial results and business operations, stemming primarily from the
ongoing economic hardship of the Utility’s customers and the cap on the number of service disconnections for residential customers. The Utility continues
to monitor the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect additional financial impacts in the future as a result of
the COVID-19 pandemic. Other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on PG&E Corporation and the Utility have included operational disruptions,
workforce disruptions, both in personnel availability (including a reduction in contract labor resources) and deployment, delays in production and shipping
of materials used in the Utility’s operations, higher credit spreads and borrowing costs and could potentially also include a reduction in revenue due to the
cost of capital adjustment mechanism and incremental financing needs. For more information on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on PG&E
Corporation and the Utility, see “PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows have been and
could continue to be significantly affected by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.” in Item 1A. Risk Factors in the 2021 Form 10-K and “COVID-
19” in Liquidity and Financial Resources below.
13
For more information about the risks that could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash
flows, or that could cause future results to differ from historical results, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Form 10-Q and the 2021 Form 10-K.  In addition, this
quarterly report contains forward-looking statements that are necessarily subject to various risks and uncertainties.  These statements reflect management’s
judgment and opinions that are based on current estimates, expectations, and projections about future events and assumptions regarding these events and
management’s knowledge of facts as of the date of this report.  See “Forward-Looking Statements” above for a list of some of the factors that may cause actual
results to differ materially.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict all the factors that may affect future results and do not undertake an obligation
to update forward-looking statements, whether in response to new information, future events, or otherwise.
Tax Matters
PG&E Corporation had a U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately $21.1 billion and California net operating loss carryforward of
approximately $18.9 billion as of December 31, 2021.
Under Section 382 of the IRC, if a corporation (or a consolidated group) undergoes an “ownership change,” net operating loss carryforwards and other tax
attributes may be subject to certain limitations. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain shareholders (generally five
percent shareholders, applying certain look-through and aggregation rules) increases by more than 50% over such shareholders’ lowest percentage ownership
during the testing period (generally three years). PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Amended Articles limit Transfers (as defined in the Amended Articles) that
increase a person’s or entity’s (including certain groups of persons) ownership of PG&E Corporation’s equity securities to 4.75% or more prior to the Restriction
Release Date (as defined in the Amended Articles) without approval by the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation (the “Ownership Restrictions”). As discussed
below under “Update on Ownership Restrictions in PG&E Corporation’s Amended Articles,” due to the election to treat the Fire Victim Trust as a grantor trust for
income tax purposes, the calculation of Percentage Stock Ownership (as defined in the Amended Articles) will effectively be based on a reduced number of shares
outstanding, namely the total number of outstanding equity securities less the number of equity securities held by the Fire Victim Trust, the Utility and ShareCo. As
of the date of this report, it is more likely than not that PG&E Corporation has not undergone an ownership change, and consequently, its net operating loss
carryforwards and other tax attributes are not limited by Section 382 of the IRC.
Furthermore, the activities of the Fire Victim Trust are treated as activities of the Utility for tax purposes. Accordingly, PG&E Corporation will recognize income
tax benefits and the corresponding deferred tax asset as the Fire Victim Trust sells shares of PG&E Corporation common stock, and the amounts of such benefits
and assets will be impacted by the price at which the Fire Victim Trust sells the shares, rather than the price at the time such shares were transferred to the Fire
Victim Trust. On January 31, 2022, April 14, 2022, and October 4, 2022, the Fire Victim Trust exchanged 40,000,000, 60,000,000, and 35,000,000 Plan Shares,
respectively, for an equal number of New Shares in the manner contemplated by the Share Exchange and Tax Matters Agreement; in each case, the Fire Victim
Trust thereafter reported that it sold the applicable New Shares. In the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Fire Victim Trust’s sale of PG&E Corporation
common stock in the aggregate amount of 100,000,000 shares resulted in an aggregate tax benefit of $337 million recorded in PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Update on Ownership Restrictions in PG&E Corporation’s Amended Articles
As a result of the grantor trust election, shares of PG&E Corporation common stock owned by the Fire Victim Trust are treated as held by the Utility and, in turn,
attributed to PG&E Corporation for income tax purposes. Consequently, any shares of PG&E Corporation common stock owned by the Fire Victim Trust, along
with any shares owned by the Utility directly, are effectively excluded from the total number of outstanding equity securities when calculating a person’s
Percentage Stock Ownership (as defined in the Amended Articles) for purposes of the 4.75% ownership limitation in the Amended Articles. Shares owned by
ShareCo are also effectively excluded because ShareCo is a disregarded entity for income tax purposes. For example, although PG&E Corporation had
2,465,443,675 shares outstanding as of October 20, 2022, only 1,644,956,495 shares (the number of outstanding shares of common stock less the number of shares
held by the Fire Victim Trust, the Utility and ShareCo) count as outstanding for purposes of the ownership restrictions in the Amended Articles. As such, based on
the total number of outstanding equity securities and taking into account the shares of PG&E Corporation common stock known to have been sold by the Fire
Victim Trust as of October 20, 2022, a person’s effective Percentage Stock Ownership limitation for purposes of the Amended Articles as of October 20, 2022 was
3.16% of outstanding shares. As of October 20, 2022, to the knowledge of PG&E Corporation, the Fire Victim Trust had sold 135,000,000 shares of PG&E
Corporation common stock in the aggregate.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion presents PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. See
“Key Factors Affecting Financial Results” above for further discussion about factors that could affect future results of operations.
PG&E Corporation
The consolidated results of operations consist primarily of results related to the Utility, which are discussed in the “Utility” section below.  The following table
provides a summary of net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021:
Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,
(in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021
Consolidated Total $ 456 $ (1,091)$ 1,287 $ (574)
PG&E Corporation (31) (46) (323) (139)
Utility $ 487 $ (1,045)$ 1,610 $ (435)
PG&E Corporation’s net loss primarily consists of income taxes, interest expense on long-term debt, and charges related to Wildfire-Related Securities Claims. For
more information on Wildfire-Related Securities Claims, see Note 11 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1.
Utility
The table below shows certain items from the Utility’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and
2021.  The table separately identifies the revenues and costs that impacted earnings from those that did not impact earnings.  In general, expenses the Utility is
authorized to pass through directly to customers (such as costs to purchase electricity and natural gas, as well as costs to fund public purpose programs), and the
corresponding amount of revenues collected to recover those pass-through costs, do not impact earnings. 
Revenues that impact earnings are primarily those that have been authorized by the CPUC and the FERC to recover the Utility’s costs to own and operate its assets
and to provide the Utility an opportunity to earn its authorized rate of return on rate base.  Expenses that impact earnings are primarily those that the Utility incurs
to own and operate its assets.
CPUC and FERC rates decouple authorized revenue from the volume of electricity and natural gas sales, so the Utility receives revenue equal to the amounts
authorized by the relevant regulatory agencies. As a result, the volume of electricity and natural gas sold does not have a direct impact on PG&E Corporation’s and
the Utility’s financial results.

Utility Revenues and Costs that Impacted Earnings
The following discussion presents the Utility’s operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, focusing on revenues and
expenses that impacted earnings for these periods. 
Operating Revenues
The Utility’s electric and natural gas operating revenues that impacted earnings increased by $83 million, or 2%, in the three months ended September 30, 2022,
compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to the recognition of approximately $180 million in revenues related to the final decision approving
$356.3 million in revenue requirements for capital expenditures incurred in the period from 2011 through 2014 for its GT&S system (see “2015 Gas Transmission
and Storage Rate Case and 2011-2014 Gas Transmission and Storage Capital Expenditures Audit” in Note 12 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 1 below), increased base revenues authorized in the 2020 GRC, and additional revenues as authorized through the FERC formula rate. The
increases were partially offset by approximately $80 million of previously deferred revenues recognized in conjunction with interim rate relief associated with the
WMCE application (see “2020 WMCE Application” below).(1)
 (1)
(1) 
17
The Utility’s electric and natural gas operating revenues that impacted earnings increased by $520 million, or 5%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2022,
compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to the recognition of approximately $310 million in revenues related to the settlement agreement for the 2018
CEMA application (see “2018 CEMA Application” below), the recognition of approximately $180 million in revenues related to the final decision approving
$356.3 million in revenue requirements for capital expenditures incurred in the period from 2011 through 2014 for its GT&S system (see “2015 Gas Transmission
and Storage Rate Case and 2011-2014 Gas Transmission and Storage Capital Expenditures Audit” in Note 12 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 1 below), increased base revenues authorized in the 2020 GRC, and additional revenues as authorized through the FERC formula rate. These
increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $80 million of previously deferred revenues recognized in conjunction with interim rate relief
associated with the WMCE application (see “2020 WMCE Application” below).
Operating and Maintenance
The Utility’s operating and maintenance expenses that impacted earnings decreased by $479 million, or 21%, in the three months ended September 30, 2022,
compared to the same period in 2021, as a result of operating cost efficiencies and decreases in the recognition of previously deferred costs including approximately
$80 million recognized in conjunction with interim rate relief associated with the WMCE application (see “2020 WMCE Application” below) in the three months
ended September 30, 2021 with no comparable charge in the same period in 2022. In addition, in the three months ended September 30, 2021, the Utility recorded a
$124 million charge related to the September 21, 2021 joint motion for approval of settlement agreement associated with the 2020 WMCE filing, with no
comparable charge in the same period in 2022.
The Utility’s operating and maintenance expenses that impacted earnings decreased by $489 million, or 8%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2022,
compared to the same period in 2021, as a result of operating cost efficiencies and decreases in the recognition of previously deferred costs including $90 million
related to residential uncollectibles and $105 million recognized in conjunction with interim rate relief associated with the WMCE application (see “2020 WMCE
Application” below). In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the Utility recorded a $124 million charge related to the September 21, 2021
joint motion for approval of settlement agreement associated with the 2020 WMCE filing, with no comparable charge in the same period in 2022. These decreases
were partially offset by the recognition of approximately $310 million of previously deferred expenses which were authorized by the settlement agreement for the
2018 CEMA application (see “2018 CEMA Application” below) in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021.
SB 901 Securitization Charges, Net
SB 901 securitization charges, net, that impacted earnings increased by $40 million, or 100%, in the nine months ended September 30, compared to the same period
in 2021. In the second quarter of 2022, as a result of the establishment of the SB 901 securitization regulatory asset and liability, the Utility recorded a $40 million
charge. For more information, see Note 6 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1.
Wildfire-Related Claims, Net of Recoveries
Costs related to wildfires that impacted earnings decreased by $85 million, or 90% in the three months ended September 30, 2022, compared to the same period in
2021. The Utility recognized pre-tax charges of $100 million related to the 2022 Mosquito fire in the three months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to pre-
tax charges of $1.15 billion related to the 2021 Dixie fire in the three months ended September 30, 2021. The 2022 Mosquito fire charges were partially offset by
$90 million of probable recoveries through insurance and the WEMA in the three months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to $1.06 billion of probable
recoveries through insurance, the WEMA, and the Wildfire Fund related to the 2021 Dixie fire in the three months ended September 30, 2021. See “Loss
Recoveries” in Note 11 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 below.
Costs related to wildfires that impacted earnings decreased by $108 million, or 41%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to the same period in
2021. The Utility recognized pre-tax charges of $150 million related to the 2019 Kincade fire and $100 million related to the 2022 Mosquito fire in the nine months
ended September 30, 2022, as compared to pre-tax charges of $1.15 billion related to the 2021 Dixie fire, $175 million related to the 2019 Kincade fire, and $100
million related to the 2020 Zogg fire in the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The 2022 Mosquito fire charges were partially offset by $90 million of
probable recoveries through insurance and the WEMA in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to $1.06 billion of probable recoveries through
insurance, the WEMA, and the Wildfire Fund related to the 2021 Dixie fire and $108 million of probable insurance recoveries related to the 2020 Zogg fire in the
nine months ended September 30, 2021. See “Loss Recoveries” in Note 11 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 below.
18
Wildfire Fund Expense
The Utility’s Wildfire Fund expense that impacted earnings decreased by $44 million, or 27%, and $46 million, or 12%, in the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021, primarily due to accelerated amortization of the Wildfire Fund asset recorded in 2021 as a
result of the Wildfire Fund receivable accrued in relation to the 2021 Dixie fire, with no comparable amounts recorded in 2022.
Depreciation, Amortization, and Decommissioning
The Utility’s depreciation, amortization, and decommissioning expenses that impacted earnings increased by $201 million, or 25%, and $375 million, or 15%, in
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021, primarily due to capital additions and an increase in
decommissioning expense beginning in January 2022 as a result of the final 2018 NDCTP decision.
Interest Income
Interest income that impacted earnings increased by $42 million, or 100%, and increased by $54 million, or 318%, in the three and nine months ended September
30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021, primarily due to higher interest rates earned on regulatory balancing accounts.
Interest Expense
Interest expense that impacted earnings increased by $116 million, or 34%, and increased by $143 million, or 14%, in the three and nine months ended September
30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021, primarily due to the issuance of additional long-term debt and an increase in interest rates on
variable-rate debt.
Other Income, Net
Changes to Other income, net that impact earnings are primarily driven by fluctuations in the balance of construction work in progress that impact the equity
component of allowance for funds used during construction, and gains and losses on equity securities held by the customer credit trust.
Reorganization Items, Net
There was no material change to reorganization items, net that impacted earnings for the periods presented.
Income Tax Provision (Benefit)
Income tax benefit increased by $1,190 million and $1,555 million, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same
periods in 2021, primarily due to a write-off of a deferred tax asset associated with the grantor trust election for the Fire Victim Trust in the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2021 with no comparable amount in 2022. Additionally, income tax provision increased due to a benefit recognized related to the sale of
shares in the Fire Victim Trust in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 with no comparable benefits in the same period in 2021. The income tax provision
also increased due to a higher pre-tax income in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to the same periods in 2021.

The following table reconciles the income tax expense at the federal statutory rate to the income tax provision:
Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,
2022 2021 2022 2021
Federal statutory income tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %
Increase (decrease) in income tax rate resulting from:
State income tax (net of federal benefit) (4.8)% 303.4 % (10.9)% 45.3 %
Effect of regulatory treatment of fixed asset differences (34.6)% (156.8)% (32.4)% (57.4)%
Tax credits (0.8)% (3.3)% (0.9)% (1.5)%
Fire Victim Trust — % 994.5 % (22.9)% 155.4 %
Other, net 7.6 % 29.6 % (0.7)% 6.6 %
Effective tax rate (11.6)% 1,188.4 % (46.8)% 169.4 %
Includes the effect of state flow-through ratemaking treatment.
Includes the effect of federal flow-through ratemaking treatment for certain property-related costs. For these temporary tax differences, the Utility recognizes the deferred tax impact in the current period
and records offsetting regulatory assets and liabilities. Therefore, the Utility’s effective tax rate is impacted as these differences arise and reverse. The Utility recognizes such differences as regulatory
assets or liabilities as it is probable that these amounts will be recovered from or returned to customers in future rates. These amounts also reflect the impact of the amortization of excess deferred tax
benefits to be refunded to customers as a result of the Tax Act.
 Includes the effect of the grantor trust election for the Fire Victim Trust in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. Includes the effect of the grantor trust election for the Fire Victim Trust
and the tax benefit for the sale of shares by the Fire Victim Trust in the nine months ended September 30, 2022. See “Tax Matters” above and Note 7 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 1.
Utility Revenues and Costs that Did Not Impact Earnings
Fluctuations in revenues that did not impact earnings are primarily driven by procurement costs.  See below for more information.
Cost of Electricity
The Utility’s cost of electricity includes the cost of power purchased from third parties (including renewable energy resources), fuel and associated transmission
costs used in its own generation facilities, fuel and associated transmission costs supplied to other facilities under power purchase agreements, costs to comply with
California’s cap-and-trade program, and realized gains and losses on price risk management activities.  Cost of electricity also includes net sales (Utility owned
generation and third parties) in the CAISO electricity markets. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1.  The
Utility’s total purchased power is driven by customer demand, net CAISO electricity market activities (purchases or sales), the availability of the Utility’s own
generation facilities (including Diablo Canyon and its hydroelectric plants), and the cost effectiveness of each source of electricity.
Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,
(in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021
Cost of purchased power, net $ 879 $ 1,017 $ 2,016 $ 2,344 
Fuel used in generation facilities 153 116 298 226 
Total cost of electricity $ 1,032 $ 1,133 $ 2,314 $ 2,570  (1)

Cost of Natural Gas
The Utility’s cost of natural gas includes the costs of procurement, storage and transportation of natural gas, costs to comply with California’s cap-and-trade
program, and realized gains and losses on price risk management activities.  See Note 9 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item
1.  The Utility’s cost of natural gas is impacted by the market price of natural gas, changes in the cost of storage and transportation, and changes in customer
demand. 
Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,
(in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021
Cost of natural gas sold $ 224 $ 144 $ 1,070 $ 567 
Transportation cost of natural gas sold 33 32 107 103 
Total cost of natural gas $ 257 $ 176 $ 1,177 $ 670 
Operating and Maintenance Expenses
The Utility’s operating expenses that did not impact earnings include certain costs that the Utility is authorized to recover as incurred. If the Utility were to spend
more than authorized amounts, these expenses could have an impact to earnings.
Other Income, Net
The Utility’s other income, net that did not impact earnings includes pension and other post-retirement benefit costs that fluctuate primarily from market and
interest rate changes.
Nuclear Operations
Capacity factors, which are significantly affected by the number and duration of refueling and non-refueling outages, reflect the availability of Diablo Canyon’s
generation to the California electricity market. Management analyzes capacity factors by comparing Diablo Canyon’s actual generation to forecasted annual
capacity factors, which reflect planned refueling outages, curtailments for condenser cleaning, allowances for minor curtailments resulting from equipment issues,
and curtailments for major ocean storms. Capacity factors do not currently impact PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s results of operations, except to the extent
requested cost recovery is denied because the costs are found to be imprudently incurred.
Apart from cost-of-service ratemaking and beginning on September 2, 2022, the Utility is entitled to receive a monthly performance-based disbursement. (See
“Senate Bill 846” below.)
The Utility manages its scheduled refueling outages with the objective of minimizing their duration and maintaining high nuclear generating capacity factors,
resulting in a stable generation base for the Utility’s wholesale and retail power marketing activities. During scheduled refueling outages, the Utility performs
maintenance and equipment upgrades in order to minimize the occurrence of unplanned outages and to maintain safe, reliable operations. For the year ended
December 31, 2021, and the nine months ended September 30, 2022, Diablo Canyon achieved an average capacity factor of 84% and 94%, respectively. As
previously disclosed, Diablo Canyon Unit 2 experienced five outages between July 2020 and April 2021, each due or related to malfunctions within the main
generator associated with excessive vibration.
In addition to the maintenance and equipment upgrades performed by the Utility during scheduled refueling outages, the Utility has extensive operating and
security procedures in place to ensure the safe operation of Diablo Canyon. The Utility also has extensive safety systems in place designed to protect the plant,
personnel, and surrounding area in the unlikely event of an accident or other incident.

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES
Overview
The Utility’s ability to fund operations, finance capital expenditures, make scheduled principal and interest payments, and make distributions to PG&E Corporation
depends on the levels of its operating cash flows and access to the capital and credit markets. The CPUC authorizes the Utility’s capital structure, the aggregate
amount of long-term and short-term debt that the Utility may issue, and the revenue requirements the Utility is able to collect to recover its cost of capital. The
Utility generally utilizes retained earnings, equity contributions from PG&E Corporation and long-term debt issuances to maintain its CPUC-authorized long-term
capital structure consisting of 52% equity and 48% debt and preferred stock and relies on short-term debt, including its revolving credit facilities, to fund temporary
financing needs. On May 28, 2020, the CPUC approved a final decision in the Chapter 11 Proceedings OII, which, among other things, grants the Utility a
temporary, five-year waiver from compliance with its authorized capital structure for the financing in place upon the Utility’s emergence from Chapter 11.
PG&E Corporation’s ability to fund operations, make scheduled principal and interest payments, and fund equity contributions to the Utility depends on the level of
cash on hand, cash received from the Utility, and PG&E Corporation’s access to the capital and credit markets.
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s credit ratings may be affected by the ultimate outcome of pending enforcement and litigation matters. Credit rating
downgrades may impact the cost and availability of short-term borrowings, including credit facilities, and long-term debt costs. In addition, some of the Utility’s
commodity contracts contain collateral posting provisions tied to the Utility’s credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies. The collateral posting
provisions for some of the Utility’s power and natural gas commodity, and transportation and service agreements state that if the Utility’s credit ratings were to fall
below investment grade, the Utility would be required to post additional cash immediately to fully collateralize some or all of its net liability positions.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have various contractual commitments which impact cash requirements. These commitments are discussed in “Purchase
Commitments” in Note 12 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1.
COVID-19
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows have been and could continue to be significantly affected
by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the emergence of variant strains of the virus (including Delta and
Omicron), and the resulting economic conditions and government orders have had and will continue to have a significant adverse impact on the Utility’s customers
and, as a result, these circumstances have impacted and will continue to impact the Utility for an indeterminate period of time. In particular, the Utility continues to
experience increased arrearages. The principal areas of near-term impact include liquidity, financial results and business operations, stemming primarily from the
ongoing economic hardship of the Utility’s customers, the cap on the number of service disconnections for residential customers, and the CPUC’s “Emergency
Authorization and Order Directing Utilities to Implement Emergency Customer COVID-19 Protections.” The Utility has resumed non-residential service and
residential service disconnections as of October 13, 2022. The CPUC has set an annual cap on the number of residential disconnections. The Utility’s accounts
receivable balances over 30 days outstanding as of September 30, 2022, were approximately $1.1 billion, or $869 million higher as compared to the balance as of
December 31, 2019. The Utility is unable to estimate the portion of the increase directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.
As of September 30, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility had access to approximately $2.6 billion of total liquidity comprised of approximately $107 million
of Utility cash, $155 million of PG&E Corporation cash and $2.3 billion of availability under PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s revolving credit facilities. The
2022 cost of capital application was filed off-cycle based on the extraordinary event of the COVID-19 pandemic and related government response. See “Cost of
Capital Proceedings” below for more information.
The Utility established the CPPMA memorandum accounts for tracking costs related to the CPUC’s emergency authorization and order for the period the CPPMA
was in effect. As of September 30, 2022, the CPPMA totaled $32 million and is reflected in Long-term regulatory assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance
Sheets. In addition to the $32 million recorded to the CPPMA, the Utility recorded approximately $109 million of undercollections from residential customers from
March 4, 2020 to September 30, 2022 to the RUBA, which has been approved by the CPUC and is reflected in Regulatory balancing accounts receivable on the
Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
22
On June 30, 2022, the Governor of California signed AB 205, which included authorization for additional incremental CAPP funding of $958 million for California
IOUs to be determined by the California Department of Community Services and Development. The Utility and the community choice aggregators in its territory
expect to receive $219 million to reduce the amounts owed by customer accounts in arrears.
The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact PG&E Corporation and the Utility financially, and PG&E Corporation and the Utility will continue to monitor
the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.  PG&E Corporation and the
Utility maintain separate bank accounts and primarily invest their cash in money market funds. 
Financial Resources
Equity Financings
On April 30, 2021, PG&E Corporation entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with the Agents, the Forward Sellers and the Forward Purchasers (each as
defined in “At the Market Equity Distribution Program” in Note 7 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1.), establishing an at
the market equity distribution program, pursuant to which PG&E Corporation, through the Agents, may offer and sell from time to time shares of PG&E
Corporation’s common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $400 million. The Equity Distribution Agreement provides that, in addition to the
issuance and sale of shares of common stock by PG&E Corporation to or through the Agents, PG&E Corporation may enter into Forward Sale Agreements (as
defined in “At the Market Equity Distribution Program” in Note 7 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1) with the Forward
Purchasers.
As of September 30, 2022, there was $400 million available under PG&E Corporation’s At the Market Equity Distribution Program for future offerings. During the
nine months ended September 30, 2022, PG&E Corporation did not sell any shares pursuant to the Equity Distribution Agreement or any Forward Sale Agreement.
PG&E Corporation plans to meet its capital requirements for 2022 and 2023 through internally-generated funds and the issuance of long-term debt, short-term debt,
and the potential sale of a minority interest in Pacific Generation. (See “Application with Pacific Generation LLC for Approval to Transfer Non-Nuclear Generation
Assets.”) PG&E Corporation does not plan to issue any equity securities in 2022, 2023, or 2024. Factors that could affect PG&E Corporation’s planned equity
issuances include liquidity and cash flow needs, capital expenditures, interest rates, the timing and outcome of ratemaking proceedings, and the timing and terms of
other financings, including the potential sale of a minority interest in Pacific Generation.
Debt Financings
On February 18, 2022, the Utility completed the sale of (i) $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.25% First Mortgage Bonds due 2024, (ii) $400 million
aggregate principal amount of 4.20% First Mortgage Bonds due 2029, (iii) $450 million aggregate principal amount of 4.40% First Mortgage Bonds due 2032 and
(iv) $550 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% First Mortgage Bonds due 2052. The proceeds were used for the prepayment of a portion of the 18-month
tranche loans pursuant to an existing term loan credit agreement (the “2020 Utility Term Loan Credit Agreement”), in an amount equal to $1.0 billion, and for
general corporate purposes.
On June 8, 2022, the Utility issued $450 million aggregate principal amount of 4.950% First Mortgage Bonds due June 8, 2025, $450 million aggregate principal
amount of 5.450% First Mortgage Bonds due June 15, 2027, and $600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.90% First Mortgage Bonds due June 15, 2032. The
proceeds were used for the repayment of all of the borrowings outstanding under the Utility’s revolving credit facility pursuant to the Utility Revolving Credit
Agreement.
As previously disclosed, on August 11, 2021, PG&E Corporation borrowed $145 million from the Utility under an interest bearing 364-day intercompany note due
August 10, 2022. On June 17, 2022, this loan was repaid in full.
23
SB 901 Securitization
On May 10, 2022, PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC, a bankruptcy remote, limited liability company wholly owned by the Utility, issued $3.6 billion
aggregate principal amount of senior secured recovery bonds (the “Series 2022-A Recovery Bonds”). The Series 2022-A Recovery Bonds were issued in five
tranches:
Tranche Amount Interest Rate Due Date
A-1 $ 540,000,000 3.594 % June 1, 2032
A-2 $ 540,000,000 4.263 % June 1, 2038

A-5 $ 900,000,000 4.674 % December 1, 2053
The net proceeds were used to fund the redemption of all $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Utility’s Floating Rate First Mortgage Bonds due June 16,
2022 on May 16, 2022 and the redemption of all $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of the Utility’s 1.75% First Mortgage Bonds due June 16, 2022 on May
16, 2022. The Utility used the remaining proceeds from the issuance of the Series 2022-A Recovery Bonds for the repayment of a portion of loans outstanding
under the Utility’s revolving credit facility pursuant to the Utility Revolving Credit Agreement.
On July 20, 2022, PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC issued $3.9 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured recovery bonds (the “Series 2022-B
Recovery Bonds”). The Series 2022-B Recovery Bonds were issued in five tranches:
Tranche Amount Interest Rate Due Date
B-1 $ 613,080,000 4.022 % June 1, 2033
B-2 $ 600,000,000 4.722 % June 1, 2039
B-3 $ 500,040,000 5.081 % June 3, 2043

2023 on July 25, 2022, (2) the prepayment of all $500 million of loans outstanding under the 2022A Utility Term Loan Credit Agreement as defined below, and (3)
the repayment of a portion of loans outstanding under the Utility’s revolving credit facility pursuant to the Utility Revolving Credit Agreement. The Utility also
intends to use a portion of the remaining proceeds to fund the redemption of all $1 billion aggregate principal amount of the Utility’s 3.25% First Mortgage Bonds
due 2024.
Credit Facilities
As of September 30, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility had $500 million and $1.8 billion available under their respective $500 million and $4.0 billion
revolving credit facilities. The Utility also has access to the Receivables Securitization Program, under which the Utility may borrow the lesser of the facility limit
and the facility availability. The facility limit fluctuates between $1.0 billion and $1.5 billion depending on the periods set forth in the amendment. Further, the
facility availability may vary based on the amount of accounts receivable that the Utility owns that are eligible for sale to the SPV and the portion of those accounts
receivable that are sold to the SPV that are eligible for advances by the lenders under the Receivables Securitization Program from time to time.
PG&E Corporation
As previously disclosed, on July 1, 2020, PG&E Corporation entered into the Corporation Revolving Credit Agreement, which it subsequently amended.
On October 4, 2022, PG&E Corporation further amended the Corporation Revolving Credit Agreement to, among other things, extend the maturity date of such
agreement to June 22, 2025 (subject to a one-year extension at the option of PG&E Corporation).
24
Utility
On March 31, 2022, the Utility prepaid in full the remaining portion of the 18-month tranche loans pursuant to the 2020 Utility Term Loan Credit Agreement, in a
principal amount equal to $298 million. As a result of such prepayment, the 2020 Utility Term Loan Credit Agreement was terminated and is no longer outstanding.
On April 4, 2022, the Utility entered into a term loan credit agreement (the “2022A Utility Term Loan Credit Agreement”), comprised of 364-day tranche loans in
the aggregate principal amount of $500 million (the “364-Day 2022A Tranche Loans”). The 364-Day 2022A Tranche Loans have a maturity date of April 3, 2023
and bear interest based on the Utility’s election of either (1) Term SOFR (plus a 0.10% credit spread adjustment) plus an applicable margin of 1.25%, or (2) the
base rate plus an applicable margin of 0.25%. The Utility borrowed the entire amount of the 364-Day 2022A Tranche Loans on April 4, 2022. On July 21, 2022, the
364-Day 2022A Tranche Loans were prepaid in full with a portion of the proceeds from issuance of the Series 2022-B Recovery Bonds. As a result of such
prepayment, the 2022A Utility Term Loan Credit Agreement was terminated and is no longer outstanding.
On April 20, 2022, the Utility entered into a term loan credit agreement (the “2022B Utility Term Loan Credit Agreement”), comprised of 364-day tranche loans in
the aggregate principal amount of $125 million (the “364-Day 2022B Tranche Loans”) and two-year tranche loans in the aggregate principal amount of $400
million (the “2-Year 2022B Tranche Loans”). The 364-Day 2022B Tranche Loans have a maturity date of April 19, 2023 and the 2-Year 2022B Tranche Loans have
a maturity date of April 19, 2024. The 364-Day 2022B Tranche Loans and the 2-Year 2022B Tranche Loans bear interest based on the Utility’s election of either (1)
Term SOFR (plus a 0.10% credit spread adjustment) plus an applicable margin of 1.25%, or (2) the base rate plus an applicable margin of 0.25%. The Utility
borrowed the entire amount of the 364-Day 2022B Tranche Loans and the 2-Year 2022B Tranche Loans on April 20, 2022.
On April 20, 2022, the Utility entered into an amendment to the Receivables Securitization Program to, among other things, add an uncommitted incremental
facility which, subject to certain conditions precedent, allows the SPV to request an increase in the facility limit by an additional $500 million to an aggregate
amount of $1.5 billion. On August 12, 2022, the SPV requested such an increase to the facility limit, and the facility limit was subsequently increased to $1.5
billion on August 22, 2022. On September 30, 2022, the Utility entered into an amendment to the Receivables Securitization Program to, among other things,
extend the scheduled termination date to September 30, 2024 and implement a seasonal facility limit. After giving effect to the amendment, the facility limit
fluctuates between $1.0 billion and $1.5 billion based on the periods set forth in the amendment.
As previously disclosed, on July 1, 2020, the Utility entered into the Utility Revolving Credit Agreement, which it subsequently amended.
On October 4, 2022, the Utility further amended the Utility Revolving Credit Agreement to, among other things, (i) increase the aggregate commitments provided
by the lenders to $4.4 billion and (ii) extend the maturity date of such agreement to June 22, 2027 (subject to a one-year extension at the option of the Utility).
For more information, see “Credit Facilities” in Note 5 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1.
Dividends
On December 20, 2017, the Boards of Directors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility suspended quarterly cash dividends on both PG&E Corporation’s and the
Utility’s common stock, beginning the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as the Utility’s preferred stock, beginning the three-month period ending January 31, 2018.
On February 8, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Utility authorized the payment of all cumulative and unpaid dividends on the Utility’s preferred stock as of
January 31, 2022 totaling $59.1 million, which was paid on May 13, 2022, to holders of record on April 29, 2022 and declared a dividend on the Utility’s preferred
stock totaling $3.5 million, which was paid on May 15, 2022, to holders of record on April 29, 2022. On September 15, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Utility
declared dividends on its outstanding series of preferred stock, payable on November 15, 2022, to holders of record on October 31, 2022.
On June 15, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Utility also reinstated the dividend on the Utility’s common stock and declared a common stock dividend of
$425 million that was paid to PG&E Corporation on June 17, 2022. On September 15, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Utility declared a common stock
dividend of $425 million that was paid to PG&E Corporation on September 16, 2022. No dividend is payable until declared by the Board of Directors of the Utility.
25
Subject to the dividend restrictions as described in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of the 2021 Form 10-K, any decision to
declare and pay dividends on PG&E Corporation’s common stock in the future will be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on, among
other things, results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant.
Pursuant to the Confirmation Order, PG&E Corporation may not pay dividends on shares of its common stock until it recognizes $6.2 billion in Non-GAAP Core
Earnings following the Emergence Date. “Non-GAAP Core Earnings” means GAAP earnings adjusted for certain non-core items. PG&E Corporation currently is
unable to predict when it will commence the payment of dividends on its common stock.
Utility Cash Flows
The Utility’s cash flows were as follows:
Nine Months Ended September 30,
 (in millions) 2022 2021
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,940 $ 2,220 
Net cash used in investing activities (8,173) (4,823)
Net cash provided by financing activities 5,304 2,479 
Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 71 $ (124)
Operating Activities
The Utility’s cash flows from operating activities primarily consist of receipts from customers less payments of operating expenses, other than expenses such as
depreciation that do not require the use of cash.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, net cash provided by operating activities increased by
$720 million compared to the same period in 2021.  This increase was primarily due to a reduction in accounts receivable in 2022 resulting from the CAPP relief
payment of approximately $300 million received in January 2022 to reduce the amounts owed by customer accounts in arrears. In addition, during the nine months
ended September 30, 2022, the Utility made a payment to the Fire Victim Trust of $592 million as compared to a payment of $758 million in the same period in
2021.
Future cash flow from operating activities will be affected by various factors, including:
•the timing and amount of costs in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, and the 2022 Mosquito fire and the
timing and amount of any potential related insurance, Wildfire Fund, and regulatory recoveries;
•the timing and amounts of costs, including fines and penalties, that may be incurred in connection with current and future enforcement, litigation, and
regulatory matters (see “Wildfire-Related Securities Class Action” in Note 11 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1
and “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” and “Regulatory Matters” below for more information);
•the severity, extent and duration of the global COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the Utility’s service territory, the ability of the Utility to collect on its

the Utility are able to recover their costs through regulated rates as recorded in memorandum accounts or balancing accounts, or as otherwise requested.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect
on their financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources, other
than those discussed under “Purchase Commitments” in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of the 2021 Form 10-K.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities increased by $3.4 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021. This
increase was primarily driven by a $1.9 billion increase in capital expenditures, including additional system hardening and emergency response work performed in
2022. Additionally, the Utility purchased $1.0 billion of investments as part of the creation of the customer credit trust, with no similar purchases in 2021.
The Utility’s investing activities primarily consist of the construction of new and replacement facilities necessary to provide safe and reliable electricity and natural
gas services to its customers. Cash used in investing activities also includes the proceeds from sales of nuclear decommissioning trust investments which are largely
offset by the amount of cash used to purchase new nuclear decommissioning trust investments.  The funds in the decommissioning trusts, along with accumulated
earnings, are used exclusively for decommissioning and dismantling the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities.
Future cash flows used in investing activities are largely dependent on the timing and amount of capital expenditures.  The Utility estimates that it will incur
between $7.8 billion and $9.4 billion of capital expenditures in 2022 and between $7.9 billion and $11.2 billion in 2023. Cash provided by or used in investing
activities is also driven by proceeds and purchases of customer credit trust investments. Additionally, future cash flows used in investing activities will be impacted
by the timing and amount related to the intended purchase of the Lakeside Building.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities increased by $2.8 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021. The
increase was due to the issuance of $7.5 billion in SB 901 recovery bonds and a $1.0 billion increase in net borrowings under credit facilities, partially offset by a
$4.9 billion decrease in proceeds from issuance of long-term debt, net of repayments, during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to the same
period in 2021. Additionally, the Utility received equity contributions from PG&E Corporation of $427 million, which were offset by common stock dividend
payments of $850 million. The net increase was also offset by $370 million of proceeds received in 2021 from the sale of future revenue from transmission tower
license sales, with no similar receipts in 2022.
Cash provided by or used in financing activities is driven by the Utility’s financing needs, which depend on the level of cash provided by or used in operating
activities, the level of cash provided by or used in investing activities, the conditions in the capital markets, and the maturity date or prepayment date of existing
debt instruments.  Additionally, future cash flows from financing activities will be affected by the timing and outcome of the Utility’s second AB 1054
securitization transaction, dividend payments, and equity contributions from PG&E Corporation.
ENFORCEMENT AND LITIGATION MATTERS
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have significant contingencies arising from their operations, including contingencies related to the enforcement and litigation
matters described in Note 2, Note 11, and 12 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. that are incorporated by reference herein.
The outcome of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of
operations, liquidity, and cash flows.
27
Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process
In the OII to Consider PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Plan of Reorganization final decision, the CPUC adopted an EOEP designed to provide a roadmap for
how the CPUC will monitor the Utility’s operational performance on an ongoing basis. The EOEP contains six steps that are triggered by specific events and
includes enhanced reporting requirements and additional monitoring and oversight. These trigger events include failure to obtain an approved WMP, failure to
comply with regulatory reporting requirements in the WMP, insufficient progress toward approved safety or risk-driven investments and failure to comply with or
demonstrate sufficient progress toward certain metrics. The EOEP also contains provisions for the Utility to cure and permanently exit the EOEP if it can satisfy
specific criteria. If the Utility is placed into the EOEP, actions taken would occur in coordination with the CPUC’s existing formal and informal reporting
requirements and procedures. The EOEP does not replace or limit the CPUC’s regulatory authority, including the authority to issue Orders to Show Cause and OIIs
and to impose fines and penalties. The EOEP requires the Utility to report the occurrence of a triggering event to the CPUC’s executive director no later than five
business days after the date on which any member of senior management of the Utility becomes aware of the occurrence of a triggering event.
On August 18, 2021, the then-president of the CPUC informed the Utility that the CPUC staff intends to conduct a fact-finding review regarding a pattern of self-
reported missed inspections and other self-reported safety incidents to determine whether a recommendation to advance the Utility further within the EOEP is
warranted.
The Utility is unable to predict whether additional fines or penalties may be imposed, or other regulatory actions may be taken.
Vegetation Management
The CPUC placed the Utility into step 1 of the EOEP on April 15, 2021 and imposed additional reporting requirements on the Utility. The CPUC’s resolution states
that a step 1 triggering event had occurred because the Utility had “made insufficient progress toward approved safety or risk-driven investments related to its
electric business.” The resolution found that, based on the CPUC’s evaluation of the Utility’s EVM work in 2020, the Utility was “not sufficiently prioritizing its
Enhanced Vegetation Management (“EVM”) based on risk” and was “not making risk-driven investments.” The resolution also found that “less than five percent of
the EVM work” the Utility completed in 2020 “was on the 20 highest risk power lines according to its own risk rankings.”
As required by the CPUC’s resolution, the Utility submitted a corrective action plan to the CPUC’s Executive Director on May 6, 2021, which is designed to
correct or prevent recurrence of the step 1 triggering event, or otherwise mitigate any ongoing safety risk or impact, as soon as practicable, among other things. The
corrective action plan addressed the EVM situation that occurred in 2020 and provided a risk-informed EVM work plan for 2021. The Utility is required to update
the information contained in the corrective action plan every 90 days, which it has done. The Utility will remain in step 1 of the EOEP until the CPUC determines
that the Utility has met the conditions of the corrective action plan. If the Utility does not adequately meet such conditions within the timeframe approved by the
CPUC, the CPUC may place the Utility into a higher step of the EOEP, or the Utility may remain in step 1 of the EOEP if it demonstrates sufficient progress
towards meeting such conditions.
On October 14, 2022, the CPUC issued a draft resolution authorizing the Utility to exit the EOEP. The CPUC is scheduled to vote on the draft resolution on
November 17, 2022.
REGULATORY MATTERS
The Utility is subject to substantial regulation by the CPUC, the FERC, the NRC, and other federal and state regulatory agencies. The resolutions of the
proceedings described below and other proceedings may materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity,
and cash flows.
During the three months ended September 30, 2022 and through the date of this filing, the Utility has continued to make progress on regulatory and legislative
matters.
•On September 2, 2022, the Governor of California signed SB 846, which supports the extension of operations at Diablo Canyon until 2030. The Utility
filed an application for federal funding through the U.S. DOE’s Civil Nuclear Credit program on September 2, 2022. On October 18, 2022, the Utility
executed the loan agreement with the DWR. On September 29, 2022, the Governor of California also signed SB 884, which authorizes and expedites
OEIS and CPUC review of a 10-year undergrounding plan.
28
•On September 6, 2022, the Utility submitted update testimony in the 2023 GRC. The update testimony reflects updates for escalation rates and federal tax
law and increases the Utility’s revenue requirement request by $835 million for 2023. On October 7, 2022, the Utility filed a settlement agreement with
two parties to the proceeding pursuant to which the Utility’s wildfire insurance would be entirely based on self-insurance.
•On September 28, 2022, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC regarding the separation of its non-nuclear generation assets into a stand-alone
Utility subsidiary and the potential sale of a minority interest in the newly-formed subsidiary to one or more investors to be identified.
•On September 30, 2022, the CPUC issued a PD and an APD in the Utility’s 2022 cost of capital proceeding. Both the PD and the APD find that an
extraordinary event occurred, though only the PD opens a second phase to determine a new 2022 cost of capital.
•On October 6, 2022, OEIS issued a draft decision approving the Utility’s 2022 WMP.
•On October 11, 2022, the CPUC issued a PD and an APD regarding the Utility’s 2020 WMCE application. The Utility intends to seek further review of
both proposed decisions.
•On October 14, 2022, the CPUC issued a draft resolution authorizing the Utility to exit the EOEP. The CPUC is scheduled to vote on the draft resolution
on November 17, 2022.
Cost Recovery Proceedings
Periodically, costs arise that could not have been anticipated by the Utility during CPUC GRC rate requests or that have been deliberately excluded from such
requests. These costs may result from catastrophic events, changes in regulation, or extraordinary changes in operating practices. The Utility may seek authority to
track incremental costs in a memorandum account and the CPUC may authorize recovery of costs tracked in memorandum accounts if the costs are deemed
incremental and prudently incurred. The CPUC may also authorize balancing accounts with limitations or caps to cost recovery. These various accounts, which
include the CEMA, WEMA, FHPMA, FRMMA, WMPMA, VMBA, WMBA, and RTBA among others, allow the Utility to track the costs associated with work
related to disaster and wildfire response, other wildfire prevention-related costs, certain third-party wildfire claims, and insurance costs. While the Utility generally
expects such costs to be recoverable, there can be no assurance that the CPUC will authorize the Utility to recover the full amount of its costs.
In recent years, the amount of the costs recorded in these accounts has increased. Because rate recovery may require CPUC authorization for these accounts, there
can be a delay between when the Utility incurs costs and when it may recover those costs. As of September 30, 2022, the Utility had recorded an aggregate amount
of approximately $5.7 billion in costs for the CEMA, WEMA, FHPMA, FRMMA, WMPMA, VMBA, WMBA, MGMA, and RTBA. Of these costs, approximately
$800 million was authorized for recovery and accounted for as current, and $4.9 billion was accounted for as long term as of September 30, 2022. See Note 4 of the
Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1.
If the amount of the costs recorded in these accounts continues to increase or the delay between incurring and recovering costs lengthens, PG&E Corporation and
the Utility may incur additional financing costs. If the Utility does not recover the full amount of its recorded costs, the difference between the recorded and
recovered amounts would be written off as a non-cash disallowance. Such disallowances could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial
condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.
Except as otherwise noted, the Utility is unable to predict the timing and outcome of the following applications. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial
condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected if the Utility is unable to timely recover costs included in these applications.
For more information, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1., “Wildfire Mitigation and Catastrophic Events Cost
Recovery Applications,” and “Catastrophic Event Memorandum Account Application” below.
29
The Utility’s cost recovery proceedings for the costs described above that are pending, have pending appeals, or were completed during the nine months ended
September 30, 2022 are summarized in the following table:
Proceeding Request Status
2020 WMCE Revenue requirement of approximately $1.28 billionSettlement agreement to recover $1.04 billion of revenue
requirement filed September 2021. PD and APD issued in October
2022.
2021 WMCE Revenue requirement of approximately $1.47 billion PD scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2022.
2018 CEMA Revenue requirement of $763 millionSettlement agreement to recover $683 million plus interest
approved March 2022.
Wildfire Mitigation and Catastrophic Events Cost Recovery Applications
2020 WMCE Application
On September 30, 2020, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC requesting cost recovery of recorded expenditures related to wildfire mitigation and certain
catastrophic events (the “2020 WMCE application”). The recorded expenditures, which exclude amounts disallowed as a result of the CPUC’s decision in the OII
into the multiple wildfires that began on October 8, 2017 and spread through Northern California, including Napa, Sonoma, Butte, Humboldt, Mendocino, Lake,
Nevada and Yuba Counties, as well as in the area surrounding Yuba City (the “2017 Northern California wildfires”) and the 2018 Camp fire, consist of $1.18 billion
in expense and $801 million in capital expenditures, resulting in a proposed revenue requirement of approximately $1.28 billion.
On September 21, 2021, the Utility and certain parties filed a motion with the CPUC seeking approval of a settlement agreement that would resolve all of the issues
raised by the settling parties in the 2020 WMCE application. The settlement agreement proposes that the Utility recover a revenue requirement of $1.04 billion. The
settlement agreement authorizes the Utility to recover a revenue requirement of $591 million over a 24-month amortization period, which is in addition to the
interim rate relief of $447 million that was approved by an earlier CPUC decision. On October 11, 2022, the assigned ALJ issued a PD, and the assigned
Commissioner issued an APD. The PD would reject the settlement agreement and result in recovery of a revenue requirement of approximately $748 million. The
APD would approve the settlement and authorize recovery of a revenue requirement of $1.04 billion, but would modify the settlement agreement to make
permanent a 19% reduction in capital expenditures for future cost-recovery periods through the full service life of the subject assets; the settlement agreement had
limited this period to three years. The Utility intends to seek further review of both proposed decisions.
For more information regarding this proceeding, see Note 12 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1.
2021 WMCE Application
On September 16, 2021, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC requesting cost recovery of approximately $1.6 billion of recorded expenditures, resulting in
a proposed revenue requirement of approximately $1.47 billion (the “2021 WMCE application”). The costs addressed in this application reflect costs related to
wildfire mitigation and certain catastrophic events, as well as implementation of various customer-focused initiatives. These costs were incurred primarily in 2020.
The recorded expenditures consist of $1.4 billion in expenses and $197 million in capital expenditures. The costs addressed in the 2021 WMCE application are
incremental to those previously authorized in the Utility’s 2017 GRC, 2020 GRC, and other proceedings. The majority of the Utility’s proposed revenue
requirement would be collected over a two-year period beginning in January 2023.
The Utility’s requested revenue requirement includes amounts recorded to the VMBA of $592 million, the CEMA of $535 million, the WMBA of $149 million, and
other memorandum accounts. On November 18, 2021, the Utility filed updates to the application, increasing total costs by $19.4 million. On December 30, 2021,
the Utility filed supplemental testimony reducing the cost recovery request of the COVID-19 CEMA costs by $12.2 million. The $12.2 million reduction was a
result of costs, such as employee business travel expenses and in-person training costs, that the Utility was able to avoid due to the pandemic.
30
The CPUC’s schedule indicates a PD will be issued in the fourth quarter of 2022.
Catastrophic Event Memorandum Account Application
The CPUC allows utilities to recover the reasonable, incremental costs of responding to catastrophic events that have been declared a disaster or state of emergency
by competent federal or state authorities. The Utility has historically sought such costs through standalone CEMA applications. More recently, the Utility has
sought to recover CEMA-eligible costs through its WMCE applications.
In addition to the Utility’s responsibilities in responding to catastrophic events, in 2014, the CPUC directed the Utility to perform additional fire prevention and
vegetation management work in response to the severe drought in California. Through 2019, the costs associated with this work were tracked in the CEMA. In the
2020 GRC decision, the CPUC required the Utility to track these costs in the VMBA for the period beginning January 1, 2020.
2018 CEMA Application
On March 30, 2018, the Utility submitted to the CPUC its 2018 CEMA application requesting cost recovery of $183 million in connection with seven catastrophic
events that included fire and storm declared emergencies from mid-2016 through early 2017, as well as $405 million related to work performed in 2016 and 2017 to
cut back or remove dead or dying trees that were exposed to years of drought conditions and bark beetle infestation. The Utility filed three revisions to this
application, resulting in a total cost recovery request of $763 million.
On April 25, 2019, the CPUC approved the Utility’s request for interim rate relief, allowing for recovery of $373 million of costs as requested by the Utility at that
time. The interim rate relief was implemented, commencing on October 1, 2019.
On March 17, 2022, the CPUC approved a settlement agreement authorizing the Utility to collect a total of $683 million plus interest for the 2018 CEMA
application. As noted above, $373 million of the total amount had already been collected in interim rates. The interim rates became final and are no longer subject
to refund. The remainder of the authorized revenue requirement will be amortized over a 12-month period, which began on June 1, 2022.
Forward-Looking Rate Cases
The Utility routinely participates in forward-looking rate case applications before the CPUC and the FERC. Those applications include GRCs, where the revenue
required for general operations (“base revenue”) of the Utility is assessed and reset. In addition, the Utility is periodically involved in proceedings to adjust its
regulated return on rate base.
Decisions in GRC proceedings have historically been expected prior to the commencement of the period to which the rates would apply. In recent years, decisions
in GRC proceedings have been delayed. Delayed decisions may cause the Utility to develop its budgets based on approved revenue requirements and possible
outcomes, rather than authorized amounts. When decisions are delayed, the CPUC typically provides rate relief to the Utility effective as of the commencement of
the rate case period (not effective as of the date of the delayed decision). Nonetheless, the Utility’s spending during the period of the delay may exceed the
authorized amount, without an ability for the Utility to seek cost recovery of such excess. If the Utility’s spending during the period of the delay is less than the
authorized amount, the Utility could be exposed to operational and financial risk associated with the lower level of work achieved compared to that funded by the
CPUC.
Except as otherwise noted, the Utility is unable to predict the timing and outcome of the following applications. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial
condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected depending on the outcomes of these applications.
31
The Utility’s forward-looking rate cases that are pending, have pending appeals, or were completed during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 are
summarized in the following table:
Rate Case Request Status
2023 GRC Revenue requirement of $16.18 billion for 2023Filed amended application March 2022. Submitted updated
testimony September 2022. A decision is scheduled in the third
quarter of 2023.
2022 Cost of Capital Leave cost of capital components at pre-2022 levels for 2022 Filed August 2021. PD and APD issued in September 2022.
2023 Cost of Capital Increase ROE to 11% and cost of debt to 4.31%Filed April 2022 and updated September 2022. PD expected in
November 2022.
2015 GT&SRevenue requirement of $416 million related to 2011-2014
capital expenditures subject to auditFinal decision issued in July 2022 approving settlement to recover
$356 million of revenue requirements.
2023 General Rate Case
On June 30, 2021, the Utility filed its 2023 GRC application with the CPUC (“the Original Application”). The 2023 GRC combined what had historically been
separated into the GRC and GT&S rate cases. In a GRC, the CPUC approves annual revenue requirements for the first year (a “test year”) of the GRC period and
typically authorizes the Utility to receive annual increases in revenue requirements for the subsequent years of the GRC period (known as “attrition years”). In the
2023 GRC, the CPUC will determine the annual amount of base revenues that the Utility will be authorized to collect from customers from 2023 through 2026 to
recover its anticipated costs for gas distribution, gas transmission and storage, electric distribution, and electric generation and to provide the Utility an opportunity
to earn its authorized rate of return. The Utility’s revenue requirements for other portions of its operations, such as electric transmission, and electricity, natural gas
and power purchases, are authorized in other regulatory proceedings overseen by the CPUC or the FERC. In the Original Application, the Utility proposed a series
of safety, resiliency, and clean energy investments to further reduce wildfire risk and deliver safe, reliable, and clean energy service.
Between August 2021 and January 2022, the Utility served various updates to its 2023 GRC testimony. On February 25, 2022 and February 28, 2022, the Utility
served supplemental testimony for its 2023 GRC to reflect the Utility’s integrated wildfire mitigation strategy, including the Utility’s proposals for the initial phase
of undergrounding 10,000 miles of electric distribution powerlines in high fire risk areas throughout the Utility’s service area, the EPSS program, and its EVM
program. On March 10, 2022, the Utility filed an amended application that revised and superseded the revenue requirement request in the Original Application. On
September 6, 2022, the Utility submitted testimony updating the revenue requirement request in its 2023 GRC proceeding. The testimony reflected updates for
escalation rates and federal tax law and guidance since the filing of the Original Application.
As amended and updated, the Utility’s application requests revenue requirements of $16.18 billion and a weighted-average GRC rate base of $50.88 billion for its
2023 test year. The tables below compare the requested revenue requirements and rate base for the GRC period from 2023 through 2026 to those adopted for 2022
in the 2020 GRC and 2019 GT&S proceedings:
(in billions)     2022
(as adopted) 2023 2024 2025 2026
Requested revenue requirement $ 12.21 $ 16.18 $ 17.22 $ 18.08 $ 18.76 
Requested weighted-average GRC rate base 39.21 50.88 56.81 62.51 68.16 
Over the GRC period of 2023 through 2026, the Utility plans to make average annual capital investments of approximately $10.95 billion in gas distribution,
transmission and storage, electric distribution, and electric generation infrastructure, and to improve safety, reliability, and customer service.
On July 22, 2022, the Utility submitted a request for the second track of this proceeding, requesting cost recovery of recorded expenditures related primarily to the
safety and reliability of the Utility’s gas transmission and storage system. The recorded expenditures consist of $206 million in expenses and $129 million in capital
expenditures, resulting in a proposed revenue requirement of approximately $241 million, most of which is proposed to be collected over a two-year period
beginning August 1, 2023.
32
On October 7, 2022, the Utility filed a settlement agreement with two parties to the proceeding pursuant to which the Utility’s wildfire insurance would be entirely
based on self-insurance. If approved, the self-insurance would be funded through CPUC-jurisdictional rates at $400 million for test year 2023 and subsequent years
until $1.0 billion of unimpaired self-insurance is reached. If losses are incurred, the settlement agreement contains an adjustment mechanism designed to match
customer funded self-insurance with wildfire related liabilities as they become payable. The settlement agreement includes a 5% deductible, that is shareholder
funded, on claims that are incurred each year capped at a maximum of $50 million. The parties’ motion requested a decision on the settlement by February 2023.
The Utility does not seek recovery of compensation of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s officers within the scope of 17 Code of Federal Regulations 240.3b-7.
The CPUC’s schedule indicated a decision on both tracks of this proceeding would be issued in the third quarter of 2023.
Cost of Capital Proceedings
2020 and 2022 Cost of Capital Applications
On December 19, 2019, the CPUC approved a final decision in the 2020 cost of capital application (the “2020 cost of capital application”), maintaining the Utility’s
return on common equity at the 2019 level of 10.25% for the three-year period beginning January 1, 2020. The decision maintained the common equity component
of the Utility’s capital structure (i.e., the relative weightings of common equity, preferred equity, and debt for ratemaking) at 52% and reduced its preferred stock
component from 1% to 0.5%. The decision also approved the cost of debt requested by the Utility.
On August 23, 2021, the Utility filed an off-cycle 2022 cost of capital application with the CPUC. The Utility also concurrently filed a motion requesting that the
revenue requirement for the 2022 cost of capital be recorded in memorandum accounts to be trued-up following a final decision in this proceeding. On October 28,
2021, the CPUC ruled that the Utility was required to comply with the cost of capital mechanism for 2022; if the CPUC determines that there are not extraordinary
circumstances that warrant a departure from the cost of capital mechanism for 2022, the cost of capital adjustment mechanism would operate, and the return on
common equity would be 9.67% and the cost of long-term debt would be 4.15%.
On September 30, 2022, the assigned ALJs issued a PD, and the assigned Commissioner issued an APD. Both the PD and the APD found that an extraordinary
event occurred, and that the cost of capital adjustment mechanism should not be implemented for 2022. If adopted, the PD would open a second phase of this
proceeding to determine the 2022 cost of capital, while the APD would retain the cost of capital previously authorized in the 2020 cost of capital proceeding and
close this proceeding. Comments on the PD and APD were filed October 20, 2022, and reply comments were filed October 25, 2022.
For more information regarding this proceeding, see Note 12 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1.
2023 Cost of Capital Application
On April 20, 2022, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC requesting that the CPUC authorize the Utility's cost of capital for its electric generation, electric
distribution, natural gas distribution, and natural gas transmission and storage rate base beginning on January 1, 2023 (the “2023 cost of capital application”).
In its 2023 cost of capital application, the Utility requested that the CPUC approve the Utility’s proposed ratemaking capital structure (i.e., the relative weightings
of common equity, preferred equity, and debt for ratemaking), ROE, cost of preferred stock, and cost of debt. The Utility proposed to adopt a rate of ROE of 11%
for test year 2023 and to retain the existing capital structure, which would result in a $231 million total increase above currently adopted electric generation, electric
distribution, natural gas distribution, and natural gas transmission and storage revenue requirements. The estimated revenue increase is based on the 2022 adopted
electric generation, electric distribution, natural gas distribution, and natural gas transmission and storage rate base and does not reflect projected infrastructure
investments beyond 2022.
33
The following table compares the currently authorized capital structure and rates of return with those requested in the Utility’s application for 2023, as modified by
a correction to the requested level of long-term debt that the Utility identified on June 27, 2022, and an update to the long-term cost of debt submitted on September
14, 2022. The Utility’s authorized rates of return for 2022 are currently subject to a separate cost of capital proceeding as described above.
2022 Currently Authorized 2023 Requested
Cost Capital Structure Weighted Cost Cost Capital StructureWeighted
Cost
Common Equity 10.25 % 52.00 % 5.33 % 11.00 % 52.00 % 5.72 %
Preferred Stock 5.52 % 0.50 % 0.03 % 5.52 % 0.50 % 0.03 %
Long-term Debt 4.17 % 47.50 % 1.98 % 4.31 % 47.50 % 2.05 %
Weighted Average Cost of Capital 100.00 % 7.34 % 100.00 % 7.80 %
For 2023, the Utility expects that the proposed cost of capital, if adopted, would result in revenue requirement increases of approximately $141 million for electric
generation and distribution and $54 million for gas distribution operations, assuming 2022 authorized rate base amounts from the 2020 GRC decision. The revenues
for the gas transmission and storage operations would increase by approximately $36 million, assuming 2022 authorized rate base amounts from the 2019 GT&S
decision. However, if the CPUC subsequently approves different electric and gas rate base amounts for the Utility in its 2023 GRC, which is currently pending
before the CPUC, the revenue requirement changes resulting from the Utility’s requested ROE may differ from the amounts reflected in the 2023 cost of capital
application for the period beyond 2022.
The Utility also requested that the CPUC approve an upward adjustment above the three-month commercial paper rate for interest on the Utility’s balancing and
memorandum accounts to reflect the Utility’s actual cost of short-term debt. The Utility requested that the adjustment be set on an annual basis effective January 1
of each year based on the average difference between the three-month commercial paper rate and the Utility’s actual cost of short-term debt over the preceding
twelve-month period from November through October. The Utility included an illustrative calculation using the period March 2021 to February 2022 with an
adjustment to increase the rate by 153 basis points, which would result in an estimated $69.3 million increase in recovery of short-term financing costs associated
with its recent balancing and memorandum account balances. The actual revenue requirement impact of the short-term debt proposal would differ depending on the
final adjustment set each year and the recorded balances in the balancing and memorandum accounts.
The cost of capital that is approved in this proceeding is expected to be effective until December 31, 2025, unless the cost of capital adjustment mechanism is
triggered. (For more information on the cost of capital adjustment mechanism, see Note 12 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 1.)
On July 12, 2022, the CPUC issued a scoping memo which indicates a PD in November 2022.
2015 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case
On June 23, 2016, the CPUC approved a final phase one decision in the Utility’s 2015 GT&S rate case. The phase one decision excluded from rate base
$696 million of 2011 to 2014 capital spending in excess of the amount adopted in the prior GT&S rate case. The decision permanently disallowed $120 million of
that amount and ordered that the remaining $576 million be subject to an audit overseen by the CPUC staff, with the possibility that the Utility may seek recovery
in a future proceeding. On July 14, 2022, the CPUC approved a final decision approving a settlement agreement among the Utility and the active parties in the
proceeding, which authorizes a $356.3 million revenue requirement for the period of 2015 through 2022. For more information regarding this proceeding, see Note
12 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1.
Transmission Owner Rate Cases
Transmission Owner Rate Cases for 2015 and 2016 (the “TO16” and “TO17” rate cases, respectively)
As previously disclosed, on January 8, 2018, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion granting an appeal of the FERC’s decisions in the TO16 and
TO17 rate cases that had granted the Utility a 50-basis point ROE incentive adder for its continued participation in the CAISO. If the FERC concluded on remand
that the Utility should no longer be authorized to receive the 50-basis point ROE incentive adder, the Utility would incur a refund obligation of $1 million and
$8.5 million for TO16 and TO17, respectively. Those rate case decisions were remanded to the FERC for further proceedings consistent with the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals’ opinion.
34
On July 18, 2019, the FERC issued its order on remand reaffirming its prior grant of the Utility’s request for the 50-basis point ROE adder.
On March 17, 2020, the FERC issued its order denying requests for rehearing that were previously filed by several parties. On May 11, 2020, the CPUC and a
number of other parties filed a petition for review of the FERC’s orders in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
On March 17, 2022, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the FERC’s order granting the Utility the 50-basis point ROE incentive adder for CAISO
participation. The order would extinguish the Utility’s refund obligations that might have been required under the TO16 and TO17 rate cases had the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals not found in the FERC’s favor. On May 2, 2022, the CPUC filed a petition for panel rehearing of the order. On May 25, 2022, the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals issued a decision denying the request for rehearing and the request for a rehearing en banc.
Transmission Owner Rate Case for 2017 (the “TO18” rate case)
As previously disclosed, on July 29, 2016, the Utility filed its TO18 rate case with the FERC requesting a 2017 retail electric transmission revenue requirement of
$1.72 billion, a $387 million increase over the 2016 revenue requirement of $1.33 billion.  The forecasted network transmission rate base for 2017 was
$6.7 billion.  The Utility sought a ROE of 10.9%, which included an incentive component of 50-basis points for the Utility’s continuing participation in the
CAISO. 
On October 15, 2020, the FERC issued an order that, among other things, rejected the Utility’s direct assignment of common plant to FERC and required the
allocation of all common plant between CPUC and FERC jurisdiction be based on operating and maintenance labor ratios. The order reopened the record for the
limited purpose of allowing the participants to the proceeding an opportunity to present written evidence concerning the FERC’s revised ROE methodology
adopted in FERC Opinion No. 569-A, issued on May 21, 2020.
On December 17, 2020 and June 17, 2021, the FERC issued orders denying requests for rehearing submitted by the Utility and intervenors. In 2021, the Utility
filed four appeals. The appeals related to two issues: (1) impact of the Tax Act on TO18 rates in January and February 2018 and (2) aspects of the rehearing order
other than the Tax Act. The appeals have been consolidated and are currently being held in abeyance until the FERC addresses the ROE issue on rehearing.
As a result of an order denying rehearing on the common plant allocation, the Utility increased its regulatory liabilities for amounts previously collected during the
TO18, TO19, and TO20 rate case periods from 2017 through the third quarter of 2022 by approximately $384 million. A portion of these common plant costs are
expected to be recovered at the CPUC in a separate application and as a result, as of September 30, 2022, the Utility had recorded approximately $240 million to
Regulatory assets.
On March 17, 2022, the FERC issued a further order in the TO18 rate case proceeding finding that 9.26% is the just and reasonable base ROE for the Utility. With
the incentive component of 50-basis points for the Utility’s continuing participation in the CAISO, the resulting ROE would be 9.76%. As a result, the Utility
increased its regulatory liability for the potential refund for TO18 by $30 million in the first quarter of 2022. On April 18, 2022, the Utility sought rehearing of the
FERC’s determination of the base ROE finding. On May 16, 2022 and May 31, 2022, the Utility filed a compliance filing and a refund report describing the
adjustments made to the transmission revenue requirement, adjusted rates, and the calculation and mechanism of the refunds. On May 19, 2022, the FERC denied
all parties’ rehearing requests. The Utility has filed an appeal in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, as have the other parties that sought rehearing. The appeal is
being held in abeyance until the FERC issues a substantive order on rehearing on the ROE issue.
Aside from the ultimate outcome of the ROE rehearing request and the common plant allocation, the FERC’s orders in the TO18 proceeding are not expected to
result in a material impact on the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Some of the issues that will be decided in a final and
unappealable TO18 decision, including the common plant allocation, will also be incorporated into the Utility’s TO19 and TO20 rate cases. The ROE rehearing
request will not impact the TO20 rate case. See “Transmission Owner Rate Case Revenue Subject to Refund” in Note 12 of the Notes to the Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1.
35
Transmission Owner Rate Case for 2018 (the “TO19” rate case)
As previously disclosed, on July 27, 2017, the Utility filed its TO19 rate case with the FERC. On December 20, 2018, the FERC issued an order approving an all-
party settlement filed by the Utility. As part of the settlement, the TO19 revenue requirement will be set at 98.85% of the revenue requirement for TO18 that will be
determined upon the issuance of a final, non-appealable TO18 decision. On March 17, 2022, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the FERC’s order granting
the Utility the 50-basis point ROE incentive adder for CAISO participation and eliminating the refund obligation, and so the Utility was not obligated to make a
refund to customers based on this matter. See “Transmission Owner Rate Cases for 2015 and 2016” above for a discussion of the incentive adder. As a result of the
potential reduction to the TO18 revenue requirement, the Utility increased its regulatory liability for the potential refund for TO19 by $32 million in the first quarter
of 2022. On April 18, 2022, the Utility sought rehearing of the FERC’s determination of the base ROE finding.
Transmission Owner Rate Case for 2019 (the “TO20” rate case)
As previously disclosed, on October 1, 2018, the Utility filed its TO20 rate case with the FERC requesting approval of a formula rate for the costs associated with
the Utility’s electric transmission facilities. On November 30, 2018, the FERC issued an order accepting the Utility’s October 2018 filing, subject to hearings and
refund, and established May 1, 2019 as the effective date for rate changes. The FERC also ordered that the hearings be held in abeyance pending settlement
discussions among the parties.
On March 31, 2020, the Utility filed a partial settlement with the FERC, which the FERC approved on August 17, 2020. On October 15, 2020, the Utility filed a
settlement with the FERC resolving all of the remaining issues in the formula rate proceedings, including the Utility’s ROE, capital structure, depreciation rates, as
well as certain other aspects of the Utility’s formula rate. Specifically, the settlement establishes an all-in ROE of 10.45%; a fixed capital structure of 49.75%
common stock, 49.75% debt, and 0.5% preferred stock; and fixed depreciation rates for various categories of transmission facilities (represented by individual
FERC accounts). The term of the settlement continues until December 31, 2023 and the Utility will be required to file a replacement rate filing to be effective on
January 1, 2024.
On December 30, 2020, the FERC approved the settlement without modification.
Some of the issues that will be decided in a final and unappealable TO18 decision, including the common plant allocation, will also be incorporated into the
Utility’s TO20 rate case.
Other Regulatory Proceedings
Application for Post-Emergence SB 901 Securitization Transaction
SB 901, signed into law on September 21, 2018, requires the CPUC to establish a CHT, directing the CPUC to limit certain disallowances in the aggregate so that
they do not exceed the maximum amount that the Utility can pay without harming customers or materially impacting its ability to provide adequate and safe
service. SB 901 also authorizes the CPUC to issue a financing order that permits recovery, through the issuance of recovery bonds (also referred to as
“securitization”), of wildfire-related costs found to be just and reasonable by the CPUC and, only for the 2017 Northern California wildfires, any amounts in excess
of the CHT.
Pursuant to SB 901 and the CPUC’s methodology adopted in the CHT OIR, on April 30, 2020, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC seeking authorization
for a post-emergence transaction to recover $7.5 billion of 2017 wildfire claims costs through securitization that is designed to be rate neutral to customers through
the creation of a corresponding customer credit trust, with the proceeds used to pay or reimburse the Utility for the payment of wildfire claims costs associated with
the 2017 Northern California wildfires. Among other uses, as a result of the proposed transaction, the Utility would retire $6.0 billion of Utility debt. Specifically,
the application requested administration of the stress test methodology approved in the CHT OIR and a determination that $7.5 billion in 2017 catastrophic wildfire
costs and expenses are stress test costs and eligible for securitization. In this context, a securitization refers to a financing transaction where a special purpose
financing vehicle issues new debt that is secured by the proceeds of a new recovery charge to Utility customers. The application also proposed a customer credit
designed to equal the bond charges over the life of the bonds, which would insulate customers from the charge on customer bills associated with the bonds.
36
On April 23, 2021, the CPUC issued a decision finding that $7.5 billion of the Utility’s 2017 catastrophic wildfire costs and expenses are stress test costs that may
be financed through the issuance of recovery bonds pursuant to Public Utilities Code sections 850 et seq. and approving a structure for the transaction. As
requested, the decision authorized the Utility to establish a customer credit trust funded by PG&E Corporation’s shareholders, that will provide a monthly credit to
customers that is anticipated to equal the securitized charges such that the securitization is designed to be rate neutral to customers. Subject to retention of the
CPUC’s existing jurisdiction, the decision adopted a transaction structure comprised of four elements: (1) an initial shareholder contribution of $2.0 billion,
$1.0 billion of which was contributed in 2022 and $1.0 billion to be contributed in 2024; (2) up to $7.59 billion of additional contributions funded by certain
shareholder tax benefits; (3) a single CPUC review of the balance of the customer credit trust in 2040, with a single contingent supplemental shareholder
contribution, if needed, up to $775 million in 2040; and (4) sharing with customers 25% of any surplus of shareholder assets in the customer credit trust at the end
of the life of the trust.
In addition, on January 6, 2021, the Utility filed an additional application requesting that the CPUC issue a financing order authorizing the issuance of one or more
series of recovery bonds in connection with the post-emergence transaction to finance, using securitization, the $7.5 billion of claims associated with the 2017
Northern California wildfires, which the CPUC subsequently granted on May 11, 2021.
On February 28, 2022, the decision finding $7.5 billion of stress test costs eligible for securitization and the financing order authorizing the issuance of up to
$7.5 billion of recovery bonds became final and non-appealable. The financing order authorized the issuance of bonds through the end of 2022. PG&E Wildfire
Recovery Funding LLC issued $3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of Series 2022-A Recovery Bonds on May 10, 2022 and $3.9 billion aggregate principal
amount of Series 2022-B Recovery Bonds on July 20, 2022. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1.
Application for Second AB 1054 Securitization Transaction
AB 1054 provides that the first $5.0 billion expended in the aggregate by California’s three large electric IOUs on fire risk mitigation capital expenditures included
in their respective approved WMPs will be excluded from their respective equity rate bases. The $5.0 billion of capital expenditures has been allocated among the
large electric IOUs in accordance with their Wildfire Fund allocation metrics. The Utility’s allocation is $3.21 billion. AB 1054 contemplates that such capital
expenditures may be financed using a structure that securitizes a dedicated customer charge. Pursuant to an earlier financing order issued by the CPUC authorizing
the Utility’s initial application for AB 1054 securitization transaction, on November 12, 2021, PG&E Recovery Funding LLC issued approximately $860 million of
senior secured recovery bonds. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1.
On March 11, 2022, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC seeking authorization for a second transaction to securitize up to $1.7 billion of fire risk
mitigation capital expenditure amounts that have been or will be incurred by the Utility from 2019 through 2022. The $1.7 billion reflects $212 million recorded
and $1.16 billion forecasted capital expenditure amounts that were approved by the CPUC in the 2020 GRC and up to $350 million capital expenditure amounts
pending in the 2020 WMCE proceeding. On May 4, 2022, the $350 million of capital expenditure amounts were removed because the CPUC extended the schedule
in the 2020 WMCE proceeding such that a final decision approving such capital expenditure amounts in that proceeding was no longer expected prior to the
issuance of a financing order authorizing the second AB 1054 securitization transaction.  The final amount to be securitized will be based on actual recorded capital
expenditures incurred by the Utility prior to the securitization transaction.
The application requested that the CPUC issue a financing order authorizing one or more series of recovery bonds, determine that the issuance of the bonds and
collection through fixed recovery charges is just and reasonable, consistent with the public interest, would reduce rates on a present-value basis compared to
traditional utility financing mechanisms, and authorize the Utility to collect a non-bypassable charge sufficient to pay debt service on the recovery bonds.  The
application also requested that the CPUC exclude the securitized debt from the Utility’s ratemaking capital structure and adjust the Utility’s 2020 GRC revenue
requirements following the issuance of the recovery bonds. 
On August 5, 2022, the CPUC issued a final decision approving the securitization of up to approximately $1.4 billion of fire risk mitigation capital expenditures,
which is the amount requested in the application less the $350 million pending in the 2020 WMCE proceeding. The Utility plans to securitize these expenditures
later in 2022 or early 2023.
37
2020-2022 Wildfire Mitigation Plan
The Utility’s 2022 WMP was submitted on February 25, 2022. The 2022 WMP addressed the Utility’s wildfire safety programs and initiatives focused on reducing
the potential for catastrophic wildfires related to electrical equipment, reducing the potential for fires to spread and reducing the impact of PSPS events. On May
26, 2022, the OEIS issued a revision notice requiring the Utility to address 13 critical issues. The Utility responded to the revision notice on June 27, 2022, July 11,
2022, and July 26, 2022, respectively, as directed by OEIS. On October 6, 2022, OEIS issued a draft decision approving the Utility’s 2022 WMP. Public comments
on the draft decision were submitted to OEIS on October 26, 2022, and reply comments are due by November 7, 2022.
Electric Integrated Resource Planning and Related Procurement
On November 13, 2019, the CPUC issued a decision that takes a number of steps to address the potential for system RA shortages beginning in 2021. The decision
required incremental procurement of system-level qualifying RA capacity of 3,300 MWs by all load-serving entities (“LSEs”) operating within the CAISO’s
balancing area for the period from 2021 to 2023, of which the Utility is responsible for 716.9 MWs for its bundled customer portion. The decision required that at
least 50% of LSEs resource responsibilities come online by August 1, 2021, at least 75% by August 1, 2022, and the remaining by August 1, 2023. Additionally, the
decision directed the IOUs to act as the backstop procurement agent for community choice aggregators and energy service providers that choose not to voluntarily
self-procure or that fail to meet their procurement responsibilities after electing to self-provide their assigned MWs of system RA capacity under the decision.
On June 30, 2021, the CPUC issued a mid-term reliability decision to address incremental electric system reliability needs between 2024 and 2026 due to, in part,
the pending retirement of once-through-cooling natural gas plants in Southern California and the possible retirement of Diablo Canyon by requiring at least 11,500
MW of additional net qualifying capacity to be procured by LSEs. See section below entitled “Senate Bill 846” in Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives. The
decision set procurement requirements of 2,000 MW by 2023, an additional 6,000 MW by 2024, an additional 1,500 MW by 2025, and an additional 2,000 MW by
2026. The decision set the Utility’s share of the procurement at 2,302 MW of incremental net qualifying capacity.
On April 21, 2022, the CPUC approved a group of nine long-term RA agreements to meet a portion of the Utility’s procurement requirements under the CPUC’s
mid-term reliability decision. The agreements are each for a term of 15 years and collectively expected to supply 1,598.7 MW of lithium-ion energy storage
capacity with some projects expected to be operational in 2023 and others in 2024.
OIR to Revisit Net Energy Metering Tariffs
On August 17, 2020, the CPUC initiated a rulemaking proceeding to develop a successor to the existing NEM tariffs. The successor tariff is being developed
pursuant to the requirements of AB 327. Under AB 327, the successor to the existing NEM tariffs should provide customer-generators with credit or compensation
for electricity generated by their renewable facilities based on the value of that generation to all customers and allow customer-sited renewable generation to grow
sustainably among different types of customers.
On December 13, 2021, the CPUC issued a PD that would reduce the NEM subsidy for new non-California Alternate Rates for Energy Program (“CARE”) NEM
customers by about 80 percent for standalone solar and about 60 percent for solar-paired storage. Commercial customer NEM subsidy would be reduced by about
35 percent. Additionally, the PD would reduce the legacy period for existing non-CARE NEM customers from 20 years to 15 years after which such customers
would transition to the successor tariff. On May 9, 2022, the ALJ issued a ruling setting aside submission of the record to take comment on certain questions
regarding possible alternative tariff elements and community solar. On August 25, 2022, the CPUC extended the statutory deadline in this proceeding until August
27, 2023.
Application with Pacific Generation LLC for Approval to Transfer Non-Nuclear Generation Assets
On September 28, 2022, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC regarding the separation of the Utility’s non-nuclear generation assets into a newly formed,
stand-alone Utility subsidiary, Pacific Generation. The application, which was filed jointly with Pacific Generation, seeks to establish Pacific Generation as a
separate, rate-regulated utility subject to regulation by the CPUC and contemplates the potential sale of a minority interest in Pacific Generation to one or more
investors to be identified. The application proposes that the negotiated transaction documents would be submitted to the CPUC via an advice letter.
38
The application requests a final decision by July 2023 to transfer the Utility’s non-nuclear generation assets to Pacific Generation. PG&E Corporation and the
Utility have proposed to complete the potential minority ownership sale by the end of 2023.
Self-Reports to the CPUC
The Utility self-reports potential violations of certain requirements to the CPUC. The Utility could face penalties, enforcement actions, or other adverse legal or
regulatory consequences for these potential violations, including under the EOEP. The Utility is unable to predict the likelihood and the amount of potential fines or
penalties, if any, related to these matters.
Electric Asset Inspections
The Utility has notified the CPUC of various errors relating to inspections and maintenance of its electric assets or implementation of WMP initiatives. These
notices include missed inspections or the inability to locate records evidencing performance of inspections required under CPUC general orders 95 and 165
(including failure to perform inspections in compliance with general order 165 of approximately 55,000 poles in 2020) and errors regarding reporting meeting
targets set by the Utility’s 2020 WMP. In these notices, the Utility describes the failures and corrective actions the Utility is taking to remediate these issues and to
prevent recurrence. Among other corrective measures, the Utility has developed short-term and longer-term systemic corrective actions to address these errors,
including performing enhanced inspections for poles with outdated or incomplete general order 165 inspection records and strengthening the Utility’s asset registry,
as well as corrective actions regarding reporting on the progress toward WMP targets.
On October 26, 2022, the Utility notified the CPUC that the Utility’s procedure for wood pole replacements did not comply with CPUC requirements for
replacement of poles under certain conditions and, accordingly, in some instances, the Utility failed to replace wood poles with safety factors below the required
minimum. Among other short- and longer-term corrective measures, the Utility is replacing identified poles on a risk prioritized basis and revising its wood pole
replacement procedures in alignment with CPUC requirements.
The Utility continues to evaluate whether there are additional failures to comply with general orders 95 and 165 and the 2020 WMP, beyond those identified in
submitted self-reports. The Utility intends to update the CPUC upon completion of its reviews and to address any issues it identifies.
Subsurface Electric Ducts
On October 21, 2021, the Utility notified the CPUC of inconsistent application of the requirements to locate and mark empty subsurface electric ducts in
accordance with Government Code sections 4216(k), 4216(s) and 4216.3(a)(1)(A). On December 30, 2021, the Utility submitted a corrective action plan to the
SED and is implementing the plan.
LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY INITIATIVES
Vaccine Mandates
On September 9, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that would require certain COVID-19 precautions for government contractors and their
subcontractors, including mandatory employee vaccination. The requirements under the executive order are currently stayed in numerous states. The stay applicable
to contracts performed in California was lifted as of August 26, 2022. However, it is unclear if or when the federal government intends to implement the executive
order in California. The ultimate implementation of the executive order could result in workplace disruptions, employee attrition, and difficulty securing future
labor needs.
Assembly Bill 180
On June 30, 2022, the Governor of California signed AB 180, which authorized the California DWR to use up to $75 million to support contracts with the owners
of electric generating facilities pending retirement, such as Diablo Canyon, to fund, reimburse or compensate the owner for any costs, expenses or financial
commitments incurred to retain the future availability of such generating facilities pending further legislation.
39
Assembly Bill 205
On June 30, 2022, the Governor of California signed AB 205, which included authorization for additional incremental CAPP funding of $958 million for California
IOUs to be determined by the California Department of Community Services and Development. The Utility and the community choice aggregators in its territory
expect to receive $219 million to reduce the amounts owed by customer accounts in arrears.
Senate Bill 846
On September 2, 2022, the Governor of California signed SB 846, which supports the extension of operations at Diablo Canyon through no later than 2030, with
the potential for an earlier retirement date. Additionally, the State of California has authorized a loan of up to $1.4 billion pursuant to SB 846 to the Utility from the
DWR to support the extension of plant operations, which is in addition to the amount discussed in the AB 180 section, above. SB 846 further directs the Utility to
take steps to secure funds from the U.S. DOE’s Civil Nuclear Credit program, and any other potentially available federal funding, to repay the loan. The loan may
be forgiven under certain circumstances. On October 18, 2022, the Utility executed the loan agreement with DWR.
On September 2, 2022, the Utility applied for federal funding through the U.S. DOE’s Civil Nuclear Credit program. SB 846 provides that within 180 days of the
filing of the DOE application, the California Energy Commission, in consultation with the CAISO and the CPUC, shall make a determination in a public process of
whether the state’s electricity forecasts for the calendar years from 2024 through 2030 show potential for reliability deficiencies if Diablo Canyon operation is not
extended beyond 2025 and whether extending operations of Diablo Canyon to at least 2030 is prudent to ensure reliability in light of any potential for supply
deficiency. The Utility’s ARO associated with the decommissioning of Diablo Canyon could be materially impacted if the operations are extended beyond 2025.
During the period prior to extended operations, the bill authorizes a monthly performance-based disbursement equal to $7 for each megawatt-hour (“MWh”)
generated by Diablo Canyon. The performance-based disbursement will be paid from the loan proceeds authorized by SB 846 and is contingent upon the Utility’s
ongoing pursuit of extension of the operating period and continued safe and reliable Diablo Canyon operations. The performance-based disbursement cannot be
realized as shareholder profits or paid out as dividends.
During the period of extended operations and in lieu of a rate-based return on investment, the bill provides for a fixed payment of $50 million, in 2022 dollars, for
each of Diablo Canyon’s Unit 1 and Unit 2 for each year of extended operations, which is potentially subject to adjustment downward in the event of extended
unplanned outages. In addition, the bill authorizes a volumetric payment totaling $13, in 2022 dollars, for each MWh generated by Diablo Canyon during the period
of extended operations. The amount of the fixed and volumetric payments will be adjusted annually by the CPUC using CPUC-approved escalation methodologies
and adjustment factors. The volumetric payment cannot be realized as shareholder profits or paid out as dividends, to the extent it is not needed for Diablo Canyon.
The legislation includes language that limits use of the volumetric payment to investments in the system and for customers that address critical state priorities.
Senate Bill 884
On September 30, 2022, the Governor of California signed SB 884, which authorizes and expedites OEIS and CPUC review of a 10-year undergrounding plan.
Under SB 884, large electrical corporations may submit 10-year plans for undergrounding distribution infrastructure in Tier 2 or 3 high fire threat districts or
rebuild areas to OEIS. The plan must include an evaluation of project costs, projected economic benefits over the life of the assets, and any cost-containment
assumptions, including the economies of scale necessary to reduce wildfire risk and mitigation costs and establish a sustainable supply chain. OEIS will have up to
nine months to review and approve or deny the plan, and then the CPUC will have up to nine months to review and approve or deny the plan, including its costs.
Inflation Reduction Act
On August 16, 2022, the President of the United States signed the Inflation Reduction Act. The Inflation Reduction Act includes a 15% corporate alternative
minimum tax (“CAMT”) on the adjusted financial statement income (“AFSI”) of corporations with average AFSI exceeding $1 billion over a three-year period,
which will become effective January 1, 2023. Many aspects of the Inflation Reduction Act, including the CAMT, remain uncertain and the U.S. Department of the
Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service have been granted broad authority to enact regulations implementing its provisions. The law extends and modifies
existing tax credits and creates new tax credits for renewable and clean energy sources. PG&E Corporation and the Utility continue to evaluate the impact of the
law and its potential implications.
40
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
The Utility’s operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and permits relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and health of
the Utility’s personnel and the public.  These laws and requirements relate to a broad range of the Utility’s activities, including the remediation of hazardous wastes;
the reporting and reduction of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions; the discharge of pollutants into the air, water, and soil; the reporting of safety
and reliability measures for natural gas storage facilities; and the transportation, handling, storage, and disposal of spent nuclear fuel. See “Environmental
Remediation Contingencies” in Note 12 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, as well as “Item 1A. Risk
Factors” and Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of the 2021 Form 10-K.
RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES
PG&E Corporation, mainly through its ownership of the Utility, and the Utility are exposed to risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices, interest
rates, and counterparty credit.
The Utility actively manages market risk through risk management programs designed to support business objectives, discourage unauthorized risk-taking, reduce
commodity cost volatility, and manage cash flows.  The Utility uses derivative instruments only for risk mitigation purposes and not for speculative purposes.  The
Utility’s risk management activities include the use of physical and financial instruments such as forward contracts, futures, swaps, options, and other instruments
and agreements, most of which are accounted for as derivative instruments.  Some contracts are accounted for as leases.  The Utility manages credit risk associated
with its counterparties by assigning credit limits based on evaluations of their financial conditions, net worth, credit ratings, and other credit criteria as deemed
appropriate.  Credit limits and credit quality are monitored periodically.  These activities are discussed in detail in the 2021 Form 10-K.  There were no significant
developments to the Utility’s and PG&E Corporation’s risk management activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2022.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP involves the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the
recorded amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. PG&E Corporation and the Utility consider their accounting policies for regulatory assets and liabilities, loss contingencies associated
with environmental remediation liabilities and legal and regulatory matters, AROs, contributions to the Wildfire Fund, and pension and other post-retirement
benefit plans to be critical accounting policies. These policies are considered critical accounting estimates due, in part, to their complexity and because their
application is relevant and material to the financial position and results of operations of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and because these policies require the
use of material judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions. These accounting estimates and their key
characteristics are discussed in detail in the 2021 Form 10-K.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1: ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Organization and Basis of Presentation
PG&E Corporation is a holding company whose primary operating subsidiary is Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a public utility serving northern and central
California.  The Utility generates revenues mainly through the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas to customers.  The Utility is primarily regulated by the
CPUC and the FERC.  In addition, the NRC oversees the licensing, construction, operation, and decommissioning of the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities.
This quarterly report on Form 10-Q is a combined report of PG&E Corporation and the Utility.  PG&E Corporation’s Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements include the accounts of PG&E Corporation, the Utility, and other wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries.  The Utility’s Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements include the accounts of the Utility and its wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries.  All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.  The Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements apply to both PG&E Corporation and the Utility.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility
assess financial performance and allocate resources on a consolidated basis (i.e., the companies operate in one segment).
The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and in accordance with the interim period
reporting requirements of Form 10-Q and reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of PG&E Corporation’s and the
Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented.  The information at December 31, 2021 in the Condensed Consolidated
Balance Sheets included in this Form 10-Q was derived from the audited Consolidated Balance Sheets in Item 8 of the 2021 Form 10-K.  This Form 10-Q should
be read in conjunction with the 2021 Form 10-K. 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions relate to the
Utility’s regulatory assets and liabilities, wildfire-related liabilities, legal and regulatory contingencies, the Wildfire Fund, environmental remediation liabilities,
AROs, wildfire-related receivables, and pension and other post-retirement benefit plan obligations. Management believes that its estimates and assumptions
reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are appropriate and reasonable. A change in management’s estimates or assumptions could result in
an adjustment that would have a material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows during
the period in which such change occurred.
NOTE 2: BANKRUPTCY FILING
Chapter 11 Proceedings
On January 29, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility commenced the Chapter 11 Cases with the Bankruptcy Court. Prior to the Emergence Date, PG&E
Corporation and the Utility continued to operate their business as debtors-in-possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court.
57
On June 20, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Confirmation Order confirming the Plan filed on June 19, 2020. PG&E Corporation and the Utility emerged
from Chapter 11 on the Emergence Date of July 1, 2020. Certain parties filed notices of appeal with respect to the Confirmation Order, including that the Ad Hoc
Committee of Holders of Trade Claims (the “Trade Committee”) appealed the Confirmation Order’s holding awarding post-petition interest on general unsecured
claims at the federal judgment rate, which is 2.59%. The Trade Committee is seeking for its members to receive post-petition interest at the rates specified under
their contracts or the rate established under California state law, which is 10%. The Bankruptcy Court and the federal district court held that the Trade Committee’s
members are entitled to post-petition interest at the federal judgment rate. On June 8, 2021, the Trade Committee appealed the federal district court decision to the
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. On August 29, 2022, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the federal district court decision 2-1. On
September 12, 2022, the Utility filed a petition for en banc review, which was denied on October 5, 2022. The Utility plans to file a petition for a writ of certiorari
to the Supreme Court. PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it is probable that they will incur a loss in connection with the post-petition interest matter, but the
amount of that loss is not reasonably estimable at this time. If the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision is not reversed, then the matter would be remanded to the
Bankruptcy Court to evaluate the rate of interest for each individual contract, the conditions under which the contract rate applies, and whether payment of interest
under state law would be warranted for each contract and claimant. These proceedings therefore will require extensive discovery and motion practice before the
Bankruptcy Court with respect to each of these claims on a variety of contractual issues and equitable considerations. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable
to predict the timing and outcome of these proceedings or any further appeals.
Except as otherwise set forth in the Plan, the Confirmation Order or another order of the Bankruptcy Court, substantially all pre-petition liabilities were discharged
under the Plan.
Unresolved Chapter 11 Claims
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have received over 100,000 proofs of claim since January 29, 2019, of which approximately 80,000 were channeled to a trust for
the benefit of holders of certain subrogation claims (the “Subrogation Wildfire Trust”) and the Fire Victim Trust. The claims channeled to the Subrogation Wildfire
Trust and Fire Victim Trust will be resolved by such trusts, and PG&E Corporation and the Utility have no further liability in connection with such claims. PG&E
Corporation and the Utility continue their review and analysis of certain remaining claims, including asserted litigation claims, trade creditor claims, along with
other tax and regulatory claims, and therefore the ultimate liability of PG&E Corporation or the Utility for such claims may differ from the amounts asserted in
such claims. Allowed claims are paid in accordance with the Plan and the Confirmation Order. Amounts expected to be allowed are reflected as current liabilities in
the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Holders of certain claims may assert that they are entitled under the Plan or the Bankruptcy Code to pursue, or continue to pursue, their claims against PG&E
Corporation and the Utility on or after the Emergence Date, including claims arising from or relating to indemnification or contribution claims, including with
respect to the wildfire that began on November 8, 2018 near the city of Paradise, Butte County, California (the “2018 Camp fire”), the 2017 Northern California
wildfires, and the wildfire that began September 9, 2015 in Amador and Calaveras counties in Northern California (the “2015 Butte fire”).
In addition, Subordinated Debt Claims and HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims (each as defined in Note 11 below) continue to be pursued against PG&E
Corporation and the Utility in the claims reconciliation process in the Bankruptcy Court, and claims against certain former directors and current and former officers,
as well as certain underwriters, are being pursued in the purported securities class action that is further described in Note 11 under the heading “Securities Class
Action Litigation.”
In addition to filing objections in the Bankruptcy Court to claims that were subject to certain defenses which allowed PG&E Corporation and the Utility to file
objections expunging those claims on an omnibus basis, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are working to resolve disputed claims, including Subordinated Debt
Claims and HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims. By order of the Bankruptcy Court, the current deadline for PG&E Corporation and the Utility to object to
claims is December 19, 2022. On October 25, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed a motion requesting entry of an order further extending the deadline to
object to claims to September 15, 2023.
58
NOTE 3: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Revenue Recognition
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The Utility recognizes revenues when electricity and natural gas services are delivered.  The Utility records unbilled revenues for the estimated amount of energy
delivered to customers but not yet billed at the end of the period.  Unbilled revenues are included in accounts receivable on the Condensed Consolidated Balance
Sheets.  Rates charged to customers are based on CPUC and FERC authorized revenue requirements. Revenues can vary significantly from period to period
because of seasonality, weather, and customer usage patterns.
Regulatory Balancing Account Revenue
The CPUC authorizes most of the Utility’s revenues in the Utility’s GRCs, which occur every four years. CPUC and FERC rates decouple authorized revenue from
the volume of electricity and natural gas sales, so the Utility receives revenue equal to the amounts authorized by the relevant regulatory agencies. As a result, the
volume of electricity and natural gas sold does not have a direct impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results. The Utility recognizes revenues
that have been authorized for rate recovery, are objectively determinable and probable of recovery, and are expected to be collected within 24 months.  Generally,
electric and natural gas operating revenue is recognized ratably over the year. The Utility records a balancing account asset or liability for differences between
customer billings and authorized revenue requirements that are probable of recovery or refund.
The Utility also collects additional revenue requirements to recover costs that the CPUC has authorized the Utility to pass on to customers, including costs to
purchase electricity and natural gas, and to fund public purpose, demand response, and customer energy efficiency programs.  In general, the revenue recognition
criteria for pass-through costs billed to customers are met at the time the costs are incurred. The Utility records a regulatory balancing account asset or liability for
differences between incurred costs and customer billings or authorized revenue meant to recover those costs, to the extent that these differences are probable of
recovery or refund. As a result, these differences have no impact on net income.
59
The following table presents the Utility’s revenues disaggregated by type of customer:

This activity is primarily related to the change in unbilled revenue and amounts subject to refund, partially offset by other miscellaneous revenue items.
These amounts represent revenues authorized to be billed or refunded to customers.
Variable Interest Entities
A VIE is an entity that does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or whose
equity investors lack any characteristics of a controlling financial interest.  An enterprise that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is a primary beneficiary
and is required to consolidate the VIE.  
Consolidated VIEs
Receivables Securitization Program
The SPV was created in connection with the Receivables Securitization Program and is a bankruptcy remote, limited liability company wholly owned by the Utility,
and its assets are not available to creditors of PG&E Corporation or the Utility. Pursuant to the Receivables Securitization Program, the Utility sells certain of its
receivables and certain related rights to payment and obligations of the Utility with respect to such receivables, and certain other related rights to the SPV, which, in
turn, obtains loans secured by the receivables from financial institutions (the “Lenders”). The pledged receivables and the corresponding debt are included in
Accounts receivable, Other noncurrent assets, and Long-term debt, respectively, on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.(1)

The SPV is considered a VIE because its equity capitalization is insufficient to support its activities. The most significant activities that impact the economic
performance of the SPV are decisions made to manage receivables. The Utility is considered the primary beneficiary and consolidates the SPV as it makes these
decisions. No additional financial support was provided to the SPV during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 or is expected to be provided in the future
that was not previously contractually required. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the SPV had net accounts receivable of $3.3 billion, and
outstanding borrowings of $1.3 billion and $974 million, respectively, under the Receivables Securitization Program. For more information, see Note 5 below.
AB 1054 Securitization
PG&E Recovery Funding LLC is a bankruptcy remote, limited liability company wholly owned by the Utility, and its assets are not available to creditors of PG&E
Corporation or the Utility. Pursuant to the financing order for the first AB 1054 securitization transaction, the Utility sold its right to receive revenues from the non-
bypassable wildfire hardening fixed recovery charge (“Recovery Property”) to PG&E Recovery Funding LLC, which, in turn, issued recovery bonds secured by the
Recovery Property. On November 12, 2021, PG&E Recovery Funding LLC issued approximately $860 million of senior secured recovery bonds. The recovery
bonds were issued in three tranches: (1) approximately $266 million with an interest rate of 1.46% and is due July 15, 2033, (2) approximately $160 million with an
interest rate of 2.28% and is due January 15, 2038, and (3) approximately $434 million with an interest rate of 2.82% and is due July 15, 2048. The recovery bonds
are scheduled to pay principal and interest semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year. The final scheduled payment date is July 15, 2046. Amounts owed
to bondholders are included in Long-term debt and Long-term debt, classified as current, on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
PG&E Recovery Funding LLC is considered a VIE because its equity capitalization is insufficient to support its operations. The most significant activities that
impact the economic performance of PG&E Recovery Funding LLC are decisions made by the servicer of the Recovery Property. The Utility is considered the
primary beneficiary and consolidates PG&E Recovery Funding LLC as it acts in this role as servicer. No additional financial support was provided to PG&E
Recovery Funding LLC during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 or is expected to be provided in the future that was not previously contractually
required. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, PG&E Recovery Funding LLC had outstanding borrowings of $842 million and $860 million,
respectively.
SB 901 Securitization
PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC is a bankruptcy remote, limited liability company wholly owned by the Utility, and its assets are not available to creditors
of PG&E Corporation or the Utility. Pursuant to the financing order for the SB 901 securitization transaction, the Utility sold its right to receive revenues from the
non-bypassable fixed recovery charge (“SB 901 Recovery Property”) to PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC, which, in turn, issued recovery bonds secured by
the SB 901 Recovery Property.
PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC is considered a VIE because its equity capitalization is insufficient to support its operations. The most significant activities
that impact the economic performance of PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC are decisions made by the servicer of the SB 901 Recovery Property. The Utility
is considered the primary beneficiary and consolidates PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC as it acts in this role as servicer. No additional financial support was
provided to PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 or is expected to be provided in the future that was not
previously contractually required. On May 10, 2022, PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC issued $3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured
recovery bonds (the “Series 2022-A Recovery Bonds”). On July 20, 2022, PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC issued $3.9 billion aggregate principal amount
of senior secured recovery bonds (the “Series 2022-B Recovery Bonds”). As of September 30, 2022, PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC had outstanding
borrowings of $7.5 billion. For more information, see Note 6 below.
61
Non-Consolidated VIEs
Some of the counterparties to the Utility’s power purchase agreements are considered VIEs.  Each of these VIEs was designed to own a power plant that would
generate electricity for sale to the Utility.  To determine whether the Utility was the primary beneficiary of any of these VIEs as of September 30, 2022, it assessed
whether it absorbs any of the VIE’s expected losses or receives any portion of the VIE’s expected residual returns under the terms of the power purchase agreement,
analyzed the variability in the VIE’s gross margin, and considered whether it had any decision-making rights associated with the activities that are most significant
to the VIE’s performance, such as dispatch rights and operating and maintenance activities.  The Utility’s financial obligation is limited to the amount the Utility
pays for delivered electricity and capacity.  The Utility did not have any decision-making rights associated with any of the activities that are most significant to the
economic performance of any of these VIEs.  Since the Utility was not the primary beneficiary of any of these VIEs as of September 30, 2022, it did not
consolidate any of them.
Contributions to the Wildfire Fund Established Pursuant to AB 1054
PG&E Corporation and the Utility account for contributions to the Wildfire Fund by capitalizing an asset, amortizing to periods ratably based on an estimated
period of coverage, and incrementally adjusting for accelerated amortization as the level of coverage declines, as further described below. However, AB 1054 did
not specify a period of coverage for the Wildfire Fund; therefore, this accounting treatment is subject to significant accounting judgments and estimates. Since the
inception of the Wildfire Fund, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have estimated a period of coverage of 15 years. In estimating that initial period of coverage,
PG&E Corporation and the Utility started in 2019 with a dataset of 12 years of historical, publicly available fire-loss data for the period from 2007 to 2018 for
wildfires caused by electrical equipment to create Monte Carlo simulations of expected loss. For each year after 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility added the
fire-loss data for the preceding year to the dataset. The number of years of historic fire-loss data and the effectiveness of mitigation efforts by the California electric
utility companies are significant assumptions used to estimate the period of coverage. Other assumptions include the estimated costs to settle wildfire claims for
participating electric utilities including the Utility, the CPUC’s determinations of whether costs were just and reasonable in cases of electric utility-caused wildfires
and amounts required to be reimbursed to the Wildfire Fund, the impacts of climate change, the amount of future insurance coverage held by the electric utilities,
the FERC-allocable portion of loss recovery, and the future transmission and distribution equity rate base growth of participating electric utilities. These
assumptions create a high degree of uncertainty for the estimated useful life of the Wildfire Fund.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility evaluate and, where appropriate, update all assumptions quarterly. Changes in any of the assumptions could materially impact
the estimated period of coverage. PG&E Corporation and the Utility assess the Wildfire Fund asset for acceleration of the amortization of the asset in the event that
it is probable that a participating utility’s electrical equipment will be found to be the substantial cause of a catastrophic wildfire. In the first quarter of 2022, PG&E
Corporation and the Utility updated assumptions related to the mitigation effectiveness and historical fire loss dataset to align with the 2022 WMP. These updates
did not change the estimated period of coverage, which continues to be 15 years from the inception of the Wildfire Fund.
As of September 30, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded $193 million in Other current liabilities, $1.1 billion in Other non-current liabilities,
$461 million in Current assets - Wildfire Fund asset, and $5.0 billion in Non-current assets - Wildfire Fund asset in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
During the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Utility recorded amortization and accretion expense of $118 million and $162 million,
respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Utility recorded amortization and accretion expense of $353 million and
$399 million, respectively. The amortization of the asset, accretion of the liability, and applicable acceleration of the amortization of the asset is reflected in
Wildfire Fund expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. As of September 30, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility had recorded
$150 million in Other noncurrent assets for Wildfire Fund receivables related to the 2021 Dixie fire.
For more information, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of the 2021 Form 10-K and “Wildfire Fund under AB 1054” in
Note 11 below.
Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits
PG&E Corporation and the Utility sponsor a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan and cash balance plan. Both plans are included in “Pension Benefits”
below. Post-retirement medical and life insurance plans are included in “Other Benefits” below.

There was no material difference between PG&E Corporation and the Utility for the information disclosed above.
Voluntary Separation Program
In the second quarter of 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility enacted a VSP, which provides separation benefits to approximately 470 eligible employees who
voluntarily agreed to terminate their employment under the program. The VSP includes certain one-time cash payments and a credit to the employee’s retirement
health savings account. PG&E Corporation and the Utility account for the VSP as a special termination benefit with any costs of the special separation benefits
recorded upon each employee’s irrevocable acceptance. In the third quarter of 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded $77 million in Operating and
maintenance expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income related to the VSP one-time cash payments. In addition, during the third quarter of
2022, VSP-related credits to employee retirement health savings accounts totaled $22 million. This amount will be paid using the PG&E Corporation and Utility
postretirement medical plan trusts’ assets and does not impact income.
Financial Assets Measured at Amortized Cost – Credit Losses
PG&E Corporation and the Utility use the current expected credit loss model to estimate the expected lifetime credit loss on financial assets measured at amortized
cost. PG&E Corporation and the Utility evaluate credit risk in their portfolio of financial assets quarterly. As of September 30, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the
Utility identified the following significant categories of financial assets. (1)
(1) 
 (1)
(1) 
65
Trade Receivables
Trade receivables are represented by customer accounts. PG&E Corporation and the Utility record an allowance for doubtful accounts to recognize an estimate of
expected lifetime credit losses. The allowance is determined on a collective basis based on the historical amounts written-off and an assessment of customer
collectability. Furthermore, economic conditions are evaluated as part of the estimate of expected lifetime credit losses.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, expected credit losses of $126 million were recorded in Operating and maintenance expense on the Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Income for credit losses associated with trade and other receivables. The portion of expected credit losses that are deemed probable of
recovery are deferred to the RUBA, CPPMA and a FERC regulatory asset. As of September 30, 2022, the RUBA current balancing accounts receivable balance was
$109 million, and CPPMA and FERC long-term regulatory asset balances were $10 million and $10 million, respectively.
Other Receivables and Available-For-Sale Debt Securities
Insurance receivables are related to the liability insurance policies PG&E Corporation and the Utility carry. Insurance receivable risk is related to each insurance
carrier’s risk of defaulting on their individual policies. Wildfire Fund receivables are the funds available from the statewide fund established under AB 1054 for
payment of eligible claims related to the 2021 Dixie fire that exceed $1.0 billion and available insurance coverage. For more information, see Note 11 below.
Wildfire Fund receivables risk is related to the Wildfire Fund’s durability, which is a measurement of the claim-paying capacity. Lastly, PG&E Corporation and the
Utility are required to determine if the fair value is below the amortized cost basis for its available-for-sale debt securities (i.e., impairment). If such an impairment
exists and it does not otherwise result in a write-down, then PG&E Corporation and the Utility must determine whether a portion of the impairment is a result of
expected credit loss.
As of September 30, 2022, expected credit losses for insurance receivables, Wildfire Fund receivables, and available-for-sale debt securities were immaterial.
Asset Retirement Obligations
PG&E Corporation and the Utility account for an ARO at fair value in the period during which the legal obligation is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value
and its settlement date can be made. At the time of recording an ARO, the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the
related long-lived asset. The Utility recognizes a regulatory asset or liability for the timing differences between the recognition of expenses and costs recovered
through the ratemaking process. For more information, see Note 4 below.
To estimate its liability, the Utility uses a discounted cash flow model based upon significant estimates and assumptions about future decommissioning costs,
escalation rates, credit-adjusted risk-free rates, and the estimated date of decommissioning. For generation facilities, the Utility uses a probability-weighted,
discounted cash flow model. For nuclear generation facilities, the model also considers multiple decommissioning start-year scenarios. The estimated future cash
flows are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate that reflects the risk associated with the decommissioning obligation. The Utility performs detailed
studies of its nuclear generation facilities every three years in conjunction with the NDCTP, and updates its nuclear AROs accordingly, unless circumstances
warrant more frequent updates, based on its annual evaluation of cost escalation factors and probabilities assigned to various scenarios.
The ARO liability decreased from $6.4 billion as of December 31, 2020 to $5.3 billion as of December 31, 2021, primarily due to the decrease in nuclear
decommissioning ARO of $1.3 billion. In December 2021, the Utility filed its 2021 NDCTP application, which includes a Diablo Canyon site-specific
decommissioning cost estimate of $4.0 billion. Relative to the 2018 NDCTP decision, the 2021 NDCTP application resulted in a decommissioning cost estimate
that was decreased by $378 million on a non-escalated basis and $2.6 billion on an escalated basis. The escalated basis assumed that costs will be spread primarily
over 56 years, which represents the assumption for how much time will be required for physical decommissioning of Units 1 and 2. This decrease reflected
favorable changes in the scope and methods of planned decommissioning activities. In addition, the Utility’s escalation rates were filed as part of the NDCTP and
include factors for the Utility’s labor, materials, contract labor, burial costs, and other costs. Additionally, the average total escalation factor decreased, primarily
due to a reduction in the escalation factor for burial costs. Furthermore, the credit-adjusted risk-free rate, was greater in 2021 than in 2020.
66
The increase of $925 million in the 2022 ARO liability at September 30, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021 is primarily due to a realignment of the expected
timing of Diablo Canyon decommissioning work to be completed; the creation of a new liability for the permanently abandoned electric transmission lines in
connection with the Kincade SED Settlement (as defined in Note 11); increases in the probability that the Utility will be responsible for decommissioning certain
hydroelectric generation facilities; increases in the costs associated with retiring gas transmission pipelines; and increases in escalation factors.
On September 2, 2022, the Governor of California signed SB 846, which supports the extension of operations at Diablo Canyon through no later than 2030, with
the potential for an earlier retirement date. The Utility’s ARO associated with the decommissioning of Diablo Canyon could be materially impacted if the plant’s
operations are extended beyond 2025. As of September 30, 2022, the Utility did not adjust the ARO associated with the decommissioning of Diablo Canyon
because the Utility has not received approval of its application for federal funding through the U.S. DOE’s Civil Nuclear Credit program, and the Utility has not
received required federal and state licenses, permits, and approvals. PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect to adjust the ARO associated with the
decommissioning of Diablo Canyon, if at all, in the fourth quarter of 2022.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
Debt
In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20)
and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own
Equity, which simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and
contracts in an entity’s own equity. PG&E Corporation and the Utility adopted this ASU on January 1, 2022. There was no material impact on PG&E Corporation’s
or the Utility’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related disclosures resulting from the adoption of this ASU.

The amount the Utility may borrow under the Receivables Securitization Program is limited to the lesser of the facility limit and the facility availability. The facility limit fluctuates between $1.0 billion
and $1.5 billion depending on the time period. Further, the facility availability may vary based on the amount of accounts receivable that the Utility owns that are eligible for sale to the SPV and the
portion of those accounts receivable that are sold to the SPV that are eligible for advances by the lenders under the Receivables Securitization Program. As of September 30, 2022, the Receivables
Securitization Program had a maximum borrowing base of $1.3 billion and was fully drawn.
Utility
On March 31, 2022, the Utility prepaid in full the remaining portion of the 18-month tranche loans pursuant to an existing term loan credit agreement (the “2020
Utility Term Loan Credit Agreement”), in a principal amount equal to $298 million. As a result of such prepayment, the 2020 Utility Term Loan Credit Agreement
was terminated and is no longer outstanding.
On April 4, 2022, the Utility entered into a term loan credit agreement (the “2022A Utility Term Loan Credit Agreement”), comprised of 364-day tranche loans in
the aggregate principal amount of $500 million (the “364-Day 2022A Tranche Loans”). The 364-Day 2022A Tranche Loans have a maturity date of April 3, 2023
and bear interest based on the Utility’s election of either (1) Term SOFR (plus a 0.10% credit spread adjustment) plus an applicable margin of 1.25%, or (2) the
base rate plus an applicable margin of 0.25%. The Utility borrowed the entire amount of the 364-Day 2022A Tranche Loans on April 4, 2022. On July 21, 2022, the
364-Day 2022A Tranche Loans were prepaid in full with a portion of the proceeds from issuance of the Series 2022-B Recovery Bonds. As a result of such
prepayment, the 2022A Utility Term Loan Credit Agreement was terminated and is no longer outstanding.
On April 20, 2022, the Utility entered into a term loan credit agreement (the “2022B Utility Term Loan Credit Agreement”), comprised of 364-day tranche loans in
the aggregate principal amount of $125 million (the “364-Day 2022B Tranche Loans”) and two-year tranche loans in the aggregate principal amount of
$400 million (the “2-Year 2022B Tranche Loans”). The 364-Day 2022B Tranche Loans have a maturity date of April 19, 2023 and the 2-Year 2022B Tranche
Loans have a maturity date of April 19, 2024. The 364-Day 2022B Tranche Loans and the 2-Year 2022B Tranche Loans bear interest based on the Utility’s election
of either (1) Term SOFR (plus a 0.10% credit spread adjustment) plus an applicable margin of 1.25%, or (2) the base rate plus an applicable margin of 0.25%. The
Utility borrowed the entire amount of the 364-Day 2022B Tranche Loans and the 2-Year 2022B Tranche Loans on April 20, 2022.
On April 20, 2022, the Utility entered into an amendment to the Receivables Securitization Program to, among other things, add an uncommitted incremental
facility which, subject to certain conditions precedent, allows the SPV to request an increase in the facility limit by an additional $500 million to an aggregate
amount of $1.5 billion. On August 12, 2022, the SPV made such a request to increase the facility limit, and the facility limit was subsequently increased to
$1.5 billion on August 22, 2022. On September 30, 2022, the Utility entered into an amendment to the Receivables Securitization Program to, among other things,
(i) extend the scheduled termination date to September 30, 2024 and (ii) implement a seasonal facility limit. After giving effect to the amendment, the facility limit
fluctuates between $1.0 billion and $1.5 billion based on the periods set forth in the amendment.

(iv) $550 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% First Mortgage Bonds due 2052. The proceeds were used for the prepayment of a portion of the 18-month
tranche loans pursuant to the 2020 Utility Term Loan Credit Agreement, in an amount equal to $1.0 billion, and for general corporate purposes.
On June 8, 2022, the Utility issued $450 million aggregate principal amount of 4.950% First Mortgage Bonds due June 8, 2025, $450 million aggregate principal
amount of 5.450% First Mortgage Bonds due June 15, 2027, and $600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.90% First Mortgage Bonds due June 15, 2032. The
proceeds were used for the repayment of borrowings outstanding under the Utility’s revolving credit facility pursuant to the Utility Revolving Credit Agreement.
Intercompany Note Payable
As previously disclosed, on August 11, 2021, PG&E Corporation borrowed $145 million from the Utility under an interest bearing 364-day intercompany note due
August 10, 2022. On June 17, 2022, this loan was repaid in full.
NOTE 6: SB 901 SECURITIZATION AND CUSTOMER CREDIT TRUST
SB 901, signed into law on September 21, 2018, requires the CPUC to establish a CHT, directing the CPUC to limit certain disallowances in the aggregate, so that
they do not exceed the maximum amount that the Utility can pay without harming customers or materially impacting its ability to provide adequate and safe
service. SB 901 also authorizes the CPUC to issue a financing order that permits recovery, through the issuance of recovery bonds (also referred to as
“securitization”), of wildfire-related costs found to be just and reasonable by the CPUC and, only for the 2017 Northern California wildfires, any amounts in excess
of the CHT.
Pursuant to SB 901, on April 30, 2020, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC seeking authorization for a post-emergence transaction to finance, using
securitization, $7.5 billion of 2017 wildfire claims costs and create a corresponding customer credit trust that is designed to not impact the net amounts billed to
customers, with the proceeds of the securitization used to pay or reimburse the Utility for the payment of wildfire claims costs associated with the 2017 Northern
California wildfires. On April 23, 2021, the CPUC issued a decision finding that $7.5 billion of the Utility’s 2017 catastrophic wildfire costs and expenses are stress
test costs that may be financed through the issuance of recovery bonds pursuant to Public Utilities Code sections 850 et seq. (“CHT Decision”). As requested, the
decision authorized the Utility to establish a customer credit trust funded by PG&E Corporation’s shareholders that will provide a monthly credit to customers that
is anticipated to equal the fixed recovery charges such that the securitization is designed to be rate neutral to customers. Subject to retention of the CPUC’s existing
jurisdiction, the decision adopts a transaction structure comprised of four elements: (1) an initial shareholder contribution to the customer credit trust of $2.0 billion,
$1.0 billion of which was contributed in 2022 and $1.0 billion to be contributed in 2024; (2) up to $7.59 billion of additional contributions funded by certain
shareholder tax benefits; (3) a single CPUC review of the balance of the customer credit trust in 2040, with a single contingent supplemental shareholder
contribution, if needed, up to $775 million in 2040; and (4) sharing with customers 25% of any surplus of shareholder assets in the customer credit trust at the end
of the life of the trust.
72
On May 11, 2021, the CPUC issued a financing order authorizing the issuance of one or more series of recovery bonds in connection with the post-emergence
transaction to finance, using securitization, the $7.5 billion of claims associated with the 2017 Northern California wildfires. On February 28, 2022, the decision
finding $7.5 billion of stress test costs eligible for securitization and the financing order authorizing the issuance of up to $7.5 billion of recovery bonds became
final and non-appealable.
On May 10, 2022, PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC issued the Series 2022-A Recovery Bonds. The Series 2022-A Recovery Bonds were issued in five
tranches:
Tranche Amount Interest Rate Due Date
A-1 $ 540,000,000 3.594 % June 1, 2032
A-2 $ 540,000,000 4.263 % June 1, 2038
A-3 $ 360,000,000 4.377 % June 3, 2041
A-4 $ 1,260,000,000 4.451 % December 1, 2049
A-5 $ 900,000,000 4.674 % December 1, 2053
The net proceeds were used to fund the redemption of all $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Utility’s Floating Rate First Mortgage Bonds due June 16,
2022 on May 16, 2022 and the redemption of all $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of the Utility’s 1.75% First Mortgage Bonds due June 16, 2022 on May
16, 2022. The Utility used the remaining proceeds from the issuance of the Series 2022-A Recovery Bonds for the repayment of a portion of loans outstanding
under the Utility’s revolving credit facility pursuant to the Utility Revolving Credit Agreement.
On May 9, 2022, the Utility contributed $480 million to the customer credit trust. On July 19, 2022, the Utility contributed $520 million to the customer credit trust
in full satisfaction of the first $1.0 billion as required by the CHT decision.
On July 20, 2022, PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC issued the Series 2022-B Recovery Bonds. The Series 2022-B Recovery Bonds were issued in five
tranches:
Tranche Amount Interest Rate Due Date
B-1 $ 613,080,000 4.022 % June 1, 2033
B-2 $ 600,000,000 4.722 % June 1, 2039
B-3 $ 500,040,000 5.081 % June 3, 2043
B-4 $ 1,149,960,000 5.212 % December 1, 2049
B-5 $ 1,036,920,000 5.099 % June 1, 2054
The net proceeds were used to fund (1) the redemption of all $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of the Utility’s 1.367% First Mortgage Bonds due March 10,
2023 on July 25, 2022, (2) the prepayment of all $500 million of loans outstanding under the 2022A Utility Term Loan Credit Agreement, and (3) the repayment of
a portion of loans outstanding under the Utility’s revolving credit facility pursuant to the Utility Revolving Credit Agreement. The Utility also intends to use a
portion of the remaining proceeds to fund the redemption of all $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the Utility’s 3.25% First Mortgage Bonds due 2024.
Pursuant to the financing order, the Utility sold its right to receive revenues from the non-bypassable fixed recovery charge (“SB 901 Recovery Property”) to
PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC, which, in turn, issued the recovery bonds secured by the SB 901 Recovery Property. The fixed recovery charge is designed
to recover the full principal amount of the recovery bonds along with any associated interest and financing costs. In the context of the CHT decision, which is
intended to insulate customers from the fixed recovery charge, there is a customer credit which is designed to equal the recovery bond principal, interest, and
financing costs over the life of the recovery bonds. The customer credit is funded by the customer credit trust (see Note 10). The fixed recovery charges and
customer credits are presented on a net basis in Operating Revenues in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and had no net impact on Operating
Revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022.
73
Also pursuant to the CHT decision, during the quarter ended June 30, 2022, the Utility recorded a $5.5 billion SB 901 securitization regulatory asset (see Note 4),
reflecting PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC’s right to recover $7.5 billion in wildfire claims costs associated with the 2017 Northern California wildfires,
partially offset by the $2.0 billion in required upfront shareholder contributions to the customer credit trust. The Utility also recorded a $5.51 billion SB 901
securitization regulatory liability (see Note 4) during the quarter ended June 30, 2022, which represents certain shareholder tax benefits the Utility had recognized
as of that date that will be returned to customers. As the Fire Victim Trust sells the remaining shares it holds of PG&E Corporation common stock, the SB 901
securitization regulatory liability will increase, reflecting the recognition of additional income tax benefits, up to $7.59 billion as required in the CHT decision. As
these tax benefits are monetized, they will be contributed to the customer credit trust. The Utility expects to amortize the SB 901 securitization regulatory asset and
liability over the life of the recovery bonds, with such amortization expense reflected in Operating and maintenance expense in the Condensed Consolidated
Statements of Income. As a result of the initial recognition of the SB 901 securitization regulatory asset and liability, in the nine months ended September 30, 2022,
the Utility recorded a $40 million pre-tax charge, reflected in SB 901 securitization charge, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The SB 901
securitization charge, net is expected to increase in future periods as the aforementioned tax benefits are recognized and recorded within deferred income taxes.
The following table illustrates the financial statement impact upon establishment of the regulatory asset and liability:
(in millions)
SB 901 securitization regulatory assets $ 5,500 
SB 901 securitization regulatory liability (5,540)

NOTE 7: EQUITY
At the Market Equity Distribution Program
On April 30, 2021, PG&E Corporation entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (“Equity Distribution Agreement”) with Barclays Capital Inc., BofA
Securities, Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as sales agents and as forward sellers (in such capacities as applicable, the
“Agents” and the “Forward Sellers,” respectively), and Barclays Bank PLC, Bank of America, N.A., Credit Suisse Capital LLC and Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association, as forward purchasers (the “Forward Purchasers”), establishing an at the market equity distribution program, pursuant to which PG&E Corporation,
through the Agents, may offer and sell from time to time shares of PG&E Corporation’s common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $400 million.
PG&E Corporation has no obligation to offer or sell any of its common stock under the Equity Distribution Agreement and may at any time suspend offers under
the Equity Distribution Agreement.
The Equity Distribution Agreement provides that, in addition to the issuance and sale of shares of common stock by PG&E Corporation to or through the Agents,
PG&E Corporation may enter into forward sale agreements (collectively, the “Forward Sale Agreements”) pursuant to which the relevant Forward Purchaser will
borrow shares from third parties and, through its affiliated Forward Seller, offer a number of shares of common stock equal to the number of shares of common
stock underlying the particular Forward Sale Agreement.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, PG&E Corporation did not sell any shares pursuant to the Equity Distribution Agreement or any Forward Sale
Agreement. As of September 30, 2022, there was $400 million available under PG&E Corporation’s At the Market Equity Distribution Program for future
offerings.
Ownership Restrictions in PG&E Corporation’s Amended Articles
Under Section 382 of the IRC, if a corporation (or a consolidated group) undergoes an “ownership change,” net operating loss carryforwards and other tax
attributes may be subject to certain limitations (which could limit PG&E Corporation or the Utility’s ability to use these deferred tax assets to offset taxable
income). In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain shareholders (generally five percent shareholders, applying certain
look-through and aggregation rules) increases by more than 50% over such shareholders’ lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three
years). The Amended Articles limit Transfers (as defined in the Amended Articles) that increase a person’s or entity’s (including certain groups of persons)
ownership of PG&E Corporation’s equity securities to 4.75% or more prior to the Restriction Release Date (as defined in the Amended Articles) without approval
by the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation.
74
On July 8, 2021, PG&E Corporation, the Utility, ShareCo and the Fire Victim Trust entered into the Share Exchange and Tax Matters Agreement, pursuant to which
PG&E Corporation and the Utility made a “grantor trust” election for the Fire Victim Trust effective retroactively to the inception of the Fire Victim Trust. As a
result of the grantor trust election, shares of PG&E Corporation common stock owned by the Fire Victim Trust are treated as held by the Utility and, in turn
attributed to PG&E Corporation for income tax purposes. Consequently, any shares owned by the Fire Victim Trust, along with any shares owned by the Utility
directly, are effectively excluded from the total number of outstanding equity securities when calculating a person’s Percentage Stock Ownership (as defined in the
Amended Articles) for purposes of the 4.75% ownership limitation in the Amended Articles. Shares owned by ShareCo are also effectively excluded because
ShareCo is a disregarded entity for income tax purposes. For example, although PG&E Corporation had 2,465,443,675 shares outstanding as of October 20, 2022,
only 1,644,956,495 shares (that is, the number of outstanding shares of common stock less the number of shares held by the Fire Victim Trust, the Utility and
ShareCo) count as outstanding for purposes of the ownership restrictions in the Amended Articles. As such, based on the total number of outstanding equity
securities and taking into account the shares of PG&E Corporation common stock known to have been sold by the Fire Victim Trust as of October 20, 2022, a
person’s effective Percentage Stock Ownership limitation for purposes of the Amended Articles as of October 20, 2022 was 3.16% of the outstanding shares. On
January 31, 2022, April 14, 2022, and October 4, 2022, the Fire Victim Trust exchanged 40,000,000, 60,000,000, and 35,000,000 Plan Shares, respectively, for an
equal number of New Shares in the manner contemplated by the Share Exchange and Tax Matters Agreement; in each case, the Fire Victim Trust thereafter reported
that it sold the applicable New Shares. In the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Fire Victim Trust’s sale of PG&E Corporation common stock in the
aggregate amount of 100,000,000 shares resulted in an aggregate tax benefit of $337 million recorded in PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements. As of October 20, 2022, to the knowledge of PG&E Corporation, the Fire Victim Trust had sold 135,000,000 shares of PG&E
Corporation common stock in the aggregate.
As of the date of this report, it is more likely than not that PG&E Corporation has not undergone an ownership change and consequently, its net operating loss
carryforwards and other tax attributes are not limited by Section 382 of the IRC.
Dividends
On December 20, 2017, the Boards of Directors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility suspended quarterly cash dividends on both PG&E Corporation’s and the
Utility’s common stock, beginning the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as the Utility’s preferred stock, beginning the three-month period ending January 31, 2018.
On February 8, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Utility authorized the payment of all cumulative and unpaid dividends on the Utility’s preferred stock as of
January 31, 2022 totaling $59.1 million, which was paid on May 13, 2022, to holders of record on April 29, 2022 and declared a dividend on the Utility’s preferred
stock totaling $3.5 million, which was paid on May 15, 2022, to holders of record on April 29, 2022. On September 15, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Utility
declared dividends on its outstanding series of preferred stock totaling $3.5 million, to be payable on November 15, 2022, to holders of record on October 31, 2022.
On June 15, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Utility also reinstated the dividend on the Utility’s common stock and declared a common stock dividend of
$425 million that was paid to PG&E Corporation on June 17, 2022. On September 15, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Utility declared a common stock
dividend of $425 million that was paid to PG&E Corporation on September 16, 2022. No dividend is payable until declared by the Board of Directors of the Utility.
Subject to the dividend restrictions as described in Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of the 2021 Form 10-K, any decision to
declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation and will depend on, among other things,
results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation may deem
relevant. Pursuant to the Confirmation Order, PG&E Corporation may not pay dividends on shares of its common stock until it recognizes $6.2 billion in Non-
GAAP Core Earnings following the Emergence Date. “Non-GAAP Core Earnings” means GAAP earnings adjusted for certain non-core items. PG&E Corporation
currently is unable to predict when it will commence the payment of dividends on its common stock.
75
NOTE 8: EARNINGS PER SHARE
PG&E Corporation’s basic earnings per common share (“EPS”) is calculated by dividing the income available for common shareholders by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding.  PG&E Corporation applies the treasury stock method of reflecting the dilutive effect of outstanding share-based
compensation in the calculation of diluted EPS.  The following is a reconciliation of PG&E Corporation’s income available for common shareholders and weighted
average common shares outstanding for calculating diluted EPS:
Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,
(in millions, except per share amounts) 2022 2021 2022 2021
Income (loss) available for common shareholders $ 456 $ (1,091)$ 1,287 $ (574)
Weighted average common shares outstanding, basic 1,987 1,985 1,987 1,985 
Add incremental shares from assumed conversions:
Employee share-based compensation 8 — 8 — 
Equity Units 137 — 137 — 
Weighted average common shares outstanding, diluted 2,132 1,985 2,132 1,985 
Total income (loss) per common share, diluted $ 0.21 $ (0.55)$ 0.60 $ (0.29)
All potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the calculation of outstanding common shares on a diluted basis in periods where PG&E Corporation has
incurred a net loss.
For each of the periods presented above, the calculation of outstanding common shares on a diluted basis excluded an insignificant amount of options and securities
that were antidilutive.
NOTE 9: DERIVATIVES
Use of Derivative Instruments
The Utility is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its electricity and natural gas procurement activities. Procurement costs are recovered through rates.
The Utility uses both derivative and non-derivative contracts to manage volatility in customer rates due to fluctuating commodity prices. Derivatives include
contracts, such as power purchase agreements, forwards, futures, swaps, options, and CRRs that are traded either on an exchange or over-the-counter.
Derivatives are presented in the Utility’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and recorded at fair value and on a net basis in accordance with master netting
arrangements for each counterparty. The fair value of derivative instruments is further offset by cash collateral paid or received where the right of offset and the
intention to offset exist.
Price risk management activities that meet the definition of derivatives are recorded at fair value on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. These instruments
are not held for speculative purposes and are subject to certain regulatory requirements. The Utility expects to fully recover through rates all costs related to
derivatives under the applicable ratemaking mechanism in place as long as the Utility’s price risk management activities are carried out in accordance with CPUC
directives. Therefore, all unrealized gains and losses associated with the change in fair value of these derivatives are deferred and recorded within the Utility’s
regulatory assets and liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net realized gains or losses on commodity derivatives are recorded in the cost of
electricity or the cost of natural gas with corresponding increases or decreases to regulatory balancing accounts for recovery from or refund to customers.
The Utility elects the normal purchase and sale exception for eligible derivatives. Eligible derivatives are those that require physical delivery in quantities that are
expected to be used by the Utility over a reasonable period in the normal course of business, and do not contain pricing provisions unrelated to the commodity
delivered.  These items are not reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.

Cash inflows and outflows associated with derivatives are included in operating cash flows on the Utility’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Some of the Utility’s derivatives instruments, including power purchase agreements, contain collateral posting provisions tied to the Utility’s credit rating from
each of the major credit rating agencies, also known as a credit-risk-related contingent feature. Multiple credit agencies continue to rate the Utility below
investment grade, which results in the Utility posting additional collateral. As of September 30, 2022, the Utility satisfied or has otherwise addressed its obligations
related to the credit-risk related contingency features.
NOTE 10: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
PG&E Corporation and the Utility measure their cash equivalents, trust assets, and price risk management instruments at fair value.  A three-tier fair value
hierarchy is established that prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:
•Level 1 – Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.(1) (2)
(3)
(1) 
(2)
(3)
77
•Level 2 – Other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.
•Level 3 – Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activities.
The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis for PG&E Corporation and the Utility are summarized below.  Assets held in rabbi trusts are held
by PG&E Corporation and not the Utility.

Valuation Techniques
The following describes the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the assets and liabilities shown in the tables above.  There are no restrictions on
the terms and conditions upon which the investments may be redeemed. There were no material transfers between any levels for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2022 and 2021.
Trust Assets
Assets Measured at Fair Value
In general, investments held in the trusts are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and market volatility risks. Nuclear decommissioning trust assets,
customer credit trust assets and other trust assets are composed primarily of equity and fixed-income securities and also include short-term investments that are
money market funds classified as Level 1.
Global equity securities primarily include investments in common stock that are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and are classified as Level 1. (1)
 (2)
(1)
(2)
79
Fixed-income securities are primarily composed of U.S. government and agency securities, municipal securities, and other fixed-income securities, including
corporate debt securities.  U.S. government and agency securities primarily consist of U.S. Treasury securities that are classified as Level 1 because the fair value is
determined by observable market prices in active markets.  A market approach is generally used to estimate the fair value of fixed-income securities classified as
Level 2 using evaluated pricing data such as broker quotes, for similar securities adjusted for observable differences.  Significant inputs used in the valuation model
generally include benchmark yield curves and issuer spreads.  The external credit ratings, coupon rate, and maturity of each security are considered in the valuation
model, as applicable.
Assets Measured at NAV Using Practical Expedient
Investments in the nuclear decommissioning trusts and the long-term disability trust that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share practical expedient
have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy tables above.  The fair value amounts are included in the tables above in order to reconcile to the amounts
presented in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  These investments include commingled funds that are composed of equity securities traded publicly on
exchanges as well as fixed-income securities that are composed primarily of U.S. government securities, credit securities and asset-backed securities.
Price Risk Management Instruments
Price risk management instruments include physical and financial derivative contracts, such as power purchase agreements, forwards, futures, swaps, options, and
CRRs that are traded either on an exchange or over-the-counter. 
Power purchase agreements, forwards, and swaps are valued using a discounted cash flow model.  Exchange-traded futures that are valued using observable market
forward prices for the underlying commodity are classified as Level 1.  Over-the-counter forwards and swaps that are identical to exchange-traded futures, or are
valued using forward prices from broker quotes that are corroborated with market data are classified as Level 2.  Exchange-traded options are valued using
observable market data and market-corroborated data and are classified as Level 2. 
Long-dated power purchase agreements that are valued using significant unobservable data are classified as Level 3. These Level 3 contracts are valued using either
estimated basis adjustments from liquid trading points or techniques, including extrapolation from observable prices, when a contract term extends beyond a period
for which market data is available.  The Utility utilizes models to derive pricing inputs for the valuation of the Utility’s Level 3 instruments using pricing inputs
from brokers and historical data.
The Utility holds CRRs to hedge the financial risk of CAISO-imposed congestion charges in the day-ahead market.  Limited market data is available in the CAISO
auction and between auction dates; therefore, the Utility utilizes historical prices to forecast forward prices. CRRs are classified as Level 3.
Level 3 Measurements and Uncertainty Analysis
Inputs used and the fair value of Level 3 instruments are reviewed period-over-period and compared with market conditions to determine reasonableness.
Significant increases or decreases in any of those inputs would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value, respectively.  All reasonable costs related to Level
3 instruments are expected to be recoverable through rates; therefore, there is no impact to net income resulting from changes in the fair value of these instruments.

NOTE 11: WILDFIRE-RELATED CONTINGENCIES
Liability Overview
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have significant contingencies arising from their operations, including contingencies related to wildfires. A provision for a loss
contingency is recorded when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. PG&E Corporation
and the Utility evaluate which potential liabilities are probable and the related range of reasonably estimated losses and record a charge that reflects their best
estimate or the lower end of the range, if there is no better estimate. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a
range of losses is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. Loss contingencies are reviewed quarterly, and estimates are
adjusted to reflect the impact of all known information, such as negotiations (including those during mediations with claimants), discovery, settlements and
payments, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s provision for
loss and expense excludes anticipated legal costs, which are expensed as incurred. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations,
liquidity, and cash flows may be materially affected by the outcome of the following matters. (1)
(1)
83
The process for estimating losses associated with potential claims related to wildfires requires management to exercise significant judgment based on a number of
assumptions and subjective factors, including the factors identified above and estimates based on currently available information and prior experience with
wildfires. As more information becomes available, including from potential claimants as litigation or resolution efforts progress, management estimates and
assumptions regarding the potential financial impacts of wildfire events may change.
Potential liabilities related to wildfires depend on various factors, including the cause of the fire, contributing causes of the fire (including alternative potential
origins, weather- and climate-related issues, and forest management and fire suppression practices), the number, size and type of structures damaged or destroyed,
the contents of such structures and other personal property damage, the number and types of trees damaged or destroyed, attorneys’ fees for claimants, the nature
and extent of any personal injuries, including the loss of lives, the amount of fire suppression and clean-up costs, other damages the Utility may be responsible for
if found negligent, and the amount of any penalties, fines, or restitution that may be imposed by courts or other governmental entities.
Criminal charges have been filed against the Utility in connection with the 2020 Zogg fire. Under California law (including Penal Code section 1202.4), if the
Utility were convicted of any of the charges, the sentencing court must order the Utility to “make restitution to the victim or victims in an amount established by
court order” that is “sufficient to fully reimburse the victim or victims for every determined economic loss incurred as the result of” the Utility’s underlying
conduct, in addition to interest and the victim’s or victims’ attorneys’ fees. This requirement for full reimbursement of economic loss is not waivable by either the
government or the victims and is not offset by any compensation that the victims have received or may receive from their insurance carriers. If convicted of any of
the charges, the Utility could be subject to fines, penalties, and restitution to victims for their economic losses (including property damage, medical and mental
health expenses, lost wages, lost profits, attorneys’ fees and interest), as well as non-monetary remedies such as oversight requirements. In the event that the Utility
were convicted of certain charges in connection with the 2020 Zogg fire, the Utility currently believes that, depending on which charges it were to be convicted of,
its total losses associated with the fire would materially exceed the accrued estimated liabilities that PG&E Corporation and the Utility have recorded to reflect the
lower end of the range of the reasonably estimable range of losses. The Utility is currently unable to determine a reasonable estimate of the amount of such
additional losses. The Utility does not expect that any of its liability insurance would be available to cover restitution payments, if such payments were ordered by
the court presiding over the criminal proceeding in connection with the 2020 Zogg fire.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility are aware of numerous civil complaints related to the following wildfire events and expect that they may receive further such
complaints. The complaints include claims based on multiple theories of liability, including inverse condemnation, negligence, violations of the Public Utilities
Code, violations of the Health & Safety Code, premises liability, trespass, public nuisance and private nuisance. The plaintiffs in each action principally assert that
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s alleged failure to properly maintain, inspect, and de-energize their transmission lines was the cause of the relevant wildfire.
The timing and outcome for resolution of any such claims or investigations are uncertain. The Utility believes it will continue to receive additional information
from potential claimants in connection with these wildfire events as litigation or resolution efforts progress. Any such additional information may potentially allow
PG&E Corporation and the Utility to refine the estimates of their accrued losses and may result in changes to the accrual depending on the information received.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility intend to vigorously defend themselves against both criminal charges and civil complaints.
If the Utility’s facilities, such as its electric distribution and transmission lines, are judicially determined to be the substantial cause of the following matters, and the
doctrine of inverse condemnation applies, the Utility could be liable for property damage, business interruption, interest and attorneys’ fees without having been
found negligent. California courts have imposed liability under the doctrine of inverse condemnation in legal actions brought by property holders against utilities on
the grounds that losses borne by the person whose property was damaged through a public use undertaking should be spread across the community that benefited
from such undertaking, and based on the assumption that utilities have the ability to recover these costs through rates. Further, California courts have determined
that the doctrine of inverse condemnation is applicable regardless of whether the CPUC ultimately allows recovery by the utility for any such costs. The CPUC may
decide not to authorize cost recovery even if a court decision were to determine that the Utility is liable as a result of the application of the doctrine of inverse
condemnation. In addition to claims for property damage, business interruption, interest and attorneys’ fees under inverse condemnation, PG&E Corporation and
the Utility could be liable for fire suppression costs, evacuation costs, medical expenses, personal injury damages, punitive damages and other damages under other
theories of liability in connection with the following wildfire events, including if PG&E Corporation or the Utility were found to have been negligent.
84
PG&E Corporation and the Utility currently believe that it is reasonably possible that the amount of loss could be greater than the accrued estimated amounts but
are unable to reasonably estimate the additional loss and the upper end of the range because, as described above, there are a number of unknown facts and legal
considerations that may impact the amount of any potential liability, including the total scope and nature of claims that may be asserted against PG&E Corporation
and the Utility and the outcome of the criminal proceeding initiated against the Utility in connection with the 2020 Zogg fire and three other fires in Shasta County,
California. If the liability for wildfires were to exceed $1.0 billion in the aggregate in any Coverage Year, the Utility may be eligible to make a claim to the Wildfire
Fund under AB 1054 to satisfy settled or finally adjudicated eligible claims in excess of such amount, except that claims related to the 2019 Kincade fire would be
subject to the 40% limitation on the allowed amount of claims arising before emergence from bankruptcy. PG&E Corporation and the Utility intend to continue to
review the available information and other information as it becomes available, including evidence in the possession of Cal Fire, USFS, or the relevant district
attorney’s office, evidence from or held by other parties, claims that have not yet been submitted, and additional information about the nature and extent of personal
and business property damages and losses, the nature, number and severity of personal injuries, and information made available through the discovery process.
2019 Kincade Fire
According to Cal Fire, on October 23, 2019 at approximately 9:27 p.m. Pacific Time, a wildfire began northeast of Geyserville in Sonoma County, California (the
“2019 Kincade fire”), located in the service territory of the Utility. According to a Cal Fire incident update dated March 3, 2020, 3:35 p.m. Pacific Time, the 2019
Kincade fire consumed 77,758 acres and resulted in no fatalities, four first responder injuries, 374 structures destroyed, and 60 structures damaged. In connection
with the 2019 Kincade fire, state and local officials issued numerous mandatory evacuation orders and evacuation warnings. Based on County of Sonoma
information, PG&E Corporation and the Utility understand that the geographic zones subject to either a mandatory evacuation order or an evacuation warning
between October 23, 2019 and November 4, 2019 included approximately 200,000 persons.
On July 16, 2020, Cal Fire issued a press release with its determination that the Utility’s equipment caused the 2019 Kincade fire.
On April 6, 2021, the Sonoma County District Attorney’s Office (“the Sonoma D.A.”) filed the Kincade Complaint charging the Utility with five felonies and 28
misdemeanors related to the 2019 Kincade fire. On April 6, 2021, PG&E Corporation announced that it disputed the charges in the Kincade Complaint. It further
announced that it would accept Cal Fire’s finding that a Utility transmission line caused the 2019 Kincade fire. On May 11, 2021, the Utility filed a demurrer to 25
of the 33 counts contained in the Kincade Complaint. At a hearing on September 9, 2021, the Sonoma County Superior Court overruled the demurrer. On January
28, 2022, the Sonoma D.A. filed the Kincade Amended Complaint, which replaced two felonies with five different felonies and dropped six misdemeanor counts.
On April 8, 2022, the Utility and the Sonoma D.A. filed a civil stipulated judgment to resolve the criminal prosecution of the Utility in connection with the 2019
Kincade fire (the “Kincade Stipulation”) without the Utility admitting any liability. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Kincade Stipulation, the Utility will
pay a total of $20.25 million, which will not be recoverable through rates. Pursuant to the Kincade Stipulation, the Utility has also agreed to: (i) fill at least 80 new
internal employee positions headquartered in or serving Sonoma County; (ii) take certain wildfire mitigation actions consistent with its WMP; and (iii) engage an
independent compliance monitor for at least five years to monitor the Utility’s compliance with certain commitments under the Kincade Stipulation, including its
commitments to carry out vegetation management and equipment inspections in Sonoma County consistent with its WMP. After the Kincade Stipulation was
entered by the Sonoma County Superior Court, the Sonoma D.A. moved to dismiss the Kincade Amended Complaint with prejudice, and the court granted the
motion on April 11, 2022. In the first quarter of 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded $20.25 million within Other current liabilities and Other
noncurrent liabilities in connection with the Kincade Stipulation. As of September 30, 2022, $1.25 million has been paid pursuant to the Kincade Stipulation.
85
On December 2, 2021, the CPUC approved a settlement between the SED and the Utility (the “Kincade SED Settlement”). The Kincade SED Settlement resolves
SED’s investigation into the 2019 Kincade fire and provides for the removal of approximately 70 transmission lines or portions of lines that are no longer in service
and are de-energized but have not been removed as required by CPUC rules. The Kincade SED Settlement provides that the Utility (i) will pay $40 million to
California’s General Fund; (ii) will remove permanently abandoned transmission lines over a ten-year period; and (iii) must incur $85 million of the costs of such
work by December 31, 2024, and it may not seek recovery of this $85 million of costs. SED agreed to refrain from instituting enforcement proceedings against the
Utility for not having removed the lines previously. The Kincade SED Settlement states that it does not constitute an admission by the Utility of violations of
general orders or statutory requirements. In the first quarter of 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded $40 million within Other current liabilities in
connection with the Kincade SED Settlement. As of September 30, 2022, $20 million has been paid to California’s General Fund pursuant to the Kincade SED
Settlement. For the $85 million of cost of removal that the Utility will not seek recovery, the Utility recorded such disallowances in the first quarter of 2022 upon
identification of the facilities to be removed. On January 10, 2022, The Utility Reform Network (“TURN”) filed an application for rehearing of the Kincade SED
Settlement. On January 25, 2022, the Utility filed an opposition to the application for rehearing. On April 21, 2022, the CPUC granted TURN’s application for the
limited purpose of requiring SED to include in the decision approving the settlement an analysis of the appropriate penalty using the CPUC’s methodology and
denied TURN’s application in all other respects. On July 14, 2022, the CPUC approved the SED settlement.
As of October 20, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are aware of approximately 106 complaints on behalf of at least 2,670 plaintiffs related to the 2019
Kincade fire. The plaintiffs filed master complaints on July 16, 2021; PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s response was filed on August 16, 2021; and PG&E
Corporation and the Utility filed a demurrer with respect to the plaintiffs’ inverse condemnation claims. On December 10, 2021, the court overruled the demurrer.
The court scheduled trial for November 7, 2022, which it vacated on October 11, 2022.
In addition, on January 5, 2022, Cal Fire filed a complaint against the Utility in the coordinated proceeding seeking to recover approximately $90 million for fire
suppression and other costs incurred in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire. The Utility filed an answer to Cal Fire’s complaint on February 4, 2022.
On April 28, 2022, subrogation plaintiffs filed a motion for summary adjudication of their inverse condemnation cause of action in the coordinated proceeding. The
court scheduled a hearing on this summary adjudication motion for August 5, 2022, which it vacated on July 29, 2022. On October 26, 2022, PG&E Corporation
and the Utility entered an agreement with substantially all of the insurance subrogation plaintiffs to resolve their claims arising from the 2019 Kincade fire.
Additionally, on July 20, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed a motion for summary adjudication on individual plaintiffs’ claims for punitive damages.
The court scheduled a hearing on this summary adjudication motion for October 7, 2022, which it vacated on October 6, 2022.
Based on the current state of the law concerning inverse condemnation in California and the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility
as of the date of this filing, including Cal Fire’s determination of the cause and the information gathered as part of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s
investigation, PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it is probable that they will incur a loss in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire. PG&E Corporation and
the Utility recorded a liability in the aggregate amount of $800 million as of December 31, 2021 (before available insurance). Based on the facts and circumstances
available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility as of the date of filing the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, including the then-
current status of settlement discussions with certain subrogation entities and individuals, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded an additional charge in the
second quarter of 2022 for potential losses in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire of $150 million, for an aggregate liability of $950 million (before available
insurance). The aggregate liability remained unchanged as of September 30, 2022.
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s accrued estimated losses of $950 million do not include, among other things: (i) any amounts for potential penalties or fines
that may be imposed by courts or other governmental entities on PG&E Corporation or the Utility, (ii) any punitive damages, (iii) any amounts in respect of
compensation claims by federal or state agencies other than state fire suppression costs, (iv) evacuation costs, or (v) any other amounts that are not reasonably
estimable.
86
The following table presents changes in the lower end of the range of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s reasonably estimable range of losses for claims arising
from the 2019 Kincade fire since December 31, 2021.

The Utility has liability insurance coverage for third-party liability attributable to the 2019 Kincade fire in an aggregate amount of $430 million. As of September
30, 2022, the Utility recorded an insurance receivable for the full amount of $430 million.
2020 Zogg Fire
According to Cal Fire, on September 27, 2020, at approximately 4:03 p.m. Pacific Time, a wildfire began in the area of Zogg Mine Road and Jenny Bird Lane,
north of Igo in Shasta County, California (the “2020 Zogg fire”), located in the service territory of the Utility. According to a Cal Fire incident update dated October
16, 2020, 3:08 p.m. Pacific Time, the 2020 Zogg fire consumed 56,338 acres and resulted in four fatalities, one injury, 204 structures destroyed, and 27 structures
damaged.
On March 22, 2021, Cal Fire issued a press release with its determination that the 2020 Zogg fire was caused by a pine tree contacting electrical facilities owned
and operated by the Utility located north of the community of Igo.
On September 24, 2021, the Shasta County District Attorney’s Office filed the Zogg Complaint charging the Utility with 11 felonies and 20 misdemeanors related
to the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2020 Daniel fire, the 2020 Ponder fire, and the 2021 Woody fire. On September 24, 2021, PG&E Corporation and the Utility announced
that they disputed the charges in the Zogg Complaint. They further announced that they would accept Cal Fire’s finding that a Utility electric line caused the 2020
Zogg fire, even though PG&E Corporation and the Utility did not have access to all of the evidence that Cal Fire gathered. On November 18, 2021, the Utility filed
a demurrer to 10 of the 31 counts contained in the Zogg Complaint. At a hearing on May 2, 2022, the Shasta County Superior Court overruled the demurrer. On
June 9, 2022, the Utility entered a plea of not guilty to all of the charges in the Zogg Complaint. The preliminary hearing is scheduled to begin on January 18, 2023.
On October 25, 2022, the SED issued a proposed administrative enforcement order alleging that the Utility violated CPUC regulations and Public Utilities Code
Section 451 in connection with the CPUC’s investigation of the 2020 Zogg fire. The proposed order recommends a penalty of $155 million. By November 21,
2022, the Utility must either agree to pay the penalty upon adoption of a final order by the CPUC or request a hearing on the proposed order. PG&E Corporation
and the Utility believe it is probable that they will incur a loss, but the amount of that loss is not reasonably estimable at this time because the Utility intends to
request a hearing to challenge the proposed order.
Various other entities, which may include other law enforcement agencies, may also be investigating the fire. It is uncertain when any such investigations will be
complete.
As of October 20, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are aware of approximately 28 complaints on behalf of at least 496 plaintiffs related to the 2020 Zogg
fire. The plaintiffs seek damages that include wrongful death, property damage, economic loss, punitive damages, exemplary damages, attorneys’ fees and other
damages. The plaintiffs filed master complaints on August 6, 2021, and PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s answer was filed on September 7, 2021, and PG&E
Corporation and the Utility filed a demurrer with respect to the plaintiffs’ inverse condemnation claims. On December 10, 2021, the court overruled the demurrer.
In addition, on March 18, 2022, Cal Fire filed a complaint against the Utility in the coordinated proceeding seeking to recover approximately $34.5 million for fire
suppression and other costs incurred in connection with the 2020 Zogg fire. The Utility filed an answer to Cal Fire’s complaint on May 3, 2022. On October 4,
2022, the court granted the parties’ stipulated motion to continue the February 6, 2023 trial date to May 30, 2023.
Based on the current state of the law concerning inverse condemnation in California and the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility
as of the date of this filing, including Cal Fire’s determination of the cause and the information gathered as part of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s
investigation, PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it is probable that they will incur a loss in connection with the 2020 Zogg fire. PG&E Corporation and the
Utility recorded a liability in the aggregate amount of $375 million as of December 31, 2021 (before available insurance). The aggregate liability remained
unchanged as of September 30, 2022.
87
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s accrued estimated losses do not include, among other things: (i) any amounts for potential penalties, fines, or restitution that
may be imposed by courts or other governmental entities on PG&E Corporation or the Utility, (ii) any punitive damages, (iii) any amounts in respect of
compensation claims by federal or state agencies other than state fire suppression costs, (iv) evacuation costs, or (v) any other amounts that are not reasonably
estimable.
The following table presents changes in the lower end of the range of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s reasonably estimable range of losses for claims arising
from the 2020 Zogg fire since December 31, 2021.

Balance at September 30, 2022 $ 74 
The Utility has liability insurance for third-party liability attributable to the 2020 Zogg fire in an aggregate amount of $611 million. As of September 30, 2022, the
Utility recorded an insurance receivable for $347 million for probable insurance recoveries in connection with the 2020 Zogg fire, which equals the $375 million
probable loss estimate less an initial self-insured retention of $60 million, plus $32 million in legal fees incurred. Recovery under the Utility’s wildfire insurance
policies for the 2021 Dixie fire will reduce the amount of insurance proceeds available for the 2020 Zogg fire by the same amount up to $600 million and vice
versa.
2021 Dixie Fire
According to the Cal Fire Investigation Report on the 2021 Dixie fire (the “Cal Fire Investigation Report”), on July 13, 2021, at approximately 5:07 p.m. Pacific
Time, a wildfire began in the Feather River Canyon near Cresta Dam (the “2021 Dixie fire”), located in the service territory of the Utility. According to the Cal Fire
Investigation Report, the 2021 Dixie fire consumed 963,309 acres and resulted in 1,311 structures destroyed and 94 structures damaged (including 763 residential
homes, 12 multi-family homes, 8 commercial residential homes, 148 nonresidential commercial structures, and 466 detached structures), and four first-responder
injuries. The Cal Fire Investigation Report does not attribute a fatality that was previously published in an October 25, 2021 Cal Fire incident report to the 2021
Dixie fire.
On January 4, 2022, Cal Fire issued a press release with its determination that the 2021 Dixie fire was caused by a tree contacting electrical distribution lines owned
and operated by the Utility. On June 7, 2022, the Utility received a copy of the Cal Fire Investigation Report, which states that the fire ignited when a tree fell and
contacted electrical distribution lines owned and operated by the Utility, and the Cal Fire Investigation Report has been made publicly available. The Cal Fire
Investigation Report alleges that the Utility acted negligently in its response to the initial outage and fault that caused the 2021 Dixie fire. The Cal Fire Investigation
Report also alleges that the subject tree had visible outward signs of damage and decay which would have been noticeable at the ground level, and that a brief
visual inspection should have discovered the decay. The Utility has not been provided the report of Cal Fire’s expert arborist. Based on the information currently
available to the Utility, including its inspection records, operating and inspection protocols and procedures, implementation of those protocols and procedures, and
day-of-event response, the Utility believes its personnel acted reasonably (within the meaning of the applicable prudency standard discussed under “Regulatory
Recovery” below) given the information available at the time and followed applicable policies and protocols both before ignition and in the day-of-event response.
While an intervenor in a future cost recovery proceeding may argue the Cal Fire Investigation Report itself creates serious doubt with respect to the reasonableness
of the Utility’s conduct, PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not believe the report identifies sufficient facts to shift the burden of proof applicable in a proceeding
for cost recovery to the Utility. (See “Regulatory Recovery” and “Wildfire Fund under AB 1054”). PG&E Corporation and the Utility disagree with the allegations
of the Cal Fire Investigation Report and plan to vigorously contest them. However, if the CPUC or the FERC were to reach conclusions similar to those of the Cal
Fire Investigation Report, it may determine that the Utility had been imprudent, in which case some or all of its costs recorded to the WEMA would not be
recoverable, the Utility would not be able to recover costs through FERC TO rates, or the Utility would be required to reimburse the Wildfire Fund for the costs and
expenses that are allocated to it.
88
The District Attorneys’ Offices of Butte County, Plumas County, Shasta County, Lassen County and Tehama County (the “North State Counties”), as well as the
SED and OEIS, have been investigating the fire; various other entities, which may include other state and federal law enforcement agencies, may also be
investigating the fire. The United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of California issued a subpoena for documents as well. PG&E Corporation and
the Utility are cooperating with the investigations. Except for the investigation by the District Attorneys of the North State Counties, it is uncertain when any other
such investigations will be complete. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are also conducting their own investigation into the cause of the 2021 Dixie fire. This
investigation is ongoing, and PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not have access to the evidence in the possession of Cal Fire or other third parties.
On April 11, 2022, the Utility and the District Attorneys of the North State Counties filed a civil stipulated judgment to permanently resolve any potential state
criminal prosecution of the Utility in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire (the “Dixie Stipulation”) without the Utility admitting any liability, and the Court entered
the judgment on that same date. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Dixie Stipulation, the Utility will pay a total of $34.75 million, which will not be
recoverable through rates. Pursuant to the Dixie Stipulation, the Utility has also agreed to: (i) fill at least 80 new internal employee positions headquartered in or
serving the North State Counties; (ii) take certain other wildfire mitigation actions consistent with its WMP; (iii) engage an independent compliance monitor for
five years to monitor the Utility’s compliance with certain commitments under the Dixie Stipulation, including its commitments to carry out vegetation
management and equipment inspections in the North State Counties consistent with its WMP; (iv) take good faith steps to initiate mediations with certain
commercial timber landowners; and (v) initiate an expedited compensation program under which individuals whose homes, including mobile homes, were
destroyed by the 2021 Dixie fire can submit an electronic claim form and supporting documentation, and the Utility will make them an offer to resolve their loss
based on an objective, pre-determined valuation framework. The Dixie Stipulation also permanently resolved any potential state criminal prosecution of the Utility
in connection with the 2021 Fly fire, which merged with the 2021 Dixie fire. In the first quarter of 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded $34.75 million
within Other current liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities in connection with the Dixie Stipulation. As of September 30, 2022, $29.75 million has been paid
pursuant to the Dixie Stipulation.
As of October 20, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are aware of approximately 54 complaints on behalf of at least 1,444 plaintiffs related to the 2021 Dixie
fire and expect that they may receive further such complaints. The plaintiffs seek damages that include property damage, economic loss, punitive damages,
exemplary damages, attorneys’ fees and other damages. On July 27, 2022, the court set a trial date of June 5, 2023.
Based on the current state of the law concerning inverse condemnation in California and the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility
as of the date of this filing, including Cal Fire’s determination of the cause and the information gathered as part of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s
investigation, PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it is probable that they will incur a loss in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire. PG&E Corporation and the
Utility recorded a liability in the aggregate amount of $1.15 billion as of the year ended December 31, 2021 (before available recoveries). The aggregate liability
remained unchanged as of September 30, 2022.
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s accrued estimated losses of $1.15 billion represent only claims based on the doctrine of inverse condemnation and do not
include, among other things: (i) any amounts for potential penalties or fines that may be imposed by courts or other governmental entities on PG&E Corporation or
the Utility, (ii) any punitive damages, (iii) any amounts in respect of compensation claims by federal or state agencies including for state or federal fire suppression
costs and damages related to federal land, (iv) evacuation costs, or (v) any other amounts that are not reasonably estimable.
As noted above, the aggregate estimated liability for claims in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire does not include potential claims for fire suppression costs from
federal, state, county, or local agencies or damage to land and vegetation in national parks or national forests. As to these damages, PG&E Corporation and the
Utility have not concluded that a loss is probable. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are currently unable to reasonably estimate the range of possible losses for any
such claims due to, among other factors, incomplete information as to facts pertinent to potential claims and defenses, as well as facts that would bear on the
amount, type, and valuation of vegetation loss, potential reforestation, habitat loss, and other resources damaged or destroyed by the 2021 Dixie fire. PG&E
Corporation and the Utility believe, however, that such losses could be significant with respect to fire suppression costs due to the size and duration of the 2021
Dixie fire and corresponding magnitude of fire suppression resources dedicated to fighting the 2021 Dixie fire and with respect to claims for damage to land and
vegetation in national parks or national forests due to the very large number of acres of national park and national forests that were affected by the 2021 Dixie fire.
According to the Cal Fire Investigation Report, over $650 million of costs had been incurred in suppressing the 2021 Dixie fire. The Utility currently estimates that
the fire burned approximately 70,000 acres of national parks and approximately 685,000 acres of national forests.
89
The following table presents changes in the lower end of the range of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s reasonably estimable range of losses for claims arising
from the 2021 Dixie fire since December 31, 2021.
Loss Accrual (in millions)
Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 1,150 
Accrued Losses — 
Payments (32)
Balance at September 30, 2022 $ 1,118 
The Utility has liability insurance coverage for third-party liability in an aggregate amount of $900 million. Recovery under the Utility’s wildfire insurance policies
for the 2020 Zogg fire will reduce the amount of insurance proceeds available for the 2021 Dixie fire by the same amount up to $600 million and vice versa. As of
September 30, 2022, the Utility recorded an insurance receivable of $553 million for probable insurance recoveries in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire, which
equals the aggregate $900 million of available insurance coverage for third-party liability attributable to the 2021 Dixie fire, less the $347 million insurance
receivable recorded in connection with the 2020 Zogg fire.
As of September 30, 2022, the Utility recorded a Wildfire Fund receivable of $150 million for probable recoveries in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire. AB 1054
provides that the CPUC may allocate costs and expenses in the application for cost recovery in full or in part taking into account factors both within and beyond the
utility’s control that may have exacerbated the costs and expenses, including humidity, temperature, and winds. PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe that,
even if it found that the Utility acted unreasonably, the CPUC would nevertheless authorize recovery in part. See “Wildfire Fund under AB 1054” below. The
Utility also recorded a $106 million reduction to its regulatory liability for wildfire-related claims costs that were determined to be probable of recovery through the
FERC TO formula rate and a $367 million regulatory asset for costs that were determined to be probable of recovery through the WEMA. See “Regulatory
Recovery” below. Decreases in the amount of the insurance receivable for the 2021 Dixie fire may also increase the amount that is probable of recovery through the
FERC TO formula rate and the WEMA. An immaterial increase was recorded in the third quarter of 2022.
2022 Mosquito Fire
On September 6, 2022, at approximately 6:17 p.m. Pacific Time, the Utility was notified that a wildfire had ignited near OxBow Reservoir in Placer County,
California (the “2022 Mosquito fire”), located in the service territory of the Utility. The National Wildfire Coordinating Group’s InciWeb incident overview dated
October 25, 2022 at 6:30 p.m. Pacific Time indicated that the 2022 Mosquito fire had consumed approximately 76,788 acres at that time. It also indicated no
fatalities, no injuries, 13 structures damaged, and 78 structures destroyed and that the fire was 100% contained.
The USFS has indicated to the Utility an initial assessment that the fire started in the area of the Utility’s power line on National Forest System lands and that the
USFS is conducting a criminal investigation into the 2022 Mosquito fire. On September 24, 2022, the USFS removed and took possession of one of the Utility’s
transmission poles and attached equipment. The USFS has not issued a determination as to the cause.
The cause of the 2022 Mosquito fire remains under investigation by the USFS and the US Department of Justice (“DOJ”), and PG&E Corporation and the Utility
are cooperating with the investigation. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have received document and information requests from the DOJ. It is uncertain when any
such investigations will be complete. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are also conducting their own investigation into the cause of the 2022 Mosquito fire. This
investigation is preliminary, and PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not currently have access to the evidence in the possession of the USFS, DOJ, or other third
parties.
As of October 20, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are aware of approximately three complaints on behalf of at least 34 plaintiffs related to the 2022
Mosquito fire and expect that they may receive further such complaints. The plaintiffs seek damages that include property damage, economic loss, punitive
damages, exemplary damages, attorneys’ fees and other damages.
Based on the current state of the law concerning inverse condemnation in California and the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility
as of the date of this filing, including the information gathered as part of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s investigation, PG&E Corporation and the Utility
believe it is probable that they will incur a loss in connection with the 2022 Mosquito fire. PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded a liability in the aggregate
amount of $100 million as of the quarter ended September 30, 2022 (before available recoveries).
90
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s accrued estimated losses represent only claims based on the doctrine of inverse condemnation and do not include, among
other things: (i) any amounts for potential penalties or fines that may be imposed by courts or other governmental entities on PG&E Corporation or the Utility, (ii)
any punitive damages, (iii) any amounts in respect of compensation claims by federal or state agencies including for state or federal fire suppression costs and
damages related to federal land, (iv) evacuation costs, or (v) any other amounts that are not reasonably estimable. The Utility’s accrued estimated losses also do not
include any assumptions regarding offsetting recoveries from third-parties (outside of the Utility’s insurers).
As noted above, the aggregate estimated liability for claims in connection with the 2022 Mosquito fire does not include potential claims for fire suppression costs
from federal, state, county, or local agencies or damage to land and vegetation in national parks or national forests. As to these damages, PG&E Corporation and the
Utility have not concluded that a loss is probable. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are currently unable to reasonably estimate the range of possible losses for any
such claims due to, among other factors, incomplete information as to facts pertinent to potential claims and defenses, as well as facts that would bear on the
amount, type, and valuation of vegetation loss, potential reforestation, habitat loss, and other resources damaged or destroyed by the 2022 Mosquito fire.
The Utility has liability insurance coverage for third-party liability in an aggregate amount of $940 million, with a deductible of $60 million. As of September 30,
2022, the Utility recorded an insurance receivable of $40 million for probable insurance recoveries in connection with the 2022 Mosquito fire. As of September 30,
2022, the Utility also recorded a $10 million regulatory asset for costs that were determined to be probable of recovery through the FERC TO formula rate and a
$50 million regulatory asset for costs that were determined to be probable of recovery through the WEMA. See “Regulatory Recovery” below.
Loss Recoveries
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have recovery mechanisms available for wildfire liabilities including from insurance, customers, and the Wildfire Fund. PG&E
Corporation and the Utility record a receivable for a recovery when it is deemed probable that recovery of a recorded loss will occur, and the Utility can reasonably
estimate the amount or its range. While the Utility plans to seek recovery of all insured losses, it is unable to predict the ultimate amount and timing of such
recoveries. For more information on the applicable facts and circumstances of the corresponding wildfires, see “2019 Kincade Fire,” “2020 Zogg Fire,” “2021
Dixie Fire,” and “2022 Mosquito Fire.”
Total probable recoveries for the 2021 Dixie fire and the 2022 Mosquito fire as of September 30, 2022 are:
Potential Recovery Source (in millions) 2022 Mosquito fire 2021 Dixie fire
Insurance $ 40 $ 553 
FERC TO rates 10 106 
WEMA 50 367 
Wildfire Fund — 150 
Probable recoveries at September 30, 2022 $ 100 $ 1,176 
The Utility could be subject to significant liability in connection with these wildfire events. If such liability is not recoverable from insurance or the other
mechanisms described in this section, it could have a material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity,
and cash flows.
Insurance
Insurance Coverage
In April 2022, the Utility purchased approximately $340 million in wildfire liability insurance coverage for the period from April 1, 2022 to April 1, 2023, at a cost
of approximately $263 million. Additionally, the Utility purchased approximately $600 million in wildfire liability insurance in August 2022 for the period from
August 1, 2022 to August 1, 2023, at a cost of approximately $516 million. The Utility’s wildfire liability insurance is subject to an initial self-insured retention of
$60 million.
91
In April 2022, the Utility purchased approximately $725 million in non-wildfire liability coverage for the period from April 1, 2022 to April 1, 2023 at a cost of
approximately $154 million. The Utility’s non-wildfire liability insurance is subject to an initial self-insured retention of $10 million. As of September 30, 2022,
PG&E Corporation and the Utility had prepaid insurance of $673 million, reflected in Other current assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Various coverage limitations applicable to different insurance layers could result in material uninsured costs in the future depending on the amount and type of
damages resulting from covered events.
In the Utility’s 2020 GRC proceeding, the CPUC also approved a settlement agreement provision that allows the Utility to recover annual insurance costs for up to
$1.4 billion in excess liability insurance coverage. For more information about the RTBA, see Note 4 above.
Insurance Receivable
Through September 30, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded $430 million, $347 million, $553 million, and $40 million for probable insurance
recoveries in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, and the 2022 Mosquito fire, respectively. PG&E Corporation and the
Utility intend to seek full recovery for all insured losses.
The balances for insurance receivables with respect to wildfires are included in Other accounts receivable in PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheets:
Insurance Receivable (in millions) 2022 Mosquito fire 2021 Dixie fire 2020 Zogg fire 2019 Kincade fire Total
Balance at December 31, 2021 $ — $ 563 $ 270 $ 414 $ 1,247 
Accrued insurance recoveries $ 40 (10) 10 — 40 
Reimbursements — — (142) (25) (167)
Balance at September 30, 2022 $ 40 $ 553 $ 138 $ 389 $ 1,120 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the accrued insurance recoveries decreased for the 2021 Dixie fire with a corresponding increase to the 2020 Zogg fire for $10 million.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility resolved property related claims in the amount of $468 million, of which
approximately $239 million is reflected in Accounts receivable, other on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (excluded from the table above).
Regulatory Recovery
Section 451.1 of the Public Utilities Code provides that when determining an application to recover costs and expenses arising from a covered wildfire, the CPUC
shall allow cost recovery if the costs and expenses are just and reasonable (i.e., the “prudency standard”). AB 1054 states that a utility with a valid safety
certification for the time period in which a covered wildfire ignited “shall be deemed to have been reasonable” unless “a party to the proceeding creates a serious
doubt as to the reasonableness of the [Utility’s] conduct,” in which case the burden shifts to the utility to prove its conduct was reasonable. The Utility had a valid
safety certification at the time of the 2021 Dixie fire and the 2022 Mosquito fire, so any analysis of cost recovery starts with this presumption. AB 1054 also allows
the CPUC to allocate costs and expenses “in full or in part taking into account factors both within and beyond the Utility’s control that may have exacerbated the
costs and expenses, including humidity, temperature, and winds.” (1)
(1) 
92
The Utility’s recorded receivables under the WEMA and with respect to the Wildfire Fund take into account this revised prudency standard and the presumption of
reasonableness of the Utility’s conduct, based on the Utility’s interpretation of AB 1054 and the information currently available to the Utility. Although the concept
of “serious doubt” has been applied in other regulatory proceedings, such as FERC proceedings, the revised prudency standard under AB 1054 has not been
interpreted or applied by the CPUC and it is possible that the CPUC could interpret or apply the standard differently, in which case the Utility may not be able to
recover all or a portion of expenses that it has recorded as a receivable.
FERC TO rates
The Utility recognizes income and reduces its regulatory liability for potential refund through future FERC TO formula rates for a portion of the third-party
wildfire-related claims in excess of insurance coverage. The FERC presumes that a utility’s expenditures are prudent and permits cost recovery unless a party raises
a serious doubt regarding the prudency of such costs. The allocation to transmission customers was based on a FERC-approved allocation factor as determined in
the formula rate. Based on information currently available to the Utility regarding the 2021 Dixie fire and the 2022 Mosquito fire, as of September 30, 2022, the
Utility recorded reductions of $106 million and $10 million, respectively, to its regulatory liability for wildfire-related claims costs that were determined to be
probable of recovery through the FERC TO formula rate.
WEMA
The WEMA provides for tracking of incremental wildfire claims, outside legal costs, and insurance premiums above those authorized in rates. With respect to
wildfire claims and outside legal costs, the Utility expects that the same prudency standard as applies to the Wildfire Fund would also be applied in any CPUC
review of an application filed by the Utility seeking recovery of such costs recorded to the WEMA. See “Wildfire Fund under AB 1054” below. As of September
30, 2022, based on information currently available to the Utility, incremental wildfire claims-related costs for the 2021 Dixie fire and the 2022 Mosquito fire were
determined to be probable of recovery and the Utility recorded $367 million and $50 million, respectively, as regulatory assets in the WEMA. Cost recovery for
incremental insurance premiums is addressed through balancing account mechanisms.
Wildfire Fund under AB 1054
On July 12, 2019, the California governor signed into law AB 1054, a bill which provides for the establishment of a statewide fund that will be available for eligible
electric utility companies to pay eligible claims for liabilities arising from wildfires occurring after July 12, 2019 that are caused by the applicable electric utility
company’s equipment, subject to the terms and conditions of AB 1054. Each of California’s large electric IOUs has elected to participate in the Wildfire Fund.
Eligible claims are claims for third-party damages resulting from any such wildfires, limited to the portion of such claims that exceeds the greater of (i) $1.0 billion
in the aggregate in any Coverage Year and (ii) the amount of insurance coverage required to be in place for the electric utility company pursuant to Section 3293 of
the Public Utilities Code, added by AB 1054. The accrued Wildfire Fund receivable as of September 30, 2022 reflects an expectation that the Coverage Year will be
based on the calendar year with coverage limited to the 2021 Dixie fire. For 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have elected a Coverage Year that commences
on January 1, 2022 at 12:01 a.m. Pacific Time and ends on December 31, 2022 at 12:00 a.m. Pacific Time.
Electric utility companies that draw from the Wildfire Fund will only be required to reimburse amounts that are determined by the CPUC in a proceeding for cost
recovery not to be just and reasonable, applying the prudency standard in AB 1054 and after allocating costs and expenses based on relevant factors that may have
exacerbated the costs and expenses, subject to a disallowance cap equal to 20% of the IOU’s transmission and distribution equity rate base. For the Utility, the
disallowance cap would be approximately $3.0 billion based on its 2022 equity rate base, which is subject to adjustment based on changes in the Utility’s total
transmission and distribution equity rate base and would apply for a three calendar-year period. The disallowance cap is inapplicable in certain circumstances,
including if the Wildfire Fund administrator determines that the electric utility company’s actions or inactions that resulted in the applicable wildfire constituted
“conscious or willful disregard for the rights and safety of others,” or the electric utility company failed to maintain a valid safety certification. Costs that the CPUC
determines to be just and reasonable in accordance with the prudency standard in AB 1054 will not be reimbursed to the Wildfire Fund, resulting in a draw-down of
the Wildfire Fund.
93
Before the expiration of any current safety certification, the Utility must request a new safety certification from the OEIS, which the Utility expects to be issued
within 90 days if the Utility has provided documentation that it has satisfied the requirements for the safety certification pursuant to Section 8389(e) of the Public
Utilities Code, added by AB 1054. An issued safety certification is valid for 12 months or until a timely request for a new safety certification is acted upon,
whichever occurs later. The safety certification is separate from the CPUC’s enforcement authority and does not preclude the CPUC from pursuing remedies for
safety or other applicable violations. On January 31, 2022, the OEIS approved the Utility’s 2021 application and issued the Utility’s 2021 safety certification. On
September 14, 2022, the Utility submitted its 2022 safety certificate request.
The Wildfire Fund and disallowance cap will be terminated when the amounts therein are exhausted. The Wildfire Fund is expected to be capitalized with (i)
$10.5 billion of proceeds of bonds supported by a 15-year extension of the DWR charge to customers, (ii) $7.5 billion in initial contributions from California’s
three large electric IOUs and (iii) $300 million in annual contributions paid by California’s three large electric IOUs for a 10-year period.
The Wildfire Fund will only be available for payment of eligible claims so long as there are sufficient funds remaining in the Wildfire Fund. Such funds could be
depleted more quickly than expected, including as a result of claims made by California’s other participating electric utility companies. The Wildfire Fund is
available to pay for the Utility’s eligible claims arising as of July 12, 2019, the effective date of AB 1054, subject to a limit of 40% of the allowed amount of such
claims arising between the effective date of AB 1054 and the Utility’s emergence from Chapter 11. The 40% limit does not apply to eligible claims that arise after
the Utility’s emergence from Chapter 11.
As of September 30, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded $150 million in Other noncurrent assets for Wildfire Fund receivables related to the 2021
Dixie fire.
For more information see Note 3 above.
Wildfire-Related Securities Claims, Fire Victim Trust D&O Claims and Potential Insurance Recoveries
As further described under the headings “Wildfire-Related Securities Class Action” and “Wildfire-Related Securities Claims—Claims in the Bankruptcy Court
Process,” PG&E Corporation and the Utility face certain wildfire-related securities claims related to the 2017 Northern California wildfires and other claims related
to the 2018 Camp fire and the PSPS program in the Chapter 11 Cases (i.e., the Subordinated Claims), and certain former directors, current and former officers, and
underwriters of certain note offerings face wildfire-related securities claims in the District Court action. These securities claims are collectively referred to in this
section as the “Wildfire-Related Securities Claims.”
Based on discussions with certain holders of Wildfire-Related Securities Claims, as well as the terms of the FVT D&O Claims Settlement Agreement (as defined
below) and the settlement agreements with carriers of the D&O Insurance policies, PG&E Corporation believes it is probable that it will incur a loss in connection
with the Wildfire-Related Securities Claims. As of September 30, 2022 and each as further described below:
•For the Wildfire-Related Securities Claims, based on discussions with the plaintiffs in the consolidated securities action, PG&E Corporation recorded a
liability in the aggregate amount of $300 million (before available insurance), which represents its best estimate of probable losses for such claims, though
actual losses could be greater or less than this estimate.
•For the Insurance Coverage Claims, PG&E Corporation entered into agreements with certain of its D&O Insurance carriers to settle the majority of the
Insurance Coverage Claims and recorded an insurance receivable for $272 million. PG&E Corporation records a receivable for a recovery when it is
deemed probable that recovery of a recorded loss will occur, and PG&E Corporation can reasonably estimate the amount or its range.
•For the Fire Victim Trust D&O Claims, the parties entered into a settlement agreement (the “FVT D&O Claims Settlement Agreement”) pursuant to which
PG&E Corporation, the Utility, and certain former director and officer defendants will cause $117 million to be paid to the Fire Victim Trust from D&O
insurance policy proceeds, subject to certain conditions. Proceeds from the D&O Insurance coverage will be paid first to the Fire Victim Trust for the Fire
Victim Trust D&O Claims, and then PG&E Corporation intends to apply the remaining proceeds to the Wildfire-Related Securities Claims. Accordingly,
PG&E Corporation recorded a $117 million payable to the Fire Victim Trust in the second quarter of 2022.
94
As a result, PG&E Corporation believes it is probable that it will incur a net loss of $145 million in connection with these matters. As of September 30, 2022, the
net loss is reflected in Other income (expense), net on PG&E Corporation’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.
In the event that one or more of the settlements in these matters does not become effective, some or all parties are expected to continue to litigate, and at least some
of the amounts of PG&E Corporation’s expected liabilities will remain uncertain.
Wildfire-Related Derivative Litigation
Two purported derivative lawsuits alleging claims for breach of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment were filed in the San Francisco County Superior Court on
November 16, 2017 and November 20, 2017, respectively, naming as defendants certain then-current and former members of the boards of directors and certain
then-current and former officers of PG&E Corporation and the Utility. PG&E Corporation and the Utility were named as nominal defendants. These lawsuits were
consolidated by the court on February 14, 2018 and denominated In Re California North Bay Fire Derivative Litigation (now re-captioned Trotter v. Williams et
al.). On April 13, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. On January 28, 2019, this matter was automatically stayed by PG&E Corporation’s and the
Utility’s commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s rights with respect to PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s claims, if any,
directly or indirectly related to any of the Fires (as defined in the Plan) against former officers and directors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility were assigned to
the Fire Victim Trust under the Plan (the “Fire Victim Trust D&O Claims”). Any such recovery was limited to the extent of any D&O Insurance policy proceeds
paid by any insurance carrier on behalf of PG&E Corporation or the Utility for amounts owed pursuant to their indemnification obligations in connection with such
causes of action. On March 8, 2021, the court granted a stipulation by the parties to substitute the trustee for the Fire Victim Trust as the plaintiff.
On December 24, 2018, a separate derivative lawsuit, entitled Bowlinger v. Chew, et al. (now captioned Trotter v. Chew, et al.), was filed in San Francisco Superior
Court, alleging claims for breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, corporate waste, and unjust enrichment in connection with the 2018 Camp fire against certain
then-current and former officers and directors, and naming PG&E Corporation and the Utility as nominal defendants. On November 5, 2020, the court entered a
stipulation and order to substitute the trustee for the Fire Victim Trust as the plaintiff.
On February 24, 2021, the trustee filed an amended complaint in the Trotter v. Chew action, asserting two direct claims for breach of fiduciary duty against certain
of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s former directors and officers. Neither PG&E Corporation nor the Utility was a party to the action. On March 30, 2021, the
Trotter v. Chew and Trotter v. Williams actions were consolidated. On April 26, 2021, the defendants filed demurrers to the amended complaint, which the court
sustained in part and overruled in part on November 8, 2021. On November 18, 2021, the trustee filed a second amended complaint. On December 21, 2021, the
defendants filed demurrers to the second amended complaint, which the court overruled. On March 10, 2022, the defendants filed motions for summary judgment.
On July 26, 2022, PG&E Corporation, the Utility, certain former director and officer defendants, and the Fire Victim Trust entered into the FVT D&O Claims
Settlement Agreement, pursuant to which PG&E Corporation, the Utility, and certain former director and officer defendants will cause $117 million to be paid to
the Fire Victim Trust from D&O Insurance policy proceeds, and the Fire Victim Trust will release, among other things, any claims related to the assigned claims
and the pursuit of the Trotter v. Chew action. Pursuant to the Plan, the settlement amount must be paid solely from insurance proceeds from the “Side B” D&O
Insurance coverage. Accordingly, the settlement is contingent upon, among other things, a final order from the Bankruptcy Court approving settlements among
PG&E Corporation, the Utility, and their D&O Insurance carriers (see “Indemnification Obligations and D&O Insurance Coverage” below). The settlement is also
contingent upon an order from the Bankruptcy Court approving a settlement of the claims described under the heading “Wildfire-Related Securities Class Action”
below, subject to certain exceptions. As a result of the FVT D&O Claims Settlement Agreement, the Trotter v. Chew action has been stayed. As of September 30,
2022, PG&E Corporation recorded a $117 million payable to the Fire Victim Trust.
On January 25, 2019, a separate purported derivative lawsuit, entitled Hagberg v. Chew, et al., was filed in San Francisco Superior Court, alleging claims for breach
of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, corporate waste, and unjust enrichment in connection with the 2018 Camp fire against certain then-current and former officers
and directors, and naming PG&E Corporation and the Utility as nominal defendants. The plaintiff filed a request to dismiss this action, and on October 12, 2022,
the court dismissed the action.

Securities Class Action Litigation
Wildfire-Related Securities Class Action
In June 2018, two purported securities class actions were filed in the District Court, naming PG&E Corporation and certain of its then-current and former officers
as defendants, entitled David C. Weston v. PG&E Corporation, et al. and Jon Paul Moretti v. PG&E Corporation, et al., respectively. The complaints alleged
material misrepresentations and omissions in various PG&E Corporation public disclosures related to, among other things, vegetation management and other issues
connected to the 2017 Northern California wildfires. The complaints asserted claims under Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5
promulgated thereunder, and sought unspecified monetary relief, interest, attorneys’ fees and other costs. Both complaints identified a proposed class period of
April 29, 2015 to June 8, 2018. On September 10, 2018, the court consolidated both cases, and the litigation is now denominated In re PG&E Corporation
Securities Litigation, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Case No. 18-03509. The court also appointed PERA as lead plaintiff. PERA filed a
consolidated amended complaint on November 9, 2018. On December 14, 2018, PERA filed a second amended consolidated complaint to add allegations regarding
the 2018 Camp fire, including allegations regarding transmission line safety and the PSPS program.
Due to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the proceedings were automatically stayed as to PG&E Corporation and the Utility.
On February 22, 2019, a third purported securities class action was filed in the District Court, entitled York County on behalf of the York County Retirement Fund, et
al. v. Rambo, et al. (the “York County Action”). The complaint named as defendants certain then-current and former officers and directors, as well as the
underwriters of four public offerings of notes from 2016 to 2018. Neither PG&E Corporation nor the Utility was named as a defendant. The complaint asserted
claims under Section 11 of the Securities Act based on alleged material misrepresentations and omissions in connection with the note offerings related to, among
other things, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s vegetation management and wildfire safety measures. On May 7, 2019, the York County Action was
consolidated with In re PG&E Corporation Securities Litigation.
On May 28, 2019, the plaintiffs in the consolidated securities actions filed a third amended consolidated class action complaint, which includes the claims asserted
in the previously filed actions and names as defendants PG&E Corporation, the Utility, certain current and former officers and former directors, and the
underwriters. On August 28, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court denied PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s request to extend the stay to the claims against the officer,
director, and underwriter defendants. On October 4, 2019, the officer, director, and underwriter defendants filed motions to dismiss the third amended complaint,
which motions are under submission with the District Court. The securities actions have been enjoined as to PG&E Corporation and the Utility pursuant to the Plan
with any such claims submitted through a proof of claim to be resolved by the Bankruptcy Court as part of the claims reconciliation process in the Chapter 11
Cases. On April 29, 2021, the District Court issued a notice of intent to stay this action pending completion of the claims procedures in the bankruptcy proceedings.
PERA filed objections to the notice of intent to stay on May 28, 2021. PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed a response to PERA’s objections on June 10, 2021,
the officer, director, and underwriter defendants filed a response to PERA’s objections on June 11, 2021, and PERA filed a sur-response on June 21, 2021. On
September 30, 2022, the District Court issued an order staying the action pending resolution of the bankruptcy proceedings. Accordingly, the District Court
administratively closed the case, subject to a motion by the parties thereto to reopen the case.
Based on discussions with the plaintiffs in this matter, PG&E Corporation believes it is probable that it will incur a loss in connection with this matter. In the second
quarter of 2022, PG&E Corporation recorded a liability in the aggregate amount of $300 million (before available insurance), which represents its best loss estimate
for the Wildfire-Related Securities Claims. PG&E Corporation believes that it is reasonably possible that the amount of loss could be greater or less than the
accrued estimated amount but is unable to reasonably estimate any additional loss because the amount of the liability has not been agreed or otherwise determined,
and even if PG&E Corporation were to enter into an agreement with representatives of the plaintiffs in this matter (which would also resolve proofs of claim by
these plaintiffs in the bankruptcy), any such agreement would be subject to, among other things, approval by the Bankruptcy Court and the District Court, and class
members would have the right to opt out of any such agreement.
96
Wildfire-Related Securities Claims—Claims in the Bankruptcy Court Process
PG&E Corporation and the Utility intend to resolve claims filed in the bankruptcy relating to, among others, the three purported securities class actions (described
above) that have been consolidated and denominated In re PG&E Corporation Securities Litigation, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California,
Case No. 18-03509, pursuant to the Plan. As described above, these claims consist of pre-petition claims under the federal securities laws related to, among other
things, allegedly misleading statements or omissions with respect to vegetation management and wildfire safety disclosures, and are classified into separate
categories under the Plan, each of which is subject to subordination under the Bankruptcy Code. The first category of claims consists of pre-petition claims arising
from or related to the common stock of PG&E Corporation (such claims, with certain other similar claims against PG&E Corporation, the “HoldCo Rescission or
Damage Claims”). The second category of pre-petition claims, which comprises two separate classes under the Plan, consists of claims arising from debt securities
issued by PG&E Corporation and the Utility (such claims, with certain other similar claims against PG&E Corporation and the Utility, the “Subordinated Debt
Claims,” and together with the HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims, the “Subordinated Claims”).
While PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe they have defenses to the Subordinated Claims, as well as insurance coverage that may be available with respect
to the Subordinated Claims, these defenses may not prevail and any such insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the full amount of the allowed claims. In
that case, PG&E Corporation and the Utility will be required, pursuant to the Plan, to satisfy any such allowed claims as follows:
•each holder of an allowed HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claim will receive a number of shares of common stock of PG&E Corporation equal to such
holder’s HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claim Share (as such term is defined in the Plan); and
•each holder of an allowed Subordinated Debt Claim will receive payment in full in cash.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have engaged in settlement efforts with respect to the Subordinated Claims. If any of the Subordinated Claims are ultimately not
settled, PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect that those Subordinated Claims will be resolved by the Bankruptcy Court in the claims reconciliation process and
treated as described above under the Plan. Under the Plan, after the Emergence Date, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have the authority to compromise, settle,
object to, or otherwise resolve proofs of claim, and the Bankruptcy Court retains jurisdiction to hear disputes arising in connection with disputed claims. With
respect to the Subordinated Claims, the claims reconciliation process may include litigation of the merits of such claims, including the filing of motions, fact
discovery, and expert discovery. The total number and amount of allowed Subordinated Claims, if any, was not determined at the Emergence Date. To the extent
any such claims are allowed, the total amount of such claims could be material, and therefore could result in (a) the issuance of a material number of shares of
common stock of PG&E Corporation with respect to allowed HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims, or (b) the payment of a material amount of cash with respect
to allowed Subordinated Debt Claims. There can be no assurance that such claims will not have a material adverse impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.
Further, if shares are issued in respect of allowed HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims, it may be determined that, under the Plan, the Fire Victim Trust should
receive additional shares of common stock of PG&E Corporation such that it would have owned 22.19% of the outstanding common stock of reorganized PG&E
Corporation on the Emergence Date, assuming that such issuance of shares in satisfaction of the HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims had occurred on the
Emergence Date.
On July 2, 2020, PERA filed a notice of appeal of the Confirmation Order to the District Court, solely to the extent of seeking review of that part of the
Confirmation Order approving the Insurance Deduction (as defined in the Plan) with respect to the formula for the determination of the HoldCo Rescission or
Damage Claims Share. On August 10, 2021, the District Court issued an order affirming the Bankruptcy Court’s ruling with respect to the Insurance Deduction. On
September 9, 2021, PERA filed a notice of appeal of the District Court’s order to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and on December 15,
2021, PERA filed its opening brief. On February 14, 2022 and February 17, 2022, the Official Committee of Tort Claimants appointed in the Chapter 11 Cases and
both PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed their answering briefs, respectively. On May 20, 2022, the Official Committee of Tort Claimants filed a motion to
dismiss the case. On June 21, 2022, PERA filed its opposition, and PG&E Corporation and the Utility joined the motion to dismiss. On June 28, 2022, the Official
Committee of Tort Claimants filed its reply. PERA’s appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals remains pending.
97
On September 1, 2020, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed a motion (the “Securities Claims Procedures Motion”) with the Bankruptcy Court to approve
procedures to help facilitate the resolution of the Subordinated Claims. The motion, among other things, requested approval of procedures which would allow
PG&E Corporation and the Utility to collect trading information with respect to the Subordinated Claims, to engage in an alternative dispute resolution process for
resolving disputed Subordinated Claims, and to file certain omnibus claim objections with respect to the Subordinated Claims. On January 25, 2021, the
Bankruptcy Court granted the Securities Claims Procedures Motion.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have worked to resolve the Subordinated Claims in accordance with the procedures approved by the Bankruptcy Court,
including by collecting trading information from holders of Subordinated Claims. Also, pursuant to those procedures, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have filed
numerous omnibus objections in the Bankruptcy Court to certain of the Subordinated Claims. The Bankruptcy Court has entered several orders disallowing and
expunging Subordinated Claims that were subject to these omnibus objections, and certain Subordinated Claims subject to these omnibus objections remain
pending. PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect to file additional omnibus objections with respect to certain of the Subordinated Claims and to continue to act
under the procedures approved by the Bankruptcy Court to resolve the Subordinated Claims.
Indemnification Obligations and D&O Insurance Coverage
To the extent permitted by law, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have obligations to indemnify directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while a
director or officer is or was serving in such capacity, which indemnification obligations may extend to the claims asserted against certain directors and officers in
the securities class actions and in the litigation matters enumerated above under the heading “Wildfire-Related Derivative Litigation.” PG&E Corporation and the
Utility maintain D&O Insurance coverage to reduce their exposure to such indemnification obligations. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have provided notice to
their insurance carriers of the claims asserted in the litigation matters enumerated above under the headings “Wildfire-Related Securities Class Action” and
“Wildfire-Related Derivative Litigation,” and are in arbitration with the carriers regarding, among other things, the applicability of one year of D&O Insurance
policies to those matters (the “Insurance Coverage Claims”).
In July 2022, PG&E Corporation, the Utility, and the former director and officer defendants entered into agreements with certain of their D&O Insurance carriers to
settle the majority of the Insurance Coverage Claims. As a result of these agreements, PG&E Corporation will receive insurance coverage in an aggregate amount
of $272 million. These settlements are contingent upon approval by the Bankruptcy Court. On September 29, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed a
motion for approval of these settlements with the Bankruptcy Court, and on October 25, 2022, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving these settlements.
In the second quarter of 2022, PG&E Corporation recorded an insurance receivable for $272 million. Proceeds from the D&O Insurance coverage will be paid first
to the Fire Victim Trust for the Fire Victim Trust D&O Claims, and then PG&E Corporation intends to apply the remaining proceeds to the Wildfire-Related
Securities Claims.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility additionally have potential indemnification obligations to the underwriters for the Utility’s note offerings, pursuant to the
underwriting agreements associated with those offerings. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s indemnification obligations to the officers, directors and
underwriters may be limited or affected by the Chapter 11 Cases, among other things.
The extent of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s recovery of the D&O Insurance proceeds could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.
Butte County District Attorney’s Office Investigation into the 2018 Camp Fire
Following the 2018 Camp fire, the Butte County District Attorney’s Office and the California Attorney General’s Office opened a criminal investigation of the 2018
Camp fire.
On March 17, 2020, the Utility entered into the Plea Agreement and Settlement (the “Plea Agreement”) with the People of the State of California, by and through
the Butte County District Attorney’s Office to resolve the criminal prosecution of the Utility in connection with the 2018 Camp fire. Subject to the terms and
conditions of the Plea Agreement, the Utility pleaded guilty to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter in violation of Penal Code section 192(b) and one count of
unlawfully causing a fire in violation of Penal Code section 452, and to admit special allegations pursuant to Penal Code sections 452.1(a)(2), 452.1(a)(3) and
452.1(a)(4).
98
On August 20, 2021, the Butte County Superior Court held a brief hearing on the status of restitution, which involves distribution of funds from the Fire Victim
Trust. The Butte County Superior Court has since continued the hearing to May 19, 2023.
NOTE 12: OTHER CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have significant contingencies arising from their operations, including contingencies related to enforcement and litigation
matters and environmental remediation.  A provision for a loss contingency is recorded when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the
loss can be reasonably estimated.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility evaluate the range of reasonably estimated losses and record a provision based on the lower
end of the range, unless an amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount.  The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably
possible, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events.  Loss contingencies are reviewed
quarterly and estimates are adjusted to reflect the impact of all known information, such as negotiations, discovery, settlements and payments, rulings, penalties
related to regulatory compliance, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility
exclude anticipated legal costs from the provision for loss and expense these costs as incurred. The Utility also has substantial financial commitments in connection
with agreements entered into to support its operating activities.  See “Purchase Commitments” below.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition,
results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows may be materially affected by the outcome of the following matters.
CPUC and FERC Matters
Transmission Owner Rate Case Revenue Subject to Refund
The FERC determines the amount of authorized revenue requirements, including the rate of return on electric transmission assets, that the Utility may collect in
rates in the TO rate case. The FERC typically authorizes the Utility to charge new rates based on the requested revenue requirement, subject to refund, before the
FERC has issued a final decision. The Utility bills and records revenue based on the amounts requested in its rate case filing and records a reserve for its estimate of
the amounts that are probable of refund. Rates subject to refund went into effect on March 1, 2017, March 1, 2018, and May 1, 2019 for the TO rate case for 2017
(“TO18”), the TO rate case for 2018 (“TO19”), and the TO rate case for 2019 (“TO20”), respectively.
On October 15, 2020, the FERC issued an order that, among other things, rejected the Utility’s direct assignment of common plant to FERC and required the
allocation of all common plant between CPUC and FERC jurisdiction be based on operating and maintenance labor ratios. The order reopened the record for the
limited purpose of allowing the parties an opportunity to present written evidence concerning the FERC’s revised ROE methodology adopted in FERC Opinion No.
569-A, issued on May 21, 2020.
On December 17, 2020 and June 17, 2021, the FERC issued orders denying requests for rehearing submitted by the Utility and intervenors. In 2021, the Utility
filed four appeals. The appeals related to two issues: (i) impact of the Tax Act on TO18 rates in January and February 2018 and (ii) aspects of the rehearing order
other than the Tax Act. The appeals have been consolidated and are currently being held in abeyance until the FERC addresses the ROE issue on rehearing.
As a result of an order denying rehearing on the common plant allocation, the Utility increased its regulatory liabilities for amounts previously collected during the
TO18, TO19, and TO20 rate case periods from 2017 through the third quarter of 2022 by approximately $384 million. A portion of these common plant costs are
expected to be recovered at the CPUC in a separate application and as a result, the Utility recorded approximately $240 million to Regulatory assets.
On September 21, 2018, the Utility filed an all-party settlement with the FERC, which was approved by the FERC on December 20, 2018, in connection with
TO19. As part of the settlement, the TO19 revenue requirement will be set at 98.85% of the revenue requirement for TO18 that will be determined upon issuance of
a final unappealable decision in the TO18 proceeding.
On December 30, 2020, the FERC approved an all-party settlement agreement in connection with TO20. The TO20 settlement resolved all issues of the Utility’s
formula rate. However, some of the formula rate issues are contingent on the outcome of TO18, including the allocation of costs related to common, general and
intangible plant. The settlement provides that the formula rate will remain in effect through December 31, 2023. The TO20 rate case provides that the transmission
revenue requirement and rates are to be updated annually on January 1, subject to true-up. The Utility is required to make a successor rate filing in 2023, which
would go into effect on January 1, 2024.
99
On March 17, 2022, the FERC issued a further order in the TO18 rate case proceeding finding that 9.26% is the just and reasonable base ROE for the Utility. With
the incentive component of 50-basis points for the Utility’s continuing participation in the CAISO, the resulting ROE would be 9.76%. As a result, the Utility
increased its regulatory liabilities for amounts previously collected during the TO18 and TO19 rate case periods from March 2017 through the first quarter of 2022
by approximately $62.5 million. On April 18, 2022, the Utility and several other parties sought rehearing of the FERC’s determination of the base ROE finding. On
May 19, 2022, the FERC denied all parties’ rehearing requests. The Utility has filed an appeal in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, as have the other parties that
sought rehearing. The appeal is being held in abeyance until the FERC issues a substantive order on rehearing on the ROE issue.
On May 16, 2022 and May 31, 2022, the Utility filed a compliance filing and a refund report describing the adjustments made to the transmission revenue
requirement, adjusted rates, and the calculation and mechanism of the refunds.
2020 WMCE Interim Rate Relief Subject to Refund
On September 30, 2020, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC requesting cost recovery of recorded expenditures related to wildfire mitigation, certain
catastrophic events, and a number of other activities (the “2020 WMCE application”). The recorded expenditures, which exclude amounts disallowed as a result of
the CPUC’s decision in the OII into the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018 Camp fire, consist of $1.18 billion in expense and $801 million in capital
expenditures, resulting in a proposed revenue requirement of approximately $1.28 billion.
As previously disclosed, on October 23, 2020, the CPUC approved $447 million in interim rate relief (which includes interest) pertaining to costs addressed in the
2020 WMCE application. As a result, the Utility proposed to recover the remaining $868 million revenue requirement over a one-year period (following the
conclusion of interim rate relief recovery).
The costs addressed in the 2020 WMCE application cover activities mainly during the years 2017 to 2019 and are incremental to those previously authorized in the
Utility’s 2017 GRC and other proceedings. The majority of costs addressed in this application reflect work necessary to mitigate wildfire risk and to respond to
catastrophic events occurring during the years 2017 to 2019. The Utility’s requested revenue includes amounts for the FHPMA of $293 million, the FRMMA and
the WMPMA of $740 million, and the CEMA of $251 million.
On September 21, 2021, the Utility and certain parties filed a motion with the CPUC seeking approval of a settlement agreement that would resolve all of the issues
raised by the settling parties in the 2020 WMCE application. On October 11, 2022, the assigned ALJ issued a PD, and the assigned Commissioner issued an APD.
Both the PD and the APD would make the interim rates final and no longer subject to refund.
2022 Cost of Capital Application
The Utility’s annual cost of capital adjustment mechanism provides that in any year in which the difference between (i) the average Moody’s utility bond rates (as
measured in the 12-month period from October through September (the “Index”)) and (ii) 4.5% exceeds 100 basis points, the Utility’s ROE will be adjusted by one-
half of such difference, and the cost of debt will be trued up to the most recent recorded cost of debt. The Utility is to initiate this adjustment mechanism by filing
an advice letter on or before October 15 of the year in which the mechanism triggered, to become effective on January 1 of the next year.
On August 23, 2021, the Utility filed an off-cycle 2022 cost of capital application with the CPUC based on the extraordinary event of the COVID-19 pandemic and
related government response, which has decreased interest rates but has not reduced the cost of capital for electric utilities in general, and the Utility in particular, to
the same extent as the overall financial markets (the “2022 cost of capital application”). The 2022 cost of capital application requested that the CPUC authorize the
Utility's cost of capital for its electric generation, electric distribution, natural gas distribution, and natural gas transmission and storage rate base beginning on
January 1, 2022 for 2022, 2023, and 2024. The Utility requested that the CPUC approve the Utility’s proposed ratemaking capital structure, ROE, cost of preferred
stock, and cost of debt. The Utility proposed to establish a cost of long-term debt of 4.14%, a return on preferred stock of 5.52%, a ROE of 11%, and to retain the
existing capital structure. The Utility also concurrently filed a motion requesting that the revenue requirement for the 2022 cost of capital be recorded in
memorandum accounts to be trued-up following a final decision in this proceeding.
100
In September 2021, the cost of capital adjustment mechanism was triggered because the Index was 117 basis points below the benchmark. As the 2022 cost of
capital application was pending, the Utility did not file the October 15, 2021 advice letter to adjust rates. Subsequently, on October 28, 2021, the CPUC ruled that
the 2022 cost of capital application did not suspend the adjustment mechanism as requested by the application. The ruling also required that the Utility comply with
the cost of capital mechanism by filing the information that would have been included in the October 15, 2021 advice letter in the 2022 cost of capital application
proceeding on November 8, 2021, which the Utility did.
On December 17, 2021, the CPUC issued a final decision authorizing the Utility’s request to establish memorandum accounts to track revenue requirement changes
beginning on January 1, 2022 and leaving the cost of capital rates at current levels, subject to true-up based on the CPUC’s decision on the 2022 cost of capital
application. As of September 30, 2022, the Utility had not recorded a reserve for refunds related to these memorandum accounts.
On December 24, 2021, the CPUC issued a scoping memo in the 2022 cost of capital application limiting the scope of the Utility’s 2022 cost of capital application
to the 2022 cost of capital only.
To set the 2022 cost of capital, the CPUC will consider (i) whether there are extraordinary circumstances that warrant a departure from the cost of capital
mechanism for 2022; and (ii) if so, whether to leave the cost of capital components at pre-2022 levels for the year 2022, or open a second phase to consider
alternative cost of capital proposals for the year 2022. The Utility’s position is that there are extraordinary circumstances that warrant a departure from the cost of
capital mechanism for 2022 and that the CPUC should leave the cost of capital components at pre-2022 levels for 2022. Briefing concluded on March 25, 2022.
If the CPUC determines that the 2022 cost of capital application establishes extraordinary circumstances that warrant a departure from the cost of capital
mechanism for 2022 and leaves the Utility’s cost of capital components at pre-2022 levels for 2022, the cost of long-term debt would be 4.17%, the return on
preferred stock would be 5.52%, and the ROE would be 10.25%. If the CPUC opens a second phase of the proceeding, the CPUC would set the cost of capital for
2022 based on alternative cost of capital proposals that would address the technical cost of capital material included within the Utility’s 2022 cost of capital
application.
If the CPUC determines that there are not extraordinary circumstances that warrant a departure from the cost of capital mechanism for 2022, the cost of capital
adjustment mechanism would operate and the cost of long-term debt would be 4.15%, the return on preferred stock would be 5.52%, and the ROE would be 9.67%.
The resulting decrease in the CPUC jurisdictional gas and electric revenue requirement would be approximately $163 million ($99 million electric and $64 million
gas).
On September 30, 2022, the assigned ALJs issued a PD, and the assigned Commissioner issued an APD. Both the PD and the APD found that an extraordinary
event occurred, and that the cost of capital adjustment mechanism should not be implemented for 2022. If adopted, the PD would open a second phase of this
proceeding to determine the 2022 cost of capital, while the APD would retain the cost of capital previously authorized in the 2020 cost of capital proceeding and
close this proceeding. Comments on the PD and APD were filed October 20, 2022, and reply comments were filed October 25, 2022.
2015 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case and 2011-2014 Gas Transmission and Storage Capital Expenditures Audit
In its final decision in the Utility’s 2015 GT&S rate case, the CPUC excluded from rate base $696 million of capital spending in 2011 through 2014. This was the
amount forecast to be recorded in excess of the amount adopted in the 2011 GT&S rate case. The decision permanently disallowed $120 million of that amount and
ordered that the remaining $576 million be subject to an audit overseen by the CPUC staff, with the possibility that the Utility may seek recovery in a future
proceeding. The audit report was released June 2, 2020 and did not recommend any additional disallowances. The 2015 GT&S decision authorized the Utility to
seek recovery, through a separate application, of those costs not recommended for disallowance by the audit.
On July 31, 2020, the Utility filed an application seeking recovery of $416.3 million in 2015 to 2022 revenue associated with $512 million of recorded capital
expenditures. On July 7, 2021, the Utility filed a joint motion to adopt a settlement agreement reached with the active parties in the proceeding. On July 14, 2022,
the CPUC approved a final decision approving the settlement agreement, which resolved all issues in this proceeding and authorized a $356.3 million revenue
requirement for the period of 2015 through 2022. Of this amount, $313.3 million of revenues for the period 2015 through 2021 will be amortized in rates over 60
months and $43 million associated with 2022 will be amortized in rates over 12 months beginning August 1, 2022. Going forward, the as-yet undepreciated capital
plant associated with this application was included in test year 2023 rate base in the Utility’s consolidated 2023 GRC.
101
Other Matters
PG&E Corporation and the Utility are subject to various claims and lawsuits that separately are not considered material.  Accruals for contingencies related to such
matters totaled $61 million and $77 million as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. These amounts were included in Other current
liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not believe it is reasonably possible that the resolution of
these matters will have a material impact on their financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
PSPS Class Action
On December 19, 2019, a complaint was filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California naming PG&E Corporation and the
Utility. The plaintiff seeks certification of a class consisting of all California residents and business owners who had their power shut off by the Utility during the
October 9, October 23, October 26, October 28, or November 20, 2019 power outages and any subsequent voluntary outages occurring during the course of
litigation. The plaintiff alleges that the necessity for the October and November 2019 power shutoff events was caused by the Utility’s negligence in failing to
properly maintain its electrical lines and surrounding vegetation. The complaint seeks up to $2.5 billion in special and general damages, punitive and exemplary
damages and injunctive relief to require the Utility to properly maintain and inspect its power grid. PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe the allegations are
without merit and intend to defend this lawsuit vigorously.
On March 30, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court granted a motion to dismiss this class action by the Utility because the plaintiff’s class action claims are preempted as a
matter of law by the California Public Utilities Code. On April 3, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order dismissing the action without leave to amend.
The plaintiff appealed the decision dismissing the complaint to the District Court. On March 26, 2021, the District Court affirmed the Bankruptcy Court’s dismissal
of this action, and the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. On February 28, 2022, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals entered an
order certifying two questions of state law to the California Supreme Court. On June 1, 2022, the California Supreme Court accepted certification of the questions.
The plaintiff filed his opening brief on July 1, 2022. The Utility’s answering brief was filed on August 31, 2022, and the plaintiff’s reply brief was filed on October
20, 2022.
The Utility is unable to determine the timing and outcome of this proceeding.
CZU Lightning Complex Fire Notices of Violation
Between November 2020 and January 2021, several governmental entities raised concerns regarding the Utility’s emergency response to the 2020 CZU Lightning
Complex fire, including Cal Fire, the California Coastal Commission, the Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board, and Santa Cruz County Board of
Supervisors alleging environmental, vegetation management, and unpermitted work violations. In the matter of Santa Cruz County’s complaint with the CPUC, the
parties reached a settlement, and the CPUC dismissed the complaint on December 15, 2021. The Utility continues to work with the California Coastal Commission,
Cal Fire, and the Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board to resolve any outstanding issues and to work with Santa Cruz County to implement the
terms of the settlement agreement. Violations can result in penalties, remediation, and other relief.
Based on the information currently available, PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it is probable that a liability has been incurred. Accordingly, PG&E
Corporation and the Utility recorded a charge during the fourth quarter of 2021 for an amount that is not material. PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not believe
that the resolution of these matters will have a material impact on their financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
102
Environmental Remediation Contingencies
Given the complexities of the legal and regulatory environment and the inherent uncertainties involved in the early stages of a remediation project, the process for
estimating remediation liabilities requires significant judgment. The Utility records an environmental remediation liability when the site assessments indicate that
remediation is probable, and the Utility can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of probable amounts. The Utility records an environmental remediation liability
based on the lower end of the range of estimated probable costs, unless an amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. Key factors that
inform the development of estimated costs include site feasibility studies and investigations, applicable remediation actions, operations and maintenance activities,
post-remediation monitoring, and the cost of technologies that are expected to be approved to remediate the site. Amounts recorded are not discounted to their
present value. The Utility’s environmental remediation liability is primarily included in non-current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and is
comprised of the following:
 Balance at
(in millions) September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021
Topock natural gas compressor station $ 286 $ 299 
Hinkley natural gas compressor station 113 123 
Former MGP sites owned by the Utility or third parties 792 667 
Utility-owned generation facilities (other than fossil fuel-fired), other facilities, and third-party
disposal sites 112 104 
Fossil fuel-fired generation facilities and sites 32 70 
Total environmental remediation liability $ 1,335 $ 1,263 
Primarily driven by the following sites: San Francisco Beach Street, Vallejo, Napa, and San Francisco East Harbor.
Primarily driven by geothermal landfill and Shell Pond site.
 Primarily driven by the San Francisco Potrero Power Plant.
The Utility’s gas compressor stations, former MGP sites, power plant sites, gas gathering sites, and sites used by the Utility for the storage, recycling, and disposal
of potentially hazardous substances are subject to requirements issued by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Federal Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act in addition to other state hazardous waste laws.  The Utility has a comprehensive program in place designed to comply with federal, state, and local
laws and regulations related to hazardous materials, waste, remediation activities, and other environmental requirements.  The Utility assesses and monitors the
environmental requirements on an ongoing basis and implements changes to its program as deemed appropriate. The Utility’s remediation activities are overseen by
the DTSC, several California regional water quality control boards, and various other federal, state, and local agencies.
The Utility’s environmental remediation liability as of September 30, 2022, reflects its best estimate of probable future costs for remediation based on the current
assessment data and regulatory obligations. Future costs will depend on many factors, including the extent of work necessary to implement final remediation plans,
the Utility’s time frame for remediation, and unanticipated claims filed against the Utility.  The Utility may incur actual costs in the future that are materially
different than this estimate and such costs could have a material impact on results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows during the period in which they
are recorded. As of September 30, 2022, the Utility expected to recover $1,092 million of its environmental remediation liability for certain sites through various
ratemaking mechanisms authorized by the CPUC. 
Natural Gas Compressor Station Sites
The Utility is legally responsible for remediating groundwater contamination caused by hexavalent chromium used in the past at the Utility’s natural gas
compressor stations. The Utility is also required to take measures to abate the effects of the contamination on the environment.(1)

103
Topock Site
The Utility’s remediation and abatement efforts at the Topock site are subject to the regulatory authority of the California DTSC and the U.S. Department of the
Interior. On April 24, 2018, the DTSC authorized the Utility to build an in-situ groundwater treatment system to convert hexavalent chromium into a non-toxic and
non-soluble form of chromium. Construction activities began in October 2018 and the initial phase of construction was completed in 2021. Additional phases of
construction will continue for several years. The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with the Topock site may increase by as much as $237 million if the
extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated. The costs associated with environmental remediation at the Topock site are expected to
be recovered primarily through the HSMA, where 90% of the costs are recovered through rates.
Hinkley Site
The Utility has been implementing remediation measures at the Hinkley site to reduce the mass of the chromium plume in groundwater and to monitor and control
movement of the plume. The Utility’s remediation and abatement efforts at the Hinkley site are subject to the regulatory authority of the California Regional Water
Quality Control Board, Lahontan Region. In November 2015, the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Lahontan Region adopted a clean-up and
abatement order directing the Utility to contain and remediate the underground plume of hexavalent chromium and the potential environmental impacts. The final
order states that the Utility must continue and improve its remediation efforts, define the boundaries of the chromium plume, and take other action. Additionally, the
final order sets plume capture requirements, requires a monitoring and reporting program, and includes deadlines for the Utility to meet interim cleanup targets. The
United States Geological Survey team is currently conducting a background study on the site to better define the chromium plume boundaries. A draft background
report was received in January 2020 and is expected to be finalized in 2023. The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with the Hinkley site may increase
by as much as $127 million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated. The costs associated with environmental remediation
at the Hinkley site will not be recovered through rates.
Former Manufactured Gas Plants
Former MGPs used coal and oil to produce gas for use by the Utility’s customers before natural gas became available. The by-products and residues of this process
were often disposed of at the MGPs themselves. The Utility has a program to manage the residues left behind as a result of the manufacturing process; many of the
sites in the program have been addressed. The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with MGP sites may increase by as much as $509 million if the extent
of contamination or necessary remediation at currently identified MGP sites is greater than anticipated. The costs associated with environmental remediation at the
MGP sites are recovered through the HSMA, where 90% of the costs are recovered through rates.
Utility-Owned Generation Facilities and Third-Party Disposal Sites
Utility-owned generation facilities and third-party disposal sites often involve long-term remediation. The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with
Utility-owned generation facilities and third-party disposal sites may increase by as much as $47 million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is
greater than anticipated. The environmental remediation costs associated with the Utility-owned generation facilities and third-party disposal sites are recovered
through the HSMA, where 90% of the costs are recovered through rates.
Fossil Fuel-Fired Generation Sites
In 1998, the Utility divested its generation power plant business as part of generation deregulation. Although the Utility sold its fossil-fueled power plants, the
Utility retained the environmental remediation liability associated with each site. The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with fossil fuel-fired generation
sites may increase by as much as $50 million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated. The environmental remediation
costs associated with the fossil fuel-fired sites will not be recovered through rates.
104
Nuclear Insurance
The Utility maintains multiple insurance policies through NEIL and EMANI, covering nuclear or non-nuclear events at the Utility’s two nuclear generating units at
Diablo Canyon and the retired Humboldt Bay Unit 3.  NEIL provides property damage and business interruption coverage of up to $3.2 billion per nuclear incident
and $2.5 billion per non-nuclear incident for Diablo Canyon. For Humboldt Bay Unit 3, NEIL provides up to $50 million of coverage for nuclear and non-nuclear
property damages to the site’s spent fuel storage installation. NEIL also provides coverage for damages caused by acts of terrorism and cyberattacks at nuclear
power plants. Through NEIL, there is up to $3.2 billion available to the membership to cover this exposure. EMANI shares losses with NEIL, as part of the first
$400 million of coverage within the current nuclear insurance program. EMANI also provides an additional $200 million in excess insurance for property damage
and business interruption losses incurred by the Utility if a nuclear or non-nuclear event were to occur at Diablo Canyon. If NEIL losses in any policy year exceed
accumulated funds, the Utility could be subject to a retrospective assessment.  If NEIL were to exercise this assessment, the maximum aggregate annual
retrospective premium obligation for the Utility would be approximately $41 million.  If EMANI losses in any policy year exceed accumulated funds, the Utility
could be subject to a retrospective assessment of approximately $4 million.  For more information about the Utility’s nuclear insurance coverage, see Note 15 of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of the 2021 Form 10-K.
Purchase Commitments
In the ordinary course of business, the Utility enters into various agreements to purchase power and electric capacity; natural gas supply, transportation, and
storage; nuclear fuel supply and services; and various other commitments. At December 31, 2021, the Utility had undiscounted future expected obligations of
approximately $34 billion. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of the 2021 Form 10-K.
Oakland Headquarters Lease
On October 23, 2020, the Utility and BA2 300 Lakeside LLC (“Landlord”), a wholly owned subsidiary of TMG Bay Area Investments II, LLC, entered into an
office lease agreement for approximately 910,000 rentable square feet of space within the Lakeside Building to serve as the Utility’s principal administrative
headquarters (the “Lease”). In connection with the Lease, the Utility also issued to Landlord (i) an option payment letter of credit in the amount of $75 million, and
(ii) a lease security letter of credit in the amount of $75 million.
The term of the Lease began on April 8, 2022. The Lease term will expire in 34 years and 11 months after the commencement date, unless earlier terminated in
accordance with the terms of the Lease. In addition to base rent, the Utility will be responsible for certain costs and charges specified in the Lease, including
insurance costs, maintenance costs and taxes.
The Lease requires the Landlord to pursue approvals to subdivide the real estate it owns surrounding the Lakeside Building to create a separate legal parcel that
contains the Lakeside Building (the “Property”) that can be sold to the Utility. The Lease grants to the Utility an option to purchase the Property, following such
subdivision, at a price of $892 million, subject to certain adjustments (the “Purchase Price”). If the option is exercised, the Purchase Price would be paid in 2023.
The Lease also requires the rentable space to be delivered in two phases, with each phase consisting of further subdivided spaces. As of June 30, 2022, part of the
space in the Lease has been made available for use. The Utility has recorded approximately $322 million in Operating lease right of use assets, approximately $157
million of leasehold improvements, which includes approximately $78 million that was provided to the Utility as lease incentives, and approximately $399 million
in current and noncurrent Operating lease liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements related to the Lease.
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s primary market risk results from changes in energy commodity prices.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility engage in price
risk management activities for non-trading purposes only.  Both PG&E Corporation and the Utility may engage in these price risk management activities using
forward contracts, futures, options, and swaps to hedge the impact of market fluctuations on energy commodity prices and interest rates.  See the section above
entitled “Risk Management Activities” in MD&A and in Notes 9 and 10 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1.
105
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Based on an evaluation of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2022, PG&E Corporation’s and the
Utility’s respective principal executive officers and principal financial officers have concluded that such controls and procedures are effective to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by PG&E Corporation and the Utility in reports that the companies file or submit under the Exchange Act, is (i) recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to PG&E Corporation’s
and the Utility’s management, including PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s respective principal executive officers and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2022, that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, PG&E Corporation’s or the Utility’s internal control over financial reporting.
PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
PG&E Corporation and the Utility are parties to various lawsuits and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of their business.  For more information
regarding material lawsuits and proceedings, see Notes 2, 11, and 12 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 and Part I,
MD&A: “Enforcement and Litigation Matters.”
Each of PG&E Corporation and the Utility has elected to disclose environmental proceedings described in Item 103(c)(3)(iii) of Regulation S- K unless it
reasonably believes that such proceeding will result in no monetary sanctions, or in monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, of less than $1 million.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
For information about the significant risks that could affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash
flows, see the section of the 2021 Form 10-K entitled “Risk Factors,” as supplemented below, and the section of this quarterly report entitled “Forward-Looking
Statements.”
Jurisdictions may attempt to acquire the Utility’s assets through eminent domain.
Jurisdictions may attempt to acquire the Utility’s assets through eminent domain (“municipalization”). In particular, the City and County of San Francisco (“San
Francisco”) has submitted a petition with the CPUC seeking a valuation of the Utility’s electric assets in San Francisco and has expressed intent to acquire such
assets. While San Francisco would still need to initiate and prevail in an eminent domain action in state court to acquire the Utility’s assets, there is no guarantee
that the Utility would be successful in defending against such an action. If municipalization proceedings are permitted to move forward and are successful, the
Utility would be entitled to receive the fair market value of the assets that are subject to the takeover effort, but the valuation issues in any municipalization
proceeding would be highly contentious and could result in the Utility receiving less than what it believes is just compensation for the applicable assets. Any assets
acquired by a third party through eminent domain would be excluded from the Utility’s rate base, reducing the Utility’s revenues and opportunity to earn a return.
Assets that are targeted for municipalization generally are located in geographic areas that have a lower cost of service relative to billed revenues, so
municipalization could negatively impact the affordability of the Utility’s service for remaining Utility customers served outside of those geographic areas. A
successful municipalization attempt could also encourage similar attempts by other municipalities, which if successful, would further divide apart the Utility’s
assets and reduce the Utility’s rate base, profitability, and affordability for remaining Utility customers. Additionally, it is unclear how the CPUC would allocate the
compensation received by the Utility for its assets between shareholders and customers. As a result of these factors, municipalization could materially affect the
Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flow.
106
PG&E Corporation and the Utility could be liable for a failure to comply with privacy laws.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility collect and retain certain personal information of their customers, shareholders, and employees in connection with their business.
Although PG&E Corporation and the Utility invest in risk management and information security measures, the personal information that they collect, as well as
other commercially-sensitive data that they possess, could become compromised because of certain events, including a cyber incident, the insufficiency or failure of
such measures, human error, the misappropriation of data, or the occurrence of any of the foregoing at any third party with which PG&E Corporation or the Utility
has shared information. If any of these events were to transpire, it could subject PG&E Corporation and the Utility to financial liability.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility are subject to federal and state privacy laws, which grant consumers rights and protections, including, among other things, the
ability to opt out of receiving certain communications and certain data sharing with third parties. Non-compliance with these privacy laws could result in the
imposition of material fines on PG&E Corporation and the Utility, other regulatory exposure, significant litigation, and reputational harm, which could materially
affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.
Inflation may negatively impact PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial conditions, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have observed that prices for equipment, materials, supplies, employee labor, contractor services, and variable-rate debt have
increased. Long-term inflationary pressures may result in such prices continuing to increase more quickly than expected. Increases in inflation raises costs for labor,
materials and services, and PG&E Corporation and the Utility may be unable to secure these resources on economically acceptable terms or offset such costs with
increased revenues, operating efficiencies, or cost savings, which may adversely impact PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial conditions, results of
operations, liquidity, and cash flows.
ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
During the quarter ended September 30, 2022, PG&E Corporation did not contribute any equity securities to the Utility. Also during the quarter ended September
30, 2022, PG&E Corporation did not make any sales of unregistered equity securities in reliance on an exemption from registration under the Securities Act.
On July 8, 2021, PG&E Corporation, the Utility, ShareCo and the Fire Victim Trust entered into the Share Exchange and Tax Matters Agreement, pursuant to which
PG&E Corporation and the Utility made a “grantor trust” election for the Fire Victim Trust effective retroactively to the inception of the Fire Victim Trust. As a
result of the grantor trust election, shares of PG&E Corporation common stock owned by the Fire Victim Trust are treated as held by the Utility and, in turn
attributed to PG&E Corporation for income tax purposes. On January 31, 2022, April 14, 2022, and October 4, 2022, the Fire Victim Trust exchanged 40,000,000,
60,000,000, and 35,000,000 Plan Shares, respectively, for an equal number of New Shares in the manner contemplated by the Share Exchange and Tax Matters
Agreement; in each case, the Fire Victim Trust thereafter reported that it sold the applicable New Shares. As of September 30, 2022, to the knowledge of PG&E
Corporation, the Fire Victim Trust had sold 100,000,000 shares of PG&E Corporation common stock in the aggregate.
107
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
On September 15, 2022, the Board of Directors amended the terms of PG&E Corporation Chief Executive Officer Patricia K. Poppe’s Non-Annual Restricted Stock
Unit Award Agreement dated March 1, 2021 to allow the forfeiture of additional shares of PG&E Corporation common stock to satisfy state tax obligations in
connection with a prior vesting of restricted stock units. In accordance with this amendment, on September 22, 2022, PG&E Corporation repurchased 57,396 shares
from Ms. Poppe in connection with the forfeiture of additional shares to satisfy these state tax obligations.

PG&E Corporation does not have any preferred stock outstanding. During the quarter ended September 30, 2022, the Utility did not redeem or repurchase any
shares of its various series of preferred stock outstanding.
On January 31, 2022, April 14, 2022, and October 4, 2022, the Fire Victim Trust exchanged 40,000,000, 60,000,000, and 35,000,000 Plan Shares, respectively, for
an equal number of New Shares in the manner contemplated by the Share Exchange and Tax Matters Agreement. The exchange was effected in reliance on the
exemption from registration under Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act. See “Tax Matters” in Part I, Item 2. MD&A above and “Share Exchange and Tax Matters
Agreement” in Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of the 2021 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of the exchange and the
terms of the Share Exchange and Tax Matters Agreement, respectively.

By     
Authorized Signatory
Dated:
[FORM OF  REVERSE OF  BOND OF  THE THIR TY-SECOND SERIES]
This Bond  of the Thirty-Second Series (this “Bond ”) is one of a duly authorized issue of Bonds of the Company (the “Bonds ”)
issued and issuable in one or more series under and equally secured by an Indenture of Mortgage, dated as of June 19, 2020 (such
Indenture as originally executed and delivered and as supplemented or amended from time to time thereafter , together with any
constituent instrume nts establishing the terms of particular Bonds, being herein called the “Mortgage Indentu re”), betwee n the
Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company , N.A., as Trustee (herein called the “Trustee ,” which term includes any
successor trustee under the Mortgage Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Mortgage Indenture for a description of the
property mortgaged, pledged and held in trust, the nature and extent of the security and the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties
and immunities of the Company , the Trustee and the Holders of the Bonds thereunder and of the terms and conditions upon which the
Bonds are, and are to be, authenticated  and delivered. The acceptance of this Bond shall be deemed to constitute the consent and
agreement by the Holder hereof to all of the terms and provisions of the Mortgage Indenture.
This Bond is issued to the Designated Agent by the Company pursuant to the Company’ s obligations under the Loan Documents.
This Bond is not subject to redemption prior to the Maturity Date specified above.
As provid ed in the Mortgage Indentur e and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, this Bond or any portion of the
principal amount hereof will be deemed  to have been paid for all purposes of the Mortgage Indenture and to be no longer Outstanding
thereunder , and the Company’ s entire indebtedness in respect thereof will be satisfied and dischar ged, if there has been irrevocably
deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent (other than the Company), in trust, money in an amount which will be sufficient and/or
Eligible Obligations, the principal of and interest on which when due, without regard to any reinvestment thereof, will provide moneys
which, together with money , if any, deposited with or held by the Trustee or such Paying Agent, will be sufficient to pay when due the
principal of and interest with respect to this Bond when due, assuming all commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement
outstanding at the time of such deposit were fully drawn.
If an Event of Defa ult (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) shall have occurred under Section 8 of the Revolving
Credit Agreement by reason of a failure  by the Company to make a payment with respect to any Principal Obligation when the same
shall be due and payable (including by acceleration) pursuant to the Loan Docu ments, it shall be deemed to be an Event of Default, for
purposes of Section  10.01 of the Mortgage Indenture, in payment of an amount of principal of this Bond equal to the amount of such
unpaid Obligation (but, in no event, in excess of the face amount (maximum principal amount) of this Bond). If an Event of Default (as
defined in the Revolving Credit Agreem ent) shall have occurred under Section 8 of the Revolving Credit Agreement by reason of a
failure by the Comp any to make a payment of any Interest Amount or any other  Obligation (other than a Principal Obligation) when the
same shall be due and payable (including by acceleration) pursuant to the Loan Documents, it shall be deemed to be an Event of
Default, for purposes of Section 10.01 of the Mortgage Indenture, in the paym ent of an amount of interest with respect to this Bond
equal to the amount  of such unpaid Interest Amount or amount of such other Obligation. The Company’ s obligation with respect to this
Bond shall be fully  satisfied when (and the holder hereof shall surrender this Bond to, or upon the order of, the Company for
cancellation) the Revolving Credit Agreement shall have been terminated, all commitments thereunder shall have been terminated, and
all of the Obligations and Interest Amounts then due and payable shall have been duly paid by the Company and all Letters of Credit (as
defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) shall have
expired or terminated or have been fully cash collateralized pursuant to Section 8 of the Revolving Credit Agreement. At the time of
surrender of this Bond, the holder hereof shall deliver such appropriate instrume nts of transfer or release as may reasonably be requested
by the Company .
If an Even t of Default shall occur and be continuing as provided in the Mortgage  Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of not less
than 25% in aggreg ate principal amount of Bonds then Outstanding, considered as one class, may declare the principal amount of all
Bonds then Outstanding to be due and payable immediately by notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by
Holders); provided , however, that with respect to certain Events of Default relating to bankruptcy , insolvency and similar events, the
principal amount of all Bonds then Outstanding shall be due and payable immediately without further action by the Trustee or the
Holders.
The Mortg age Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the Company and the Trustee to enter into one or
more supplemental indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to, or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the
provisions of, the Mortgage Indenture with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Bonds at the time Outstanding, considered as one class; provided, however , that if there shall be Bonds of more than one series
Outstanding under the Mortgage Indenture and if a proposed supplemental indenture shall directly affect the rights of the Holders of
Bonds of one or more, but less than all, of such series, then the consent only of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount
of the Outstanding Bonds of all series so directly affected, considered as one class, shall be required; and provided, further , that if the
Bonds of any series  shall have been issued in more than one Tranche and if a proposed supplemental indenture shall directly affect the
rights of the Holders  of Bonds of one or more, but less than all, of such Tranch es, then the consent only of the Holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Outsta nding Bonds of all Tranches so directly affected, considered as one class, shall be required; and
provided, further , that the Mortgage Indenture permits the Company and the Trustee to enter into one or more supplemental indentures
for certain  purposes without the consent  of any Holders of Bonds; and provided, further , that for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing
shall not change the voting requirements under Section 14.02 of the Mortgage Indenture, which for the avoidance of doubt, require the
consent of the Holders of each Outstanding Bond of each series or Tranche in certain circumstances. The Mortgage Indenture also
contains provisions permitting the Hold ers of a majority in aggregate principal amount of Bonds, on behalf of the Holders of all such
Bonds, to waive certain past defaults under the Mortgage Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder
of this Bond shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Bond and of any Bond issued upon
the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made
upon this Bond. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no supplemental indenture shall amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 10.07
of the Mortgage Indenture without the consent of the Holders.
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Mortgage Indenture, the Holder of this Bond shall not have the right to
institute any proceeding with respect to the Mortgage Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy
thereunder , unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default, the Holders of at
least 25% in aggregate principal amount  of the Bonds at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute
proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity , and the Trustee shall not have
received from the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of Bonds at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent
with such written request, and shall have  failed to institute any such proceeding for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer
of indemnity . The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Bond for the
enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or interest with respect hereto on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
No reference herein to the Mortgage Indenture and no provision of this Bond or of the Mortgage Indenture shall alter or impair
the obliga tion of the Company , which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest with respect to this Bond at the
times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency , herein prescribed.
For all purposes of the Mortgage Indent ure, the principal amount of this Bond Outstanding as of any date of calculation shall be
equal to the Obligations outstanding under the Loan Documents as of such date.
This Bond is issuable in the denomination of $4,400,000,000 or such greater or lesser amount equal to the face amount of this
Bond as provided herein.
As provided in the Mortgage Indenture and subject to certain limitations set forth therein and herein, the transfer of this Bond is
registrable in the Bond Register , upon surrender of this Bond for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any
place where the principal of and interest with respect to this Bond are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written
instrument of transfer in form satisfacto ry to the Company , the Trustee or the Bond Registrar , as the case may be, duly executed by the
Holder hereof or such Holder ’s attorne y duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Bonds of this series and of like
tenor , of authorized  denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or
transferees.
Before any transfer of this Bond by the Holder or such Holder ’s legal representative will be recognized or given effect by the
Company or the Trustee, the Holder shall note the then current principal amount payable on this Bond, the interest accrued to the date of
such trans fer and the then current face amount of this Bond, and shall notify the Company and the Trustee of the name and address of
the transferee and shall afford the Comp any and the Trustee the opportunity of verifying the notation as to such then current principal
amount payable on this Bond, the interest accrued to the date of such transfer and the then current face amount of this Bond. By
acceptance hereof the Holder of this Bond and each transferee shall be deemed to have agreed to indemnify and hold harmless the
Company and the Trustee against all losses, claims, damages or liability arising  out of any failure on part of the Holder or of any such
transferee to comply with the requirements of the preceding sentence.
No service  charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a
sum suf ficient to cover any tax or other governmental char ge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Bond for registration of transfer , the Company , the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the
Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Bond is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Bond be
overdue, and neither the Company , the Trustee nor any such agent shall be af fected by notice to the contrary .
This Bond shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York without
regard to the principles of conflicts of laws thereunder , except to the extent that the Trust Indenture Act shall be applicable.
As provided in the Mortgage Indenture,  no recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or interest with respect to
this Bond, or any part thereof, or for any claim based hereon or otherwise in respect hereof, or of the indebtedness represented hereby , or
upon any obligation, covenant or agreement under the Mortgage Indenture, against any incorporator ,
shareholder , officer or director , as such, past, present or future, of the Company or of any predecessor or successor corporation (either
directly or through the Company or a predecessor or successor corporation), whether by virtue of any constitutional provision, statute or
rule of law or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise; it being expressly agreed and understood that the Mortgage
Indenture and all the Bonds are solely corporate obligations and that any such personal liability is hereby expressly waived and released
as a condition of, and as part of the consideration for , the execution of the Mortgage Indenture and the issuance of this Bond.
Anything in this Bond, the Mortgage Indenture, or the Loan Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, any payment by the
Company of principal of or interest on this Bond shall be applied by the holder hereof to the payment of any amounts owing by the
Company on the Obligations and Intere st Amounts that are then due or are to become due, and shall, to the extent of such application,
for all purposes, satisfy and dischar ge the obligation of the Company to make such payment on such Obligations and Interest Amounts,
respectively .
Anything in this Bond, the Mortgage Indenture, or the Loan Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, any payment by the
Company of the Obligations and Interest Amounts pursuant to the Loan Documents shall, to the extent thereof, for all purposes, satisfy
and dischar ge the obligation of the Company to make a payment of principal or interest, as the case may be, in respect of this Bond that
is then due or is to become due; provided, that any such payment of the Obligations and Interest Amounts pursuant to the Loan

represent the rate at which contributing banks may obtain short-term borr owings from each other  in the London
interbank market. On March 5, 2021, the FCA  publicly announced that: (a) immediately after  December  31, 2021,
publication of all seven euro LIBOR settings, all seven Swiss Franc LIBOR settings, the spot next, 1-week, 2-month and
12-month Japanese Yen LIBOR settings, the overnight, 1-week, 2-month and 12-month British Pound Sterling LIBOR
settings, and the 1-week and 2-month U.S. Dollar  LIBOR settings will permanently cease; immediately after  June 30,

economic reality they are intended to measur e and that representativeness will not be restor ed; and immediately after
June 30, 2023, the 1-month, 3- month and 6-month U.S. Dollar  LIBOR settings will cease to be provided or, subject to the
FCA ’s consideration of the case, be provided on a synthetic basis and no longer  be representative of the underlying
market and economic reality they are intended to measur e and that representativeness will not be restor ed. Ther e is no
assurance that dates announced by the FCA  will not change or that the administrator  of LIBOR and/or  regulators will
not take further  action that could impact the availability , composition, or characteristics of LIBOR or the currencies
and/or  tenors for which LIBOR is published. Each party to this agreement should consult its own advisors to stay
informed of any such developments. Public and private sector  industry initiatives are currently underway to identify new
or alterna tive reference rates to be used in place of LIBOR a Loan denominat ed in Dollars may be derived from an
inter est rate benchmark that may be discontinued or is, or may in the futur e become, the subject of regulatory reform .
Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event  or an Early Opt-I n Election , Section 2.13(b)  and 2.13(cb) provide
theprovides a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the

Loans is based. However , the Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any
liability with respect to, (a) the administration, submission , performance  or any other matter related to LIBOR or other  rates
in the definition of “Eur odollar  Base  Rate” any interest rate used in this Agreement,  or with respect to any alternative or
successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof  (including, without limitation, (i) any such alternative, successor  or
replacement rate implemented purs uant to Section 2.13(b)  or (c), whether  upon the occurr ence of a Benchmark
Transition Event or an Early Opt-In Election, and (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming
Changes pursuant to Section 2.13(d) ),, including without limitation, whether the composition or characteristics of any such
alternative, successor
or replacement reference rate will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, the Eurodollar  Base
Rate existing interest rate being replaced  or have the same volume or liquidity as did the Lond on interb ank offer edany
existing inter est rate prior to its discontinuance or unavailability . or (b) the effect, implementation or composition of any
Conforming Chang es. The Administrative Agent and its affiliates and/or  other  related entities may engage in transactions
that affect the calculation of any inter est rate used in this Agreement or any alternative, successor  or alternative rate
(including any Benchmark Replacement) and/or  any relevant adjustments thereto, in each case, in a manner  adverse to
the Borr ower . The Administrative Agent may select information sources or services in its reasonable discr etion to
ascertain any inter est rate used in this Agreement, any component thereof, or rates referenced in the definition thereof, in
each case pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and shall have no liability to the Borr ower , any Lender  or any other
person or entity for damages of any kind, including direct or indir ect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential

or after the effectiveness thereof (the “Revolving Credit Re-Allocation Date ”) shall be made pro rata based on the
Percentages in effect on and after such Revolving Credit Re-Allocation Date (except to the extent that any such
pro rata borrowings would result in any Lender making an aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loans in
excess of its Comm itment, in which case such excess amount will be allocated to, and made by, such New
Revolving Credit Lenders and/or Lenders with such increased Commitments to the extent of, and pro rata based
on, their respective Commitments otherwise available for Revolving Loans), and continuations of
Eurodollar Term Benchmark  Loan s outstanding on such Revolving Credit Re-Allocation Date shall be effected
by repaym ent of such Eurodollar Term Benchmark  Loans on the last day of the Interest  Period applicable

the event that on any such Revolving Credit Re-Allocation Date there is an unpaid principal amount of ABR
Loans, the Borrower shall make prepayments thereof and borrowings of ABR Loans so that, after giving effect
thereto, the ABR Loans outstanding are held pro rata based on such new Percentages. In the event that on any
such Revolving Credit Re-Allocation Date there is an unpaid principal amount of Eurodollar Term Benchmark
Loans, such Eurodollar Term Benchmark  Loans shall remain outstanding with the respective holders thereof
until the expiration of their respective Interest Periods (unless the Borrower elects to prepay any thereof in
accordance with the applicable provi sions of this Agreement), and interest on and repayments of such
Eurodollar Term Benchmark  Loans will be paid thereon to the respective Lenders holding such
Eurodollar Term Benchmark  Loans pro rata based on the respective principal amounts thereof outstanding.

consenting to extend the then applicable Termination Date are hereinafter referred to as “Continuing Lenders ”,
and Lenders declining to consent to extend such Termination Date (or Lenders  deemed to have so declined) are
hereinafter referred to as “Non-Extending Lenders”. If the Required Lenders have electe d (in their sole and

“Termination Date” (except with respect to any Non-Extending Lender) shall refer to the Termination Date as so
extended.
d.If any Lender shall determine (or be deemed to have determined) not to extend the Termination Date as requested
by any Extension Notice given by the Borrower pursuant to this Section, the Commitment of such Non-Extending
Lender shall terminate on the Termination Date without giving any effect to such proposed extension, and the
Borrower shall on such date pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of such Non-Extending Lender , the
principal amount of, and accrued interest on, such Non-Extending Lender ’s Loans, together with any amounts
payable to such Lender pursuant to Section 2.17 and any and all fees or other amounts owing to such Non-
Extending Lender under this Agreement ; provided  that if the Borrower has replaced such Non-Extending Lender
pursuant to Section 2.7(e) then the provisions of such paragraph shall apply . The Total Commitments shall be
reduced by the amount of the Commitment of such Non-Extending Lender to the extent the Commitment of such
Non-Extending Lender has not been transferred to one or more Continuing Lenders pursuant to Section 2.7(e).
e.A Non-Ex tending Lender shall be obligated, at the request of the Borrower and subject to (i)(i) payment by the

recourse, representation, warranty (other than a representation that such Lender  has not created an adverse claim
on its Loans) or expense to such Non-Extending Lender , at any time prior to the Termination Date applicable to
such Non- Extending Lender , all of such Non-Extending Lender ’s rights and obligations hereunder to another
financial institution or group of financial institutions nominated by the Borrower and willing to participate as a
successor Lender in the place of such Non-Extending Lender; provided  that, if such transferee is not already a
Lender , (1) such transferee satisfies all the requirements of this Agreement, and (2) the Administrative Agent shall
have consented to such transfer , which consent shall not be unreasonably withh eld, conditioned or delayed. Each
such transferee successor Lender shall be deemed to be a Continuing Lender hereunder in replacement of the
transferor Non-Exte nding Lender and shall enjoy all rights and assume all obligations on the part of such Non-
Extending Lender set forth in this Agree ment. Each such transfer shall be effected pursuant to an Assignment and
Assumption.
f.If the Termination Date shall have been extended in respect of Continuing Lenders in accordance with this
Section, any notice of borrowing pursuant to Section 2.2 specifying a Borrowing Date occurring after the
Termination Date applicable to a Non-E xtending Lender or requesting an Inter est Period extending beyond such

respective Percentages of the Lenders.
b.Each payment (including each prepayment) by the Borrower on account of principal of and interest on the
Revolving Loans shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstandi ng principal amounts of the
Revolving Loans then held by the Lenders.
c.Notwithstanding anything to the contr ary herein, all payments (including prepayments) to be made by the
Borrower hereunder , whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without setof f or
counterclaim and shall be made prior  to 4:00 P.M., New York City time, on the due date thereof to the
Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, at the Funding Office, in Dollars and in immediately
available funds. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the Lenders promptly upon receipt in
like funds as received. If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the Eurodollar Term Benchmark
Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next
succeeding Business Day. If any payment on a Eurodollar Term Benchmark  Loan becomes due and payable on
a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day
unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into anoth er calendar month, in which event
such paym ent shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. In the case of any extension of any
payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then
applicable rate during such extension.
d.Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such
Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative
Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the
Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the
Borrower a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the
required time on the Borrowing Date therefor , such Lender shall pay to the Administrative
Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon, at a rate equal to the greater of (i)(i) the Federal Funds
Effective NYFRB  Rate and (ii)(ii) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordanc e with banking
industry rules on interbank compensat ion, for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately
available to the Adm inistrative Agent. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with
respect to any amou nts owing under this paragraph shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error . If such
Lender ’s share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three
Business Days after such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount
with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans from the Borrower within 30 days after
written demand therefor .
e.Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by the Borrower prior to the date of any
payment due to be made by the Borro wer hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment to the
Administrative Agen t, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower  is making such payment, and the
Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the
Lenders their respective pro rata shares of a corresp onding amount. If such payment is not made to the
Administrative Agen t by the Borrower within three Business Days after such due date, the Administrative Agent
shall be entitled to recover , on deman d, from each Lender to which any amount which was made available
pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum equal to the daily
average Federal Funds Effective NYFRB  Rate. Nothing herein shall be deeme d to limit the rights of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Borrower .

promptly execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note (a “Note ”) of the Borrower evidencing any
Revolving Loans of such Lender , substantially in the form of Exhibit H, with appropriate insertions as to date and
principal amount; provided , that delivery of Notes shall not be a condition precedent to the occurrence of the
Effective Date or the making of Loans on the Ef fective Date.
g.If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.14(d), then the
Administrative Agent may, in its discre tion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, (i)(i) apply any
amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of such Lender for the benefit
of the Adm inistrative Agent to satisfy such Lender ’s obligations to the Adminis trative Agent, as the case may be,
under such Section until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii)(ii) so long as such Lender is a
Defaulting Lender , hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any
future funding obligations of such Lender under any
such Section, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative
Agent in its discretion.

through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its Loans or
Commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto;
ii.impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporati on insurance charge or other similar insurance charge or similar requirement against
assets held by, deposits or other liabiliti es in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of
credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any Lender that is not otherwise included in the
determination of the Eurodollar Adjusted Term SOFR  Rate, which requirements are generally applicable
to advances, loans and other extensions of credit made by such Lender; or
iii.impose on any Lender any other condition that is generally applicable to loans made by such Lender or
participations therein by a Lender;
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient, by an amount that such Lender or
such other  Recipient deems to be material, of making, converting into, conti nuing or maintaining Loans, or to reduce any amount
receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender or such other Recipient,
within ten Business Days after its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such other Recipient for
such incre ased cost or reduced amount receivable. If any Lender or other Recipient becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts
pursuant to this paragraph, it shall prom ptly notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of the event by reason of
which it has become  so entitled; provided , however , that no Lender or other Recipient shall be entitled to demand such compensation
more than 90 days following (x) the last day of the Interest Period in respect of which such demand is made or (y) the repayment of the
Loan in respect of which such demand is made. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, no Lender shall demand compensation
pursuant to this Section 2.15 if it shall not at the time be the general policy or practice of such Lender to demand such compensation
from similarly situated borrowers (to the extent that such Lender has the right to do so under its credit facilities with similarly situated
borrowers).
b.If any Lender shall have determined that a Change of Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements shall have
the ef fect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender ’s capital or the capital of any corporation
controlling such Lender as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or
such corporation could have achieved but for such Change of Law (taking into consideration such Lender ’s or
such corporation’ s policies with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity) by an amount deemed by such Lender to
be materia l, then from time to time, after submission by such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor , the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such corporation for such reduction.
c.A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.15 submitted by any Lender or any
other Recipient to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall constitute prima facie evidence of
such costs or amounts. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.15, the Borrower shall not be
required to compensate a Lender or any other Recipient pursuant to this Section 2.15 for any amounts incurred
more than six months prior to the date that such Lender or such other Recipi ent notifies the Borrower of such
Lender ’s or such other Recipient’ s inten tion to claim compensation therefor; provided  that, if the circums tances
giving rise to such claim have a retroactive effect, then such six-month period  shall be extended to include the
period of such retro active effect not to exceed twelve months. The obligations of the Borrower pursuant to this
Section 2.15 shall survive for 90 days after the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and
all other amounts then due and payable hereunder .
2.16    Taxes.
a.Any and all paymen ts by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower under any Loan Document shall be
made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable laws. If any applicable
laws (as determined in the good faith discretion of the Borrower or Administrative Agent making the payment)
require the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment, then (A) the Borrower or Administrative
Agent, as applicable, shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by the Borrower or the
Administrative Agen t to be required, (B) the Borrower or Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall timely pay
the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with such laws, and
(C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indem nified Taxes, the sum payable by
the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withhold ing or the making of all required
deductions (includin g deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.16) the applicable
Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been
made.
b.Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above, the Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant
Governmental Auth ority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely
reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.

thereof within 10 days after demand therefor , for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including
Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.16)
payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such
Recipient, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such
Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevan t Governmental Authority .
A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or
another Recipient (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own
behalf or on behalf of a Lender or another Recipient, shall be conclusive absent manifest error .
ii. Each Lend er shall, and does hereby , severally indemnify , and shall make paymen t in respect thereof within

Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (y) the
Administrative Agen t against any Taxes attributable to such Lender ’s failure to comply with the provisions
of Section 10.6(c) (iii) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (z) the Administrative
Agent against any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender , in each case, that are payable or paid by the
Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising
therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted
by the relevant Governmental Authority . A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability
delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error . Each
Lender hereby authorizes the Administr ative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time

amount due to the Administrative Agent under this clause (ii).

Borrower or by the Administrative Agent to a Governmental Authority as provided in this
Section 2.16, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent shall deliver to
the Borrower , as the case may be, the original or a certified copy of a recei pt issued by such Governmental
Authority evidencin g such payment, a copy of any return required by laws to report such payment or other

be.

payments made under any Loan Docum ent shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at
the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly
completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent

addition, any Lender , if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver
such other  documen tation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requeste d by the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not
such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requi rements. Notwithstanding

documentation (other than such docum entation set forth in Sections 2.16(e)( ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D)
below) shall not be required if in the Lender ’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or
submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially

with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and

that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable lending office to make, maintain, or fund Loans whose interest is determined

Eurodollar Adjusted Term SOFR  Rate component of the ABR), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor , if such
Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Term Benchmark  Loans to such day, or immediately , if such Lender
may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Term Benchmark  Loans and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of
such Lend er determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Adjusted Term SOFR  Rate, the Administrative

Documents); provided  that no Agent shall be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the
opinion of its counsel, may expose such Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan

with respe ct to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less
than $10,000,000 (or , if such Assignee is an
Eligible Assignee that is an Affiliate of a Lender , $5,000,000) unless each of the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, provided  that (1) no such consent of the
Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (2)

effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make
such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate
(which may be outright payment, purchases by the Assignee of participations or sub-participations, or other compensating
actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans
previously requested  but not funded by the Defaulting Lender , to each of which the applicable Assignee and assignor hereby
irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full
pro rata share of all Loans in accordance with its Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of
rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable law without compliance with
the provisi ons of this paragraph, then the Assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of
this Agreement until such compliance occurs.
iii.    Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) below , from and after the effective
date speci fied in each Assignment and Assumption the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the
extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, shall have the rights and obligations of a
Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by
such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an
Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender ’s rights and obligations under this Agreement,
such Lender shall cease to be a party
hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.5 but shall be subject to
the limitations set forth therein); provided , that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected
parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party
hereunder arising from the Lender ’s having been a Defaulting Lender . Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of
rights or obligation s under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 10.6 shall be treated for
purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in
accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.
vi.    The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower (and such agency
being solely to establish that the relevant obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United
States Treasury Regulations), shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption
delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments
of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the
“Register ”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Borrower , the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to
the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notw ithstanding notice to the contrary .
The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender , at any reasonable time and from
time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

Assignee, the Assignee’ s completed administrative questionnaire (unless the Assignee shall already be a Lender
hereunder), the processing and recordati on fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent
to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Admini strative Agent shall accept such
Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register . No assignment shall be
effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.
c.    
i.Any Lend er may, without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to
one or more banks or other entities (other than a Defaulting Lender or the Borrower or any of the Borrower ’s
Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (a “Participan t”) in all or a portion of such Lender ’s rights and obligations under this
Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans owing to it); provided  that (A) such
Lender ’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the
Borrower , the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Lender in connectio n with such Lender ’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement pursuant to
which a Lender sells such a participatio n shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this
Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided
that such agreement may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any
amendment, modific ation or waiver that (1) requires the consent of each Lender  directly affected thereby pursuant
to the proviso to the second sentence of Section 10.1 and (2) directly affects such Participant. Subject to
paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to the same  extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment
pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section.
ii.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 2.15 or 2.16 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with
respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant
is made with the Borrower ’s prior written consent to such greater payments. Any Participant that is a
Foreign Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 unless such Participant complies with
Section 2.16(e).
iii.Each Lend er that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the
Borrower , maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal
amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’ s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan
Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all
or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Parti cipant or any information
relating to a Participant’ s interest in any commitments, loans or its other obligations under any Loan
Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such
commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the
United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent
manifest error , and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register
as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the
contrary . For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent)
shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register .
d.    Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this
Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender , including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal
Reserve Bank or other central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender , and this Section shall not apply to any such
pledge or assignment of a security intere st; provided  that no such pledge  or assignment of a security interest shall release
a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee  or Assignee for such Lender as a party
hereto.
e.    The Borrower , upon receipt of writt en notice from the relevant Lender , agrees to issue Notes to any Lender requiring
Notes to facilitate transactions of the type described in paragraph (d) above.
f.    Notwithstanding  the foregoing, any Conduit Lender may assign any or all of the Loans it may have funded hereunder
to its designating Lender without the consent of the Borrower or the Admini strative Agent and without regard to the
limitations set forth in Section 10.6(b). Each of the Borrower , each Lender and the Administrative Agent hereby confirms
that it will not institute against a Cond uit Lender or join any other Person in instituting against a Conduit Lender any
bankruptcy , reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceeding under any state bankruptcy or similar law,
for one year and one day after the payment in full of the latest maturing comm ercial paper note issued by such Conduit
Lender; provided , however , that each Lender designating any Conduit Lender hereby agrees to indemnify , save and hold
harmless each other party hereto for any loss, cost, damage, expense, obligations, penalties, actions, judgments, suits or
any kind whatsoever arising out of its inability to institute such a proceeding against such Conduit Lender during such
period of forbearance.
g.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, none of the Agents, in their capacity as Lenders, will assign
without the consent of the Borrower , prior to the Effective Date, any of the Commitments held by them on the Effective
Date.
h.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 10.6, for the avoidance of doubt, Goldman Sachs Bank USA

portion of the Obligations owing to each such other Lender hereunder , or shall  provide such other Lenders with
the benefi ts of any such collateral, as shall be necessary to cause such Benefitted Lender to share the excess

interest.

off and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or final), in any currency , and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency , in each case
whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such
Lender or any branc h, Affiliate or agen cy thereof to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower; provided ,
that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall
be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of
Section 2.20 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and
deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lende rs, and (y) the Defaulting Lender

Agreement on any number of separate counterparts, and all of said counterparts  taken together shall be deemed to constitute one
and the same instrum ent. Delivery of an executed signature page of this Agreement by facsimile transmission, emailed pdf. or

by a Person with the intent to sign, authenticate or accept such
contract or record, deliveries or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity

represent the rate at which contributing banks may obtain short-term borr owings from each other  in the London
interbank market. On March 5, 2021, the FCA  publicly announced that: (a) immediately after  December  31, 2021,
publication of all seven euro LIBOR settings, all seven Swiss Franc LIBOR settings, the spot next, 1-week, 2-month and
12-month Japanese Yen LIBOR settings, the overnight, 1-week, 2-month and 12-month British Pound Sterling LIBOR
settings, and the 1-week and 2-month U.S. Dollar  LIBOR settings will permanently cease; immediately after  June 30,

market and economic reality they are intended to measur e and that representativeness will not be restor ed. Ther e is no
assurance that dates announced by the FCA  will not change or that the administrator  of LIBOR and/or  regulators will
not take further  action that could impact the availability , composition, or characteristics of LIBOR or the currencies
and/or  tenors for which LIBOR is published. Each party to this agreement should consult its own advisors to stay
informed of any such developments. Public and private sector  industry initiatives are currently underway to identify new
or alterna tive reference rates to be used in place of LIBOR a Loan denominat ed in Dollars may be derived from an

successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof  (including, without limitation, (i) any such alternative,
successor  or replacement rate implemented pursuant to Section 2.13(b)  or (c), whether  upon the occurr ence of a
Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-In Election, and (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement
Conforming Chang es pursuant to Section 2.13(d) ),, inclu ding without limitation, whether the composition or characteristics
of any such alterna tive, successor or replacement reference rate will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic
equivalence of, the Eurodollar  Base Rate existing inter est rate being replaced  or have the same volume or liquidity as did the
London interbank  offer edany existing inter est rate prior to its discontinuance or unavailability . or (b) the effect,
implementation or composition of any Conforming Changes. The Designated Agent and its affiliates and/or  other  related
entities may engage in transactions that affect the calculation of any interest rate used in this Agreement or any
alternative, successor  or alternative rate (including any Benchmark Replacement) and/or  any relevant adjustments
thereto, in each case, in a manner  adverse to the Borr ower . The Designated Agent may select information sources or
services in its reasonable discr etion to ascertain any inter est rate used in this Agreement, any component thereof, or rates
referenced in the definition thereof, in each case pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and shall have no liability to
the Borr ower , any Lender  or any other person or entity for damages of any kind, including direct or indir ect, special,

entitled to claim any additional amounts  pursuant to this paragraph, it shall promptly notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Designated
Agent) of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled; provided , however , that no Lender or other Recipient shall be entitled
to demand such compensation more than 90 days following (x) the last day of the Interest Period in respect of which such demand is
made or (y) the repayment of the Loan in respect of which such demand is made, and no Issuing Lender shall be entitled to demand such
compensation more than 90 days follow ing the expiration or termination (by drawing or otherwise) of the Letter of Credit issued by it in
respect of which such demand is made. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, no Lender shall demand compensation pursuant to
this Section 2.15 if it shall not at the time be the general policy or practice of such Lender to demand such compensation from similarly
situated borrowers (to the extent that such Lender has the right to do so under its credit facilities with similarly situated borrowers).
(b)    If any Lender or any Issuing Lender shall have determined that a Chan ge of Law regarding capital or liquidity
requirements shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender ’s or such Issuing Lender ’s capital or the
capital of any corporation controlling such Lender or such Issuing Lender as a consequence of its obligations hereunder
or under or in respe ct of any Letter of Credit to a level below that which such Lender , such Issuing Lender or such
corporation could have achieved but for such Change of Law (taking into consideration such Lender ’s, such Issuing
Lender ’s or such corporation’ s policies  with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity) by an amount deemed by such
Lender or such Issuing Lender to be material, then from time to time, after submission by such Lender or such Issuing
Lender to the Borro wer (with a copy to the Designated Agent) of a written request therefor , the Borrower shall pay to
such Lender or such Issuing Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender , such Issuing
Lender or such corporation for such reduction.
(c)    A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.15 submitted by any Lender , any
Issuing Lender or any other Recipient to the Borrower (with a copy to the Designated Agent) shall constitute prima facie
evidence of such costs or amounts. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.15, the Borrower shall not
be require d to compensate a Lender , any Issuing Lender or any other Recipie nt pursuant to this Section 2.15 for any
amounts incurred more than six months prior to the date that such Lender , such Issuing Lender or such other Recipient
notifies the Borrower of such Lender ’s, such Issuing Lender ’s or such other Recipient’ s intention to claim compensation
therefor; provided  that, if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a retroactive effect, then such six-month
period shall be exten ded to include the period of such retroactive effect not to exceed twelve months. The obligations of
the Borrower pursuant
to this Section 2.15 shall survive for 90 days after the termination of this Agreem ent and the payment of the Loans and all
other amounts then due and payable hereunder .
2.16    Taxes.
(a)    Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower under any Loan Document shall be made
without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable laws. If any applicable laws (as
determined in the good faith discretion of the Borrower or Designated Agent making the payment) require the deduction
or withholding of any Tax from any such payment, then (A)(A) the Borrower or Designated Agent, as applicable shall
withhold or make such deductions as are determined by the Borrower or the Designated Agent to be required, (B)(B) the
Borrower or Designated Agent, as applicable shall timely pay the full amou nt withheld or deducted to the relevant
Governmental Autho rity in accordance with such laws, and (C)(C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made
on accoun t of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after any
required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums
payable under this Section 2.16) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had
no such withholding or deduction been made.
(b)    Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above, the Borro wer shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental
Authority in accordance with applicable  law, or at the option of the Designated Agent timely reimburse it for the payment
of, any Other Taxes.
(c)    (i) The Borro wer shall, and does hereby , indemnify each Recipient, and shall make payment in respect thereof
within 10 days after demand therefor , for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes
imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.16) payable or paid by such Recipient or
required to be withh eld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or
with respe ct thereto,  whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant
Governmental Authority . A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a
Lender or another Recipient (with a copy to the Designated Agent), or by the Designated Agent on its own behalf or on
behalf of a Lender or another Recipient, shall be conclusive absent manifest error .
(i)(ii) Each Lender and each Issuing Lender shall, and does hereby , severally indemnify , and shall make
payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor , (x) the Designated Agent against any
Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender or such Issuing Lender (but only to the extent that the
Borrower has not already indemnified the Designated Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without
limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (y) the Designated Agent against any Taxes attributable
to such Lender ’s or such Issuing Lender ’s failure to comply with the provisi ons of Section 10.6(c)(iii)
relating to the main tenance of a Participant Register and (z) the Designated Agent against any Excluded
Taxes attributable to
such Lend er or such Issuing Lender , in each case, that are payable or paid by the Designated Agent in
connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect
thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant
Governmental Auth ority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any
Lender or any Issui ng Lender by the Designated Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error . Each
Lender and each Issuing Lender hereby authorizes the Designated Agent to set off and apply any and all
amounts at any time owing to such Lender or such Issuing Lender , as the case may be, under this
Agreement or any other Loan Docume nt against any amount due to the Designated Agent under this
clause (ii).
(d)    Upon request by the Borrower or the Designated Agent, as the case may be, after any payment of Taxes by the
Borrower or by the Designated Agent to a Governmental Authority as provided  in this Section 2.16, the Borrower shall
deliver to the Designated Agent or the Designated Agent shall deliver to the Borrower , as the case may be, the original or
a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return
required by laws to report such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower or the
Designated Agent, as the case may be.
(e)    (i) Any Lender or any Issuing Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with
respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Designated Agent, at the time
or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Designated Agent, such properly completed and executed
documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Designated Agent as will permit such payments to be made
without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender or any Issuing Lender , if reasonably
requested by the Borrower or the Designated Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law
or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Designated Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Designated Agent to
determine whether or not such Lender or such Issuing Lender is subject to back up withholding or information reporting
requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and
submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Sections 2.16(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D)
below) shall not be required if in the Lender ’s or any Issuing Lender ’s reasona ble judgment such completion, execution
or submiss ion would subject such Lender or such Issuing Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would
materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender or such Issuing Lender .
(ii)    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
(A)    any Lender or any Issuing Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver  to the Borrower and the
Designated Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender or such Issuing Lender
becomes a Lender or an Issuing Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the
reasonable request of the Borrower or the Designated Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying
that such Lender or such Issuing Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;
(B)    any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the
Designated Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipi ent) on or prior to the date

(II)     executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI;
(III)    in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section

within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of
Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” describ ed in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S.
Tax Compliance Certificate ”) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable; or
(IV)    to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner , executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY ,
accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate
substantially in the form of Exhibit G-2 or Exhibit G-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each
beneficial owner , as applicable; provided  that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect
partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S.
Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner .
.
(C)    any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliv er to the Borrower and the Designated Agent (in
such number of copies as shall be requested by
the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender or an Issuing Lender under this Agreement (and
from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Designated Agent), executed copies of any other form
prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed,
together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Designated
Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
(D)    if a payment made to a Lender or any Issuing Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal
withholding Tax imposed by FATCA  if such Lender or such Issuing Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting
requirements of FATCA  (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender or such
Issuing Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Designated Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Designated Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as
prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3) (C)(i)  of the Code) and such additional docu mentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the
Designated Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Designated Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA  and to
determine that such Lender or such Issuing Lender has complied with such Lend er’s or such Issuing Lender ’s obligations under FATCA
or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely  for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include
any amendments made to F ATCA  after the Ef fective Date.
(iii)    Each Lender and each Issuing Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered
pursuant to this Section 2.16 expires or beco mes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or
certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Designated Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
(f)    At no time shall the Designated Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender or an
Issuing Lender any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender or such Issuing
Lender , as the case may be. If any Recipient determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received
a refund of, or credit with respect to, any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.16
(including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.16), it shall pay to the Borrower an amount
equal to such refund or credit (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section 2.16 with respect to
the Taxes giving rise to such refund or credit), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified
party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such
refund or credit). The Borrower , upon the request of such indemnified party , shall repay to such indemnified party the
amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (f) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant
Governmental Auth ority) in the event  such indemnified party is required to repay such refund or credit to such
Governmental Authority . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (f), in no event will the indemnified
party be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph (f) the payment of which would place the
indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnif ied party would have been in if the Tax
subject to
indemnification and giving rise to such refund or credit had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the
indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph (f) shall
not be construed to require any Recipien t to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes
that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
(g)    Each party’ s obligations under this Section 2.16 shall survive for one year after the termination of this Agreement
and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder .
2.17    Indemnity . The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender for, and to hold each Lender harmless from, any loss (other
than the loss of Applicable Margin) or expense that such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a)(a) default by the
Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of Eurodollar Term Benchmark  Loans after the Borrower
has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (b)(b) default by the Borrower in
making any prepayment of or conversion from Eurodollar Term Benchmark  Loans after the Borrower has given a notice
thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or (c)(c) the making of a prepayment of Eurodollar Term
Benchmark  Loan s on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. A certificate as to any amounts
payable pursuant to this Section submit ted to the Borrower by any Lender shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error .
This cove nant shall  survive for 90 days after the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other
amounts payable hereunder .
2.18    Change of Lending Office. Each Lender agree s that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of
Section 2.15 or 2.16 with respect to such Lender , it will, if requested by the Borrower , use reasonable efforts (subject to overall
policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Loans affected by such event with the object of
avoiding the consequences of such event; provided, that such designation is made on terms that, in the sole but reasonable
judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its lending office(s) to suffer no unreimbursed economic disadvantage or any
legal or regulatory disadvantage, and provided, further , that nothing in this Section shall affect or postpone any of the obligations
of the Borrower or the rights of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.16.
2.19    Replacement of Lenders . The Borrower shall be permitted to replace any Lender that (a)(a) requests (on its behalf or any
of its Participants) reimbursement for amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.16, (b) provides notice under Section 2.21 or
(c) becom es a Defaulting Lender , with a replacement financial institution; provided that (i)(i) such replacement does not conflict
with any Requireme nt of Law, (ii)(ii) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement,
(iii)(iii) prior to any such replacement, such Lender shall have taken no action under Section 2.18 which eliminates the continued
need for payment of amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.16, (iv)(iv) the replacement financial institution shall
purchase, at par, all Loans and other amounts owing to such replaced Lender on or prior to the date of replacement, (v)(v) the
Borrower shall be liable to such replaced Lender under Section 2.17 if any Eurodollar Term Benchmark  Loan owing to such
replaced Lender shall be purchased other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto, (vi)(vi) the replacement
financial institution, if not
already a Lender , shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Designated Agent, (vii)(vii) the replaced Lender shall be obligated to
make such replacement in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.6 (provided that the Borrower shall be obligated to pay
the registration and processing fee referr ed to therein), (viii)(viii) until such time as such replacement shall be consummated, the
Borrower shall pay all additional amounts (if any) required pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.16, as the case may be, and (ix)(ix) any
such replacement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights that the Borrower , the Designated Agent or any other Lender
shall have against the replaced Lender .
2.20    Defaulting Lenders . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a
Defaulting Lender , then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender , to the extent permitted by applicable
law:
(a)    any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts (other than those described in Section 2.20(b)) received by
the Designated Agent for the account of that Defaulting Lender (whether volunt ary or mandatory , at maturity , pursuant to
Section 7 or otherwise, and including any amounts made available to the Designated Agent by that Defaulting Lender
pursuant to Section 9.7), shall be applied  at such time or times as may be determined by the Designated Agent as follows:
first, to the payment of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the Designated Agent hereunder; second , to the
payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to any Issuing Lender hereunder; third, if so
requested by any Issuing Lender with a Letter of Credit outstanding or with unreimbursed drawings owing under a Letter
of Credit, to be held as cash collateral in respect of such Defaulting Lender ’s Percentage of such L/C Obligations; fourth ,
if so deter mined by the Designated Agent or requested by any Issuing Lender , to be held as cash collateral for future
funding obligations of that Defaulting Lender of any participation in any L/C Obligations; fifth, as the Borrower may
request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which that Defaulting
Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Designated Agent; sixth ,
if so determined by the Borrower with the consent of the Designated Agent, not to be unreasonably withheld, to be held
in a non-i nterest bearing deposit account and released in order to satisfy obligations of that Defaulting Lender to fund
Loans under this Agreement; seventh , to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders or any Issuing Lender as a
result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender or any Issuing Lender against that
Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender ’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; eighth , so long
as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that
Defaulting Lender ’s breach of its obliga tions under this Agreement; and ninth , to that Defaulting Lender or as otherwise
directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any
Loans or unreimbur sed drawings under Letters of Credit in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has not fully funded
its approp riate share such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans and unreimbursed drawings under Letters of
Credit of all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of that
Defaulting
Lender or participating interests of that Defaulting Lender in unreimbursed drawings under Letters of Credit. Any
payments, prepayme nts or other amount s paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts
owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post cash collateral pursuant to this Section 2.20(a) shall be deemed paid to and
redirected by that Defaulting Lender , and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto;
(b)    [reserved];
(c)    during any period in which there is a Defaulting Lender , for purposes of computing the amount of the obligation of
each non-Defaulting Lender to acquire, refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit pursuant to Section 3.4, the
Percentage of each non-Defaulting Lender shall be computed without giving effect to the Commitment of that Defaulting
Lender; provided, that, (i) each such reallocation shall be given effect only if, at the date the applicable Lender becomes a
Defaulting Lender , no Default or Event of Default exists; and (ii) the aggregate obligation of each non-Defaulting Lender
to acquire, refinance or fund participations in L/C Obligations shall not exceed  the positive difference, if any, of (1) the
Commitment of that non-Defaulting Lender minus (2) the aggregate outstanding Loans of that Lender and that Lender ’s
Percentage of L/C Obligations. Subject to Section 10.20, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of
any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting
Lender , including any claim of a non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such non-Defaulting Lender ’s increased exposure
following such reallocation.
(d)    if the reallocation described in paragraph (c) above cannot, or can only partially , be effected, the Borrower shall
within one Business Day following notice by the Designated Agent (after giving effect to any partial reallocation
pursuant to paragrap h (c) above) deposi t cash with the Designated Agent as collateral to secure such Defaulting Lender ’s
Percentage of any outstanding L/C Obligations for so long as any such L/C Obligation are outstanding; and
(e)    that Defaulting Lender ’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or
consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of “Required Lenders” and Section
10.1.
If the Borrower , the Designated Agent and each Issuing Lender reasonably determine in writing that a Defaulting Lender should no
longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender , the Designated Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date
specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any cash
collateral), that Lender will, to the exten t applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Loans and Participation Amounts of the other
Lenders or take such other actions as the Designated Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded
participations in Letters of Credit to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lender s in accordance with their Percentages (without giving
effect to Section 2.20(c)), whereupon that Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made
retroactively with respect to fees accrued  or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender;
and provided, further ,
that excep t to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will
constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender ’s having been a Defaulting Lender .
Cash colla teral held by the Designated Agent to reduce Fronting Exposure shall be released to the applicable Lender promptly following
(i)(i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure or other obligation s giving rise thereto (including by the termination of
Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its assign ee following compliance with Section 10.6)); (ii)(ii) the
Designated Agent’ s good faith determination that there exists excess cash collateral; and (iii)(iii) the termination of the Commitment
Period and the repayment in full of all outstanding Loans and L/C Obligations.
2.21    Illegality . If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted
that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable lending office to make, maintain, or fund Loans whose interest is determined
by reference to the Eurodollar Adjusted Term SOFR  Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar
Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender  to purchase or
sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market Adjusted Term SOFR Rate , then, upon notice thereof
by such Lender to the Borrower (thro ugh the Designated Agent), (a) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue
Eurodollar Term Benchmark  Loans or to convert ABR Loans to Eurodollar Term Benchmark  Loans shall be suspended, and
(b) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining ABR Loans the interest rate on which is determined
by reference to the Eurodollar Adjusted Term SOFR  Rate component of the ABR, the interest rate on which ABR Loans of
such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality , be determined by the Designated Agent without reference to the
Eurodollar Adjusted Term SOFR  Rate component of the ABR, in each case until such Lender notifies the Designated Agent
and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the
Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Designated Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all
Eurodollar Term Benchmark  Loans of such Lend er to ABR Loans (the interest rate on which ABR Loans of such Lender shall,
if necessary to avoid such illegality , be determined by the Designated Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Adjusted Term
SOFR  Rate component of the ABR), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor , if such Lender may lawfully continue
to maintain such Eurodollar Term Benchmark  Loan s to such day, or immediately , if such Lender may not lawfully continue to
maintain such Eurodollar Term Benchmark  Loans and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining  or
charging interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Adjusted Term SOFR  Rate, the Designate d Agent shall during the period of
such suspension compute the ABR applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurodollar Adjusted Term SOFR  Rate
component thereof until the Designated Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to
determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Adjusted Term SOFR  Rate. Upon any such prepayment or
conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional
amounts required pursuant to Section 2.17.

Borrower on any Business Day on or after the Effective Date and during the Commitment Period in such form as may be
approved from time to time by such Issuing Lender; provided , that each of Goldm an Sachs Bank USA, Credit Suisse AG,
New York Branch, Barclays Bank PLC and their respective Affiliates shall not be required to issue any commercial letters
of credit; provided  further  that no Issuing Lender shall issue, amend or extend any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect
to such issuance, amendment or extension, (i)(i) the aggregate amount of L/C Obligations owed by the Borrower to any
Issuing Lender shall exceed the amoun t of such Issuing Lender ’s L/C Pro Rata Commitment (or such higher amount
agreed upon in writi ng between the Borrower and such Issuing Lender), (ii)(ii) the L/C Obligations would exceed the L/C
Commitment, (iii)(iii) the aggregate amount of the Available Commitments would be less than zero or (iv) the Total
Extensions of Credit would exceed the outstanding principal amount of the Senior Bond at any time (as determined by
the Designated Agent). Each Letter of Credit shall (i) be denominated in Dollars and, (ii) subject to the second paragraph
of Section 3.2, expire no later than the earlier of (x) the first anniversary of its date of issuance and (y) the date which is
five Business Days prior to the Termination Date (such fifth Business Day , the “ Letter of Credit Expiration Date ”).
(b)    No Issuing Lender shall at any time be obligated to issue, amend or extend any Letter of Credit hereunder if such
issuance, amendment or extension would (i)(i) conflict with, or cause such Issuing Lender or any L/C Participant to
exceed any limits imposed by, any applicable Requirement of Law, (ii)(ii) violate one or more policies of the Issuing
Lender applicable to letters of credit generally or (iii) violate any order , judgment, or decree of any Governmental

law applicable to such Issuing Lender . No Issuing Lender shall be under any obligation to issue, amend or extend any
Letter of Credit that is not a standby Letter of Credit, unless otherwise agreed by such Issuing Lender . In the event there
is a Defau lting Lender as of the date of any request for the issuance of a Letter of Credit, no Issuing Lender shall be
required to issue or arrange for such Letter of Credit to the extent the Issuing Lender is not reasonably satisfied that the
Defaulting Lender ’s L/C Obligations with respect to such Letter of Credit have been reallocated and/or cash
collateralized pursuant to Section 2.20.
(c)    Unless otherwise specified herein, the amount of a Letter of Credit at any time shall be deemed to be the stated
amount of such Letter of Credit in effect at such time; provided , however , that with respect to any Letter of Credit that
provides for one or more automatic increases in the stated amount thereof, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be
deemed to be the maximum stated amount of such Letter of Credit after giving effect to all such increases, whether or not
such maximum stated amount is in ef fect at such time.
(d)    For all purposes of this Agreemen t, if on any date of determination, a Letter of Credit has expired by its terms but
any amount may still be drawn
thereunder by reason of the operation of any rule of law or uniform practices to which any Letter of Credit is subject
(including Rule 3.13 and Rule 3.14 of the ISP) or similar terms in the Letter of Credit itself that permit a drawing to be
made under such Letter of Credit after the expiration thereof, such Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be “outstanding” in
the amount so remaining available to be drawn.
3.2    Procedure for Issuance of Letters  of Credit . The Borrower may from time to time request that an Issuing Lender issue a
Letter of Credit by delivering to such Issuing Lender at its address for notices specified herein an Application therefor ,
completed to the satisfaction of such Issuing Lender , and such other certificates , documents and other papers and information as
such Issui ng Lender  may request. Conc urrently with the delivery of an Application to an Issuing Lender , the Borrower shall
deliver a copy thereof to the Designated Agent and the Designated Agent shall provide notice of such request to the Lenders.
Upon receipt of any Application, an Issuing Lender will process such Application and the certificates, documents and other
papers and informat ion delivered to it in connection therewith in accordance with its customary procedures and shall promptly
issue the Letter of Credit requested thereby by issuing the original of such Letter of Credit to the beneficiary thereof or as
otherwise may be agreed to by such Issuing Lender and the Borrower (but in no event shall any Issuing Lender be required to
issue any Letter of Credit earlier than three Business Days after its receipt of the Application therefor and all such other
certificates, docume nts and other papers and information relating thereto). Promptly after issuance by an Issuing Lender of a
Letter of Credit, such Issuing Lender shall furnish a copy of such Letter of Credit to the Borrower . The Borrower is responsible
for the final text of the Letter of Credit as issued by an Issuing Lender , irrespective of any assistance such Issuing Lender may
provide such as drafting or recommendi ng text or by Issuing Lender ’s use or refusal to use text submitted by the Borrower . The
Borrower is solely responsible for the suitability of the Letter of Credit for the Borrower ’s purposes. Each Issuing Lender shall
promptly give notice to the Designated Agent of the issuance of each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender (including
the amount thereof), and shall provide a copy of such Letter of Credit to the Designated Agent as soon as possible after the date
of issuance. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by an Issuing Lender and the Borrower , when a Letter of Credit is issued (i)(i) the
rules of the ISP shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit, and (ii)(ii) the rules of the Uniform Customs and Practice for
Documentary Credit s, as most recently published by the International Chamber of Commerce at the time of issuance shall apply
to each commercial Letter of Credit.
If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Application, the Issuing Lender may, in its sole discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit
that has automatic extension provisions (each, an “Auto-Extension Letter of Credit ”); provided  that any such Auto- Extension Letter of
Credit must permit the Issuing Lender to prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the
date of issuance of such Letter of Cred it) by giving prior notice to the benefi ciary thereof not later than a day (the “Non-Extension
Notice Date ”) in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed
by the Issuing Lender , the Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to the Issuing Lender for any such extension. Once
an Auto-E xtension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the Issuing
Lender to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date;
provided , however , that the Issuing Lender shall not permit any such extension if it has received notice (which may be by
telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is seven Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (1)(1) from the
Designated Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2)(2) from the Designated Agent, any Lender
or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 5.2 is not then satisfied, and in each such case
directing the Issuing Lender not to permit such extension.
3.3    Fees and Other Char ges.
(a)    The Borrower will pay a fee on the aggregate drawable amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit at a per annum
rate equal to the Applicable Margin then in effect with respect to Eurodollar Term Benchmark  Loans, shared ratably
among the Lenders (other than Defaul ting Lenders to the extent provided in Section 2.20) in accordance with their
respective Percentages and payable quarterly in arrears on each Fee Payment Date after the issuance date. In addition, the
Borrower shall pay to the relevant Issuing Lender for its own account a fronting  fee on the aggregate drawable amount of
all outstanding Letters of Credit issued  in an amount to be agreed between the Borrower and such Issuing Lender ,
payable quarterly in arrears on each Fee Payment Date after the issuance date.
(b)    In addition to the foregoing fees, the Borrower shall pay or reimburse each Issuing Lender for such normal and
customary costs and expenses as are incurred or charged by such Issuing Lender in issuing, negotiating, effecting
payment under , amending, extending or otherwise administering any Letter of Credit.
3.4    L/C Participations .
(a)    Each Issuing Lender irrevocably agrees to grant and hereby grants to each L/C Participant, and, to induce each
Issuing Lender to issue Letters of Credi t hereunder , each L/C Participant irrevo cably agrees to accept and purchase and
hereby accepts and purchases from each Issuing Lender , on the terms and conditions hereinafter stated, for such L/C
Participant’ s own account and risk, an undivided interest equal to such L/C Participant’ s Percentage in each Issuing
Lender ’s obligations and rights under each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender hereunder and the amount of
each draw ing paid by such Issuing Lend er thereunder . Each L/C Participant unconditionally and irrevocably agrees with
each Issui ng Lender  that, if a drawing is paid under any Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender for which such
Issuing Lender is not reimbursed in full by the Borrower in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such L/C
Participant shall pay to the Designated Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender upon demand at such Issuing
Lender ’s address for notices specified herein (and thereafter the Designated Agent shall promptly pay to such Issuing
Lender) an amount equal to such L/C Participant’ s Percentage of the amount of such drawing, or any part thereof, that is
not so reimbursed. Each L/C Participan t’s obligation to pay such amount shall be absolute and unconditional and shall
not be affected by any circumstance, including (i)(i) any setof f, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that
such L/C Participant may have against the Issuing Lender , the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever ,
(ii)(ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other
conditions specified  in Section 5, (iii)(iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise)  of the Borrower ,
(iv)(iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the
Borrower or any other L/C Participant or (v)(v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever , whether or not
similar to any of the foregoing.
(b)    If any amount (a “Participation Amount ”) required  to be paid by any L/C Participant to an Issuing Lender pursuant
to Section  3.4(a) in respect of any unreimbursed portion of any payment made by such Issuing Lender under any Letter
of Credit is not paid to such Issuing Lender within three Business Days after the date such payment is due, such Issuing
Lender shall so notify the Designated Agent, which shall promptly notify the L/C Participants, and each L/C Participant
shall pay to the Designated Agent, for the account of such Issuing Lender , on demand (and thereafter the Designated
Agent shall promptl y pay to such Issuing Lender) an amount equal to the product of (i)(i) such Participation Amount,
times  (ii)(ii) the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate during the period from and including the date such payment
is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such Issuing Lender , times (iii)(iii) a fraction
the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse during such period and the denominator of which is 360. If any
Participation Amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant pursuant to Section 3.4(a) is not made available to the
Designated Agent for the account of the relevant Issuing Lender by such L/C Participant within three Business Days after
the date such payme nt is due, the Designated Agent on behalf of such Issuing  Lender shall be entitled to recover from
such L/C Participan t, on demand, such Participation Amount with interest thereon calculated from such due date at the
rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans. A certificate of the Designated Agent submitted on behalf of an Issuing Lender
to any L/C Particip ant with respect to any amounts owing under this Sectio n shall be conclusive in the absence of
manifest error .
(c)    Whenever , at any time after an Issuing Lender has made payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from
the Design ated Agent any L/C Particip ant’s pro rata share of such payment in accordance with Section 3.4(a), such
Issuing Lender receives any payment related to such Letter of Credit (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise,
including proceeds of collateral applied  thereto by such Issuing Lender), or any payment of interest on account thereof,
such Issui ng Lender  will distribute to the Designated Agent for the account of such L/C Participant (and thereafter the
Designated Agent will promptly distribute to such L/C Participant) its pro rata share thereof; provided , however , that in
the event that any such payment received by such Issuing Lender shall be required to be returned by such Issuing Lender ,
such L/C Participant shall return to the Designated Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender (and thereafter the
Designated Agent shall promptly return to such Issuing Lender) the portion thereof previously distributed by such Issuing
Lender .
3.5    Reimbursement Obligation of the Borrower . The Borrower agrees to reimburse each Issuing Lender on (i) the Business
Day on which the Borrower receives notice from an Issuing Lender of a draw ing on a Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing
Lender and paid by such Issuing Lender , if such notice is received on such Business Day prior to 11:00 A.M., New York City
time, or (ii) if clause (i) above does not apply , the Business Day immediately following the day on which the Borrower receives
such notic e, for the amount of (a)(a) such draft so paid and (b)(b) any taxes, fees, charges or other costs or expenses incurred by
such Issuing Lender in connection with such payment which are obligations of the Borrower hereunder (the
amounts described in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b) in respect of any drawing, collectively , the “Payment Amount”). Each
such payment shall be made to such Issuing Lender at its address for notices specified herein in lawful money of the United
States and in immediately available funds. Interest shall be payable on each Payment Amount from the date of the applicable
drawing until payment in full at the rate set forth in (i)(i) until the second Business Day following the date of the applicable
drawing, Section 2.11(b) and (ii)(ii) thereafter , Section 2.11(c). If the Borrower fails to make such payment in accordance with
the foregoing, such failure shall be deemed to constitute a request by the Borrower to the Designated Agent for a borrowing
pursuant to Section 2.1 of ABR Loans in an amount equal to the Payment Amount. The Borrowing Date with respect to such
borrowing shall be the first date on which a borrowing of Revolving Loans could be made, pursuant to Section 2.1, if the
Designated Agent had received a notice  of such borrowing at the time the Designated Agent receives notice from the relevant
Issuing Lender of such drawing under such Letter of Credit.
3.6    Obligations Absolute . The Borrower ’s obligations under this Section 3 shall be absolute and unconditional under any and
all circum stances and irrespective of any setof f, counterclaim or defense to payment that the Borrower may have or have had
against any Issuing Lender , any benefici ary of a Letter of Credit or any other Person. The Borrower also agrees with each Issuing
Lender that such Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for, and the Borrower ’s Reimbursement Obligations under Section 3.5
shall not be affected by, among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even
though such documents shall in fact prove to be invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any dispute between or among the Borrower and
any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred or any claims
whatsoever of the Borrower against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee. No Issuing Lender shall be
liable for any error , omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however
transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit, except for errors or omissions caused by such Issuing Lender ’s gross
negligence or willful misconduct as determined by final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction. The
Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by an Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit issued by
it or the related draft s or documents, if done in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by final non-
appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction, shall be binding on the Borrower and shall not result in any liability of
such Issuing Lender to the Borrower . The liability of an Issuing Lender under , in connection with or arising out of any Letter of
Credit (or pre-advice), regardless of the form or legal grounds of the action or proceeding, shall be limited to direct damages
suffered by the Borrower that is caused directly by such Issuing Lender ’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, in each case as
determined in a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, in (i) honoring a presentation under a Letter
of Credit that on its face does not at least substantially comply with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit, (ii) failing
to honor a presentation under a Letter of Credit that strictly complies with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit, or
(iii) retain ing docum ents presented for purposes of drawing under any Letter of Credit, including by electronic transmission such
as SWIFT , electronic mail, facsimile or computer generated communication presented under a Letter of Credit (collectively ,
“Drawing Documents ”). The Borrower ’s aggregate remedies against any Issuing Lender for wrongfully honoring a presentation
under any Letter of Credit
or wrongfully retaining honored Drawin g Documents shall in no event exceed the aggregate amount paid by the Borrower to the
Issuing Lender in respect of the honored presentation in connection with such Letter of Credit under Section 3.5, plus interest at
the rate then applicable to ABR Loans hereunder .
3.7    Letter of Credit Payments . If any documents shall be presented for payment under any Letter of Credit, the relevant Issuing
Lender shall, within the period stipulated by the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit, examine the drawing documents.
After such examination and provided that the drawing documents are compliant, such Issuing Lender will promptly notify the
Borrower and the Designated Agent of the date and amount thereof. The responsibility of the relevant Issuing Lender to the
Borrower in connection with any docu ments presented for payment under any Letter of Credit, in addition to any payment
obligation expressly provided for in such Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender , shall be limited, in the absence of gross
negligence or willful misconduct, in each case as determined in a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction, to determining that the documents (including each draft) delivered under such Letter of Credit in connection with
such presentment appear on their face to be in conformity with such Letter of Credit.
3.8    Applications . To the extent that any provision of any Application related to any Letter of Credit is inconsistent with the
provisions of this Section 3, the provisions of this Section 3 shall apply .
3.9    Actions of Issuing Lenders . Each Issuing Lender shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any

statement, order or other document believed by it in good faith to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made
by the proper Perso n or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel, independent accountants and other experts
selected by such Issuing Lender . Each Issuing Lender shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this
Agreement unless it shall first have received such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it reasonably deems
appropriate (provided that no Issuing Lender shall be under any obligation to obtain such advice or concurrence and no L/C
Participant's obligations hereunder shall  be affected by the seeking or the failure to seek any such advice or concurrence) or it
shall first be indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be
incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. Notwit hstanding any other provision of this Section, as
between the Issuing Lenders and the Lenders, each Issuing Lender shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining
from acting, under this Agreement in accordance with a request of the Required  Lenders, and such request and any action taken
or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon the Lenders and any future holders of a participation in any Letter of
Credit (provided that no Issuing Lender shall be under any obligation to obtain such request and no L/C Participant's obligations
hereunder shall be af fected by the seeking or the failure to seek any such request).

Lender (and each of its branches and Affiliates) and the Designated Agent, and their respective directors, of ficers, agents

of or on account of an Issuing Lender issuing any Letter of Credit which specifies that the term “Beneficiary” included therein
includes any successor by operation of law of the named Beneficiary , but which Letter of Credit does not require that any
drawing by any such successor Beneficiary be accompanied by a copy of a legal document, satisfactory to such Issuing Lender ,
evidencing the appointment of such successor Beneficiary; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to indemnify any
Lender , any Issuing Lender or the Desig nated Agent for any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses to the extent,
but only to the extent, caused by (x) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such Issuing Lender in determining whether a
request presented under any Letter of Credit complied with the terms of such Letter of Credit as determined in a final non-
appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or (y) such Issuing Lender ’s failure to pay under any Letter of Credit
after the presentatio n to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit. Nothing in this

liability (except such as result from such indemnitees’  gross negligence or willfu l misconduct or such Issuing Lender ’s failure to
pay under any Lette r of Credit after the presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of the
Letter of Credit in each case as determ ined in a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction) that such

Code, except, in each case, to the exten t that any such Reportable Event or failure to comply with the applicable provisions of
ERISA  or the Code could not reasonabl y be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. During the five year period prior to
the date on which this representation is made or deemed made, there has been no (i)(i) failure to make a required contribution to
any Plan that would result in the imposi tion of a Lien or other encumbrance or the provision of security under Section 430 of the

from any Multiemployer Plan during the five year period prior to the date on which this representation is made or deemed made
that has resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in a material liability  under ERISA, and neither the Borrower nor any
Commonly Controlled Entity would become subject to any liability under ERISA  if the Borrower or any such Commonly
Controlled Entity were to withdraw completely from all Multiemployer Plans as of the valuation date most closely preceding the

Board and (b)(b) Sections 817-830, and Sections 701 and 851 of the California Public Utilities Code) that limits its ability to
incur Indebtedness under this Agreement.

actions on its behalf  and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Design ated Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with
such actions and powers as are reasonab ly incidental thereto. The provisions of this Section 9 are solely for the benefit of the Agents, the
Lenders and the Issuing Lenders, and the Borrower shall not have rights as a third-party beneficiary of any of such provisions (other
than with respect to the Borrower ’s rights under Sections 9.9(a) and (b)). It is understood and agreed that the use of the term “agent”
herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to any Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary
or other implied (or express) obligations arising under
agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only
an administrative relationship between contracting parties.
9.2    Dele gation of Duties . The Designated Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or
under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by it. The Designated Agent, and any such sub-

exculpatory provisio ns of this Section shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Designated Agent, and any
such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein
as well as activities as Designated Agent. The Designated Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-
agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that the Designated
Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents.
9.3    Exculpatory Provisions .
(a)    No Agent shall have any duties or obligations except those expressly  set forth herein and in the other Loan

is continuing;
2.shall have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except
discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that an
Agent is required to exercise as directe d in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or
percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents);
provided  that no Agent shall be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel,
may expose such Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including
for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automa tic stay under any Debtor
Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender
in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and
3.shall, except as expressly set forth herein  and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and
shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its
Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as an Agent or any of its Affiliates in
any capacity .
(b)    No Agent shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i)(i) with the consent or at the request of the
Required Lenders (or such other numb er or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary , or as such Agent shall
believe in good faith shall be necessary , under the circumstances as provided in Sections 10.1 and 8), or (ii)(ii) in the
absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and
nonappealable judgment.
(c)    No Agent shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i)(i) any statement, warranty or
representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii)(ii) the contents of any

the perfor mance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other  terms or conditions set forth herein or
therein or the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, (iv)(iv) the validity , enforceability , effectiveness or
genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreeme nt, instrument or document, or (v)(v) the
satisfaction of any condition set forth in Section 5 or elsewh ere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly
required to be delivered to such Agent.

relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic
message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or
otherwise authentica ted by the proper Person. The Designated Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by
telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In
determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance, extension, renewal or increase of
a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or an Issuing Lender , the Designated Agent
may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or such Issuing  Lender unless the Designated Agent shall have
received notice to the contrary from such Lender or such Issuing Lender prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance,
extension, renewal or increase of such Letter of Credit. The Designated Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be
counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken
or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
9.5    Notice of Default . The Designated Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default
or Event of Default unless the Designated Agent has received notice from a Lender , an Issuing Lender or the Borrower referring
to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a “notice of default”. In the event
that the Designated Agent receives such a notice, the Designated Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders and the Issuing
Lenders. The Designated Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably
directed by the Requ ired Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders); provided that unless and until such Agent
shall have received such directions, such Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such
action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders and the
Issuing Lenders.
9.6    Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Lenders . Each Lender and Issuing Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and
without reliance upon the Agents, or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender
and Issuin g Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agents, or any other Lender or
any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate,
continue to make its own decisions in taking or not
taking action under  or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document
furnished hereunder or thereunder . Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the
Lenders by the Designated Agent hereunder , the Designated Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any
Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operatio ns, property , condition (financial or otherwise),
prospects or creditworthiness of the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that may come into the possession of such Agent or any of
its of ficers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys in fact or Affiliates.

not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), ratably according to their
respective Percentages in effect on the date on which indemnification is soug ht under this Section (or, if indemnification is
sought after the date upon which the Commitments shall have terminated and the Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in
accordance with such Percentages immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments,  suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time
(whether before or after the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent in any way relating
to or arising out of, the Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by or
referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent
under or in connecti on with any of the foregoing; provided that no Lender or Issuing Lender shall be liable for the payment of
any portio n of such liabilities, obligation s, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
that are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent’ s
gross negligence or willful misconduct.
9.8    Agent in Its Individual Capacity . Each Person servin g as an Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its
capacity as a Lender or an Issuing Lender as any other Lender or Issuing Lender and may exercise the same as though it were
not an Agent, and the terms “Lender”, “Issuing Lender”, “Lenders” or “Issuing Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly
indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include such Person serving as an Agent hereunder in its individual capacity .

removed Agent shall be dischar ged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents
(except that in the case of the Senior Bond held by the Designated Agent on behalf of the Lenders or any Issuing Lender ,
the retiring or remo ved Designated Agent shall continue to hold such Senior Bond in its name until such time as a
successor Designated Agent is appointed) and (ii)(ii) except for any indemnity payments or other amounts then owed to
the retiring or removed Designated Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to

extent that the Designated Agent has sold a Loan (or portion thereof) acqu ired pursuant to an Erroneous Payment
Deficiency Assignment, and irrespective  of whether the Designated Agent may be equitably subrogated, the Designated

received, including without limitation waiver of any defense based on “dischar ge for value” or any similar doctrine.

replacement of the Designated Agent, any transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender or Issuing
Lender , the termination of the Commitments and/or the repayment, satisfaction or dischar ge of all Obligations (or any
portion thereof) under any Loan Document.

or transfer  by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 10.6
shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and
obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.
(iv)    The Designat ed Agent, acting for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower (and such agency

assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Designated Agent shall accept such Assignment and
Assumption and record the information  contained therein in the Register . No assignment shall be effective for
purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.
(c)    (i) Any Lend er may, without the consent of the Borrower , the Design ated Agent or any Issuing Lender , sell

Borrower ’s Affiliate s or Subsidiaries) (a “Participant ”) in all or a portion of such Lender ’s rights and obligations under
this Agree ment (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans owing to it); provided  that (A)(A) such
Lender ’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B)(B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible
to the other parties hereto for the perfo rmance of such obligations and (C)(C) the Borrower , the Designated Agent, the
Issuing Lender and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such
Lender ’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement pursuant to which a Lender sells such a
participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any
amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided  that such agreement may provide that
such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver that (1)
requires the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby pursuant to the proviso to the second sentence of Section
10.1 and (2) directly affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each
Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and

to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation  to such Participant is made with
the Borrower ’s prior written consent to such greater payments. Any Participant that is a Foreign Lender shall not
be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 unless such Participant complies with Section 2.16(e).
(vii)    (iii) Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of
the Borrower , maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal
amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’ s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan
Documents (the “Participant Register ”); provided  that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any
portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a
Participant’ s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan
Document) to any Person except
to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitm ent, loan, letter of credit or other
obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries
in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error , and such Lender shall treat each Person
whose name is recorded in the Particip ant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this
Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary . For the avoidance of doubt, the Designated Agent (in its
capacity as Designated Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register .
(d)    Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this
Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender , including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal
Reserve Bank or other central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender , and this Section shall not apply to any such
pledge or assignment of a security intere st; provided  that no such pledge  or assignment of a security interest shall release
a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee  or Assignee for such Lender as a party

Conduit Lender any bankruptcy , reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceeding under any state
bankruptcy or similar law , for one year and one day after the payment in full of the latest maturing commercial paper note

indemnify , save and hold harmless each other party hereto for any loss, cost, damage, expense, obligations, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits or any kind whatsoever arising out of its inability to institute such a proceeding against such
Conduit Lender during such period of forbearance.
(g)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, none of the Agents, in their capacity as Lenders, will
assign without the consent of the Borrower , prior to the Effective Date, any of the Commitments held by them on the

aggregate amount of $10,000,000 and shall be an integral multiple of $100,000; provided , however  that notwithstanding the

(ii) any accrued Interest and Fees in respect of such prepaid Capital shall be paid on the immediately following Settlement Date.
(e)    The Borrower may, at any time upon at least ten (10) Business Days’  prior written notice to the Administrative Agent and

Commitments prior to such reduction or, if the Administrative Agent reasonably determines that any portion of the outstanding
Borrower Obligation s is allocable solely to that portion of the Commitments being reduced or has arisen solely as a result of
such reduction, all of such portion) including, without duplication, any associated Breakage Fees. Upon receipt of any such
amounts, the Administrative Agent shall apply such amounts first to the reduc tion of the Aggregate Capital, and second to the
payment of the remaining outstanding Borrower Obligations with respect to such reduction, including any Breakage Fees, by
paying such amounts to the Lenders.
(g)    Provided that no Event of Default, Unmatured Event of Default, Termination Event or Unmatured Termination Event has
occurred and is continuing, the Borrow er may from time to time advise the Administrative Agent and each Group Agent in
writing of its desire  to extend the Scheduled Termination Date for an addition al 364 day period, provided that such request is

however , that if the Administrative Agent or any Committed Lender fails to so notify the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent, the Administrative Agent or such Committed Lender , as the case may be, shall be deemed to have declined such
extension. In the event that the Administrative Agent and one or more Committe d Lenders have so notified the Borrower and the
Administrative Agen t in writing that they are agreeable to such extension, the Borrower , the Servicer , the Administrative Agent,
the applicable Group Agents and the applicable Committed Lenders shall enter into such documents as the Administrative Agent,

and all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Administra tive Agent, the applicable Group Agents and the
applicable Committed Lenders in connection therewith (including Attorney Costs) shall be paid by the Borrower . In the event
any Committed Lender declines such request to extend the Scheduled Termination Date or is deemed to have declined such
extension, such Committed Lender ’s Group shall be an “ Exiting Group ” for all purposes of this Agreement.
(h)    Provided that no Event of Default, Unmatured Event of Default, Termination Event or Unmatured Termination Event has
occurred and is continuing, the Borrower
    S-12

Corporation regarding the Restricted Stock Units, subject to the terms of the LTIP. Any prior
agreements, commitments, or negotiatio ns are superseded. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency
between the provisio ns of this Agreement or the above cover sheet and the LTIP, the LTIP will govern.
Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Agreement or the above cover sheet are defined in the LTIP.
In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement or the above cover sheet and the
PG&E Corporation 2012 Officer Severa nce Policy , this Agreement or the above cover sheet will govern,
as applicable. For purposes of this Agreement, employment with PG&E Corporation means employment
with any member of the Participating Company Group.
Grant of Restricted Stock
UnitsPG&E Corporation grants you the number of Restricted Stock Units shown on the cover sheet of this
Agreement. The Restricted Stock Units are subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
LTIP.
Vesting of Restricted Stock
UnitsAs long as you remain employed with PG&E Corporation, the total number of Restricted Stock Units
originally subject to this Agreement, as shown on the cover sheet, will vest in accordance with the below
vesting schedule (the “Normal Vesting Schedule”).
        <vesting_schedule>
The amounts payable upon each vesting date are hereby designated separate payments for purposes of
Section 409A  of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Code”). Except as described below ,
all Restricted Stock Units subject to this Agreement which have not vested upon termination of your
employment will then be cancelled. As set forth below , the Restricted Stock Units may vest earlier upon
the occurrence of certain events.
Dividends Restricted Stock Units will accrue Dividend Equivalents in the event that cash dividends are paid with
respect to PG&E Corporation common stock having a record date prior to the date on which the RSUs are
settled. Such Dividend Equivalents will be converted into cash and paid, if at all, upon settlement of the
underlying Restricted Stock Units.
Settlement Vested Restricted Stock Units will be settled in an equal number of shares of PG&E Corporation
common stock, subject to the satisfactio n of Withholding Taxes, as described below . PG&E Corporation
will issue shares as soon as practicable after the Restricted Stock Units vest in accordance with the
Normal Vesting Schedule (but not later than sixty (60) days after the applicable vesting date) except as
set forth elsewhere in this Agreement.
Voluntary Termination In the event of your voluntary termination [(other than Retirement)], all unvested Restricted Stock Units
will be cancelled on the date of termination.
Retir ement <Include this provision if applicable> In the event of your Retirement, any unvested Restricted Stock
Units that would have vested within the 12 months following such Retirement had your employment
continued will continue to vest and be settled pursuant to the Normal Vesting Schedule (without regard
to the requirement that you be employed ), subject to the earlier settlement provisions of this Agreement;
provided, however , that in the event of your Retirement within 2 years following a Change in Control,
those Restricted Stock Units that would have vested within 12 months following such Retirement will be
vested and settled as soon as practica ble after (but not later than 60 days after) the date of such
Retirement. All other unvested Restricted Stock Units will be cancelled. Your voluntary termination of
employment will be considered Retirement if you are age 55 or older on the date of termination (other
than termination for cause) and if you were employed by PG&E Corporation for at least five consecutive
years ending on the date of termination of your employment.
Termination for  Cause If your employment  with PG&E Corpor ation is terminated at any time by PG&E Corporation for cause,
all unvested Restricted Stock Units will be cancelled on the date of termination . In general, termination
for “cause ” means termination of emplo yment because of dishonesty , a crimina l offense, or violation of
a work rule, and will be determined by and in the sole discretion of PG& E Corporation. For the
avoidance of doubt, you will not be eligible to retire if your employment is being or is terminated for
cause.
Termination other  than for
CauseIf your employment with PG&E Corporation is terminated by PG&E Corporation other than for cause,
any unves ted Restricted Stock Units that would have vested within the 12 months following such
termination had your employment continued will continue to vest and be settled pursuant to the Normal
Vesting Schedule (without regard to the requirement that you be employed ), subject to the earlier
settlement provision s of this Agreemen t. All other unvested Restricted Stock Units will be cancelled
unless your termination of employment was in connection with a Change in Control as provided below .
Death/Disability In the event of your death or Disability (as defined in Code Section 409A) while you are employed, all
of your Restricted Stock Units will vest and be settled as soon as practicable after (but not later than
sixty (60) days after) the date of such event. If your death or Disability occurs following the termination
of your employment and your Restricted Stock Units are then outstanding under the terms hereof, then
all of your vested Restricted Stock Units plus any Restricted Stock Units that would have otherwise
vested during any continued vesting period hereunder will be settled as soon as practicable after (but not
later than sixty (60) days after) the date of your death or Disability .
Termination Due to
Disposition of SubsidiaryIf your employment is involuntarily terminated other than for cause (1) by reason of a divestiture or
change in control of a subsidiary of PG&E Corporation for which you provide services, which
divestiture or change in control results in such subsidiary no longer qualifying as a subsidiary
corporation under Code Section 424(f), or (2) coincident with the sale of all or substantially all of the
assets of a subsidiar y of PG&E Corporation for which you provide services, then your Restricted Stock
Units will vest and be settled in the same manner as for a “Termination other than for Cause” described
above.
    A-2    
Change in Contr ol In the event of a Change in Control, the surviving, continuing, successor , or purchasing corporation or
other business entity or parent thereof, as the case may be (the “Acquiror ”), may, without your consent,
either assume or continue PG&E Corporation’ s rights and obligations under this Agreement or provide a
substantially equivalent award in substitution for the Restricted Stock Units subject to this Agreement.
If the Restricted Stock Units are neither  so assumed nor so continued by the Acquiror , and the Acquiror
does not provide a substantially equiva lent award in substitution for the Restricted Stock Units, all of
your unve sted Restr icted Stock Units will vest immediately preceding and contingent on, the Change in
Control and be settled as soon as practicable following the date of the Change in Control.
Termination In Connection
with a Change in Contr olIf you separate from service (other than termination for cause, or your volunta ry termination[, or your
Retirement])within three months before the Change in Control occurs, all of your outstanding Restricted
Stock Units (including Restricted Stock  Units that you would have otherwise forfeited after the end of
the continued vesting period) will vest on the date of the Change in Control and will be settled as soon as
practicable followin g the date of such separation from service, taking into account any acceleration on
account of termination or a change in control.
In the event of such a separation within two years following the Change in Control, your Restricted
Stock Units (to the extent they did not previously vest upon, for example, failure of the Acquiror to
assume or continue this award) will vest on the date of such separation and will be settled as soon as
practicable after (but not later than sixty (60) days after) the date of such separation.
Delay PG&E Corporation will delay the issuance of any shares of common stock to the extent it is necessary to
comply with Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) (relating to payments made to certain “key employees” of
certain publicly-traded companies); in such event, any shares of common stock to which you would
otherwise be entitled during the six (6) month period following the date of your “separation from service”
under Section 409A  (or shorter period ending on the date of your death following such separation) will
instead be issued on the first business day following the expiration of the applicable delay period.
    A-3    
Withholding Taxes The numb er of shares of PG&E Corporation common stock that you are otherwise entitled to receive
upon settlement of Restricted Stock Units will be reduced by a number of shares having an aggregate
Fair Market Value, as determined by PG&E Corporation, equal to the amount of any Federal, state, or
local taxes  of any kind required by law to be withheld by PG&E Corporation in connection with the
Restricted Stock Units determined using a rate not exceeding the maximum applicable withholding rates,
including social security and Medicare taxes due under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act and the
California State Disability Insurance tax (“Withholding Taxes”). If the withheld shares were not
sufficient to satisfy your Withholding  Taxes, you will be required to pay, as soon as practicable,
including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the Withho lding Taxes that is not
satisfied by the withholding of shares described above .
Leaves of Absence For purposes of this Agreement, if you are on an approved leave of absence from  PG&E Corporation, or
a recipient of PG&E Corporation spon sored disability benefits, you will conti nue to be considered as
employed. If you do not return to active  employment upon the expiration of your leave of absence or the
expiration of your PG&E Corporation sponsored disability benefits, you will be considered to have
voluntarily terminated your employment. See above under “V oluntary Termination.”
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the leave of absence exceeds six (6) months, and a return to service
upon expiration of such leave is not guaranteed by statute or contract, then you will be deemed to have
had a “separation from service” for purposes of any Restricted Stock Units that are settled hereunder
upon such separation. To the extent an authorized leave of absence is due to a medically determinable
physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or to last for a continuous period of
at least six (6) months and such impa irment causes you to be unable to perform the duties of your
position of employment or any substanti ally similar position of employment, the six (6) month period in
the prior sentence will be twenty-nine (29) months.
PG&E Corporation reserves the right to determine which leaves of absence will be considered as
continuing employment and when your employment terminates for all purposes under this Agreement.
Voting and Other  Rights You will not have voting rights with respect to the Restricted Stock Units until the date the underlying
shares are issued (as evidenced by appropriate entry on the books of PG&E Corporation or its duly
authorized transfer agent). No Restricted Stock Units and no shares of Stock that have not been issued
hereunder may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, or otherwise encumbered , other than by will or the
laws of decent and distribution, and the Restricted Stock Units may be exercised during the life of the
Recipient only by the Recipient or the Recipient’ s guardian or legal representative.
No Retention Rights This Agreement is not an employment agreement and does not give you the right to be retained by PG&E
Corporation. Except  as otherwise provi ded in an applicable employment agreement, PG&E Corporation
reserves the right to terminate your employment at any time and for any reason.

described below , all Restricted Stock Units subject to this Agreement which have not vested upon
termination of your employment will then be cancelled. As set forth below , the Restricted Stock
Units may vest earlier upon the occurrence of certain events.

applicable vesting date) except as set forth elsewhere in this Agreement.
Voluntary Termination In the event of your voluntary termination (other than Retirement), all unvested Restricted Stock
Units will be cancelled on the date of termination.
Retir ement In the event of your Retirement, any unvested Restricted Stock Units that would have vested
within the 12 months following such Retirement had your employment continued will continue to
vest and be settled pursuant to the Norm al Vesting Schedule (without regard to the requirement
that you be employed), subject to the earlier settlement provisions of this Agreement; provided,
however , that in the event of your Retirement within 2 years following a Change in Control, those

employed, all of your Restricted Stock Units will vest and be settled as soon as practicable after
(but not later than sixty (60) days after)  the date of such event. If your death or Disability occurs

outstanding under the terms hereof, then all of your vested Restricted Stock Units plus any
Restricted Stock Units that would have otherwise vested during any continued vesting period
hereunder will be settled as soon as practicable after (but not later than sixty (60) days after) the
date of your death or Disability .
Termination Due to Disposition of
SubsidiaryIf your employment is involuntarily terminated other than for cause (1) by reaso n of a divestiture
or change in control  of a subsidiary of PG&E Corporation for which you provid e services, which
divestiture or change in control results  in such subsidiary no longer qualifying as a subsidiary
corporation under Code Section 424(f), or (2) coincident with the sale of all or substantially all of
the assets of a subsidiary of PG&E Corporation for which you provide services, then your
Restricted Stock Units will vest and be settled in the same manner as for a “Termination other
than for Cause” described above.

Change in Contr ol In the event of a Change in Contro l, the surviving, continuing, successor , or purchasing
corporation or other business entity or parent thereof, as the case may be (the “Acquiror ”), may,
without your consent, either assume or continue PG&E Corporation’ s rights and obligations

PERFORMANCE SHARE UNIT  AGREEMENT
The L TIP and Other  Agreements This Agre ement and the above cover sheet constitute the entire understanding between
you and PG&E Corporation regarding the performance share units, subject to the terms
of the LTIP. Any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations are superseded. In the
event of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement or the
above cover sheet and the LTIP, the LTIP will govern. Capitalized terms that are not
defined in this Agreement or the above cover sheet are defined in the LTIP. In the event
of any conflict betw een the provisions of this Agreement or the above cover sheet and
the PG&E Corporation 2012 Officer Severance Policy , this Agreement or the above
cover sheet will govern, as applicable. The LTIP provides the Committee with sole
discretion to adjust the performance award formula, including adjustments to
performance measures or targets that may make attainment of target pay easier or more
difficult to attain. For purposes of this Agreement, employment with PG&E Corporation
means employment with any member of the Participating Company Group.
Grant of Performance Shar es PG&E Corporation grants you the number of performance share units shown on the
cover sheet of this Agreement (the “Performance Shares”). The Performance Shares are
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the L TIP.
Vesting of Performance Shar es .As long as you remain employed with PG&E Corporation, the Performance Shares will
vest upon [the third anniversary of the Date of Grant specified on the cover
sheet/<vesting date> ], in all cases subject to any requirements that awards be held for at
least three years following the Date of Grant. Except as described below, all
Performance Shares  that have not vested will be cancelled upon termination of your
employment.
Settlement in Shar es/Performance
GoalsVested Performance  Shares will be settled in shares of PG&E Corporation common
stock, subject to the satisfaction of Withholding Taxes, as described below . The number
of shares you are entitled to receive will be calculated by multiplying the number of
vested Performance Shares by the “payout percentage” determined as follows during the
three-year performance period from <date> through <date> (“Performance Period”)
(except as set forth elsewhere in this Agreement), rounded to the nearest whole number .
The Perfo rmance Shares have <description of performance goals (measures, targets,
including percent allocation between measure categories)> (as described in Exhibit A).
Subject to rounding considerations, for each measure, if performance is below threshold,
the payout  percentage will be 0%; if performance is at threshold, the payout percentage
will be 50%; if performance is at target, the payout percentage will be 100%; and if
performance is at or better than maxim um, the payout percentage will be 200%. The
actual payout percentage for performa nce between threshold and maximum will be
determined based on linear interpolation between the payout percentages for threshold
and tar get, or tar get and maximum, as appropriate.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the final payout will be determined in the discretion of
the Comm ittee, including any decision to reduce or forego payment entirely . As part of
exercising such discretion, the Committee will take into consideration, without
limitation, public, employee, and contractor safety performance.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the final payout percentage, if any, will be determ ined as
soon as practicable  following the date that the Committee determines the extent to
which the performance goal has been attained. PG&E Corporation will issue shares as
soon as practicable after such determination, but no earlier than the Vesting Date, and
not later than sixty (60) days after the Vesting Date.
Dividends Each time that PG&E Corporation declares a dividend on its shares of common stock,
an amount equal to the dividend multiplied by the number of Performance Shares
granted to you by this Agreement will be accrued on your behalf. If you receive a
Performance Share settlement in accordance with the preceding section, at that same
time you also will receive a cash payme nt equal to the amount of any dividends accrued
with respe ct to your Performance Shares multiplied by the same payout percent age used
to determine the number of shares you are entitled to receive, if any .
Voluntary Termination If you terminate your employment with PG&E Corporation voluntarily before the
Vesting Date (other than for Retirement), all of the Performance Shares will be
cancelled as of the date of such termina tion and any dividends accrued with respect to
your Performance Shares will be forfeited.
Termination for  Cause If your employment with PG&E Corporation is terminated at any time by PG&E
Corporation for cause before the Vesting Date, all of the Performance Shares  will be
cancelled as of the date of such termina tion and any dividends accrued with respect to
your Performance Shares will be forfei ted. In general, termination for “cause” means
termination of employment because of dishonesty , a criminal offense, or violation of a
work rule, and will be determined by and in the sole discretion of PG&E Corporation.
For the avoidance of doubt, you will not be eligible to retire if your employment is
being or is terminated for cause.
Termination other  than for  Cause If your employment  with PG&E Corporation is terminated by PG&E Corporation other
than for cause before the Vesting Date, a portion of your outstanding Performance
Shares will vest proportionally based on the number of months during the Performance
Period that you were employed (rounded  down) divided by the number of mont hs in the
Performance Period (36 months). All other outstanding Performance Shares will be
cancelled, and any associated accrued dividends will be forfeited, unless your
termination of employment was in connection with a Change in Control as provided
below . Your vested Performance Shares will be settled, if at all, as soon as practicable
after the Vesting Date, and in any event within sixty (60) days of the Vesting Date, based
on the same payout percentage applied to active employees. At that time you also will
receive a cash paym ent, if any, equal to the amount of dividends accrued over the
Performance Period  with respect to your vested Performance Shares multiplied by the
same payo ut percentage used to determ ine the number of shares you are entitled to
receive, if any .
Retir ement If you retire before the Vesting Date, a portion of your outstanding Performanc e Shares
will vest proportionally based on the number of months during the Performance Period
that you were employed (rounded down) divided by the number of months in the
Performance Period (36 months). All other outstanding Performance Shares will be
cancelled, and any associated accrued dividends will be forfeited. Your vested
Performance Shares will be settled, if at all, as soon as practicable after the Vesting
Date, and in any event within sixty (60) days of the Vesting Date, based on the same

payment, if any, equal to the amount of dividends accrued over the Performance Period
with respect to your vested Performance Shares multiplied by the same  payout
percentage used to determine the number of shares you are entitled to receive, if any.
Your voluntary termination of employment will be considered a Retirement if you are
age 55 or older on the date of termination and if you were employed by PG&E
Corporation for at least five consecutive years ending on the date of termination of your
employment.
Death/Disability If your employment terminates due to your death or Disability (as defined in Code
Section 409A) before the Vesting Date, all of your Performance Shares will immediately
vest in full as to the service requireme nt. Upon termination due to death prior to the
Vesting Date, vested Performance Shares will be settled as soon as practicable,
assuming target performance. Upon termination due to disability prior to the Vesting
Date, Performance Shares will be settled, if at all, as soon as practicable after the
Vesting Date, and in any event within sixty (60) days of the Vesting Date, based on the
same payout percentage applied to active employees. At the time of settlement you also
will receiv e a cash payment, if any, equal to the amount of dividends accrued over the
Performance Period with respect to your Performance Shares multiplied by the same
payout percentage used to determine the number of shares you are entitled to receive, if
any.
Termination Due to Disposition of
SubsidiaryIf your employment  is involuntarily terminated (other than for cause) (1) by reason of a
divestiture or change in control of a subsidiary of PG&E Corporation for which you
provide services, which divestiture or change in control results in such subsidiary no

Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or (2) coincident with the sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of a subsidiary of PG&E Corporation for which you

the same manner as for a “T ermination other than for Cause” described above.
Change in Contr ol In the event of a Change in Control, the surviving, continuing, successor , or purchasing
corporation or other business entity or parent thereof, as the case may be (the
“Acquiror ”), may, without your consent, either assume or continue PG&E Corporation’ s

continuously employ ed with the Acquir or or an affiliate thereof through such date, and
settlement will occur as soon as practi cable after the Vesting Date, and in any event
within sixty (60) days of the Vesting Date. At that time you also will receive a cash
payment, if any, equal to the amount of dividends accrued with respect to your
Performance Shares  over the Performan ce Period multiplied by the same overall payout
percentage used to determine the number of shares you are entitled to receive, if any.
Performance for all measures will be deemed to have been achieved at target, resulting
in a payout percentage of 100%.
If the Change in Control of PG&E Corporation occurs before the Vesting Date, and if
this award  is neither assumed nor continued by the Acquiror or if the Acquiror does not
provide a substantially equivalent award in substitution for the Performance  Shares
subject to this Agre ement, all of your outstanding Performance Shares will vest in full
(and not pro-rata) and become nonforfeitable on the date of the Change in Control. Such
vested Performance  Shares will be settled as soon as practicable following the date of
the Change in Control. At that time you also will receive a cash payment, if any, equal to
the amoun t of dividends accrued with respect to your Performance Shares to the date of
the Change in Control multiplied by the same overall payout percentage used to
determine the number of shares you are entitled to receive, if any. Performance for all
measures will be deemed to have been achieved at target and the payout percen tage will
be 100%.
Termination In Connection with a
Change in Contr olIf your employment is terminated by PG&E Corporation other than for cause within two
years follo wing the Change in Control, all of your outstanding Performance Shares (to
the extent  they did not previously vest upon failure of the Acquiror to assume or
continue this award) will vest in full (and not pro-rata) and become nonforfeitab le on the
date of termination of your employment.
If your employmen t is terminated by PG&E Corporation other than for cause within
three months before  a Change in Control occurs, all of your outstanding Performance
Shares will vest in full (and not pro-rata)  and becom e nonfor feitable (including the
portion that you would have otherwise forfeited based on the proration of vested
Performance Shares  through the date of termination of your employment) as of the date
of termination of your employment.
Such veste d Perform ance Shares will be settled as soon as practicable following your
termination, taking into account any acceleration on account of termination or a Change
in Control. At that time you also will receive a cash payment, if any, equal to the amount
of dividends accrued with respect to your vested Performance Shares multiplied by the
same overall payout percentage used to determine the number of shares you are entitled
to receive, if any. Performance for all measures will be deemed to have been achieved at
target and the payout percentage will be 100%.
Withholding Taxes The number of shares of PG&E Corporation common stock that you are otherwise
entitled to receive upon settlement of your Performance Shares will be reduc ed by a
number of shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value, as determined by PG&E

required by law to be withheld by PG&E Corporation in connection with the
Performance Shares determined using a rate not exceeding the maximum applicable
withholding rates, including social security and Medicare taxes due under the Federal
Insurance Contribu tions Act and the California State Disability Insurance tax

employment. See above under “V oluntary Termination.”

Withholding Taxes The number of shares of PG&E Corpor ation common stock that you are otherwise entitled to
receive upon settlement of Restricted Stock Units will be reduced by a number of shares having
an aggregate Fair Market Value, as determined by PG&E Corporation, equal to the amount of
any Federal, state, or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld by PG&E
Corporation in connection with the Restricted Stock Units determined using the applicable
minimum statutory withholding rates, including social security and Medicare taxes due under
the Federal Insurance Contributions Act and the California State Disability Insurance tax
(“Withholding Taxes”). If the withheld shares were not sufficient to satisfy your minimum
Withholding Taxes, you will be requir ed to pay, as soon as practicable, including through
additional payroll withholding, any amount of the W ithholding T axes that is not satisfied by the
withholding of shares described above.
Leaves of Absence For purposes of this Agreement, if you are on an approved leave of absence from PG&E
Corporation, or a recipient of PG&E  Corporation sponsored disability benefits, you will
continue to be considered as employed. If you do not return to active employment upon the
expiration of your leave of absence or the expiration of your PG&E Corpora tion sponsored
disability benefits, you will be considered to have voluntarily terminated your employment.
See above under “V oluntary Termination.”
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the leave of absence exceeds six (6) months,  and a return to
service upon expiration of such leave is not guaranteed by statute or contract, then you will be
deemed to have had a “separation from service” for purposes of any Restricted Stock Units that
are settled hereunder upon such separati on. To the extent an authorized leave of absence is due
to a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in
death or to last for a continuous period  of at least six (6) months and such impairment causes
you to be unable to perform the duties  of your position of employment or any substantially
similar position of employment, the six (6) month period in the prior sentence will be twenty-
nine (29) months.
PG&E Corporation reserves the right to determine which leaves of absence will be considered
as continuing employment and when your employment terminates for all purposes under this
Agreement.
 
5
Voting and Other  Rights You will not have voting rights with respect to the Restricted Stock Units until the date the
underlying shares are issued (as evidenced by appropriate entry on the books of PG&E
Corporation or its duly authorized transfer agent). No Restricted Stock Units and no shares of
Stock that have not been issued hereunder may be sold, assigned, transferr ed, pledged, or
otherwise encumbered, other than by will or the laws of decent and distribution, and the
Restricted Stock Units may be exercised during the life of the Recipient only by the Recipient
or the Recipient’ s guardian or legal representative.
No Retention Rights This Agreement is not an employment agreement and does not give you the right to be retained
by PG&E Corporati on. Except as otherwise provided in an applicable employment agreement,
PG&E Corporation reserves the right to terminate your employment at any time and for any
reason.

policy adopted by the Corporation from time to time, including the PG&E Corporation and
Pacific Gas and Electric Company Executive Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy , as
last revised on Febru ary 19, 2019 and available on the PG&E@W ork internet site for the Long-
Term Incentive Plan (the policy and location may be changed from time to time by PG&E
Corporation); provided, however , that this award shall only be subject to recoupment to the
extent the events giving rise to such recoupment occurred on or after the commencement of
your employment with PG&E Corporation.

Structur eIn the event of a change in the capital structure of the Corporation, this award and the shares of
Stock subject to this award shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 4.2 of the L TIP.
