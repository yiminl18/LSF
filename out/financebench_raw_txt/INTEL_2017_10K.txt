FUNDAMENTALS OF OUR BUSINESS   Our Strategy 8
Table of Contents
 
 
STRATEGIC ENABLERS
We meet our customer needs with discrete platforms and platforms that are integrated with software and other technologies to provide end-to-end solutions. Our solutions are
enabled by:
•Shared architecture and intellectual property . We have developed a common architecture and intellectual property across our platforms. W e continue to invest in improving
our architecture and product platforms that deliver increasing value to our customers. Our proprietary technologies make it possible to integrate products and platforms that
address evolving customer needs and expand the markets we serve. Sharing a common architecture and intellectual property enables us to spread our costs over a large
manufacturing base of products, which reduces our costs and increases our return on capital.
•Silicon manufacturing technologies.  We make significant investments and innovations in our silicon manufacturing technologies. Unlike many semiconductor companies, we
primarily develop and manufacture our products in our own facilities using our proprietary process technologies. This competitive advantage enables us to optimize
performance, shorten time-to-market for new product introduction, and more quickly scale products in high volume.
•Moore's Law . Intel’ s advancement of Moore’ s Law has driven significant computing power growth and better economics. Through Moore's Law we enable new devices and
capabilities that meet our customers' needs for balancing performance, power ef ficiency , and cost.
CORPORATE TRANSFORMATION
We are in the midst of a corporate transformation. Over the last four years, we’ve grown outside our traditional PC and server businesses, where we had roughly 90% market
share. By making key investments and decisions to enter data-rich markets, we have redefined our target market well beyond our traditional businesses and estimated a total
addressable market (T AM) of $260 billion1, where we have greater opportunity to grow . The expanded T AM leverages our manufacturing technologies and intellectual properties
and provides growth opportunities in our revenue and profit. W e have evolved from a PC company with a server business to a data-centric company , and have begun the next
phase of our journey—to build a world that runs on Intel.

Research AND development (R&D) and Manufacturing
We are committed to investing in R&D. Realizing the benefits from Moore’ s Law provides flexibility in balancing production costs and the increased functionality of our products.
In addition, intellectual property that we have developed for our platforms reduces our costs, creates synergies across our businesses, and provides a higher return as we
expand into new markets .
We design and manufacture silicon technology products. Unlike many other semiconductor companies, we primarily manufacture our products in our own manufacturing
facilities. W e see our in-house manufacturing as one of our most critical assets and advantages. This advantage is now expanding to our adjacent businesses, for example,
FPGA, modem, and memory , which are enabling our transformation to a data-centric company .
Moore's Law — a law of economics
Moore’ s Law is not a law of physics, but instead a law of economics predicted by Intel's co-founder Gordon Moore 50 years ago. It is the keystone of our manufacturing
advancement. W e measure Moore's Law primarily using a quantitative transistor density metric (transistors per square millimeter). In addition, we are optimizing process
technology within each node to enable an annual cadence of product improvements.
Realizing Moore’ s Law results in economic benefits as we are able to either reduce a chip's cost as we shrink its size, or increase functionality and performance of a chip while
maintaining the same cost. At Intel, we continue to develop new generations of manufacturing process technology and realize the benefits from Moore’ s Law . This makes
possible the innovation of new products with higher functionality while balancing power ef ficiency , cost, and size to meet customers' needs. As of the end of 2017, our platform
products were manufactured on 300mm wafers, with the majority manufactured using our 14nm process node.
Research and Development
We focus our R&D activities on developing new microarchitectures, advancing our manufacturing process technology , delivering the next generation of products, ensuring our
products and technologies are secure, and developing new solutions in emerging technologies, for example, artificial intelligence, 5G wireless connectivity , and autonomous
vehicles.
In conjunction with our R&D ef forts, we plan to introduce new microarchitectures for our various products on a regular cadence. W e have lengthened the amount of time we are
using our 14nm process node, further optimizing our technology and meeting the yearly market cadence for product introductions with multiple waves of product of ferings. While
we have lengthened our utilization of 14nm, we are accelerating transistor density improvement with hyper-scaling technology , resulting in the same density and cost
improvements over time as predicted by Moore's Law . We expect the same trends to continue as we introduce our next-generation 10nm process node.
 
FUNDAMENTALS OF OUR BUSINESS   Research and Development (R&D) and Manufacturing 10
Table of Contents
 
 
We centrally manage key cross-business group product initiatives to align and prioritize our R&D activities. In addition, we may augment our R&D initiatives by investing in
companies or entering into agreements with companies that have similar R&D focus areas, as well as directly purchasing or licensing applicable technology . To drive innovation
and gain ef ficiencies, we intend to utilize our investments in intellectual property and R&D across our platforms and businesses.
manufacturing footprint
In 2017, the majority of our wafer manufacturing was conducted within the U.S. W e incur factory start-up costs as we ramp our facilities for new process technologies. In 2017 we
continued to ramp the 10nm process node in our Oregon and Israel locations, began 10nm production in Oregon, and  restarted construction on one of our Arizona wafer fabs,
which is targeted for leading-edge process technologies. W e ramped our first memory fab, Fab 68, with investments representing approximately 20% of total capital spending in
2017.
The map below marks our manufacturing facilities and their primary manufacturing functions as of the end of 2017, as well as the countries where we have a significant R&D or
sales and marketing presence.
supply chain and factory network
Our manufacturing facilities are primarily used for silicon wafer manufacturing of our platform and memory products. These facilities are built following a “copy exactly”
methodology , whereby new process technologies are transferred identically from a central development fab to each manufacturing facility . This enables fast ramp of the operation
as well as better quality control. These wafer fabs operate in a network of manufacturing facilities integrated as one factory to provide the most flexible supply capacity , allowing
us to better analyze our production costs and manage capacity .
We use third-party foundries to manufacture wafers for certain components, including communications, connectivity , networking, FPGA, and memory products. W e also leverage
subcontractors to augment capacity to perform assembly and test in addition to our in-house manufacturing, primarily for chipsets and adjacent products.
We use a multi-source strategy for our memory business to enable a robust and flexible supply chain. The ramping of Fab 68 in 2017 enabled us to maintain a cost-ef fective
strategy to better serve our customers. W e expect this expansion to continue to provide significant manufacturing capacity . As of the end of 2017, over half of the 3D NAND we
supplied was manufactured in Fab 68. In addition to the memory we manufacture internally , we have a supplemental supply agreement with Micron T echnology , Inc. (Micron), as
well as capacity from our joint venture, IM Flash T echnologies, LLC (IMFT) factory in Lehi, Utah.

2017 vs. 2016
We have achieved record revenue two years in a row , with 2017  revenue of $62.8 billion , up $3.4 billion , or 6%, from 2016 . After adjusting for the Q2 2017 divestiture of ISecG,
revenue grew 9% from 2016 . The increase in revenue was primarily driven by strong performance across our data-centric businesses, which collectively grew 16% year over
year after adjusting for ISecG. W e saw revenue growth across our DCG, IOTG, NSG, and PSG businesses, and 2017  revenue includes $210 million  from our Mobileye business.
The increase in revenue was partially of fset by $1.6 billion  from the divestiture of ISecG and by a change to the Intel Inside® program in 2017 .
We implemented a change to the Intel Inside program to make the program more ef ficient and ef fective, and to provide more flexibility to our customers. This change af fects the
way we classify our cooperative advertising costs and resulted in a reduction to 2017  revenue of approximately $500 million compared to 2016 , which would have been classified
as marketing expenses prior to program changes.
2016 vs. 2015
In 2016, we achieved revenue of $59.4 billion , up $4.0 billion , or 7%, from 2015 . Our 2016  results reflected the inclusion of PSG and an extra workweek when compared to 2015 .
In addition, our revenue growth in 2016  was driven by higher unit sales from our DCG platform and higher average selling prices (ASPs) for our notebook and desktop platforms.

2016 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM
We commenced the 2016 Restructuring Program in the second quarter of 2016. This program was completed in 2017.
Restructuring actions related to this program, which were approved in 2016, impacted approximately  16,000  employees.  The charges incurred as part of the 2016 Restructuring
Program resulted in net annual headcount savings of approximately $1.8 billion  as we re-balanced our workforce. On an annual basis, $1.6 billion  of these savings reduced our
R&D and MG&A spending, and the remainder reduced our cost of sales. W e began to realize these savings in Q2 2016 and most  of these savings were realized by the end of
2017. W e reallocated these savings to our growth segments, such as the data center and Internet of Things, and continue to invest in areas that extend our leadership in Moore's
Law and expand market opportunities in areas such as memory and autonomous driving.
OTHER CHARGES
Other charges consist primarily of expenses associated with the divestiture of ISecG that was completed in Q2 2017.

We recognized higher net realized gains on sales of a portion of our interest in ASML Holding N.V . (ASML) of $3.4 billion  in 2017  compared to $407 million  in 2016 . The higher
net realized gains were partially of fset by $833 million  of impairment charges and our share of equity method investee losses in 2017.
We recognized higher net gains on equity investments in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to gains of $407 million  related to sales of a portion of our interest in ASML.
INTEREST AND OTHER, NET
We recognized a lower net loss in interest and other in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to higher interest income in 2017.
We recognized a higher net loss in interest and other in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to higher interest expense from debt issued or acquired in 2015 and 2016, as well
as lower capitalized interest due to lower eligible capital expenditures in 2016.

Effective tax rate  52.8% 20.3% 19.6%
Substantially all  of the increase  in our ef fective tax rate in 2017  compared to 2016  was driven by the one-time provisional impacts from the U.S. T ax Cuts and Jobs Act (T ax
Reform) that was enacted in December 2017, the 2017 ISecG divestiture, and a higher proportion of our income in higher tax rate jurisdictions. In addition to the one-time
impacts from T ax Reform, we expect the new legislation will significantly lower our ef fective tax rate starting in 2018. For further information on T ax Reform and its impacts, see
"Note 8: Income T axes " within the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The majority of the increase  in our ef fective tax rate in 2016  compared to 2015  was driven by one-time items and our 2015 decision to indefinitely reinvest some of our prior
years' non-U.S. earnings, partially of fset by a higher proportion of our income in lower tax jurisdictions.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We consider the following when assessing our liquidity and capital resources:
(Dollars in Millions)  Dec 30, 
 2017  Dec 31, 
 2016
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets  $ 14,002   $ 17,099

Temporary equity  $ 866  $ 882 
Debt as a percentage of permanent stockholders’ equity  38.8% 38.2%
Cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity . We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer , industry , and country .
When assessing our sources of liquidity , we include investments as shown in the preceding table. Substantially all  of our investments in debt instruments and financing
receivables are in investment-grade securities.
Other potential sources of liquidity include our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may of fer an
unspecified amount of debt, equity , and other securities. Under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to
$10.0 billion . This amount includes an increase of $5.0 billion  in the authorization limit approved by our Board of Directors in April 2017. No commercial paper remained
outstanding as of December 30, 2017 . During 2017, we issued a total of $7.7 billion  aggregate principal amount of senior notes. Additionally , we redeemed our $1.0
billion , 4.90%  senior notes due August 2045 . We used the net proceeds from the of ferings of the notes to finance a portion of the redemption price of our 4.90%  senior notes
due August 2045  and for general corporate purposes. During 2017, we repaid $500 million  of our 1.75%  senior notes that matured in May 2017 , and $3.0 billion  of our 1.35%
senior notes that matured in December 2017 . In Q4 2017, we paid $2.8 billion  in cash to convert our $1.6 billion  2.95%  junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2035.
The enactment of T ax Reform in December 2017, imposes a tax on all previously untaxed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries of U.S. corporations. Future distributions of non-U.S.
assets to the U.S. will no longer be subject to U.S. taxation. As a result, we recognized a one-time provisional transition tax expense of $6.1 billion . We expect to pay the tax over
a period of eight years based on a defined payment schedule and believe that our current U.S. sources of cash and liquidity are suf ficient to meet our tax liability .
As of December 30, 2017 , $8.4 billion  of our $14.0 billion  of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets was held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
During Q3 2017, we acquired  97.3%  of Mobileye's outstanding ordinary shares for $14.5 billion  net cash. W e funded the acquisition of shares, and expect to fund the acquisition
of the remaining shares, with cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries.

During Q2 2017, we completed the divestiture of our ISecG business for total consideration of $4.2 billion . The consideration included cash proceeds of $924 million  and $2.2
billion  in the form of promissory notes. During Q3 2017, McAfee and TPG VII Manta Holdings, L.P ., now known as Manta Holdings, L.P . (TPG) repaid the $2.2 billion  of
promissory notes and McAfee paid us a $735 million  dividend.
We believe we have suf ficient financial resources to meet our business requirements in the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and
assembly and test; working capital requirements; and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, and strategic investments.
SOURCES AND USES OF CASH
(In Millions)
 
MD&A - RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   Consolidated Results and Analysis 36
Table of Contents
 
 
In summary , our cash flows for each period were as follows:
Years Ended 
 (In Millions)  Dec 30, 
 2017  Dec 31, 
 2016  Dec 26, 
 2015
Net cash provided by operating activities  $ 22,110  $ 21,808   $ 19,018  
Net cash used for investing activities  (15,762 ) (25,817 ) (8,183 )
Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities  (8,475 ) (5,739 ) 1,912  
Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents  $ (2,127 ) $ (9,748 ) $ 12,747  
OPERA TING ACTIVITIES
Cash provided by  operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.
For 2017  compared to 2016 , the $302 million  increase  in cash provided by operating activities was due to changes to working capital partially of fset by adjustments for non-cash
items and lower net income. T ax Reform did not have an impact on our 2017 cash provided by operating activities. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was
driven by increased income before taxes and $1.0 billion  receipts of customer deposits. These increases were partially of fset by increased inventory and accounts receivable.
Income taxes paid, net of refunds, in 2017  compared to 2016  were $2.9 billion  higher  due to higher income before taxes, taxable gains on sales of ASML, and taxes on the
ISecG divestiture. W e expect approximately $2.0 billion of additional customer deposits in 2018.
For 2016  compared to 2015 , the $2.8 billion  increase  in cash provided by operating activities was due to adjustments for non-cash items and changes in working capital, partially
offset by lower net income. The adjustments for non-cash items were higher in 2016 primarily due to restructuring and other charges and the change in deferred taxes, partially
offset by lower depreciation.
INVESTING ACTIVITIES
Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; and proceeds from divestitures and cash used for
acquisitions. Our capital expenditures were $11.8 billion  in 2017  ($9.6 billion  in 2016  and $7.3 billion  in 2015 ).
The decrease  in cash used for investing activities in 2017  compared to 2016  was primarily due to higher net activity of available-for sale-investments in 2017, proceeds from our
divestiture of ISecG in 2017, and higher maturities and sales of trading assets in 2017. This activity was partially of fset by higher capital expenditures in 2017.
The increase  in cash used for investing activities in 2016  compared to 2015  was primarily due to our completed acquisition of Altera, net purchases of trading assets
in 2016 compared to net sales of trading assets in 2015, and higher capital expenditures in 2016. This increase was partially of fset by lower investments in non-marketable equity
investments.
FINANCING ACTIVITIES
Financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, and
proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans.
The increase  in cash used for financing activities in 2017  compared to 2016  was primarily due to net long-term debt activity , which was a use of cash in 2017 compared to a
source of cash in 2016. During 2017 , we repurchased $3.6 billion  of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program, compared to $2.6 billion  in 2016 .
As of December 30, 2017 , $13.2 billion  remained available for repurchasing common stock under the existing repurchase authorization limit. W e base our level of common stock
repurchases on internal cash management decisions, and this level may fluctuate. Proceeds from the sale of common stock through employee equity incentive plans totaled
$770 million  in 2017  compared to $1.1 billion  in 2016 . Our total dividend payments were $5.1 billion  in 2017  compared to $4.9 billion  in 2016 . We have paid a cash dividend in
each of the past 101 quarters. In January 2018 , our Board of Directors approved an increase to our cash dividend to $1.20  per share on an annual basis. The board has declared
a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30  per share of common stock for Q1 2018 . The dividend is payable on March 1, 2018  to stockholders of record on February 7, 2018 .
Cash was used for financing activities in 2016  compared to cash provided by financing activities in 2015 , primarily due to fewer debt issuances and the repayment of debt in
2016. This activity was partially of fset by repayment of commercial paper in 2015 and fewer common stock repurchases in 2016.

Total 6  $ 65,947   $ 14,265   $ 10,432   $ 10,067   $ 31,183  
1 Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment. They were not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets
as of December 30, 2017, as we had not yet received the related goods nor taken title to the property.
2 Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or services, as well as payments due under non-
contingent funding obligations.
3 Tax obligations represent the future cash payments related to Tax Reform enacted in 2017 for the one-time provisional transition tax on our previously untaxed foreign earnings. For further
information, see "Note 8: Income Taxes" within the Consolidated Financial Statements.
4 Amounts represent principal and interest cash payments over the life of the debt obligations, including anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets.
Debt obligations are classified based on their stated maturity date, regardless of their classification on the consolidated balance sheets. Any future settlement of convertible debt would impact our cash
payments.
5 Amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other long-term liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, including the short-term portion of these long-term liabilities.
Derivative instruments are excluded from the preceding table, as they do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid.
6 Total excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as current liabilities, except for the short-term portions of long-term debt obligations and other long-
term liabilities.
The expected timing of payments of the obligations in the preceding table is estimated based on current information. T iming of payments and actual amounts paid may be
different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.
Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services included in "Other purchase obligations and commitments" in the preceding table include agreements that are
enforceable and legally binding on Intel and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions;
and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion
of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee.
For the purchase of raw materials, we have entered into certain agreements that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or
based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements. Due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements, as well as the non-binding
nature of these agreements, obligations under these agreements have been excluded from the preceding table. Our purchase orders for other products are based on our current
manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than
binding agreements.
Contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones have been excluded from the preceding table. Most  of our milestone-based contracts are
tooling related for the purchase of capital equipment. These arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the counterparty . As of
December 30, 2017 , assuming that all future milestones are met, the additional required payments would be approximately $2.0 billion .
For the majority of restricted stock units (RSUs) granted, the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the RSUs vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding
requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is excluded from the
preceding table, as the amount is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our
common stock when the awards vest.

During 2014, we entered into a series of agreements with T singhua Unigroup Ltd. (T singhua Unigroup), an operating subsidiary of T singhua Holdings Co. Ltd., to, among other
things, jointly develop Intel architecture and communications-based solutions for phones. Subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, we have agreed to invest
up to $9.0 billion  Chinese yuan (approximately $1.5 billion  as of the date of the agreement) for a minority stake of approximately 20% of Beijing UniSpreadtrum T echnology Ltd.
(UniSpreadtrum). During 2015, we invested $966 million  to complete the first phase of the equity investment and the second phase of the investment will require additional
funding of approximately $500 million ; however , as our obligation is contingent upon regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, it has been excluded from the preceding
table.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT
MARKET RISK
We are af fected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates, as well as equity and commodity prices. Our risk management programs reduce, but may not entirely
eliminate, the impacts of these risks. All of the following potential changes are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of December 30, 2017  and
December 31, 2016 . Actual results may dif fer materially .
CURRENCY EXCHANGE RA TES
We are exposed to currency exchange risks of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable, and may economically hedge this risk with
foreign currency contracts, such as currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps. Gains or losses on these non-U.S.-currency investments are generally of fset by
corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments. W e are exposed to currency exchange risks from our non-U.S.-dollar-denominated debt indebtedness and
may use foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges to manage this risk.
Substantially all  of our revenue is transacted in U.S. dollars. However , a significant  portion of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in other currencies,
primarily the euro, the Japanese yen, the Israeli shekel, and the Chinese yuan . We have established currency risk management programs to protect against currency exchange
rate risks associated with non-U.S. dollar forecasted future cash flows and existing non-U.S. dollar monetary assets and liabilities. W e may also hedge currency risk arising from
funding of foreign currency-denominated future investments. W e may utilize foreign currency contracts, such as currency forwards or option contracts in these hedging programs.
We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 20% in currency
exchange rates could be experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and of fsetting recorded monetary asset
and liability positions, would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than $95 million  as of December 30, 2017  (less than $80 million  as of
December 31, 2016 ).
INTEREST RA TES
We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The primary objective of our investment policy is to preserve principal and
the financial flexibility to fund our business while maximizing yields, which generally track the U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR. W e generally enter into interest rate contracts to
convert the returns on our fixed-rate debt investment with remaining maturities longer than six months into U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR-based returns. W e may enter into
swaps to convert fixed-rate coupon payments into floating-rate coupon payments for our existing indebtedness. Gains or losses on these instruments are generally of fset by
corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments.
A hypothetical decrease in benchmark interest rates of up to 1.0% , after taking into account investment hedges, would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our
investment portfolio of approximately $100 million  as of December 30, 2017  (an increase of approximately $100 million  as of December 31, 2016 ). After taking into account
interest rate and currency swaps, a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of up to 1.0%  would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our indebtedness of approximately
$1.6 billion  as of December 30, 2017  (an increase of approximately $1.3 billion  as of December 31, 2016 ). The fluctuations in fair value of our investment portfolio and
indebtedness reflect only the direct impact of the change in interest rates. Other economic variables, such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk, could
result in a significantly higher fluctuation in the fair value of our net investment position.
EQUITY PRICES
Our investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments. W e typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through
hedging activities at the inception of our investments. In the event we do decide to enter into hedge arrangements, before doing so we evaluate legal, market, and economic
factors, as well as the expected timing of disposal, to determine whether hedging is appropriate. Our equity market risk management program may include equity derivatives with
or without hedge accounting designation that utilize warrants, equity options, or other equity derivatives.
We also utilize total return swaps to of fset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. Gains or losses from changes
in fair value of these total return swaps are generally of fset by the losses or gains on the related liabilities.
 
MD&A - RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   Consolidated Results and Analysis 39
Table of Contents
 
 
As of December 30, 2017 , the fair value of our marketable equity investments and our equity derivative instruments, including hedging positions, was $4.2 billion  ($6.2 billion  as
of December 31, 2016 ). A substantial majority  of our marketable equity investments portfolio as of December 30, 2017  was concentrated in our investment in ASML of $3.6
billion  ($6.1 billion  as of December 31, 2016 ). Our marketable equity method investments are excluded from our analysis, as the carrying value does not fluctuate based on
market price changes unless an impairment is deemed necessary . To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity investments, we
have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investment portfolio. Assuming a decline of 25% in market prices, and after reflecting the impact of
hedges and of fsetting positions, the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately $1.1 billion , based on the value as of December 30,
2017  (a decrease in value of approximately $1.9 billion , based on the value as of December 31, 2016  using an assumed decline of 30%). Beginning in 2018, as explained in
"Note 3: Recent Accounting Standards " within the Consolidated Financial Statements, changes in the fair value of our marketable equity securities will be measured and
recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through the income statement.
Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices af fect our non-marketable equity investments, although we cannot always quantify the
impacts directly . Financial markets are volatile, which could negatively af fect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood
of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public of ferings, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great
deal of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently , we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non-
marketable cost method equity investments had a carrying amount of $2.6 billion  as of December 30, 2017  ($3.1 billion  as of December 31, 2016 ) and included our investment in
UniSpreadtrum of $658 million  ($966 million  for UniSpreadtrum as of December 31, 2016 ). The carrying amount of our non-marketable equity method investments was $1.9
billion  as of December 30, 2017  ($1.3 billion  as of December 31, 2016 ). A substantial majority  of our non-marketable equity method investments balance as of December 30,
2017  was concentrated in our IMFT investment of $1.5 billion  ($849 million  for IMFT as of December 31, 2016 ).
COMMODITY PRICE RISK
Although we operate facilities that consume commodities, we are not directly af fected by commodity price risk to a material degree. W e have established forecasted transaction
risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in commodity prices. W e may use commodity derivatives contracts, such as commodity swaps, in these hedging
programs. In addition, we have sourcing plans in place that mitigate the risk of a potential supplier concentration for our key commodities.

Sales and Marketing
CUST OMERS
We sell our products primarily to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and original design manufacturers (ODMs). ODMs provide design and manufacturing services to
branded and unbranded private-label resellers. In addition, our customers include other manufacturers and service providers, such as industrial and communication equipment
manufacturers and cloud service providers, who buy our products through distributor , reseller , retail, and OEM channels throughout the world. For more information about our
customers, including customers who accounted for greater than 10% of our net consolidated revenue, see " Note 4: Operating Segments " within the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
Our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers—systems builders that purchase Intel ® processors and other products from our distributors. W e
have incentive programs that allow distributors to sell our microprocessors and other products in small quantities to customers of systems builders. Our microprocessors and
other products are also available in direct retail outlets.
SALES ARRANGEMENTS
Our products are sold through sales of fices throughout the world. Sales of our products are frequently made via purchase order acknowledgments that contain standard terms
and conditions covering matters such as pricing, payment terms, and warranties, as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products, such as patent and copyright
indemnities. From time to time, we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering, for example, changes from our standard terms and conditions, new product
development and marketing, and private-label branding. Our sales are routinely made using electronic and web-based processes that allow the customer to review inventory
availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered. Pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors. W e also of fer discounts,
rebates, and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology .
Our products are generally shipped under terms that transfer title to the customer , even in arrangements for which the recognition of revenue and related cost of sales is
deferred. Our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date, 30 days after shipment or delivery . We assess credit risk through
quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits, and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection
devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance.  Credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy , fraud, or other failure of the
customer to pay .
Our sales to distributors are typically made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold
merchandise. Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the dif ference between the original price paid and the current price that we of fer. Our products
typically have no contractual limit on the amount of price protection, nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted. The right of return granted
generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor .
DISTRIBUTION
Distributors typically handle a wide variety of products, including those that compete with our products, and fill orders for many customers. Customers may place orders directly
with us or through distributors. W e have several distribution warehouses that are located in proximity to key customers.
BACKLOG
Our customers generally operate with lean-inventory or just-in-time operations rather than maintaining larger inventories of our products. As our customers continue to lower their
inventories, our processes to fulfill their orders have evolved to meet their needs. As a result, our manufacturing production is based on estimates and advance non-binding
commitments from customers as to future purchases. Our order backlog as of any particular date is a mix of these commitments and specific firm orders that are primarily made
pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products. Only a small portion of our orders are non-cancelable, and the dollar amount associated with the non-cancelable
portion is not significant.
SEASONAL TRENDS
Historically , our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year , accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth
quarter .

MARKETING
Our global marketing objectives are to build a strong, well-known, dif ferentiated, and meaningful Intel corporate brand that drives preference with businesses and consumers,
and to of fer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases. The
Intel Core processor family and the Intel ® Quark™, Intel Atom®, Intel ® Celeron ®, Intel ® Pentium ®, Intel ® Xeon ®, Intel ® Xeon Phi™, and Intel ® Itanium ® trademarks make up our
processor brands.
We promote brand awareness and preference, and generate demand through our own direct marketing, as well as through co-marketing programs. Our direct marketing
activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as consumer and trade events, industry and consumer communications, and press
relations. W e market to consumer and business audiences, and focus on building awareness and generating demand for new form factors such as all-in-one devices and 2 in 1
systems powered by Intel technologies. Our key messaging focuses on increased performance, improved energy ef ficiency , and other capabilities such as connectivity and
communications.
Purchases by customers often allow them to participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs such as the Intel Inside program. This program broadens the reach of
our brands beyond the scope of our own direct marketing. Through the Intel Inside program, certain customers are licensed to place Intel ® logos on computing devices
containing our microprocessors and processor technologies, and to use our brands in their marketing activities. The program includes a market development component that
accrues funds based on purchases and partially reimburses customers for marketing activities for products featuring Intel ® brands, subject to customers meeting defined criteria.
These marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as press relations. W e have also entered into joint marketing
arrangements with certain customers.
Competition
The computing industry continuously evolves with new and enhanced technologies and products from existing and new providers. The marketplace can change quickly in
response to the introduction of such technologies and products and other factors such as changes in customer and end-user requirements, expectations, and preferences. As
technologies evolve and new market segments emerge, the boundaries between the market segments that we compete in are also subject to change.
Intel faces significant competition in the development and market acceptance of our products in this environment. Our platforms, based on Intel architecture, are positioned to
compete across the compute continuum, from low-power devices to the most powerful data center servers. These platforms have integrated hardware and software and of fer our
customers benefits such as ease of use, savings in total cost of ownership, and the ability to scale systems to accommodate increased usage.
COMPETIT ORS
We compete against other companies that make and sell platforms, other silicon components, and software to businesses that build and sell computing and communications
systems to end users. Our competitors also include companies that sell goods and services to businesses that use them for their internal and/or customer-facing processes (e.g.,
businesses running large data centers). In addition, we face competition from OEMs, ODMs, and other industrial and communications equipment manufacturers that, to some
degree, choose to vertically integrate their own proprietary semiconductor and software assets. By doing so, these competitors may be attempting to of fer greater dif ferentiation
in their products and to increase their share of the profits for each finished product they sell. Continuing changes in industry participants through, for example, acquisitions or
business collaborations could also have a significant impact on our competitive position.
In the PC market segment, we are a leading provider of platforms for notebooks, 2 in 1 systems, and desktops (including all-in-ones and high-end enthusiast PCs). W e face
existing and emerging competition in these product areas. T ablets, phones, and other mobile devices of fered by numerous vendors are significant competitors to traditional PCs
for many usages, and considerable blurring of system form factors currently exists in the marketplace. W e face strong competition from vendors who use applications processors
that are based on the ARM* architecture, feature low-power or long battery-life operation, and are built in SoC formats that integrate numerous functions on one chip.
In the data center market segment, we are a leading provider of data center platforms, and face competition from companies using ARM architecture or other technologies.
Internet cloud computing, storage, and networking are areas of significant targeted growth for us in the data center segment, including as a result of increasing amounts of data
created by artificial intelligence, autonomous driving, and other applications. We face strong competition in these market segments.
In the Internet of Things market segment, we have a long-standing position as a supplier of components and software for embedded products. This marketplace continues to
expand significantly with increasing types and numbers of smart and connected devices for retail, automotive, industrial, and consumer uses, including smart video. As this
market segment evolves, we face numerous large and small incumbent processor competitors, as well as new entrants that use ARM architecture and other operating systems
and software. In addition, the Internet of Things requires a broad range of connectivity solutions and we face competition from companies providing traditional wireless solutions
such as cellular , WiFi, and Bluetooth*, as well as several new entrants who are taking advantage of new focused communications protocols.

In the memory market segment, we compete against other providers of NAND flash memory products. W e focus our ef forts primarily on incorporating NAND flash memory into
solution products, such as SSDs supporting enterprise and consumer applications. W e believe that our memory of ferings, including innovative developments such as Intel
Optane technology , complement our product of ferings in our other segments.
In the programmable solutions market segment, we are a leading provider of programmable semiconductors and related products, including FPGAs and SoC FPGAs. W e face
competition from other programmable logic companies, as well as companies that make other types of semiconductor products, such as application-specific integrated circuits,
application-specific standard products, graphics processing units, digital signal processors, and CPUs. T argeted growth areas for our programmable solutions include
communications, data center , and automotive applications. The FPGA life cycle is long relative to other Intel products—from the time that a design win is secured, it generally
takes three or more years before a customer starts volume production and we receive the associated revenue from such design win.
 
Our products primarily compete based on performance, energy ef ficiency , integration, innovative design, features, price, quality , reliability , brand recognition, technical support,
and availability . The importance of these factors varies by the type of end system for the products. For example, performance might be among the most important factors for our
products for data center servers, while energy ef ficiency and price, as well as density and non-volatility , might be among the most important factors for our memory products.
COMPETITIVE ADV ANTAGES
Our key competitive advantages include:
•Well-positioned for growth in smart, connected world.  We offer solutions across every segment of the smart, connected world—from the cloud, to the network, to devices—
and believe that we are well-positioned for growth through our strategy of the V irtuous Cycle of Growth. The expansion and proliferation of the cloud and data center , Internet
of Things, memory , and FPGAs—all of which are connected—help grow our business. As more devices connect to the cloud, we have increased opportunities for growth.
We are uniquely positioned to meet customer needs with platform solutions that leverage our breadth of products. Our range of silicon products and associated software
gives us an end-to-end capability supported by our manufacturing expertise and intellectual property .
•Transitions to next-generation technologies.  We have a market lead in transitioning to the next-generation process technology and bringing products to market using such
technology . In Q4 2017, we began to ship products utilizing our 10nm process technology and we are continuing to work on the development of our next-generation 7nm
process technology . We believe that these advancements will of fer significant improvements in one or more of the following areas: performance, new features, energy
efficiency , and cost.
•Combination of our network of manufacturing and assembly and test facilities with our global architecture design teams.  We have made significant capital and R&D
investments into our integrated manufacturing network, which enables us to have more direct control over our design, development, and manufacturing processes; quality
control; product cost; production timing; performance; power consumption; and manufacturing yield. The increased cost of constructing new fabrication facilities to support
smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers has led to a reduced number of companies that can build and equip leading-edge manufacturing facilities. Most of our
competitors rely on third-party foundries and subcontractors for manufacturing and assembly and test needs. W e provide foundry services as an alternative to such
foundries.
Intellectual Property Rights and Licensing
Intel owns and develops significant intellectual property (IP) and related IP rights around the world that relate to our products, services, R&D, and other activities and assets. Our
IP portfolio includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, trade dress rights, and maskwork rights. W e actively seek to protect our global IP rights and to deter
unauthorized use of our IP and other assets. Such ef forts can be dif ficult, however , particularly in countries that provide less protection to IP rights and in the absence of
harmonized international IP standards. While our IP rights are important to our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any single patent, copyright, or
other IP right.
We have obtained patents in the U.S. and other countries. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, and the comparative pace of governments’ patenting
processes, our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire; in some cases, our products may be obsolete before the patents related to them are
granted. As we expand our products into new industries, we also seek to extend our patent development ef forts to patent such products. In addition to developing patents based
on our own R&D ef forts, we may purchase or license patents from third parties. Established competitors in existing and new industries, as well as companies that purchase and
enforce patents and other IP , may already have patents covering similar products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our own products, or that
we will be able to obtain licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all.
The software that we distribute, including software embedded in our component-level and platform products, is entitled to copyright and other IP protection. T o distinguish our
products from our competitors’ products, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products, and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to
promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine Intel components. W e also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets,
keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.

Critical Accounting Estimates
The methods, assumptions, and estimates that we use in applying our accounting policies may require us to apply judgments regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. W e
consider an accounting policy to be a critical estimate if: (1) we must make assumptions that were uncertain when the judgment was made, and (2) changes in the estimate
assumptions, or selection of a dif ferent estimate methodology could have a significant impact on our financial position and the results that we report in our consolidated financial
statements. While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information available when the estimate was made.
Refer to " Note 2: Accounting Policies " within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our critical accounting estimates and policies, which are as follows:
•Inventories  - the transition of manufacturing costs to inventory excluding factory excess capacity costs. Inventoried product reflected at the lower of cost or net realizable
value considering future demand and market conditions;
•Property , plant and equipment  - the useful life determination and the related timing of when depreciation begins;
•Long-lived assets  - the valuation methods and assumptions used in assessing the impairment of property , plant and equipment, identified intangibles, and goodwill, including
the determination of asset groupings and the identification and allocation of goodwill to reporting units;
•Non-marketable equity investments  - the valuation estimates and assessment of other-than-temporary impairment;
•Business combinations  - the assumptions used to allocate the purchase price paid for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions;
•Income taxes  - the identification and measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the provisional estimates associated with T ax Reform; and
•Loss contingencies  - the estimation of when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.
RISK FACTORS
The following risks could materially and adversely af fect our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could
decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be af fected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to
be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and
historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Refer also to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including
"MD&A - Results of Operations" and our financial statements and the related notes.
CHANGES IN PRODUCT DEMAND CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.
Demand for our products is variable and hard to predict.  Our platform products are used across dif ferent market segments, and demand for our platforms may vary within or
among our client computing, data center , Internet of Things, and other market segments. It is dif ficult to anticipate the impact of these changes, as demand may increase in one
or more market segments while decreasing in others. Changes in the demand for our products, particularly in the client computing or data center market segments, may reduce
our revenue, lower our gross margin, or require us to write down the value of our assets.
Important factors that could lead to variation in the demand for our products include changes in:
•business conditions, including downturns in the market segments in which we operate, or in the global or regional economies;
•consumer confidence or income levels caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in government borrowing, taxation, or spending policies; the credit
market; or expected inflation, employment, and energy or other commodity prices;
•the level of our customers’ inventories;
•competitive and pricing pressures, including actions taken by competitors;
•customer order patterns, including order cancellations;
•failure to timely introduce competitive products; and
•market acceptance and industry support of our new and maturing products.
Due to the complexity of our manufacturing operations, we may be unable to timely respond to fluctuations in demand and we may incur significant charges and costs . Because
we own and operate high-tech fabrication facilities, our operations have high costs that are fixed or dif ficult to reduce in the short term, including our costs related to utilization of
existing facilities, facility construction and equipment, R&D, and the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce. If product demand decreases or we fail to forecast
demand accurately , we could be required to write of f inventory or record excess capacity charges, which would lower our gross margin. If the demand decrease is prolonged, our
manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. W e may
also be required to shorten the useful lives of under-used facilities and equipment and accelerate depreciation. Conversely , if product demand increases, we may be unable to
add capacity fast enough to meet market demand.
We face significant competition.  The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market developments, changes in industry
standards, changes in customer needs, and frequent product introductions and improvements. If we do not anticipate and respond to these developments, our competitive
position may weaken, and our products or technologies might be uncompetitive or become obsolete. Additionally , a number of business combinations—including mergers, asset
acquisitions, and strategic partnerships—in the semiconductor industry have occurred over the last several years, and more could occur in the future. Consolidation in the
industry could lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which could negatively af fect our financial results.
In recent years, in connection with our strategic transformation to a data-centric company , we have entered new areas and introduced adjacent products in programmable
solutions, AI, and autonomous driving; we have also expanded our adjacent product of ferings in client computing, the data center , the Internet of Things, and memory , with
offerings such as modems, silicon photonics solutions, and 3D XPoint technology products. As a result, we face new sources of competition, including, in certain of these market
segments, from incumbent competitors with established customer bases and greater brand recognition. These developing products and market segments may not grow as
significantly as projected, or at all, or may utilize technologies that are dif ferent from the ones that we develop and manufacture. T o be successful, we need to cultivate new
industry relationships with customers and partners in these market segments. In addition, we must continually improve the cost, performance, integration, and energy ef ficiency
of our products, as well as expand our software capabilities to provide customers with comprehensive computing solutions. Despite our ongoing ef forts, there is no guarantee
that we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments.

To compete successfully , we must maintain a successful R&D ef fort, develop new products and production processes, and improve our existing products and processes ahead of
competitors. For example, we invest substantially in our network of manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, including the construction of new fabrication facilities to
support smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers. W e do not expect all of our R&D investments to be successful. W e may be unable to develop and market new products
successfully , and the products and technologies we invest in and develop may not be well-received by customers. Our R&D investments may not contribute to our future
operating results for several years, if at all, and such contributions may not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments. Additionally , the products and
technologies of fered by others may af fect demand for , or pricing of, our products.
If we are not able to compete ef fectively , our financial results will be adversely af fected, including reduced revenue and gross margin, and we may be required to accelerate the
write-down of the value of certain assets.
Changes in the mix of products sold may impact our financial results.  Our pricing and margins vary across our products and market segments due in part to marketability of our
products and dif ferences in their features or manufacturing costs. For example, our platform product of ferings range from lower-priced and entry-level platforms, such as those
based on Intel Atom processors, to higher-end platforms based on Intel Xeon processors. If demand shifts from our higher-priced to lower-priced products in any of our market
segments, our gross margin and revenue would decrease.
WE OPERATE GLOBALLY AND ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS IN MANY JURISDICTIONS.
Global or regional conditions may harm our financial results.  We have manufacturing, assembly and test, R&D, sales, and other operations in many countries, and some of our
business activities may be concentrated in one or more geographic areas. Moreover , sales outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 83% of our revenue for the fiscal year
ended December 30, 2017 . As a result, our operations and our financial results, including our ability to manufacture, assemble and test, design, develop, or sell products, may be
adversely af fected by a number of factors outside of our control, including:
•global and regional economic conditions;
•geopolitical and security issues, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, political instability (including geopolitical uncertainty on the Korean peninsula), human
rights concerns, and terrorist activity;
•natural disasters, public health issues, and other catastrophic events;
•inefficient infrastructure and other disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions and large-scale outages or unreliable provision of services from utilities, transportation, data
hosting, or telecommunications providers;
•government restrictions on, or nationalization of our operations in any country , or restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings from a particular country;
•differing employment practices and labor issues;
•formal or informal imposition of new or revised export and/or import and doing-business regulations, including trade sanctions and tarif fs, which could be changed without
notice;
•ineffective legal protection of our IP rights in certain countries;
•local business and cultural factors that dif fer from our current standards and practices; and
•continuing uncertainty regarding social, political, immigration, and tax and trade policies in the U.S. and abroad, including the United Kingdom's vote to withdraw from the
European Union.
We are subject to laws and regulations worldwide, which may dif fer among jurisdictions, af fecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to: IP ownership and
infringement; tax; import and export requirements; anti-corruption; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition;
advertising; employment; product regulations; environment, health, and safety requirements; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements may be onerous and
expensive, and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively . For example, unfavorable developments with evolving laws and regulations worldwide related to 5G
technology may limit its global introduction and adoption, which could impede our modem strategy and negatively impact our long-term outlook. Although we have policies,
controls, and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, and/or agents will not
violate such laws or our policies. V iolations of these laws and regulations could result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our of ficers, or our employees; prohibitions on the
conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation.
We may be af fected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  We are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange rates. Although
most of our sales occur in U.S. dollars, expenses may be paid in local currencies. An increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our
products in those markets outside the U.S. where we sell in dollars, and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of expenses such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing
expenses, as well as overseas capital expenditures. W e also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not
eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements; therefore, changes in exchange rates could harm our results of operations and financial condition.

Catastrophic events could have a material adverse ef fect on our operations and financial results.  Our operations and business could be disrupted by natural disasters; industrial
accidents; public health issues; cybersecurity incidents; interruptions of service from utilities, transportation, or telecommunications providers; or other catastrophic events. Such
events could make it dif ficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver products to our customers, receive production materials from our suppliers, or perform critical functions,
which could adversely af fect our revenue and require significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. While we maintain business recovery plans that are
intended to enable us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business, some of our systems are not fully redundant and we cannot be sure
that our plans will fully protect us from all such disruptions.
We maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property , casualty , and other risks. The types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability ,
cost, and decisions with respect to risk retention. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions. In addition, one or more of our insurance providers may be
unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.
WE ARE VULNERABLE TO PRODUCT AND MANUFACTURING-RELATED RISKS.
We are subject to risks associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing process technology . Production of integrated circuits is a complex process.
Our strategy is significantly dependent upon the timely advancement of Moore’ s Law and we are continually engaged in the development of next-generation process
technologies. W e may not be successful or ef ficient in developing or implementing new process nodes and production processes. Our ef forts to innovate involve significant
expense and carry inherent risks, including dif ficulties in designing and developing such next-generation process technologies, and investments in manufacturing assets and
facilities years in advance of the process node introduction.
Risks inherent in the development of next-generation process technologies include production timing delays, lower than anticipated manufacturing yields, and product defects
and errata. Disruptions in the production process can also result from errors, defects in materials, delays in obtaining or revising operating permits and licenses, interruption in
our supply of materials or resources, and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, or unsafe working conditions—all of
which could af fect the timing of production ramps and yields. Production issues can lead to increased costs and may af fect our ability to meet product demand, which could
adversely impact our business and the results of operations. In addition, if we face unexpected delays in the timing of our product introductions, our revenue and gross margin
could be adversely af fected because we incur significant costs up front in the product development stage and earn revenue to of fset these costs over time.
We face supply chain risks.  Thousands of suppliers provide materials and equipment that we use in production and other aspects of our business. Where possible, we seek to
have several sources of supply . However , for certain materials, we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single location. In addition,
consolidation among suppliers could impact the nature, quality , availability , and pricing of the products and services available to us. The inability of suppliers to deliver necessary
production materials or equipment could disrupt our production processes and make it more dif ficult for us to implement our business strategy . Production could be disrupted by
the unavailability of resources, such as water , silicon, electricity , gases, and other materials. The unavailability or reduced availability of materials or resources may require us to
reduce production or incur additional costs, which could harm our business and results of operations. Our manufacturing operations and ability to meet product demand may also
be impacted by IP or other litigation between our suppliers, where an injunction against Intel or a supplier could interrupt the availability of goods or services supplied to Intel by
others.
We also rely on third-party providers to manufacture and assemble and test certain components or products, particularly those related to networking, communications,
programmable semiconductor solutions, and NAND flash memory . If any of these third parties are unable to perform these services on a timely or cost-ef fective basis, we may
encounter supply delays or disruptions that could adversely af fect our business and financial results.
In addition, increased regulation or stakeholder expectations regarding responsible sourcing practices could cause our compliance costs to increase or result in publicity that
negatively af fects our reputation. Moreover , given that we use many materials in the manufacturing of our products and rely on many suppliers to provide these materials, but do
not directly control the procurement or employment practices of such suppliers, we could be subject to similar financial or reputational risks as a result of our suppliers' conduct.

We are subject to the risks of product defects, errata, or other product issues.  Product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications) may result from problems in
our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test processes. Components and products we purchase or license from third-party suppliers, or attain through
acquisitions, may also contain defects. W e could face risks if products that we design, manufacture, or sell, or that include our technology , cause personal injury or property
damage, even where the cause is unrelated to product defects or errata. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, market segments,
technologies, or applications, including wearables, drones and transportation, health care and financial transactions, and other industrial and consumer uses. Costs from defects,
errata, or other product issues could include:
•writing of f some or all of the value of inventory;
•recalling products that have been shipped;
•providing product replacements or modifications;
•reimbursing customers for certain costs they incur;
•defending against litigation and/or paying resulting damages; and
•paying fines imposed by regulatory agencies.
These costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin, and result in delay or loss of revenue. Any product defects, errata, or other issues could also
damage our reputation, negatively af fect product demand, delay product releases, or result in legal liability . The announcement of product defects or errata could cause
customers to purchase products from competitors. Any of these occurrences could harm our business and financial results. In addition, although we maintain liability insurance,
our coverage has certain exclusions and/or may not adequately cover liabilities incurred. Our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim, and losses not
covered by insurance could be large, which could harm our financial condition.
We are subject to risks associated with environmental, health, and safety regulations and climate change.  The manufacturing and assembly and test of our products require the
use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws or regulations could
result in:
•regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities;
•suspension of production;
•alteration of our manufacturing and assembly and test processes;
•damage to our reputation; and
•restrictions on our operations or sales.
Our failure to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials could lead to increased costs or future liabilities. Our
ability to expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future may be impeded by environmental regulations, such as air quality and wastewater requirements.
Environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire additional pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, or incur other expenses.
Many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may be subject to regulation under environmental laws and regulations. These restrictions could harm our
business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes.
Climate change may also pose regulatory and environmental risks that could harm our results of operations and af fect the way we conduct business. For example, climate
change regulation could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution control requirements, and increased or new monitoring, recordkeeping, and
reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. W e also see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations if, for example, utility companies pass on their
costs to their customers. Furthermore, many of our operations are located in semi-arid regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Israel that may become increasingly vulnerable
to rising average temperatures or prolonged droughts due to climate change. Our fabrication facilities require significant water use and, while we recycle and reuse a portion of
the water used, we may have dif ficulties obtaining suf ficient water to fulfill our operational needs. In addition, climate change may pose physical and regulatory risks to our
suppliers, including increased extreme weather events that could result in supply delays or disruptions.
WE ARE SUBJECT TO CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY RISKS.
Third parties regularly attempt to gain unauthorized access to our network, products, services, and infrastructure.  We regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized
access through the Internet or to introduce malicious software to our IT systems. Additionally , individuals or organizations, including malicious hackers or intruders into our
physical facilities, may attempt to gain unauthorized access and corrupt the processes of hardware and software products that we manufacture and services we provide. Due to
the widespread use of our products, we are a frequent target of computer hackers and organizations that intend to sabotage, take control of, or otherwise corrupt our
manufacturing or other processes, products, and services. W e are also a target of malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our
customers or end users; steal proprietary information related to our business, products, employees, and customers; or interrupt our systems and services or those of our
customers or others. W e believe such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication. As we become a more data-centric company , our processors may be
used in more and dif ferent critical application areas and may be subject to increased cybersecurity and privacy risks.
From time to time, we encounter intrusions or unauthorized access to our network, products, services, or infrastructure. T o date, none have resulted in any material adverse
impact to our business or operations. Such incidents, whether or not successful, could result in our incurring significant costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems,
writing down inventory value, implementing

additional threat protection measures, providing modifications to our products and services, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying
damages, providing customers with incentives to maintain the business relationship, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties. In addition, these threats are
constantly evolving, thereby increasing the dif ficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures. While we seek to detect and
investigate all unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network, products, and services, and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our internal
processes and tools and/or changes or updates to our products and services, we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats. In some instances, we,
our customers, and the users of our products and services may be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and ef fects.
Security vulnerabilities may exist with respect to our processors and other products as well as the operating systems and workloads running on them. Mitigation techniques
designed to address these security vulnerabilities, including software and firmware updates or other preventative measures, may not operate as intended or ef fectively resolve
these vulnerabilities. In addition, we may be required to rely on third parties, including hardware, software, and services vendors, as well as end users, to develop and deploy
mitigation techniques, and the ef fectiveness of mitigation techniques may depend solely or in part on the actions of these third parties. Security vulnerabilities and/or mitigation
techniques, including software and firmware updates, may result in adverse performance, reboots, system instability , data loss or corruption, unpredictable system behavior , or
the misappropriation of data by third parties, which could adversely impact our business and harm our reputation.
A side-channel exploit is a type of security vulnerability that has recently received attention as a result of the variants referred to as “Spectre” and “Meltdown.” Information on
these variants was prematurely reported publicly before mitigation techniques to address all vulnerabilities were made widely available, and certain of the mitigation techniques
did not operate as intended. To date, we do not expect a material financial impact to our business or operations from these security vulnerabilities. However , subsequent events
or new information could develop which changes our expectations, including additional information learned as we deploy updates, evaluate the competitiveness of existing and
new products, address future warranty or other claims or customer satisfaction considerations, as well as developments in the course of responding to any litigation or
investigations over these matters. The recent publicity regarding side-channel exploits may also result in increased attempts by third parties to identify additional variants. We will
continue to reassess whether or not we expect to be exposed to a loss that could be material.
As a result of the foregoing risks, we have and may continue to face product claims, litigation, and adverse publicity and customer relations from security vulnerabilities and/or
mitigation techniques. Publicity about security vulnerabilities and attempted or successful exploits, whether accurate or inaccurate, may result in increased attempts by third
parties to identify additional vulnerabilities. This publicity could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services. In addition,
future vulnerabilities and mitigation of those vulnerabilities may also adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition, customer relationships, and reputation.
Moreover , we may be unable to anticipate the timing of the release of information by third parties regarding potential vulnerabilities of our products, which, in turn, has and could
adversely impact our ability to timely introduce mitigation techniques and thereby harm our business and reputation.
We may be subject to theft, loss, or misuse of personal data about our employees, customers, or other third parties, which could increase our expenses, damage our reputation,
or result in legal or regulatory proceedings.  The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly
increased business and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and
creating a complex regulatory compliance environment. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant. In addition,
even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by
governmental entities or others.
WE ARE SUBJECT TO IP RISKS AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS.
We may be unable to enforce or protect our IP rights.  We regard our patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other IP rights as important to the success of our business. W e rely
on IP law—as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers, employees, technology development partners, and others—to protect our IP rights. Our ability
to enforce these rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our IP rights in various countries. When we seek to enforce our rights,
we may be subject to claims that our IP rights are invalid, not enforceable, or licensed to an opposing party . Our assertion of IP rights may result in another party seeking to
assert claims against us, which could harm our business. Governments may adopt regulations—and governments or courts may render decisions—requiring compulsory
licensing of IP rights, or governments may require products to meet standards that favor local companies. Our inability to enforce our IP rights under any of these circumstances
may harm our competitive position and business. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could
harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in R&D, product development, and marketing could be reduced.
Our licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives may allow competitors to use our patent rights.  Technology companies often bilaterally license patents
between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements. Our competitors may have licenses to our patents, and under current case law , some of the licenses
may exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances. Our participation in industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives may
require us to license our patents to companies that adopt industry-standard specifications. Depending on the rules of the organization, government regulations, or court
decisions, we might have to grant licenses to our patents for little or no cost, and as a result, we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others, our costs of enforcing
our licenses or protecting our patents may increase, and the value of our IP rights may be impaired.
 
OTHER KEY INFORMATION  50

Third parties may assert claims based on IP rights against us or our products, which could harm our business.  We may face claims based on IP rights from individuals and
companies, including claims from those who have aggregated patents acquired from multiple sources to form a new , larger portfolio to assert claims against us and other
companies. Additionally , large patent portfolio owners may divest portions of their portfolios to more than one individual or company increasing the number of parties who own IP
rights previously all held by a single party . We are typically engaged in a number of disputes involving IP rights. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of
others, regardless of their merits, could cause us to incur large costs to respond to, defend, and resolve the claims, and they may divert the ef forts and attention of our
management and technical personnel from our business and operations. In addition, we may face claims based on the alleged theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-
party trade secrets and other confidential information or end-user data that we obtain in conducting our business. Any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our
business, and we could suf fer losses, including the cost of product recalls and returns, and reputational harm. Furthermore, we have agreed to indemnify customers for certain IP
rights claims against them. As a result of IP rights claims, we could:
•pay monetary damages, including payments to satisfy indemnification obligations;
•stop manufacturing, using, selling, of fering to sell, or importing products or technology subject to claims;     
•need to develop other products or technology not subject to claims, which could be time-consuming or costly; and/or
•enter into settlement and license agreements, which agreements may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.
These IP rights claims could harm our competitive position, result in expenses, or require us to impair our assets. If we alter or stop production of af fected items, our revenue
could be harmed.
We rely on access to third-party IP , which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all.  Many of our products include third-party technology and/or
implement industry standards, and may require licenses from third parties. Based on past experience and industry practice, we believe such licenses generally can be obtained
on commercially reasonable terms. However , there is no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use
third-party technology , or to license IP on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude us from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our
financial condition and operating results.
We are subject to the risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings.  We may face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder , consumer , competition,
and other issues on a global basis. As described in " Note 20: Commitments and Contingencies " within the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are engaged in a number of
litigation and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur , including monetary damages, or an injunction
stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An
unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation and
regulatory proceedings can be costly , time-consuming, disruptive to our operations, and distracting to management.
WE MUST ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE KEY EMPLOYEES.
To be competitive, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and other key employees. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staf f, and
sales representatives are critical to our business, and competition for experienced employees can be intense. T o help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use
share-based and other performance-based incentive awards such as RSUs and cash bonuses. Also key to our employee hiring and retention is our ability to build and maintain
an inclusive business culture and be viewed as an employer of choice. If our share-based or other compensation programs and workplace culture cease to be viewed as
competitive, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations.
WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS.
We invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments.  We make investments in public and private companies around the world to further
our strategic objectives and support key business initiatives. Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable at the time of our initial investment. Companies in
which we invest range from early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction to mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The
success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on the company’ s access to additional funding on favorable terms, or a liquidity event, such as a public of fering
or acquisition. If any of the companies in which we invest fail, we could lose all or part of our investment.
Our acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions could fail to achieve our financial or strategic objectives, disrupt our ongoing business, and adversely impact our
results of operations.  In pursuing our business strategy , we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate opportunities, and enter into agreements for possible acquisitions,
divestitures, and other strategic transactions. These transactions involve numerous risks, including:
•the transaction may not advance our business strategy and its anticipated benefits may never materialize;
•we may experience disruption of our ongoing operations and our management’ s attention may be diverted;
•we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment, potentially resulting in an impairment;
•we may be unable to retain key personnel of acquired businesses or may have dif ficulty integrating employees, business systems, and technology;
 
OTHER KEY INFORMATION  51
Table of Contents
 
 
•we may not be able to identify opportunities in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us;
•controls, processes, and procedures of acquired businesses may not adequately ensure compliance with laws and regulations, and we may fail to identify compliance issues
or liabilities;
•we may be unable to ef fectively enter new market segments through our strategic transactions or retain customers and partners of acquired businesses;
•we may fail to identify the existence of unknown, underestimated, and/or undisclosed commitments or liabilities; and/or
•we may fail to complete a transaction in a timely manner , if at all, due to our inability to obtain required government or other approvals, IP disputes or other litigation, dif ficulty
in obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us, or other unforeseen factors.
Moreover , our resources are limited and our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly , if we pursue a particular transaction, we may need to forgo the
prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our financial or strategic objectives.
Any of these risks could have a material adverse ef fect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, particularly in the case of a large acquisition or
several concurrent acquisitions.
WE ARE SUBJECT TO SALES-RELATED RISKS.
We face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties.  We sell a significant portion of our products through third parties such as distributors, value-added
resellers, and channel partners (collectively referred to as distributors), as well as OEMs, ODMs and Internet service providers. W e depend on many distributors to help us create
end-customer demand, provide technical support and other value-added services to customers, fill customer orders, and stock our products. W e may rely on one or more key
distributors for a product, and a material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue. Our
ability to add or replace distributors for some of our products may be limited. In addition, our distributors' expertise in the determination and stocking of acceptable inventory
levels for some of our products may not be easily transferable to a new distributor; as a result, end customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a
distributor . Using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks, including competitive pressure and concentration, credit, and compliance risks. Distributors and other
third parties may sell products that compete with our products, and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to focus them on the sale of our products. They may
face financial dif ficulties, including bankruptcy , which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. V iolations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or
similar laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business. Failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors and other
third parties may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position.
We receive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers.  Collectively , our three largest customers accounted for approximately 40% of our net revenue
in 2017 and 38% of our net revenue in 2016. W e expect a small number of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future. If
one of our key customers stops purchasing from us, materially reduces its demand for our products, or delays its orders for our products, we may experience a reduction in
revenue, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition. For more information about our customers, including customers who accounted for greater than 10%
of our net consolidated revenue, see " Note 4: Operating Segments " within the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We face risks related to business transactions with U.S. government entities.  We receive proceeds from services and products we provide to the U.S. government. U.S.
government demand and payment may be af fected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations. U.S. government contracts are subject to oversight, including
special rules on accounting, IP rights, expenses, reviews, information handling, and security . Failure to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and
sanctions, including termination of contracts, fines, and suspensions, or debarment from future business with the U.S. government.
CHANGES IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE MAY REDUCE OUR NET INCOME.
A number of factors may increase our ef fective tax rates, which could reduce our net income, including:     
•changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed;
•the resolution of issues arising from tax audits;
•changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;
•adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns;
•increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill;
•changes in available tax credits;
•changes in our ability to secure new or renew existing tax holidays and incentives;
•changes in U.S. federal, state, or foreign tax laws or their interpretation, including changes in the U.S. to the taxation of manufacturing enterprises and of non-U.S. income
and expenses;
•changes in accounting standards; and
•our decision to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for local country withholding taxes incurred upon repatriation.

WE MAY HAVE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE AMOUNT AND FREQUENCY OF OUR STOCK REPURCHASES.
The amount, timing, and execution of our stock repurchase program may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes—such as investing in our
business, including operational spending, capital spending, and acquisitions, and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments—and because of changes in cash
flows, tax laws, and the market price of our common stock.
non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with GAAP , this document contains references to the non-GAAP financial measures described below . We believe these
non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results
between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in
operating our business and measuring our performance.
Our non-GAAP operating income and diluted earnings per share reflect adjustments for the following items, as well as the related income tax ef fects. Income tax ef fects have
been calculated using an appropriate tax rate for each adjustment.
Acquisition-related adjustments:
The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the company exclude certain business combination accounting adjustments and certain expenses related to acquisitions as
follow:
•Revenue and gross margin:  Non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of the deferred revenue write-down, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets
that impact cost of sales, and the inventory valuation adjustment.
 
OTHER KEY INFORMATION  53
Table of Contents
 
 
◦Deferred revenue write-down: Sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for subsequent price adjustments and returns, and are deferred until
the products are resold by the distributor . Business combination accounting principles require us to write down to fair value the deferred revenue assumed in
our acquisitions as we have limited performance obligations associated with this deferred revenue. Our GAAP revenues and related cost of sales for the
subsequent reselling by distributors to end customers after an acquisition do not reflect the full amounts that would have been reported if the acquired deferred
revenue was not written down to fair value. The non-GAAP adjustments made in Q1 2016 eliminate the ef fect of the deferred revenue write-down associated
with our acquisition of Altera. W e believe these adjustments are useful to investors as an additional means to reflect revenue and gross margin trends of our
business.
◦Inventory valuation adjustment:  Business combination accounting principles require us to measure acquired inventory at fair value. The fair value of inventory
reflects the acquired company’ s cost of manufacturing plus a portion of the expected profit margin. The non-GAAP adjustments to our cost of sales exclude the
expected profit margin component that is recorded under business combination accounting principles associated with our acquisitions of Mobileye and Altera.
We believe the adjustments are useful to investors as an additional means to reflect cost of sales and gross margin trends of our business.
•Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets:  Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed
technology , brands, and customer relationships acquired in connection with business combinations. W e record charges related to the amortization of these intangibles
within both cost of sales and operating expenses in our GAAP financial statements. Amortization charges for our acquisition-related intangible assets are inconsistent in
size and are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. Consequently , our non-GAAP adjustments exclude these charges to facilitate an
evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance.
•Other acquisition-related charges:  Other acquisition-related charges exclude the impact of other charges associated with the acquisitions of Mobileye and Altera. These
charges primarily include bankers' fees, compensation-related costs, and valuation charges for stock-based compensation incurred related to the acquisitions. W e
believe these adjustments are useful to investors as an additional means to reflect the spending trends of our business.
Restructuring and other charges:
Restructuring charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan and are primarily related to employee severance and benefit arrangements. Other charges include
asset impairments, pension charges, and costs associated with the ISecG divestiture. W e exclude restructuring and other charges, including any adjustments to charges
recorded in prior periods, for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures. W e believe that these costs do not reflect our current operating performance. Consequently ,
our non-GAAP adjustments exclude these charges to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance.
Gains or losses from divestiture:
We recognized a gain in Q2 2017 as a result of our divestiture of ISecG. W e have excluded this gain for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures. W e believe making
these adjustments facilitates a better evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results.
Tax Reform:
We recognized a higher income tax expense in Q4 2017 as a result of T ax Reform. W e have excluded the one-time tax adjustment relating to the transition tax on our previously
untaxed foreign earnings and the remeasurement of our deferred income taxes to the new U.S. statutory tax rate for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures. W e
believe making these adjustments facilitates a better evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results.
Following are the reconciliations of our most comparable GAAP measures to our non-GAAP measures presented:

OPINION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Intel Corporation (the Company) as of December 30, 2017  and December 31, 2016 , the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and stockholders' equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2017 , and the related notes and
Schedule II - V aluation and Qualifying Accounts (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 30, 2017  and December 31, 2016 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 30, 2017 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’ s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 30, 2017 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 16, 2018  expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
 
BASIS FOR OPINION
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our
audits. W e are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test
basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. W e believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

OPINION ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
We have audited Intel Corporation’ s internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2017 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the T readway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Intel Corporation (the Company)
maintained, in all material respects, ef fective internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2017 , based on the COSO criteria.
 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2017  consolidated financial
statements of the Company and our report dated February 16, 2018  expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
 
BASIS FOR OPINION
The Company’ s management is responsible for maintaining ef fective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the ef fectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. W e are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the
Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether ef fective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
 
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design
and operating ef fectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. W e believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
DEFINITION AND LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
A company‘s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’ s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.
 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of ef fectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

notes to consolidated financial statements
 
Note 1: Basis of Presentation
We have a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Saturday in December . Fiscal year 2017  was a 52-week fiscal year , while fiscal year 2016  was a 53-week fiscal year
with the first quarter of 2016 being a 14-week quarter . Fiscal year 2015  was a 52-week year . Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Intel Corporation
(Intel) and our subsidiaries. W e have eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions. W e have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to current period
presentation.
USE OF ESTIMA TES
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires us to make estimates and judgments
that af fect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. The actual results that we experience may dif fer materially from our
estimates.
During our 2015 annual assessment of the useful lives of our property , plant and equipment, we determined that the estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment in our
wafer fabrication facilities should be increased from 4 to 5 years because the lengthening of the process technology cadence resulted in longer node transitions on both 14
nanometer (nm) and 10nm products. W e have also increased the re-use of machinery and tools across each generation of process technology . This change in estimate was
applied prospectively , effective at the beginning of 2016. During 2016, this change increased our operating income by approximately $1.3 billion , our net income by approximately
$950 million , and our diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.19 .
Note 2: Accounting Policies
REVENUE RECOGNITION
We recognize net product revenue when the earnings process is complete and the risks and rewards of product ownership have transferred to our customers, as evidenced by
the existence of an agreement, delivery having occurred, pricing being deemed fixed, and collection being considered probable. W e record pricing allowances, including
discounts based on contractual arrangements with customers, when we recognize revenue as a reduction to both accounts receivable and net revenue. On sales made to
distributors that allow for price protections or right of return until the distributor sells through the merchandise, we defer product revenue, and related costs of sales, due to sales
price reductions and rapid technology obsolescence in our industry . The right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to
exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor . Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the dif ference
between the original price paid and the current price that we of fer. We include shipping charges billed to customers in net revenue, and include the related shipping costs in cost
of sales.
We make payments to our customers through cooperative advertising programs, such as our Intel Inside® program, for marketing activities for certain of our products. W e accrue
cooperative advertising obligations and record the costs at the same time that the related revenue is recognized. W e record cooperative advertising costs as marketing, general
and administrative (MG&A) expenses to the extent that an advertising benefit separate from the revenue transaction can be identified and the fair value of that advertising benefit
received is determinable. W e record any excess in cash paid to customers over the fair value of the advertising benefit we receive as a reduction in revenue.
During the first half of 2017, our cooperative advertising costs under the Intel Inside program met the criteria to be recorded as MG&A. During the second half of 2017, we
transitioned customers from previous of ferings under the Intel Inside program to cooperative advertising of ferings more tailored to customers and their marketing audiences. In
the second half of 2017, cooperative advertising costs were recorded as a reduction of revenue, as we no longer met the criteria for recording these expenses within MG&A.

INVENT ORIES
We compute inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Our process and product development life cycle corresponds with substantive engineering milestones. These engineering
milestones are regularly and consistently applied in assessing the point at which our activities, and associated costs, change in nature from research and development (R&D) to
cost of sales and when cost of sales can be capitalized as inventory .
For a product to be manufactured in high volumes and sold to our customers under our standard warranty , it must meet our rigorous technical quality specifications. This
milestone is known as product release qualification (PRQ). W e have identified PRQ as the point at which the costs incurred to manufacture our products are included in the
valuation of inventory . Prior to PRQ, costs that do not meet the criteria for R&D are included in cost of sales in the period incurred. If the point at which we estimate that inventory
meets PRQ criteria changes in the future, the timing and recognition of costs would shift between inventory , and R&D and costs of sales. A single PRQ has previously ranged up
to $770 million  and is dependent on product type.
The valuation of inventory includes determining which fixed production overhead costs can be included in inventory based on the normal capacity of our manufacturing and
assembly and test facilities. W e apply our historical loadings compared to our total available capacity in a statistical model to determine our normal capacity level. If the factory
loadings are below the established normal capacity level, a portion of our fixed production overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory; instead, it would be
recognized as cost of sales in that period. W e refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. Excess capacity charges are insignificant in the years presented, charges in
certain prior years have ranged from $46 million  to $1.1 billion . The high end of the range would be $540 million  when excluding the $1.1 billion  charge taken in connection with
the 2009 economic recession.
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Product-specific facts and circumstances
reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of our customer base, the stage of the product life cycle, and an assessment of selling price in relation to product
cost. Inventory reserves increased  by approximately $185 million  in 2017  compared to 2016 .
The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory , as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality . We use the demand forecast to develop
our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build decisions. W e compare the estimate of future demand to work in process and
finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any , of obsolete or excess inventory . If our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and
we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly , we could be required to write of f inventory .
PROPERTY , PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of assets. W e also capitalize interest on borrowings related to eligible capital expenditures.
Capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified assets and depreciated together with that asset cost. W e record capital-related government grants earned as a reduction to
property , plant and equipment.
Annually , we evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of our property , plant and equipment, considering factors such as the process technology
cadence between node transitions, changes in machinery and equipment technology , and re-use of machinery and tools across each generation of process technology . As we
make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we use assumptions involving the use of management judgments regarding the remaining useful
lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter or longer
than we had originally estimated, we adjust the rate of depreciation to reflect the assets’ revised useful lives.
We assess property , plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not
be recoverable. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to
expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. W e measure the recoverability of assets that
we will continue to use in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows arising from
the use of that asset grouping. If an asset grouping carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be
impaired. W e measure the impairment by comparing the dif ference between the asset grouping carrying value and its fair value.
We may have certain facilities, included within construction in progress, being held in a safe state and not currently in use that we plan to place into service at a future date. The
time at which these assets are placed into service depends on our existing manufacturing capacity , market demand for our products, and where we are in the transition of
products on our roadmap. Management makes judgments about the timing of when these facilities will be readied for their intended use and placed into service for the
manufacturing of our products. Depreciation is not recognized on these assets and they are not eligible for capitalized interest when construction is on hold.

FAIR V ALUE
When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, as well as assumptions that market participants would use
when pricing the asset or liability . Our financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value, except for cost method investments, cost method loans receivable, equity method
investments, grants receivable, and reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than three months.
The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are:
•Level 1.  Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. W e evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether a market is active.
•Level 2.  Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in less active markets, or model-derived valuations.
All significant inputs used in our valuations, such as discounted cash flows, are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for
substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. W e use LIBOR-based yield curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings as significant inputs in our
valuations. Level 2 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices as well as quoted prices that were adjusted for security-specific restrictions. When we use non-
binding market consensus prices, we corroborate them with quoted market prices for similar instruments or compare them to output from internally developed pricing models
such as discounted cash flow models.
•Level 3.  Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities. W e monitor and review the inputs
and results of these valuation models to help ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes. Level 3
inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices or non-binding broker quotes that we were unable to corroborate with observable market data.
CASH EQUIV ALENTS
We consider all highly liquid debt investments with original maturities from the date of purchase of three months or less as cash equivalents. Cash equivalents can include
investments such as corporate debt, financial institution instruments, government debt, and reverse repurchase agreements.
TRADING ASSETS
Marketable debt instruments are generally designated as trading assets when a market risk is economically hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument, or when the
marketable debt instrument itself is used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement. Investments designated as trading assets are reported at fair
value. The gains or losses on these investments arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate and currency market fluctuations and credit market volatility , largely of fset
by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments and balance sheet remeasurement, are recorded in interest and other , net.
AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS
Available-for-sale investments are classified within cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, marketable equity securities, or long-term investments based on the
remaining maturity of the investment.
Investments designated as available-for-sale are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),
except as noted in our other-than-temporary impairment policy . We determine the cost of the investment sold based on an average cost basis at the individual security level. Our
available-for-sale investments include:
•Marketable debt instruments  when the interest rate and foreign currency risks are not hedged at the inception of the investment or when our criteria for designation as
trading assets are not met. W e record the interest income and realized gains or losses on the sale of these instruments in interest and other , net.
•Marketable equity securities  when there is no plan to sell or hedge the investment at the time of original classification. W e acquire these equity securities to promote
business and strategic objectives. W e record the realized gains or losses on the sale or exchange of marketable equity securities in gains (losses) on equity investments,
net.
NON-MARKET ABLE AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS
We regularly invest in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies. W e account for marketable and non-marketable equity securities as equity method investments
when we have the ability to exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee. Our proportionate share of the income or loss from equity method
investments is recognized on a one-quarter lag and is recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. Non-marketable equity investments over which we cannot exercise
significant influence are accounted for as cost method investments.
The carrying value of our non-marketable equity investment portfolio totaled $4.5 billion  as of December 30, 2017  ($4.4 billion  as of December 31, 2016 ), and is included in other
long-term assets.
 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements 67
Table of Contents
 
 
Our quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factors that may have a significant impact on the investee's fair value. Qualitative factors considered
include industry and market conditions, the financial performance and near-term prospects of the investee, and other relevant events and factors af fecting the investee. W e
prepare quarterly quantitative assessments of the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using both the market and income approaches, which require judgment
and the use of estimates, including discount rates, investee revenues and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others.
OTHER-THAN-TEMPORAR Y IMP AIRMENT
Our available-for-sale debt securities, marketable equity securities, and non-marketable equity investments are subject to periodic impairment reviews.
•For available-for-sale debt securities , we consider whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or
whether recovery of the entire amortized cost basis of the security is unlikely because a credit loss exists. When we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis
of the security , we separate other-than-temporary impairments into amounts representing credit losses, which are recognized in interest and other , net, and amounts not
related to credit losses, which are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).
•For marketable equity securities , we consider the severity and duration of the decline in fair value below cost and our ability and intent to hold the security for a suf ficient
period of time to allow for recovery of value in the foreseeable future based on the financial health of, and business outlook for , the investee.
•For non-marketable equity investments , we consider the severity and duration of the impairment, the investee's financial condition and business outlook, industry and sector
performance, market for technology , operational and financing cash flow factors, and changes in the investee's credit rating, among other qualitative and quantitative criteria.
Impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $555 million  in 2017 ($184 million  in 2016 and $166 million  in 2015).
We record other-than-temporary impairments for marketable equity securities, non-marketable cost method investments, and equity method investments in gains (losses) on
equity investments, net.
DERIV ATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Our primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk, and, to a lesser extent, equity market risk,
commodity price risk, and credit risk. We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with
the same counterparty . A master netting arrangement allows counterparties to net settle amounts owed to each other as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. W e
also enter into collateral security arrangements with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments fluctuates
from contractually established thresholds. W e record the collateral within current other assets and long-term other assets with a corresponding liability . For presentation on our
consolidated balance sheets, we do not of fset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. Our derivative financial instruments
are presented at fair value on a gross basis and are included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities.
Cash Flow Hedges
We use foreign currency contracts, such as currency forwards and currency interest rate swaps, to hedge exposures for the following items:
•Variability in the U.S.-dollar equivalent of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated cash flows associated with our forecasted operating and capital purchases spending; and
•Coupon and principal payments for our non-U.S.-dollar-denominated indebtedness.
The after-tax gains or losses from the ef fective portion of a cash flow hedge is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into
earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction af fects earnings, and in the same line item on the consolidated statements of income as the impact of the
hedge transaction. For foreign currency contracts hedging our capital purchases, forward points are excluded from the hedge ef fectiveness assessment. Inef fective portions of
cash flow hedges, as well as amounts excluded from the hedge ef fectiveness assessment, are recognized in earnings in interest and other , net. If the cash flow hedge
transactions become probable not to occur , the corresponding amounts deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be immediately reclassified to interest
and other , net. These derivatives are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the same section as the underlying item.
Fair Value Hedges
We use interest rate contracts, such as interest rate swaps, to hedge against changes in the fair value on certain of our fixed-rate indebtedness attributable to changes in the
benchmark interest rate. The gains or losses on these hedges, as well as the of fsetting losses or gains related to the changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item
attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings in the current period, primarily in interest and other , net. These derivatives are classified in the consolidated statements
of cash flows in the same section as the underlying item, primarily within cash flows from financing activities.
 
 
 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements 68
Table of Contents
 
 
Non-Designated Hedges
We use foreign currency contracts to economically hedge the functional currency equivalent cash flows of recognized monetary assets and liabilities, non-U.S.-dollar-
denominated debt instruments classified as trading assets, and non-U.S.-dollar-denominated loans receivables recognized at fair value. W e also use interest rate contracts to
hedge interest rate risk related to our U.S.-dollar-denominated fixed-rate debt instruments classified as trading assets.
The change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded through earnings in the line item on the consolidated statements of income to which the derivatives most closely relate,
primarily in interest and other , net. Changes in the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities associated with the hedged risk are generally of fset by the changes in the fair
value of the related derivatives.
LOANS RECEIV ABLE
We elect the fair value option when the interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate risk is economically hedged at the inception of the loan with a related derivative
instrument. When the fair value option is not elected, the loans are carried at amortized cost. W e measure interest income for all loans receivable using the interest method,
which is based on the ef fective yield of the loans rather than the stated coupon rate. W e classify our loans within other current and long-term assets.
CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments in debt instruments, derivative financial instruments, loans
receivable, reverse repurchase agreements, and trade receivables. We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net
settlement of transactions with the same counterparty .
We generally place investments with high-credit-quality counterparties and, by policy , we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of
that counterparty’ s relative credit standing. As required per our investment policy , substantially all  of our investments in debt instruments and financing receivables are in
investment-grade instruments. Credit-rating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for other investments. Due to master netting arrangements, the amounts subject
to credit risk related to derivative instruments are generally limited to the amounts, if any , by which the counterparty’ s obligations exceed our obligations with that counterparty . As
of December 30, 2017 , our total credit exposure to any single counterparty , excluding money market funds invested in U.S. treasury and U.S. agency securities and reverse
repurchase agreements collateralized by treasury and agency securities, did not exceed $800 million . To further reduce credit risk, we obtain and secure available collateral from
counterparties against obligations, including securities lending transactions, when we deem it appropriate.
A substantial majority  of our trade receivables are derived from sales to original equipment manufacturers and original design manufacturers. W e also have accounts receivable
derived from sales to industrial and communications equipment manufacturers in the computing and communications industries. W e believe that the net accounts receivable
balances from our three largest customers ( 36% in 2017 ) do not represent a significant credit risk, based on cash flow forecasts, balance sheet analysis, and past collection
experience. For more information about the customers that represent our accounts receivable balance, see " Note 4: Operating Segments ."
We have adopted credit policies and standards intended to accommodate industry growth and inherent risk. W e believe that credit risks are moderated by the financial stability of
our major customers. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits, and determine whether we
will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance.
BUSINESS COMBINA TIONS
We allocate the purchase price paid for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions based on their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition.
This allocation involves a number of assumptions, estimates, and judgments that could materially af fect the timing or amounts recognized in our financial statements. The most
subjective areas include determining the fair value of the following:
•intangible assets, including the valuation methodology , estimations of future cash flows, discount rates, market segment growth rates, our assumed market segment share,
as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets;
•deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain tax positions, and tax-related valuation allowances, which are initially estimated as of the acquisition date;
•inventory; property , plant and equipment; pre-existing liabilities or legal claims; deferred revenue; and contingent consideration, each as may be applicable; and
•goodwill as measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
Our assumptions and estimates are based upon comparable market data and information obtained from our management and the management of the acquired companies. W e
allocate goodwill to the reporting units of the business that are expected to benefit from the business combination.
 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements 69
Table of Contents
 
 
GOODWILL
We perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of each year , or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment
exist. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment. The reporting unit’ s carrying value used in an impairment test
represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash, investments, and debt.
Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors af fecting the reporting unit. Additionally , as
part of this assessment, we may perform a quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factors above by applying sensitivities to assumptions and inputs used in measuring a
reporting unit’ s fair value.
Our quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit’ s fair value. Significant estimates include market
segment growth rates, our assumed market segment share, estimated costs, and discount rates based on a reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital.
We test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available market data. In the current year the fair value for all of our
reporting units substantially exceeds their carrying value, and our annual qualitative assessment did not indicate that a more detailed quantitative analysis was necessary .
IDENTIFIED INT ANGIBLE ASSETS
We amortize acquisition-related intangible assets that are subject to amortization over their estimated useful life. Acquisition-related in-process R&D assets represent the fair
value of incomplete R&D projects that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of acquisition; initially , these are classified as in-process R&D and are not subject to
amortization. Once these R&D projects are completed, the asset balances are transferred from in-process R&D to acquisition-related developed technology and are subject to
amortization from this point forward. The asset balances relating to projects that are abandoned after acquisition are impaired and expensed to R&D.
We perform a quarterly review of significant finite-lived identified intangible assets to determine whether facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. These reviews can be af fected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our
business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines.
EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS
We use the straight-line amortization method to recognize share-based compensation over the service period of the award net of estimated forfeitures. Upon exercise,
cancellation, forfeiture, or expiration of stock options, or upon vesting or forfeiture of restricted stock units (RSUs), we eliminate deferred tax assets for options and RSUs with
multiple vesting dates for each vesting period on a first-in, first-out basis as if each vesting period were a separate award.
INCOME T AXES
We compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax
consequences of temporary dif ferences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. W e measure
deferred tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in ef fect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or
settled.
We assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely , we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation
allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. W e believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our
consolidated balance sheets. Recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is af fected by management’ s plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments;
therefore, such changes could also af fect our future provision for taxes.
We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if (based on the technical merits of the position) it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on
examination by the tax authority . The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest amount that is more than 50%
likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. W e recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for taxes on the consolidated
statements of income.
We have recorded provisional estimates associated with the December 22, 2017 enactment of the U.S. T ax Cuts and Jobs Act (T ax Reform). The SEC has provided accounting
and reporting guidance that allows us to report provisional amounts within a measurement period up to one year due to the complexities inherent in adopting the changes. W e
consider both the recognition of the transition tax and the remeasurement of deferred income taxes incomplete. New guidance from regulators, interpretation of the law , and
refinement of our estimates from ongoing analysis of data and tax positions may change the provisional amounts.
 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements 70
Table of Contents
 
 
The transition tax is based on our total post-1986 foreign earnings and profits that were previously deferred from U.S. taxation. W e have not yet completed our substantiation of
the underlying data and therefore our taxable base estimates may change. Our estimates of foreign tax credits may also change as we substantiate tax credits claimed. Further ,
the transition tax is based in part on the amount of foreign earnings held in cash and other liquid assets. The transition tax may change as we more precisely calculate amounts
held in liquid and illiquid assets at the various measurement dates. If the final tax outcome of these matters is dif ferent than provisional amounts, its will impact the provision for
income taxes and the ef fective tax rate in the period recorded. For more information about T ax Reform impacts, see " Note 8: Income T axes ."
We recognize the tax impact of including certain foreign earnings in U.S. taxable income as a period cost. W e have not recognized deferred income taxes for local country
income and withholding taxes that could be incurred on distributions of certain non-U.S. earnings or for outside basis dif ferences in our subsidiaries, because we plan to
indefinitely reinvest such earnings and basis dif ferences. Remittances of non-U.S. earnings are based on estimates and judgments of projected cash flow needs, as well as the
working capital and investment requirements of our non-U.S. and U.S. operations. Material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital, and investment needs in various
jurisdictions could require repatriation of indefinitely reinvested non-U.S. earnings, which could be subject to applicable non-U.S. income and withholding taxes.
LOSS CONTINGENCIES
We are subject to loss contingencies, including various legal and regulatory proceedings, asserted and potential claims, liabilities related to repair or replacement of parts in
connection with product defects, as well as product warranties and potential asset impairments that arise in the ordinary course of business. An estimated loss from such
contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.

Intangibles - Goodwill and Other -
Simplifying the T est for Goodwill Impairment .
This accounting standard update eliminates
Step 2 from the existing guidance to simplify
how goodwill impairment tests are
performed. With the elimination of this step,
a goodwill impairment test is performed by
comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to
its carrying value. An impairment charge is
recognized for the amount by which the
reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair
value.
 We elected to early adopt this accounting
standard update in the second quarter of
2017 on a prospective basis.
 We expect the adoption of this update to simplify our annual goodwill impairment
testing process, by eliminating the need to estimate the implied fair value of a reporting
unit’s goodwill, if its respective carrying value exceeds fair value.

Revenue Recognition - Contracts with
Customers. This standard was issued to
achieve a consistent application of revenue
recognition within the U.S., resulting in a
single revenue model to be applied by all
companies. Under the new model,
recognition of revenue occurs when a
customer obtains control of promised goods
or services in an amount that reflects the
consideration to which the entity expects to
be entitled in exchange for those goods or
services. In addition, the new standard
requires that companies disclose the nature,
amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue
and cash flows arising from contracts with
customers.Effective in the first quarter of 2018.
We plan to adopt the standard
retrospectively with the cumulative ef fect
of initially applying it recognized at the
date of initial application ("modified
retrospective" approach).Our assessment has identified a change in revenue recognition timing on our
component sales made to distributors. W e expect to recognize revenue when we
deliver to the distributor rather than deferring recognition until the distributor sells the
components.
On the date of initial application, we will remove the deferred income and related
receivables on component sales made to distributors through a cumulative adjustment
to retained earnings. W e expect the revenue deferral, historically recognized in the
following period, to be of fset by the acceleration of revenue recognition as control of the
product transfers to our customer .
Our assessment has also identified a change in expense recognition timing related to
payments we make to our customers for distinct services they perform as part of
cooperative advertising programs, which were previously recorded as operating
expenses. W e expect to recognize the expense for cooperative advertising in the
period the marketing activities occur . We currently recognize the expense in the period
the customer is entitled to participate in the program, which coincides with the period of
sale. On the date of initial adoption, we will capitalize the expense of cooperative
advertising not performed through a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings.
We have completed our assessment and implemented policies, processes, and
controls to support the standards measurement and disclosure requirements. Refer to
the table below , which summarizes the anticipated impacts of the changes discussed
above to Intel's financial statements. This will be an adjustment to opening balances for
the fiscal year beginning December 31, 2017.
Financial Instruments - Recognition and
Measurement.  Requires changes to the
accounting for financial instruments that
primarily af fect equity investments, financial
liabilities measured using the fair value
option, and the presentation and disclosure
requirements for such instruments.Effective in the first quarter of 2018.
Changes to our marketable equity
securities are required to be adopted
using a modified retrospective approach
through a cumulative ef fect adjustment to
retained earnings for the fiscal year
beginning December 31, 2017.
Since management has elected to apply
the measurement alternative to non-
marketable equity securities, changes to
these securities are being adopted
prospectively .
 Marketable equity securities previously classified as available-for-sale equity
investments will be measured and recorded at fair value with changes in fair value
recorded through the income statement.
All non-marketable equity securities formerly classified as cost method investments will
be measured and recorded using the measurement alternative upon adoption. Equity
securities measured and recorded using the measurement alternative are recorded at
cost minus impairment, if any , plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying
observable price changes. Adjustments resulting from impairments and observable
price changes will be recorded in the income statement.
Beginning in the first quarter of 2018, in accordance with the standard, fair value
disclosures will no longer be provided for equity securities measured using the
measurement alternative. In addition, the existing impairment model will be replaced
with a new one-step qualitative impairment model. No initial adoption adjustment will be
recorded for these instruments since the standard is required to be applied
prospectively for securities measured using the measurement alternative.
We have completed our assessment and implemented policies, processes, and
controls to support the standard's measurement and disclosure requirements. Refer to
the table below , which summarizes the anticipated impacts, net of tax, of the changes
discussed above to Intel's financial statements. This will be an adjustment to opening

Compensation - Retirement Benefits  -
Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic
Pension Cost and Net Periodic
Postretirement Benefit Cost . This amended
standard was issued to provide additional
guidance on the presentation of net benefit
cost in the income statement and on the
components eligible for capitalization in
assets. The service cost component of the
net periodic benefit cost will continue to be
reported within operating income on the
consolidated income statement. All other
non-service components are required to be
presented separately outside operating
income, and only service costs will be
eligible for inventory capitalization.Effective in the first quarter of 2018.
Changes to the presentation of benefit
costs are required to be adopted
retrospectively , while changes to the
capitalization of service costs into
inventories are required to be adopted
prospectively . The standard permits, as a
practical expedient, use of the amounts
disclosed in the Retirement Benefit Plans
footnote for the prior comparative periods
as the estimation basis for applying the
retrospective presentation requirement.
 We expect the adoption of the amended standard to result in the reclassification of
approximately $1 15 million from non-service components above the subtotal of
operating income to interest and other , net, for the year ended December 30, 2017
($260 million for the year ended December 31, 2016).
 
Leases . This new lease accounting standard
requires that we recognize leased assets
and corresponding liabilities on the balance
sheet and provide enhanced disclosure of
lease activity .Effective in the first quarter of 2019.
We plan to adopt the new standard using
a modified retrospective transition
approach.We expect the valuation of our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, previously
described as operating leases, to approximate the present value of our forecasted
future lease commitments. W e are currently implementing process and system
changes in order to comply with the measurement and disclosure requirements.

The Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is our Chief Executive Of ficer (CEO). The CODM allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment
using information about its revenue and operating income (loss).
We offer platform products that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a stand-alone System-on-Chip (SoC), or a multichip
package. A platform product may be enhanced by additional hardware, software, and services of fered by Intel. Platform products are used in various form factors across our
CCG, DCG, and IOTG operating segments. W e derive a substantial majority of our revenue from platform products, which are our principal products and considered as one class
of product.
CCG and DCG are our reportable operating segments. IOTG, NSG, and PSG do not meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable operating segments; however , we
have elected to disclose the results of these non-reportable operating segments. 
We have sales and marketing, manufacturing, engineering, finance, and administration groups. Expenses for these groups are generally allocated to the operating segments.
The "all other" category includes revenue and expenses such as:
• results of operations from non-reportable segments not otherwise presented;
• historical results of operations from divested businesses;
• results of operations of start-up businesses that support our initiatives, including our foundry business;
• amounts included within restructuring and other char ges;
• a portion of employee benefits, compensation, and other expenses not allocated to the operating segments; and
• acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill.
The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information and we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segments. Based on the
interchangeable nature of our manufacturing and assembly and test assets, most of the related depreciation expense is not directly identifiable within our operating segments, as
it is included in overhead cost pools and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process. As our products are then sold across
multiple operating segments, it is impracticable to determine the total depreciation expense included as a component of each operating segment’ s operating income (loss)
results. Operating segments do not record inter-segment revenue. W e do not allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, or taxes to operating
segments. Although the CODM uses operating income to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. Except for these
differences, the accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for Intel as a whole.

Note 5: Earnings Per Share
We computed basic earnings per share of common stock based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. W e computed
diluted earnings per share of common stock based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares of common stock
outstanding during the period.

Earnings per share - Diluted  $ 1.99  $ 2.12  $ 2.33 
Potentially dilutive shares of common stock from employee incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock
options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase plan. Potentially dilutive shares of common stock for
our junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2035 (2005 convertible) debentures are determined by applying the if-converted method. In December 2017, we paid cash to
convert our 2035 debentures which we excluded from our diluted earnings per share computation in the fourth quarter and are no longer dilutive. For information on the
conversion of the 2035 debentures, see " Note 14: Borrowings ." Our junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2039 (2009 debentures) require settlement of the principal
amount of the debt in cash upon conversion, with the conversion premium paid in cash or stock at our option, potentially dilutive shares of common stock are determined by
applying the treasury stock method.
In all years presented, potentially dilutive securities that would have been antidilutive are insignificant  and are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. In all
years presented, we included  our 2009 debentures in the calculation of diluted earnings per share of common stock because the average market price was above the conversion
price. W e could potentially exclude the 2009 debentures in the future if the average market price is below the conversion price.

compensation and benefits on the consolidated balance sheets.  Restructuring actions related to this program, which were approved in 2016, impacted approximately  16,000
employees.
2015 AND 2013 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS
During 2015 and 2013, management approved and commenced implementation of restructuring actions, including targeted workforce reductions and the exit of certain
businesses and facilities, as we adjusted resources from areas of disinvestment to areas of investment. The 2013 restructuring program included the wind down of our 200mm
wafer fabrication facility in Massachusetts and the closure of our assembly and test facility in Costa Rica. Both programs were completed in 2015.
Note 8: Income Taxes
Tax Reform was enacted in December 2017 and reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35.0%  to 21.0%  starting in 2018, assessed a one-time transition tax on
earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries that have not been taxed previously in the U.S., and created new taxes on certain future foreign sourced earnings. W e recorded a provisional
income tax expense of $5.4 billion , net within our 2017 results related to T ax Reform. Our provisional estimates will be refined throughout 2018 from our ongoing analysis of data
and tax positions along with new guidance from regulators and interpretation of the law . The components of the provisional income tax expense are as follows:
•Recognition of the transition tax imposed on undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries.  We have previously asserted an intent to indefinitely reinvest our earnings
and other basis dif ferences in operations outside the U.S., and have not recognized U.S. deferred income taxes. T ax Reform imposes a one-time transition tax on all of our
previously untaxed historical non-U.S. earnings and profits at various tax rates. W e recognized a provisional tax expense of $6.1 billion  in the fourth quarter of 2017. The
move to a participation exemption system allows us to make distributions of non-U.S. earnings to the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. tax, however these distributions
may be subject to applicable non-U.S. taxation.
•Remeasurement of deferred income taxes using the newly enacted statutory tax rate of  21.0% . The new statutory U.S. federal income tax rate is ef fective for the 2018 tax
year. We remeasured our deferred tax assets and liabilities, including associated valuation allowances, with the new tax rate. W e have recognized a provisional tax benefit of
$676 million  in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Effective tax rate  52.8 % 20.3 % 19.6 %
Substantially all  of the increase  in our ef fective tax rate in 2017  compared to 2016  was driven by the one-time provisional impacts from the T ax Reform enacted on December 22,
2017, the 2017 ISecG divestiture, and a higher proportion of our income in higher tax rate jurisdictions.
The majority of the increase  in our ef fective tax rate in 2016  compared to 2015  was driven by one-time items and our 2015 decision to indefinitely reinvest some of our prior
years' non-U.S. earnings, partially of fset by a higher proportion of our income in lower tax jurisdictions.
We derive the ef fective tax rate benefit attributed to non-U.S. income taxed at dif ferent rates primarily from our operations in China, Hong Kong, Ireland, and Israel. The statutory
tax rates in these jurisdictions range from 12.5%  to 25.0% . In addition, we are subject to reduced tax rates in China and Israel as long as we conduct certain eligible activities and
make certain capital investments. These conditional reduced tax rates expire at various dates through 2026  and we expect to apply for renewals upon expiration.

The valuation allowance as of December 30, 2017  included allowances related to unrealized state credit carryforwards of $1.1 billion  and matters related to our non-U.S.
subsidiaries of $99 million .
As of December 30, 2017 , our federal, state, and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were $264 million , $149 million , and $431 million ,
respectively . The majority  of the non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards have no expiration date. The remaining non-U.S. and U.S. federal and state net operating loss
carryforwards expire at various dates through 2036 . A significant amount of the net operating loss carryforwards in the U.S. relates to acquisitions and, as a result, is limited in
the amount that can be recognized in any one year . The non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards include $249 million  that is not likely to be recovered and has been reduced
by a valuation allowance.
As of December 30, 2017 , we have not recognized deferred income tax on certain outside basis dif ferences in our subsidiaries, because we have the intent and ability to
indefinitely reinvest these basis dif ferences. Determining the unrecognized deferred tax liability for these outside basis dif ferences is not practicable.
Current income taxes receivable of $71 million  as of December 30, 2017  ($86 million  as of December 31, 2016 ) are included in other current assets. Current income taxes
payable of $1.4 billion  as of December 30, 2017  ($329 million  as of December 31, 2016 ) are included in other accrued liabilities.
Long-term income taxes payable of $4.1 billion  as of December 30, 2017  ($125 million  as of December 31, 2016 ) are included in other long-term liabilities, and include uncertain
tax positions, reduced by the associated federal deduction for state taxes and non-U.S. tax credits, and may also include other long-term tax liabilities that are not uncertain but
have not yet been paid, including the substantial majority of the transition tax from the T ax Reform, which is payable over the next eight years. The T ax Reform transition tax
drove most of the increase in long-term income taxes payable from 2016.

balance of unrecognized tax benefits were recognized in a future period, it would result in a tax benefit of $139 million  as of December 30, 2017  ($87 million  as of December 31,
2016 ) and a reduction in the ef fective tax rate. The related tax benefit for settlements, ef fective settlements, and remeasurements was insignificant  for 2017  (insignificant  in 2016
and $419 million  in 2015 ). Interest, penalties, and accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits were insignificant in the periods presented.
We comply with the laws, regulations, and filing requirements of all jurisdictions in which we conduct business. W e regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax
authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. Although the timing of the resolutions and/or closures of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that certain
U.S. federal and non-U.S. tax audits may be concluded within the next 12 months, which could significantly increase or decrease the balance of our gross unrecognized tax
benefits. However , the estimated impact on income tax expense and net income is not expected to be significant.
We file federal, state, and non-U.S. tax returns. For non-U.S. tax returns, we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to 2004 . For U.S. federal and
state tax returns, we are no longer subject to tax examination for years prior to 2004 . We have filed petitions before the U.S. T ax Court relating to the treatment of stock-based
compensation expense in an inter-company cost-sharing transaction for certain pre-acquisition Altera Corporation (Altera)  tax years. The U.S. T ax Court ruled in favor of Altera
and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service appealed the ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. During 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals heard oral arguments and
the outcome of those appeals is pending.

On April 28, 2017, Cloudera, Inc. (Cloudera) completed its initial public of fering and we designated our previous equity and cost method investments in Cloudera as available-for-
sale. During 2017, we determined we had an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of our investment and recognized an impairment charge of $278 million . We
recognized the impairment due to the duration and severity of the decline in the investment's fair value, which we determined was below cost based upon observable market
prices after the initial public of fering.

IM Flash Technologies, LLC
Since the inception of IM Flash T echnologies, LLC (IMFT) in 2006, Micron T echnology , Inc. (Micron) and Intel have jointly developed NAND flash memory and 3D XPoint
technology products. Intel also purchases jointly developed products directly from Micron under certain supply agreements.
The IMFT operating agreement continues through 2024 unless terminated earlier , and provides for certain buy-sell rights of the joint venture. Intel has the right to cause Micron to
buy our interest in IMFT and, if exercised, Micron could elect to receive financing from us for one to two years. Commencing in January 2019, Micron has the right to call our
interest in IMFT with the closing date to be ef fective within one year .
IMFT is a variable interest entity , and all costs of IMFT are passed on to Micron and Intel through sale of products or services in proportional share of ownership. Our portion of
IMFT costs was approximately $415 million  in 2017  (approximately $400 million  in 2016  and $400 million  in 2015 ). In the event that IMFT has excess cash, IMFT will make
payments to Micron and Intel in the form of dividends.
IMFT depends on Micron and Intel for any additional cash. In addition to making capital contributions throughout the year , during the fourth quarter of 2017, we extended $650
million  in member debt financing (MDF) to IMFT to fund the ramp of 3D XPoint technology . The MDF balance may be converted to a capital contribution at our request, or may be
repaid upon availability of funds. Our known maximum exposure to loss approximated the carrying value of our investment balance (which included the $650 million  of MDF as of
December 30, 2017 ). Our potential future losses could be higher than the carrying amount of our investment, as Intel and Micron are liable for other future operating costs or
obligations of IMFT and future cash calls. In addition, because we are currently committed to purchasing 49% of IMFT’ s production output and production-related services, we
may be required to purchase products at a cost in excess of realizable value.
We have determined that we do not have the characteristics of a consolidating investor in the variable interest entity , and therefore, we account for our interest in IMFT using the
equity method of accounting.
McAfee
During the second quarter of 2017, we closed our divestiture of the ISecG business and retained a  49% interest in McAfee as partial consideration. Our investment is accounted
for under the equity method of accounting and is classified within other long-term assets. During the third quarter of 2017, we received a $735 million  dividend from McAfee. For
further information related to the divestiture of the ISecG business, see " Note 10: Acquisitions and Divestitures ."
NON-MARKET ABLE COST METHOD INVESTMENTS
The carrying value of our non-marketable cost method investments was $2.6 billion  as of December 30, 2017  ($3.1 billion  as of December 31, 2016 ). In 2017 , we recognized
impairments of $548 million  on non-marketable cost method investments ( $178 million  in 2016  and $164 million  in 2015 ).

Beijing UniSpreadtrum Technology Ltd. (UniSpreadtrum)
During 2014, we entered into a series of agreements with T singhua Unigroup Ltd. (T singhua Unigroup), an operating subsidiary of T singhua Holdings Co. Ltd., to, among other
things, jointly develop Intel architecture- and communications-based solutions for phones . During 2017, we reduced our expectation of the future operating performance for
Beijing UniSpreadtrum T echnology Ltd. (UniSpreadtrum) due to competitive pressures, which resulted in other-than-temporary impairment charges of $308 million . The carrying
value of our investment was $658 million  as of December 30, 2017 ( $966 million  as of December 31, 2016).

2017 ACQUISITIONS
Mobileye
On August 21, 2017, we completed our tender of fer for all of the outstanding ordinary shares of Mobileye, a global leader in the development of computer vision and machine
learning, data analysis, localization, and mapping for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving. This acquisition combines Mobileye's leading computer vision
expertise with Intel’ s high-performance computing and connectivity expertise to create automated driving solutions from car to cloud. The combination is expected to accelerate
innovation for the automotive industry and position Intel as a leading technology provider in the fast-growing market for highly and fully autonomous vehicles. The transaction
also extends Intel’ s strategy to invest in data-intensive market opportunities that build on our strengths in computing and connectivity from the cloud, through the network, to the
device.
As of the completion of the tender of fer, we acquired substantially all of the outstanding ordinary shares of Mobileye. W e acquired 84.4%  of the outstanding shares on August 8,
2017 and 97.3%  as of August 21, 2017, and we intend to acquire all remaining outstanding shares. W e have reflected the acquisition of the additional outstanding shares and
reduction to the noncontrolling interest by $1.8 billion  in the tables below .
Total consideration to acquire Mobileye was $14.5 billion  (net of $366 million  of cash and cash equivalents acquired).
The preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of Mobileye, by major class, were recognized as follows:
(In Millions)   
Short-term investments and marketable securities  $ 370 
Tangible assets  227 
Goodwill  10,278  
Identified intangible assets  4,482  
Current liabilities  (69)
Deferred tax liabilities and other  (418)
Noncontrolling interest  (375)
Total  $ 14,495  
We assumed outstanding unvested Mobileye stock options and RSUs granted under two Mobileye equity plans. W e will not grant additional equity awards under these two
Mobileye equity plans. In connection with the acquisition, we recognized share-based compensation expense of $71 million  for cash-settled awards.
The preliminary allocation of the purchase price was based upon estimates and assumptions that are subject to change within the one-year measurement period. The primary
areas of the purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized are certain tax matters, identification of contingencies, and goodwill.
The fair value of the non-controlling interest was determined based on the quoted share price of Mobileye as of August 8, 2017, and the remaining outstanding shares that
constitute the non-controlling interest. W e recorded the non-controlling interest as a component of equity .
Goodwill of $10.3 billion  arising from the acquisition is attributed to the expected synergies and other benefits that will be generated from the combination of Intel and Mobileye.
Substantially all of the goodwill recognized is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill recognized from the acquisition is included within "all other ."

2016 ACQUISITIONS
Altera Corporation
On December 28, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Altera, a global semiconductor company that designs and sells programmable semiconductors and related products. W e
acquired all outstanding shares of Altera common stock and, subject to certain exceptions, each share of Altera common stock underlying vested stock option awards, RSUs,
and performance-based RSU awards in exchange for cash. The acquired company operates as PSG and continues to design and sell programmable logic devices (PLDs),
which incorporate field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and complex programmable logic devices, and highly integrated SoC devices. This acquisition is expected to expand
our reach within the compute continuum, as the combination of our leading-edge products and manufacturing process with Altera's leading FPGA technology enables new
classes of platforms that meet customer needs in the data center and Internet of Things market segments. As we develop future platforms, the integration of PLDs into our
platform solutions is expected to improve the overall performance and lower the cost of ownership for our customers. For further information, see " Note 4: Operating Segments ."
Total consideration to acquire Altera was $14.5 billion  (net of $2.0 billion  of cash and cash equivalents acquired).

In 2017, we began assessing fair value hierarchy levels for our short-term and long-term debt based on the underlying instrument type. The fair value of our convertible
debentures is determined using discounted cash flow models with observable market inputs, and takes into consideration variables such as interest rate changes, comparable
instruments, subordination discount, and credit-rating changes. As of December 30, 2017  and December 31, 2016 , the fair value of short-term debt (excluding drafts payable)
was $2.4 billion  and $5.1 billion , respectively , and the fair value of long-term debt, excluding the current portion of long-term debt, was $27.0 billion  and $22.0 billion , respectively .
These liabilities are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy based on the nature of the fair value inputs.
Senior Notes
During 2017, we issued a total of $7.7 billion  aggregate principal amount of senior notes, which excludes the private placement of $2.0 billion  of senior notes issued in December
2017 as discussed in the following paragraph. W e used the net proceeds from the of ferings of the notes for general corporate purposes, which included refinancing of
outstanding debt and repurchase of shares of our common stock. Additionally , we redeemed our $1.0 billion , 4.90%  senior notes due August 2045 .
In December 2017, we completed exchange and cash of fers for our outstanding 4.80%  senior notes due 2041, 4.25%  senior notes due 2042, and 4.90%  senior notes due 2045
(Old Notes). As a result of the exchange of fer, we issued in a private placement $2.0 billion  principal amount of 3.73%  senior notes due 2047 and paid $293 million  cash in
exchange for $1.9 billion  aggregate principal amount of the Old Notes. As a result of the cash of fer, we paid $518 million  to repurchase $425 million  aggregate principal amount
and recognized a $93 million  loss on the extinguishment of the Old Notes.
During 2016, we issued a total of $2.8 billion  aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes to refinance existing indebtedness, including our 1.95%  senior notes
due 2016 and a portion of our 1.35%  senior notes due 2017. In connection with our completed acquisition of Altera, in the first quarter of 2016, we acquired a total of $1.5
billion  aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes.
Our senior floating-rate notes pay interest quarterly and our senior fixed-rate notes pay interest semiannually . We may redeem the fixed-rate notes prior to their maturity at our
option at specified redemption prices and subject to certain restrictions. The obligations under the notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future
senior unsecured indebtedness and will ef fectively rank junior to all liabilities of our subsidiaries.
Convertible Debentures
In December 2017, we paid $2.8 billion  to convert our $1.6 billion  2.95%  junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2035. W e recognized a loss of $385 million  in interest
and other , net and $1.4 billion  as a reduction to stockholders' equity related to the conversion feature.
In 2009, we issued junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2039 (2009 debentures), which pay a fixed rate of interest semiannually . The 2009 debentures have a
contingent interest component that requires us to pay interest based on certain thresholds or for certain events, commencing on August 1, 2019. After such date, if the 10-day
average  trading price of $1,000  principal amount of the bond immediately preceding any six-month interest period is less than or equal to $650  or greater than or equal to $1,500 ,
we are required to pay contingent 0.25%  or 0.50%  annual interest, respectively .
The 2009 debentures are convertible, subject to certain conditions. Holders can surrender the 2009 debentures for conversion if the closing price of Intel common stock has been
at least 130%  of the conversion price then in ef fect for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading-day period ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal
quarter . We will settle any conversion of the 2009 debentures in cash up to the face value, and any amount in excess of face value will be settled in cash or stock at our option.
On or after August 5, 2019, we can redeem, for cash, all or part of the 2009 debentures for the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if the closing price of Intel
common stock has been at least 150%  of the conversion price then in ef fect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading-day period. In addition, if certain
events occur in the future, the indenture governing the 2009 debentures provides that each holder of the debentures can, for a pre-defined period of time, require us to
repurchase the holder ’s debentures for the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. The 2009 debentures are subordinated in right of payment to any existing and
future senior debt and to the other liabilities of our subsidiaries. W e have concluded that the 2009 debentures are not conventional convertible debt instruments and that the
embedded stock conversion options qualify as derivatives. In addition, we have concluded that the embedded conversion options would be classified in stockholders’ equity if
they were freestanding derivative instruments and are not accounted for separately as derivative liabilities.

During the fourth quarter of 2017 , the closing stock price conversion right condition of the 2009 debentures continued to be met and the debentures will be convertible at the
option of the holders during the first quarter of 2018 . As a result, the $1.1 billion  carrying amount of the 2009 debentures was classified as short-term debt on our consolidated
balance sheet as of December 30, 2017  ($1.1 billion  as of December 31, 2016 ). The excess of the amount of cash payable if converted over the carrying amount of the 2009
debentures of $866 million  has been classified as temporary equity on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 30, 2017  ($882 million  as of December 31, 2016 ). In
future periods, if the closing stock price conversion right condition is no longer met, all outstanding 2009 debentures would be reclassified to long-term debt and the temporary
equity would be reclassified to stockholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheet.

The conversion rate adjusts for certain events outlined in the indentures governing the 2009 debentures, such as quarterly dividend distributions in excess of $0.14  per share, but
it does not adjust for accrued interest. In addition, the conversion rate will increase for a holder of the 2009 debentures who elects to convert the debentures in connection with
certain share exchanges, mergers, or consolidations involving Intel.

ASSETS MEASURED AND RECORDED A T FAIR V ALUE ON A NON-RECURRING BASIS
Our non-marketable equity investments, marketable equity method investments, and non-financial assets—such as intangible assets and property , plant and equipment—are
recorded at fair value only if an impairment is recognized.
We classified non-marketable equity investments as Level 3. Impairments recognized on non-marketable equity investments held as of December 30, 2017  were $537 million
($153 million  held as of December 31, 2016  and $160 million  held as of December 26, 2015 ).
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS NOT RECORDED A T FAIR V ALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS
Financial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include non-marketable cost method investments, grants receivable, loans receivable, reverse repurchase
agreements, and our short-term and long-term debt.
As of December 30, 2017 , the carrying amount and fair value of our non-marketable cost method investments was $2.6 billion  and $3.6 billion , respectively ( $3.1 billion  and $3.9
billion  as of December 31, 2016 , respectively). These measures are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy based on the nature of the fair value inputs.
As of December 30, 2017 , the aggregate carrying value of grants receivable, loans receivable, and reverse repurchase agreements was $935 million  (the aggregate carrying
amount as of December 31, 2016  was $876 million ). The estimated fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying value and is categorized as Level 2 within
the fair value hierarchy based on the nature of the fair value inputs.

During the periods presented, we entered into $4.8 billion , $4.7 billion , and $4.4 billion , respectively , of interest rate swaps to hedge against changes in the fair value attributable
to the benchmark interest rates related to our outstanding senior notes. These hedges were designated as fair value hedges. During 2015, we entered into $577 million  of
currency interest rate swaps to hedge against the variability in the U.S.-dollar equivalent of coupon and principal payments associated with our non-U.S.-dollar-denominated
indebtedness. These hedges were designated as cash flow hedges.
During 2015, we discontinued cash flow hedge accounting treatment for $478 million  of forward contracts related to our anticipated equity funding of the UniSpreadtrum
investment since we could no longer assert that funding is probable to occur within the initially specified time frame. Hedge losses accumulated in other comprehensive income
and subsequently released to interest and other , net, related to these de-designated forward contracts were insignificant.

Note 18: Retirement Benefit Plans
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS
We provide tax-qualified defined contribution plans for the benefit of eligible employees, former employees, and retirees in the U.S. and certain other countries. The plans are
designed to provide employees with an accumulation of funds for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. For the benefit of eligible U.S. employees, we also provide an unfunded
non-tax-qualified supplemental deferred compensation plan for certain highly compensated employees.
We expensed $346 million  for discretionary contributions to the U.S. qualified defined contribution and non-qualified deferred compensation plans in 2017  ($326 million  in 2016
and $337 million  in 2015 ).
U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS PLAN
Upon retirement, we provide benefits to eligible U.S. employees who were hired prior to 2014 under the U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits Plan. The benefits can be used to
pay all or a portion of the cost to purchase eligible coverage in a medical plan.
As of December 30, 2017  and December 31, 2016 , the projected benefit obligation was $567 million  and $588 million , respectively , which used the discount rate of 3.8%  and
4.2% , respectively . The December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 corresponding fair value of plan assets was $563 million  and $409 million , respectively .
The investment strategy for U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits Plan assets is to invest primarily in liquid assets, due to the level of expected future benefit payments. The
assets are invested solely in a tax-aware global equity portfolio, which is actively managed by an external investment manager . The tax-aware global equity portfolio is composed
of a diversified mix of equities in developed countries. For 2018 , the expected long-term rate of return for the U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits Plan assets is 5.9% . As of
December 30, 2017 , substantially all  of the U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits Plan assets were invested in exchange-traded equity securities and were measured at fair value
using Level 1 inputs.
The estimated benefit payments for this plan over the next 10 fiscal years are as follows:
(In Millions)  2018  2019  2020  2021  2022  2023-2027

PENSION BENEFIT PLANS
We provide defined-benefit pension plans in certain countries, most significantly the U.S., Ireland, Germany , and Israel. The majority  of the plans' benefits have been frozen.

5 All plans had accumulated benefit obligations and projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets for all periods presented.
We use the corridor approach to amortize actuarial gains and losses. Under this approach, net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the larger of the projected benefit
obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized on a straight-line basis.

Rate of compensation increase  3.6% 3.8% 3.9%
We establish the discount rate for each pension plan by analyzing current market long-term bond rates and matching the bond maturity with the average duration of the pension
liabilities.
We establish the long-term expected rate of return by developing a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for each pension fund asset class, taking into account factors
such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation. A single, long-term rate of return is then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset
allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset class.
FUNDING
Policy . Our practice is to fund the various pension plans in amounts suf ficient to meet the minimum requirements of applicable local laws and regulations. Additional funding may
be provided as deemed appropriate. Funding for the U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits Plan is discretionary under applicable laws and regulations; additional funding may be
provided as deemed appropriate.
Funding Status.  On a worldwide basis, our pension and postretirement benefit plans were 65% funded as of December 30, 2017 . The U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan, which
accounts for 33% of the worldwide pension and postretirement benefit obligations, was 77% funded. Funded status is not indicative of our ability to pay ongoing pension benefits
or of our obligation to fund retirement trusts. Required pension funding for U.S. retirement plans is determined in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
(ERISA), which sets required minimum contributions. Cumulative company funding to the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan currently exceeds the minimum ERISA funding
requirements.
 
NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST
The net periodic benefit cost for pension benefits and U.S. postretirement medical benefits was $243 million  in 2017 , ($415 million  in 2016  and $250 million  in 2015 ). The service
cost component of the corresponding net periodic benefit cost was $ 104 million  in 2017  ($156 million  in 2016 and $ 176 million  in 2015).
 
The increase in the net periodic pension benefit cost in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily attributed to plan settlements and remeasurement in conjunction with our 2016
Restructuring Program. For more information on the 2016 Restructuring Program, see " Note 7: Restructuring and Other Charges ."

U.S. Plan Assets
The investment strategy for U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan assets is to maximize risk-adjusted returns, taking into consideration the investment horizon and expected volatility
to help ensure that suf ficient assets are available to pay pension benefits as they come due. The allocation to each asset class will fluctuate with market conditions, such as
volatility and liquidity concerns, and will typically be rebalanced when outside the target ranges, which were 45% fixed income, 30% hedge funds, and 25% equity investments in
2017 . For 2018 , the expected long-term rate of return for the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan assets is 5.1% .
Substantially all  of the fixed-income investments in the U.S. plan assets are asset-backed securities, corporate debt, and government debt. Government debt includes
instruments such as non-U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, and U.S. treasury securities.
The assets measured at net asset value are invested in common collective trust funds, limited partnerships, and limited liability companies.
Non-U.S. Plan Assets
The investments of the non-U.S. plans are managed by insurance companies, pension funds, or third-party trustees, consistent with regulations or market practice of the country
where the assets are invested. The investment manager makes investment decisions within the guidelines set by Intel or local regulations. Investments managed by qualified
insurance companies or pension funds under standard contracts follow local regulations, and we are not actively involved in their investment strategies. For the assets that we
have discretion to set investment guidelines, the assets are invested in developed country equity investments and fixed-income investments, either through index funds or direct
investment. In general, the investment strategy is designed to accumulate a diversified portfolio among markets, asset classes, or individual securities to reduce market risk and
to help ensure that the pension assets are available to pay benefits as they come due. The target allocation of the non-U.S. plan assets that we have control over is
approximately 45% equity , 35% fixed-income, and 20% hedge fund investments. For 2018 , the average expected long-term rate of return for the non-U.S. plan assets is 4.2% .
Most  of the equity investments in the non-U.S. plan assets are invested in a diversified mix of equities of developed countries, including the U.S., and emerging markets
throughout the world.
We have control over the investment strategy related to the majority  of the assets measured at net asset value, which are invested in hedge funds, bond index, and equity index
funds.

Note 19: Employee Equity Incentive Plans
Our equity incentive plans are broad-based, long-term programs intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests. Our plans
include our 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2006 Plan) and our 2006 Stock Purchase Plan.
In May 2017, our stockholders approved an extension of the expiration date of the 2006 Plan to June 2020 and authorized an additional 33 million  shares for issuance under the
plan. Under the 2006 Plan, 786 million  shares of common stock have been authorized for issuance as equity awards to employees and non-employee directors through June
2020. As of December 30, 2017 , 215 million  shares of common stock remained available for future grant s.
Under the 2006 Plan, we grant RSUs and previously granted stock options. W e grant RSUs with a service condition, as well as RSUs with both a market condition and a service
condition (market-based RSUs), which we call outperformance stock units (OSUs), and which are granted to a group of senior of ficers, employees, and non-employee directors.
For OSUs granted in 2017 , the number of shares of our common stock to be received at vesting will range from 0% to 200%  of the target grant amount, based on total
stockholder return (TSR) of our common stock measured against the benchmark TSR of the S&P 500 IT Sector Index over a three -year period. TSR is a measure of stock price
appreciation plus any dividends paid in this performance period. As of December 30, 2017 , 9.2 million  OSUs were outstanding. These OSUs generally vest three years and one
month from the grant date, and OSUs granted prior to 2017 accrue dividend equivalents. Other RSU awards and option awards generally vest over four years from the grant
date. Stock options generally expire seven  years from the date of grant.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSA TION
Share-based compensation recognized in 2017  was $1.4 billion  ($1.4 billion  in 2016 and $1.3 billion  in 2015), which includes $71 million  of cash-settled awards in connection
with the Mobileye acquisition.
The total share-based compensation cost capitalized as part of inventory as of December 30, 2017  was $49 million  ($44 million  as of December 31, 2016  and $49 million  as of
December 26, 2015 ). During 2017 , the tax benefit that we realized for the tax deduction from share-based awards totaled $520 million  ($616 million  in 2016  and $533 million  in
2015 ).
We estimate the fair value of RSUs with a service condition using the value of our common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be
paid on our shares of common stock prior to vesting. W e estimate the fair value of OSUs using a Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant.
We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of rights to acquire shares of common stock granted under the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan on the date of
grant. W e based the weighted average estimated value of RSU and OSU grants, and rights granted under the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan, on the weighted average assumptions

The aggregate fair value of awards that vested in 2017  was $1.6 billion  ($1.6 billion  in 2016  and $1.5 billion  in 2015 ), which represents the market value of our common stock on
the date that the RSUs vested. The grant-date fair value of awards that vested in 2017  was $1.1 billion  ($1.3 billion  in 2016  and $1.1 billion  in 2015 ). The number of RSUs vested
includes shares of common stock that we withheld on behalf of employees to satisfy the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. RSUs that are expected to vest are net
of estimated future forfeitures.
As of December 30, 2017 , unrecognized compensation costs related to RSUs granted under our equity incentive plans were $2.0 billion . We expect to recognize those costs
over a weighted average period of 1.3 years .
STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
The 2006 Stock Purchase Plan allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the value of our common stock on specific dates. Under the 2006
Stock Purchase Plan, 373 million  shares of common stock are authorized for issuance through August 2021. As of December 30, 2017 , 150 million  shares of common stock
remained available for issuance.
Employees purchased 14.5 million  shares of common stock in 2017  for $432 million  under the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan ( 16.5 million  shares of common stock for $415 million
in 2016  and 15.8 million  shares of common stock for $421 million  in 2015 ). As of December 30, 2017 , unrecognized share-based compensation costs related to rights to acquire
shares of common stock under our 2006 Stock Purchase Plan totaled  $13 million . We expect to recognize those costs over a period of approximately two months .

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
We are a party to various legal proceedings, including those noted in this section. Although management at present believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings,
individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends, legal proceedings and related government
investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or other events could occur . Unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary damages. In
addition, in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling
one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices, or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse
impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. W e might also conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests of our
stockholders, employees, and customers, and any such settlement could include substantial payments. Except as specifically described below , we have not concluded that
settlement of any of the legal proceedings noted in this section is appropriate at this time.
European Commission Competition Matter
In 2001, the European Commission (EC) commenced an investigation regarding claims by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) that we used unfair business practices to
persuade customers to buy our microprocessors. W e received numerous requests for information and documents from the EC and we responded to each of those requests. The
EC issued a Statement of Objections in July 2007 and held a hearing on that Statement in March 2008. The EC issued a Supplemental Statement of Objections in July 2008. In
May 2009, the EC issued a decision finding that we had violated Article 82 of the EC T reaty and Article 54 of the European Economic Area Agreement. In general, the EC found
that we violated Article 82 (later renumbered as Article 102 by a new treaty) by of fering alleged "conditional rebates and payments" that required our customers to purchase all or
most of their x86 microprocessors from us. The EC also found that we violated Article 82 by making alleged "payments to prevent sales of specific rival products." The EC
imposed a fine in the amount of €1.1 billion  ($1.4 billion  as of May 2009), which we subsequently paid during the third quarter of 2009, and ordered us to "immediately bring to an
end the infringement referred to in" the EC decision.
The EC decision contained no specific direction on whether or how we should modify our business practices. Instead, the decision stated that we should "cease and desist" from
further conduct that, in the EC's opinion, would violate applicable law . We took steps, which are subject to the EC's ongoing review , to comply with that decision pending appeal.
We had discussions with the EC to better understand the decision and to explain changes to our business practices.

We appealed the EC decision to the Court of First Instance (which has been renamed the General Court) in July 2009. The hearing of our appeal took place in July 2012. In June
2014, the General Court rejected our appeal in its entirety . In August 2014, we filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice. In November 2014, Intervener Association for
Competitive T echnologies filed comments in support of Intel’ s grounds of appeal. The EC and interveners filed briefs in November 2014, we filed a reply in February 2015, and
the EC filed a rejoinder in April 2015. The Court of Justice held oral argument in June 2016. In October 2016, Advocate General W ahl, an advisor to the Court of Justice, issued a
non-binding advisory opinion that favored Intel on a number of grounds. The Court of Justice issued its decision in September 2017, setting aside the judgment of the General
Court and sending the case back to the General Court to examine whether the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition. The General Court has appointed a panel
of five judges to consider our appeal of the EC’ s 2009 decision in light of the Court of Justice’ s clarifications of the law . In November 2017, the parties filed initial “Observations”
about the Court of Justice’ s decision and the appeal, and have been invited by the General Court to of fer supplemental comments to each other ’s “Observations” by March 2018.
Pending the final decision in this matter , the fine paid by Intel has been placed by the EC in commercial bank accounts where it accrues interest.
Shareholder Derivative Litigation regarding In re High Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation
In March 2014, the Police Retirement System of St. Louis (PRSSL) filed a shareholder derivative action in the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara County against Intel,
certain current and former members of our Board of Directors, and former of ficers. The complaint alleges that the defendants breached their duties to the company by
participating in, or allowing, purported antitrust violations that were alleged in a now-settled antitrust class action lawsuit captioned In re High T ech Employee Antitrust
Litigation  claiming that Intel, Adobe Systems Incorporated, Apple Inc., Google Inc., Intuit Inc., Lucasfilm Ltd., and Pixar conspired to suppress their employees’ compensation. In
March 2014, a second plaintif f, Barbara T empleton, filed a substantially similar derivative suit in the same court. In May 2014, a third shareholder , Robert Achermann, filed a
substantially similar derivative action in the same court. The court consolidated the three actions into one, which is captioned In re Intel Corporation Shareholder Derivative
Litigation . Plaintif fs filed a consolidated complaint in July 2014. In August 2015, the court granted our motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint. The plaintif fs thereafter filed a
motion for reconsideration and a motion for new trial, both of which the court denied in October 2015. In November 2015, plaintif fs PRSSL and T empleton appealed the court's
decision. The appeal is fully briefed, and we are waiting on a hearing date from the appellate court.
In June 2015, the International Brotherhood of Electrical W orkers (IBEW) filed a shareholder derivative action in the Chancery Court in Delaware against Intel, certain current and
former members of our Board of Directors, and former of ficers. The lawsuit makes allegations substantially similar to those in the California shareholder derivative litigation
described above, but additionally alleges breach of the duty of disclosure with respect to In re High T ech Employee Antitrust Litigation  and that Intel's 2013 and 2014 proxy
statements misrepresented the ef fectiveness of the Board’ s oversight of compliance issues at Intel and the Board’ s compliance with Intel’ s Code of Conduct and Board of
Director Guidelines on Significant Corporate Governance Issues. In October 2015, the court stayed the IBEW lawsuit for six months pending further developments in the
California case. In March 2016, Intel and IBEW entered into a stipulated dismissal pursuant to which IBEW dismissed its complaint but may re-file upon the withdrawal or final
resolution of the appeal in the PRSSL California shareholder derivative litigation.
In April 2016, John Esposito filed a shareholder derivative action in the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara County against Intel, current members of our Board of
Directors, and certain former of ficers and employees. Esposito made a demand on our Board in 2013 to investigate whether our of ficers or directors should be sued for their
participation in the events described in In re High T ech Employee Antitrust Litigation . In November 2015, our Board decided not to take further action on Esposito’ s demand
based on the recommendation of the Audit Committee of the Board after its investigation of relevant facts and circumstances. Esposito seeks to set aside such decision, and
alleges that the Board was not disinterested in making that decision and that the investigation was inadequate. In November 2016, the court granted Intel’ s motion to dismiss the
case, without leave to amend. In March 2017, plaintif f filed a motion for fees. The court denied plaintif f’s fee motion in May 2017, and entered final judgment in this matter in June
2017. In August 2017, Esposito appealed the final judgment.
McAfee, Inc. Shareholder Litigation
On August 19, 2010, we announced that we had agreed to acquire all of the common stock of McAfee, Inc. (McAfee) for $48.00  per share. Four McAfee shareholders filed
putative class-action lawsuits in Santa Clara County , California Superior Court challenging the proposed transaction. The cases were ordered consolidated in September 2010.
Plaintif fs filed an amended complaint that named former McAfee board members, McAfee, and Intel as defendants, and alleged that the McAfee board members breached their
fiduciary duties and that McAfee and Intel aided and abetted those breaches of duty . The complaint requested rescission of the merger agreement, such other equitable relief as
the court may deem proper , and an award of damages in an unspecified amount. In June 2012, the plaintif fs’ damages expert asserted that the value of a McAfee share for the
purposes of assessing damages should be $62.08 .

In January 2012, the court certified the action as a class action, appointed the Central Pension Laborers’ Fund to act as the class representative, and scheduled trial to begin in
January 2013. In March 2012, defendants filed a petition with the California Court of Appeal for a writ of mandate to reverse the class certification order; the petition was denied
in June 2012. In March 2012, at defendants’ request, the court held that plaintif fs were not entitled to a jury trial and ordered a bench trial. In April 2012, plaintif fs filed a petition
with the California Court of Appeal for a writ of mandate to reverse that order , which the court of appeal denied in July 2012. In August 2012, defendants filed a motion for
summary judgment. The trial court granted that motion in November 2012, and entered final judgment in the case in February 2013. In April 2013, plaintif fs appealed the final
judgment. The California Court of Appeal heard oral argument in October 2017, and in November 2017, af firmed the judgment as to McAfee's nine outside directors, reversed the
judgment as to former McAfee director and chief executive of ficer David DeW alt, Intel, and McAfee, and af firmed the trial court's ruling that the plaintif fs are not entitled to a jury
trial. No bench trial date has been set. Because the resolution of pretrial motions may materially impact the scope and nature of the proceeding, and because of uncertainties
regarding theories that may be asserted at trial following the appellate court's remand of only certain claims in the proceeding and the extent of Intel's responsibility , if any , with
respect to such claims, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any , arising from this matter . We dispute the class-action claims
and intend to continue to defend the lawsuit vigorously .
Litigation related to Security Vulnerabilities
In June 2017, a Google research team notified us and other companies that it had identified security vulnerabilities (now commonly referred to as “Spectre” and “Meltdown”) that
affect many types of microprocessors, including our products. As is standard when findings like these are presented, we worked together with other companies in the industry to
verify the research and develop and validate software and firmware updates for impacted technologies. On January 3, 2018, information on the security vulnerabilities was
publicly reported, before software and firmware updates to address the vulnerabilities were made widely available. Numerous lawsuits have been filed against Intel and, in
certain cases, our executives and directors, in U.S. federal and state courts and in certain courts in other countries relating to the Spectre and Meltdown security vulnerabilities.
As of February 15, 2018, 30 customer class action lawsuits and two securities class action lawsuits have been filed. The customer class action plaintif fs, who purport to represent
various classes of end users of our products, generally claim to have been harmed by Intel's actions and/or omissions in connection with the security vulnerabilities and assert a
variety of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages and equitable relief. The securities class action plaintif fs, who purport to represent classes of acquirers of
Intel stock between July 27, 2017 and January 4, 2018, generally allege that Intel and certain of ficers violated securities laws by making statements about Intel's products and
internal controls that were revealed to be false or misleading by the disclosure of the security vulnerabilities. Additional lawsuits and claims may be asserted on behalf of
customers and shareholders seeking monetary damages or other related relief. W e dispute the claims described above and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously . Given the
procedural posture and the nature of these cases, including that the proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as
to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved,
we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any , that might arise from these matters.  
 
In addition to these lawsuits, in January 2018, Joseph T ola, Joanne Bicknese, and Michael Kellogg each filed a shareholder derivative action in the Superior Court of the State of
California in San Mateo County against certain members of our Board of Directors and certain of ficers. The complaints allege that the defendants breached their duties to Intel in
connection with the disclosure of the security vulnerabilities and the failure to take action in relation to alleged insider trading. The complaints seek to recover damages from the
defendants on behalf of Intel.

controls and procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on management’ s evaluation (with the participation of our CEO and Chief Financial Of ficer (CFO)), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our CEO and CFO
have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
Exchange Act)), are ef fective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and forms, and is accumulated and
communicated to management, including our principal executive of ficer and principal financial of ficer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter
ended December 30, 2017  that have materially af fected, or are reasonably likely to materially af fect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the
Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with U.S. GAAP .
Management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2017 . Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal Control—
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the T readway Commission ( 2013 framework ). Management’ s assessment included evaluation of
elements such as the design and operating ef fectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control environment.
Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ef fective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP .
We reviewed the results of management’ s assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Y oung LLP , independently assessed the ef fectiveness of the company’ s internal control over financial reporting, as
stated in the firm’ s attestation report, which is included within the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect
all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’ s objectives
will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
Further , because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur
or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any , have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of
future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of
compliance with policies or procedures.

INTEL CORPORA TION
3.734% Senior Notes due 2047
1.    Interest.
Intel Corporation (the “ Issuer ”) promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Note at the rate per annum described above. Cash
interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid; or , if no interest has been paid, from December 8,
2017. Interest on this Note will be paid to but excluding the relevant Interest Payment Date or on such earlier date as the principal amount shall
become due in accordance with the provisions hereof. The Issuer will pay interest semi-annually in arrears on each Interest Payment Date,
beginning on June 8, 2018. If any Interest Payment Date, Stated Maturity or other payment date with respect to the Notes is not a Business Day ,
the required payment of principal, premium, if any , or interest will be due on the next succeeding Business Day as if made on the date that such
payment was due, and no interest will accrue on that payment for the period from and after that Interest Payment Date, Stated Maturity or other
payment date, as the case may be, to the date of that payment on the next succeeding Business Day . Interest will be computed on the basis of a
360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
The Issuer shall pay interest on overdue principal from time to time on demand at the rate borne by the Notes and at the same rate on
overdue installments of interest (without regard to any applicable grace periods) to the extent lawful from the dates such amounts are due until
such amounts are paid or made available for payment.
The Issuer shall pay all Additional Interest, if any , in the same manner and on the same dates as interest at the rate stated herein and in the
amounts set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement.
2.    Paying Agent.
Initially , Wells Far go Bank, National Association (the “ Trustee ”) will act as Paying Agent. The Issuer may change any Paying Agent
without notice to the Holders.
3.    Indenture; Defined T erms.
This Note is one of the  3.734% Senior Notes due 2047 (the “ Notes ”) issued under the Indenture dated as of March 29, 2006, as amended
by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 3, 2007 (together , the “ Base Indentur e”) and, as amended, modified and supplemented
by the T welfth Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 8, 2017 (the “ Twelfth Supplemental Indentur e” and, together with the Base
Indenture, the “ Indentur e”), by and between the Issuer and the T rustee, as trustee. This Note is a “Security” and the Notes are “Securities” under
the Indenture.
For purposes of this Note, unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms herein are used as defined in the Indenture. The terms of the
Notes include those stated
 
 
 
30
 
 
 
in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the T rust Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S.C. Sections 77aaa-77bbbb) (the
“TIA”) as in ef fect on the date on which the Indenture was qualified under the TIA. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Notes are
subject to all such terms, and Holders of Notes are referred to the Indenture and the TIA for a statement of them. To the extent the terms of the
Indenture and this Note are inconsistent, the terms of the Indenture shall govern.
4.    Denominations; T ransfer; Exchange.
The Notes are in registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $2,000 and multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. A Holder shall
register the transfer or exchange of Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The Issuer may require a Holder , among other things, to furnish
appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay certain transfer taxes or similar governmental char ges payable in connection
therewith as permitted by the Indenture. The Issuer need not issue, authenticate, register the transfer of or exchange any Notes or portions thereof
for a period of fifteen (15) days before the electronic delivery or mailing of a notice of redemption, nor need the Issuer register the transfer or
exchange of any Note selected for redemption in whole or in part.
5.    Amendment; Modification; W aiver .
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and
obligations of the Issuer and the rights of the Holders of each series of Notes af fected under the Indenture at any time by the Issuer and the T rustee
with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding of all series of Notes
affected thereby . The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Securities of a
series at the time Outstanding with respect to which a default under the Indenture shall have occurred and be continuing, on behalf of the Holders
of all Securities of such series, to waive, with certain exceptions, such past default with respect to such series and its consequences. The Indenture
also permits the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding of all series of Notes
(voting together as a single class), on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive future compliance by the Issuer with certain
provisions of the Indenture. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all
future Holders of this Note and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu hereof, whether or
not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note. Without notice to or consent of any Holder , the Indenture also permits the
amendment or supplement thereof to, among other things, cure any ambiguity , defect or inconsistency or comply with any requirements of the
Commission in connection with qualifications of the Indenture under the TIA, or make any other change that does not adversely af fect the rights
of Holders in any material respect.
 
 
 
 
 
 
31
 
 
 
6.    Optional Redemption.
The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole or in part, at its option, at any time or from time to time prior to Maturity (the date of such
redemption, the “ Redemption Date ”). The Redemption Price prior to June 8, 2047 (the “ Applicable Par Call Date ”) will be equal to the greater
of:
(i)    100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed; or
(ii)    the sum, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker based on the Reference T reasury Dealer Quotations, of the
present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments, discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day
year consisting of twelve 30-day months), using a rate equal to the T reasury Rate plus 16 basis points (such sum to be calculated as set
forth in the Indenture),
plus, in the case of (i) or (ii), accrued interest thereon to, but not including, the Redemption Date.
In the case of any redemption with a Redemption Date on or after the Applicable Par Call Date, the Redemption Price will equal 100% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued interest thereon to, but not including, the Redemption Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on Notes that are due and payable on Interest Payment Dates falling on or prior to a
Redemption Date will be payable on the Interest Payment Date to the registered Holders as of the close of business on the relevant Regular Record
Date according to the Notes and the Indenture, subject to the applicable procedures of the Depositary .
On and after the Redemption Date for the Notes, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or any portion thereof called for redemption,
unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest, if any . On or before the Redemption Date for the Notes, the
Issuer shall deposit with the T rustee or a Paying Agent, funds suf ficient to pay the Redemption Price of the Notes to be redeemed on the
Redemption Date. If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed, the Notes to be redeemed shall be selected by the T rustee by lot, on a pro-rata
basis or by such method as the T rustee deems fair and appropriate and subject, in the case of Notes represented by Global Securities, to the
applicable procedures of the Depositary; provided , however that in no event, shall Notes of a principal amount of $2,000 or less be redeemed in
part.
Notice of any redemption shall be electronically delivered or mailed at least 30 days (in the case of any Redemption Date prior to the
Applicable Par Call Date) or 15 days (in the case of any Redemption Date on or after the Applicable Par Call Date) but, in each case, not more
than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of the Notes to be redeemed. Such notice shall state the Redemption Price (if known) or
the formula pursuant to which the Redemption Price is to be determined if the Redemption
 
 
 
 
 
32
 
 
 
Price cannot be determined at the time the notice is given. If the Redemption Price cannot be determined at the time such notice is to be given, the
actual Redemption Price, calculated as set forth in the Indenture, shall be set forth in an Of ficer’s Certificate of the Issuer delivered to the T rustee
no later than two Business Days prior to the Redemption Date. Notice of redemption having been given as provided in the Indenture, the Notes
called for redemption shall become due and payable on the Redemption Date and at the applicable Redemption Price.
7.    Defaults and Remedies.
If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the T rustee or the Holders of not less than
25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes may declare the principal amount of all the Notes to be due and payable immediately , by a
notice in writing to the Issuer (and to the T rustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified amount)
shall become immediately due and payable.
The Indenture permits, subject to certain limitations therein provided, Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the Outstanding Notes to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the T rustee or exercising any
trust or power conferred on the T rustee, with respect to the Notes.

request for information when required to do so by law .

strategies, markets, sales, customers, customer lists or phone books), personnel information (e.g., organizational charts, employee lists, skill sets, employee

information is permissible under local labor law such as the right of employees to discuss comp ensation and working conditions under the US National Labor
Relations Act), and other non-public Intel data and information of a similar nature. You acknowledge your ongoing obligation to protect such information, during
and after your employment with Intel. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in your original Intel Employment Agreement, you agree that your
obligations of non-disclosure with respect to the Confidential Information survive termination of your employment with Intel and continue indefinitely thereafter
(until such information becomes lawfully and publicly known outside Intel, or an Intel officer expressly authorizes such disclosure or use in advance and in
writing). You agree to execute the T rade Secret Acknowledgment Form and to participate in an exit interview with Intel's General Counsel or his designee.
 
Notwithstanding the above, under the federal Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, you shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under federal or state trade
secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that: (a) is made in confidenc e to an attorney or to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or
indirectly , and is solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; (b) is made to your attorney in relation to a lawsuit for
retaliation against you for reporting a suspected violation of law; or (c) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding filed by
you, if such document is filed under seal and pursuant to court order .

confidentiality covenants  (ii) are fully aware of your obligations hereunder , (iii) agree to the reasonableness of the length of time and scope of the foregoing
covenants, and (iv) agree that such covenants are necessary to protect Intel’ s confidential and proprietary information, good will, stable workforce, and
customer relations.
 
e.Remedy for Breach . You hereby agree that if you breach any provision of this paragraph 9, the damage to Intel may be substantial and money damages will
not afford Intel an adequate remedy , and (ii) if you are in breach of any provision of this paragraph 9, or threatens such a breach (by initiating a course of action
that would reasonably be expected to lead to a breach), Intel shall be entitled, in addition to all other rights and remedies as may be provided by law, to seek
specific performance and injunctive and other equitable relief, without bond or other security , to prevent or restrain a breach of any provision of this paragraph
9.
 
10. Return of Company Property . Within five (5) business days following the Retirement Date, you agree that you will return to Intel (or with respect to
electronically stored information, to destroy or delete) any and all Intel property (files, documents, laptop(s), tablet(s), smart phone(s), keys, credit cards etc.) and any and all Intel
confidential information and property in your possession or electronically stored by you. You further agree that you will not delete or destroy any information that you are obligated
to preserve pursuant to any preservation request that you have received from Intel’ s counsel or court order about which you have previously been made aware.
 
11. Communications Plan.  You and Intel will confer in good faith on a plan regarding the content of the announcement of your plans to retire from Intel.
 
 
 
 
12. Code Section 409A.  You and Intel intend that any amounts payable under this Agreement shall either be exempt from or comply with Code Section 409A of
the Internal Revenue Code so as not to subject you to payment of additional tax, penalty or interest imposed under that section and all regulations, guidance and other
interpretive authority issued thereunder .
 
13. General Release of Claims.  In exchange for the benefits and payments referenced in paragraph 3, you release Intel (including its subsidiaries, affiliates,
successors, and all of its and their past and present directors, officers, and employees) (collectively “Releasees”) from all claims of any kind, known or unknown, which arose on
or before the day you signed this Agreement, except claims that cannot lawfully be waived. For example , you waive all contract, tort, or other common claims you might have,
claims for attorneys’ fees and other litigation costs, claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Equal Pay Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans
with Disabilities Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification
Act, the Employee Retire ment Income Security Act, the National Labor Relations Act, the Sarban es-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act,

California Pregnancy Disability Leave Law, the California Military & Veterans Code, California Industrial Commission Wage Orders, the California Constitution, the California
Business and Professions Code, all of their amendments, and claims under other federal, state and local laws. This Agreement includes a release of claims of discrimination or
retaliation on the basis of workers’ compensation status, but does not include workers’ compen sation claims. You also give up all rights to participate in a class, collective or
representative action under any federal, state, or local law in connection with claims released under this Agreement.
 
14. Release of Unknown Claims.  You are intentionally releasing claims against Releasees of which you may be unaware. You acknowledge that you have
read and understand Section 1542 of the California Civil Code, which states: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to
exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor .” You
give up all rights and benefits under that section. You agree that this Release of Unknown Claims is fairly and knowingly made.
 
15. Additional Release Exclusions/Employee Protections. This Agreem ent does not affect your rights to receive vested retirement and pension plan
benefits, medical plan benefits, or unemployment compensation benefits. Neither the release provisions above nor anything else in this Agreement affects: (i) claims that arise
after the day on which you sign this Agreement , such as claims for breach of this Agreement; or (ii) rights which as a matter of law cannot be released by private agreement,
including your rights to file a charge with any federal, state or local government agency , such as the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or to communicate with,
provide information to, or participate in an invest igation conducted by such an agency . However , you are hereb y waiving all rights to recover money or other individual relief from
any Releasee should any agency or individual pursue a claim on your behalf. You may nonetheless accept money from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a
reward for providing information to that agency .
 
16. Additional Employee Acknowledgements.  You further acknowledge that: (i) it is Intel policy to encourage reporting within Intel possible violations of any
law by or on behalf of Intel, (ii) no one interfered with your reporting of any such violations, and (iii) nothing in this Agreement shall prevent you from lawfully communicating to
government authorities possible violations of federal, state or local law or other information that is protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal, state or local law .
 
17. Cooperation Regarding  Other Claims.  If any claim  is asserted by or against Intel as to which you have relevant knowledge, you agree to reasonably
cooperate with Intel in pursuing or defending that claim, including by providing truthful information and testimony as reasonably requested by Intel. You further agree to cooperate
and provide information to Intel in connection with any internal investigation as to which you have relevant knowledge.
 
18. Right to Consult Legal Counsel.  You have been advised  in writing by this Agre ement to consult with an attorney before signing it, and have had an
adequate opportunity to do so.
 
19. Time To Consider and Revoke/Effective Date.  You have at least twenty-one (21) days from the date you received this Agreement to consider it before
signing (although you may choose to sign the Agreement earlier). You then have seven (7) days  after signing this Agreement to revoke it (“Revocation Period”). This Agreement
will not be ef fective until you have signed it and returned it to Leslie Culbertson, and the Revocation Period has expired.
 
20. Expiration of Agreeme nt. This Agreement shall expire if it is not signed by you and returned to Leslie Culbertson by the 21st day after you have received
this Agreement.
 
21. Governing Law . This Agreement is entered into under California law , and shall be governed by California law .
 
22.    Miscellaneous. This Agreement constitutes the complete, final and exclusive agreement between the parties  regarding all subjects referenced herein. It is
entered into without reliance on any promise or representation, written or oral, other than those expressly contained herein, and it supersedes any other promises or
representations. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become ef fective
 
 
 
 
when one or more count erparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party , it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.
This Agreement may only be changed in a writing signed by both you and a duly authorized Intel representative. This Agreement will bind both parties’ heirs, personal
representatives, successors and assigns, and will inure to the benefit of both parties plus their heirs, successors and assigns. If any provision of this Agreement is determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, that determination will not affect any other provision and the provision in question will be modified by the court so
as to be made enforceable. This Agreement is not an admission of fault or liability by either you or Intel.

Navin Shenoy
Dear Navin:
In recognitio n of your outstanding leadership and your commitment to Intel, we are pleased to offer you the following terms set forth in this letter (this “Letter ”) to enhance your
financial security and of fer incentive and encouragement for you to remain committed to Intel.
Retention Bonus . We will pay you a retention bonus in the aggregate amount of $2,000,000, less applicable taxes and payroll withholdings (“Bonus ”), contingent upon your
continued employment with Intel through December 31, 2019. This Bonus is expressly intended to encourage and induce you to remain employed at Intel for at least two years.
As a result, although Intel will advance the payment of the Bonus to you on December 15, 2017,  the Bonus will not be earned, and your right to any portion of the Bonus will not
vest, unless and until you have remained employed with Intel through December 31, 2019. In the event that before December 31, 2019, you voluntarily resign your employment
for any reaso n, or Intel terminates your employment for Cause (as defined below), you shall repay the Bonus amount in full at the time of your employment termination, by writing
a check to Intel for the full amount or otherwise entering into a repayment arrangement satisfactory to Intel.
For purposes of this Letter , “Cause ” means (1) commission  of an act of material fraud or dishonesty against Intel; (2) intentional refusal or willful failure to carry out the
reasonable instructions of the Chief Executive Officer or of Intel's Board of Directors; (3) conviction of, guilty plea or "no contest" plea to a felony or to a misdemeanor involving
moral turpitude (where moral turpitude means so extreme a departure from ordinary standards of honesty , good morals, justice or ethics as to be shocking to the moral sense of
the community); (4) gross misconduct in connection with the performance of your duties; (5) improper disclosure of confidential information or violation of material Intel policy or
Code of Conduct; (6) breach of fiduciary duty to Intel; (7) failure to cooperate with Intel in any investigation or formal proceeding or being found liable in a Securities and
Exchange Commission enforcement action or otherwise being disqualified from serving in your job; or (8) breach of duty of loyalty to Intel. Prior to termination for cause, Intel
shall provide 30 days prior written notice of the grounds for Cause, and give you an opportunity within those 30 days to cure the alleged breach. The parties recognize that given
the egregious nature of the conduct defined as Cause, a cure may not possible.
For purposes of your Bonus, a termination of your employment due to your death or disability will not constitute a voluntary resignation of your employment.
Retention RSUs.  The Compe nsation Committee of Intel’ s Board of Directors has approved a grant of Restri cted Stock Units (RSUs) with an approved grant value of
approximately $6,000,00 0 (“Retention RSUs”), which Intel will grant to you on December 15, 2017 (the “Grant Date”). Your Retention RSUs will vest over a two-year period: 1/8
of your Retention RSUs  vesting per quarter beginning on the three-month anniversary of the Grant Date and continuing such that the grant is fully vested on the second
anniversary of the Grant Date. Your Retention RSUs will be subject to the terms and conditions of the Intel Corporation 2006 Equity Incentive Plan and the specific grant
agreement linked to your Notice of Grant.
At-W ill Employment . Your employment with Intel is “at will,” which means that both Intel and you have the right to end your employment at any time, with or without advance
notice, and with or without cause. The at-will nature of your employment may not be modified or amended except by written agreement signed by Intel’ s SVP of Human
Resources and you.
Entire Agreement.  This Letter forms the entire agreement between you and Intel and replaces all prior communications regarding all subjects referenced herein.
 
 
 
 
Navin, we appreciate your continued leadership of the Intel Data Center Group. Please let us know if you have any questions.
 
 
Sincerely ,

STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS RELA TING TO RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS GRAN TED ON AND AFTER APRIL 22, 2014 UNDER THE INTEL CORPORA TION
2006 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN (Non-MCM RSU program)
 
1. TERMS OF RESTRICTED ST OCK UNIT
Unless provided otherwise in the Notice of Grant, the standard terms and conditions of this agreement ("Standard T erms" or “Agreement”) apply to Restricted Stock
Units (“RSUs”) granted to you, a U.S. employee, under the Intel Corporation 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2006 Plan"). Your Notice of Grant, these Standard T erms
and the 2006 Plan constitute the entire understanding between you and Intel Corporation (the “Corporation”) regarding the RSUs identified in your Notice of Grant.
2. VESTING OF RSUs
RSUs will vest in substantially equal tranches over sixteen quarterly vesting dates, as specified in the Notice of Grant. Provided that you remain continuously employed
by the Corporation or a Subsidiary on a full time basis from the Grant Date specified in the Notice of Grant through each vesting date specified in the Notice of Grant,
the RSUs shall vest and be converted into the right to receive the number of shares of the Corporation’ s Common Stock, $.001 par value (the “Common Stock”),
specified on the Notice of Grant with respect to such vesting date, except as otherwise provided in these Standard T erms. If a vesting date falls on a weekend or any
other day on which the Nasdaq Stock Market ("NASDAQ") is not open, af fected RSUs shall vest on the next following NASDAQ business day . The number of shares of
Common Stock into which RSUs convert as specified in the Notice of Grant shall be adjusted for stock splits and similar matters as specified in and pursuant to the
2006 Plan.
RSUs will vest to the extent provided in and in accordance with the terms of the Notice of Grant and these Standard T erms. If your status as an Employee terminates for
any reason except death, Disablement (defined below) or Retirement (defined below), prior to the vesting dates set forth in your Notice of Grant, your unvested RSUs
will be cancelled.
3. CONVERSION INT O COMMON ST OCK
Shares of Common Stock will be issued or become free of restrictions as soon as practicable following vesting of the RSUs, provided that you have satisfied your tax
withholding obligations as specified under Section 9 of these Standard T erms and you have completed, signed and returned any documents and taken any additional
action that the Corporation deems appropriate to enable it to accomplish the delivery of the shares of Common Stock. The shares of Common Stock will be issued in
your name (or may be issued to your executor or personal representative, in the event of your death or Disablement), and may be ef fected by recording shares on the
stock records of the Corporation or by crediting shares in an account established on your behalf with a brokerage firm or other custodian, in each case as determined by
the Corporation. In no event will the Corporation be obligated to issue a fractional share.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Corporation shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of the Common Stock during any period when the Corporation determines
that the conversion of a RSU or the delivery of shares hereunder would violate any federal, state or other applicable laws and/or may issue shares subject to any
restrictive legends that, as determined by the Corporation’ s counsel, is necessary to comply with securities or other regulatory requirements, and (ii) the date on which
shares are issued may include a delay in order to provide the Corporation such time as it determines appropriate to address tax withholding and other administrative
matters.
4. SUSPENSION OR TERMINA TION OF RSU FOR MISCONDUCT
If at any time the Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation established pursuant to the 2006 Plan (the "Committee"), including any Subcommittee or
“Authorized Of ficer” (as defined in Section 8(b)(vi) of the 2006 Plan) notifies the Corporation that they reasonably believe that you have committed an act of misconduct
as described in Section 8(b)(vi) of the 2006 Plan (embezzlement, fraud, dishonesty , nonpayment of any obligation owed to the Corporation, breach of fiduciary duty or
deliberate disregard of Corporation rules resulting in loss, damage or injury to the Corporation, an unauthorized disclosure of any Corporation trade secret or
confidential information, any conduct constituting unfair competition, inducing any customer to breach a contract with the Corporation or inducing any principal for whom
the Corporation acts as agent to terminate such agency relationship), the vesting of your RSUs may be suspended pending a determination of whether an act of
misconduct has been committed. If the Corporation determines that you have committed an act of misconduct, all RSUs not vested as of the date the Corporation was
notified that you may have committed an act of misconduct shall be cancelled and neither you nor any beneficiary shall be entitled to any claim with respect to the RSUs
whatsoever . Any determination by the Committee or an Authorized Of ficer with respect to the foregoing shall be final, conclusive, and binding on all interested parties.

5. TERMINA TION OF EMPLOYMENT
Except as expressly provided otherwise in these Standard T erms, if your employment by the Corporation or any Subsidiary terminates for any reason, whether
voluntarily or involuntarily , other than on account of death, Disablement (defined below) or Retirement (defined below), all RSUs not then vested shall be cancelled on
the date of employment termination, regardless of whether such employment termination is as a result of a divestiture or otherwise. For purposes of this Section 5, your
employment with any partnership, joint venture or corporation not meeting the requirements of a Subsidiary in which the Corporation or a Subsidiary is a party shall be
considered employment for purposes of this provision if either (a) the entity is designated by the Committee as a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision or (b) you are
specifically designated as an employee of a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision.
For purposes of this provision, your employment is not deemed terminated if, prior to sixty (60) days after the date of termination from the Corporation or a Subsidiary ,
you are rehired by the Corporation or a Subsidiary on a basis that would make you eligible for future Intel RSU grants, nor would your transfer from the Corporation to
any Subsidiary or from any one Subsidiary to another , or from a Subsidiary to the Corporation be deemed a termination of employment.
6. DEATH
Except as expressly provided otherwise in these Standard T erms, if you die while employed by the Corporation or any Subsidiary , your RSUs will become one hundred
percent (100%) vested.
7. DISABILITY
Except as expressly provided otherwise in these Standard T erms, if your employment terminates as a result of Disablement, your RSUs will become one hundred
percent (100%) vested upon the later of the date of your termination of employment due to your Disablement or the date of determination of your Disablement.
For purposes of this Section 7, “Disablement” shall be determined in accordance with the standards and procedures of the then-current Long T erm Disability Plan
maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, and in the event you are not a participant in a then-current Long T erm Disability Plan maintained by
the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, “Disablement” shall have the same meaning as disablement is defined in the Intel Long T erm Disability Plan, which
is generally a physical condition arising from an illness or injury , which renders an individual incapable of performing work in any occupation, as determined by the
Corporation.
8. RETIREMENT
For purposes of these Standard T erms, “Retirement” shall mean either Standard Retirement (as defined below) or the Rule of 75 (as defined below). Upon your
Retirement, vesting of your RSUs shall be accelerated to the extent provided in Section 8(a) or Section 8(b) below (but not to the extent provided under both provisions
together), whichever results in the greater number of RSUs vesting:
(a) If you retire at or after age 60 (“Standard Retirement”), then all RSUs that were scheduled to vest within a number of whole years from the date of your
Retirement determined by dividing the number of years that you have been employed by the Corporation and its Subsidiaries (measured in complete, whole
years) by five (5), rounded down to the nearest whole number of years, shall vest as of the date of your Retirement. No vesting acceleration shall occur for any
periods of employment of less than five (5) years; or
(b) If, when you terminate employment with the Corporation and its Subsidiaries, your age plus years of service (in each case measured in complete, whole years)
equals or exceeds 75 (“Rule of 75”), then all RSUs that were scheduled to vest within one year of the date of your Retirement shall vest as of the date of your
Retirement.
9. TAX WITHHOLDING
RSUs are taxable upon vesting based on the Market V alue on the date of vesting. To the extent required by applicable federal, state or other law , you shall make
arrangements satisfactory to the Corporation (or the Subsidiary that employs you, if your Subsidiary is involved in the administration of the 2006 Plan) for the payment
and satisfaction of any income tax, social security tax, payroll tax, social taxes, applicable national or local taxes, or payment on account of other tax related to
withholding obligations that arise by reason of vesting of a RSU and, if applicable, any sale of shares of the Common Stock. The Corporation shall not be required to
issue or lift any restrictions on shares of the Common Stock pursuant to your RSUs or to recognize any purported transfer of shares of the Common Stock until such
obligations are satisfied.
 
2
 
 
Unless provided otherwise by the Committee, these obligations will be satisfied by the Corporation withholding a number of shares of Common Stock that would
otherwise be issued under the RSUs that the Corporation determines has a Market V alue suf ficient to meet the tax withholding obligations. In the event that the
Committee provides that these obligations will not be satisfied under the method described in the previous sentence, you authorize UBS Financial Services Inc.,
E*TRADE FINANCIAL CORPORA TION, or any successor plan administrator , to sell a number of shares of Common Stock that are issued under the RSUs, which the
Corporation determines is suf ficient to generate an amount that meets the tax withholding obligations plus additional shares to account for rounding and market
fluctuations, and to pay such tax withholding to the Corporation. The shares may be sold as part of a block trade with other participants of the 2006 Plan in which all
participants receive an average price. For this purpose, "Market V alue" will be calculated as the average of the highest and lowest sales prices of the Common Stock as
reported by NASDAQ on the day your RSUs vest. The future value of the underlying shares of Common Stock is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty .
You are ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by you in connection with your RSUs, regardless of any action the Corporation takes or any transaction
pursuant to this Section 9 with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the RSUs. The Corporation makes no representation or
undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant, issuance, vesting or settlement of the RSUs or the subsequent sale of any of the
shares of Common Stock underlying the RSUs that vest. The Corporation does not commit and is under no obligation to structure the RSU program to reduce or
eliminate your tax liability .
10. RIGHTS AS A ST OCKHOLDER AND RESTRICTIONS
Your RSUs may not be otherwise transferred or assigned, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of in any way , whether by operation of law or otherwise, and
may not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Any attempt to transfer , assign, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of your RSUs other than as permitted
above, shall be void and unenforceable against the Corporation.
You will have the rights of a stockholder only after shares of the Common Stock have been issued to you following vesting of your RSUs and satisfaction of all other
conditions to the issuance of those shares as set forth in these Standard T erms. RSUs shall not entitle you to any rights of a stockholder of Common Stock and there
are no voting or dividend rights with respect to your RSUs. RSUs shall remain terminable pursuant to these Standard T erms at all times until they vest and convert into
shares. As a condition to having the right to receive shares of Common Stock pursuant to your RSUs, you acknowledge that unvested RSUs shall have no value for
purposes of any aspect of your employment relationship with the Corporation.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Standard T erms or the applicable Notice of Grant, your RSUs are subject to reduction by the Corporation if you change
your employment classification from a full-time employee to a part-time employee.
RSUs are not part of your employment contract (if any) with the Corporation or any Subsidiary , your salary , your normal or expected compensation, or other
remuneration for any purposes, including for purposes of computing severance pay or other termination compensation or indemnity .
11. DISPUTES
Any question concerning the interpretation of these Standard T erms, your Notice of Grant, the RSUs or the 2006 Plan, any adjustments required to be made thereunder ,
and any controversy that may arise under the Standard T erms, your Notice of Grant, the RSUs or the 2006 Plan shall be determined by the Committee (including any
person(s) to whom the Committee has delegated its authority) in its sole and absolute discretion. Such decision by the Committee shall be final and binding unless
determined pursuant to Section 13(f) to have been arbitrary and capricious.
12. AMENDMENTS
The 2006 Plan and RSUs may be amended or altered by the Committee or the Board of Directors of the Corporation to the extent provided in the 2006 Plan.
13. THE 2006 PLAN AND OTHER TERMS; OTHER MA TTERS
(a) Certain capitalized terms used in these Standard T erms are defined in the 2006 Plan. Any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations concerning the
RSUs are superseded by these Standard T erms and your Notice of Grant. You hereby acknowledge that a copy of the 2006 Plan has been made available to
you.
The grant of RSUs to an employee in any one year , or at any time, does not obligate the Corporation or any Subsidiary to make a grant in any future year or in
any given amount and should not create an expectation that the Corporation or any Subsidiary might make a grant in any future year or in any given amount.
(b) To the extent that the grant of RSUs refers to the Common Stock of Intel Corporation, and as required by the laws of your country of residence or employment,
only authorized but unissued shares thereof shall be utilized for delivery upon vesting in accord with the terms hereof.
 
3
 
 
(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of these Standard T erms, if any changes in the financial or tax accounting rules applicable to the RSUs covered by these
Standard T erms shall occur which, in the sole judgment of the Committee, may have an adverse ef fect on the reported earnings, assets or liabilities of the
Corporation, the Committee may , in its sole discretion, modify these Standard T erms or cancel and cause a forfeiture with respect to any unvested RSUs at the
time of such determination.
(d) Nothing contained in these Standard T erms creates or implies an employment contract or term of employment upon which you may rely .
(e) Notwithstanding any provision of these Standard T erms, the Notice of Grant or the 2006 Plan to the contrary , if, at the time of your termination of employment
with the Corporation,  you are a “specified employee” as defined in Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code ("Code"), and one or more of the payments or
benefits received or to be received by you pursuant to the RSUs would constitute deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, no such payment or benefit
will be provided under the RSUs until the earliest of (A) the date which is six (6) months after  your "separation from service” for any reason, other than death or
“disability” (as such terms are used in Section 409A(a)(2) of the Code), (B) the date of your death or “disability” (as such term is used in Section 409A(a)(2)(C)
of the Code) or (C) the ef fective date of a “change in the ownership or ef fective control” of the Corporation (as such term is used in Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of
the Code). The provisions of this Section 13(e) shall only apply to the extent required to avoid your incurrence of any penalty tax or interest under Section 409A
of the Code or any regulations or T reasury guidance promulgated thereunder . In addition, if any provision of the RSUs would cause you to incur any penalty tax
or interest under Section 409A of the Code or any regulations or T reasury guidance promulgated thereunder , the Corporation may reform such provision to
maintain to the maximum extent practicable the original intent of the applicable provision without violating the provisions of Section 409A of the Code.
(f) Because these Standard T erms relate to terms and conditions under which you may be issued shares of Common Stock of Intel Corporation, a Delaware
corporation, an essential term of these Standard T erms is that it shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to choice of law
principles of Delaware or other jurisdictions. Any action, suit, or proceeding relating to these Standard T erms or the RSUs granted hereunder shall be brought
in the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction in the State of California.
(g) Copies of Intel Corporation's Annual Report to Stockholders for its latest fiscal year and Intel Corporation's latest quarterly report are available, without charge,
at the Corporation's business of fice.
(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of these Standard T erms, if any changes in law or the financial or tax accounting rules applicable to the RSUs covered by
these Standard T erms shall occur , the Corporation may , in its sole discretion, (1) modify these Standard T erms to impose such restrictions or procedures with
respect to the RSUs (whether vested or unvested), the shares issued or issuable pursuant to the RSUs and/or any proceeds or payments from or relating to
such shares as it determines to be necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable law or to address, comply with or of fset the economic ef fect to the
Corporation of any accounting or administrative matters relating thereto, or (2) cancel and cause a forfeiture with respect to any unvested RSUs at the time of
such determination.

(for RSUs granted on or after December 15, 2017 under

This Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (this “Agreement”), including any special terms and conditions for your country (located at the end of this Agreement), the Notice
of Grant delivered online by logging into the UBS Once Source website (the “Notice of Grant”) and the Intel Corporation 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”), as
such may be amended from time to time, constitute the entire understanding between you and Intel Corporation (the “Corporation”) regarding the Restricted Stock Units
(“RSUs”) identified in your Notice of Grant.
2. SIGNA TURE
If you are instructed by the administrators of the 2006 Plan to accept this Agreement  and you fail to do so in the manner specified by the administrators within 180 days
of the Grant Date, the RSUs identified in your Notice of Grant will be cancelled, except as otherwise determined by the Corporation in its sole discretion.
3. VESTING OF RSUs
RSUs will vest in substantially equal tranches on eight quarterly vesting dates, as specified in the Notice of Grant. Provided that you remain continuously employed by
the Corporation or a Subsidiary from the Grant Date specified in the Notice of Grant through each vesting date, the vesting tranche allocated to each vesting date will
vest and be converted into the right to receive the number of shares of the Corporation’ s Common Stock, $.001 par value (the “Common Stock”), except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement. If a vesting date falls on a weekend or any other day on which the Nasdaq Stock Market ("NASDAQ") is not open, af fected RSUs will vest
on the next following NASDAQ business day . The number of shares of Common Stock into which RSUs convert as specified in the Notice of Grant will be adjusted for
stock splits and similar matters as specified in and pursuant to the 2006 Plan.
RSUs will vest to the extent provided in and in accordance with the terms of the Notice of Grant and this Agreement. If your status as an Employee terminates for any
reason, except death or Disablement (defined below), prior to the vesting dates set forth in your Notice of Grant, your unvested RSUs will be cancelled.
4. CONVERSION INT O COMMON ST OCK
Shares of Common Stock will be issued or become free of restrictions as soon as practicable following vesting of the RSUs, provided that you have satisfied your tax
withholding obligations as specified under Section 9 of this Agreement and you have completed, signed and returned any documents and taken any additional action
that the Corporation deems appropriate to enable it to accomplish the delivery of the shares of Common Stock. The shares of Common Stock will be issued in your
name (or may be issued to your executor or personal representative, in the event of your death or Disablement), and may be ef fected by recording shares on the stock
records of the Corporation or by crediting shares in an account established on your behalf with a brokerage firm or other custodian, in each case as determined by the
Corporation. In no event will the Corporation be obligated to issue a fractional share.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Corporation will not be obligated to deliver any shares of the Common Stock during any period when the Corporation determines
that the conversion of a RSU or the delivery of shares hereunder would violate any laws of the United States or your country of residence or employment and/or may
issue shares subject to any restrictive legends that, as determined by the Corporation’ s counsel, is necessary to comply with securities or other regulatory requirements,
and (ii) the date on which shares are issued may include a delay in order to provide the Corporation such time as it determines appropriate to address tax withholding
and other administrative matters.

5. SUSPENSION OR TERMINA TION OF RSU FOR MISCONDUCT
If at any time the Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation established pursuant to the 2006 Plan (the "Committee"), including any Subcommittee or
“Authorized Of ficer” (as defined in Section 8(b)(vi) of the 2006 Plan) notifies the Corporation that they reasonably believe that you have committed an act of misconduct
as described in Section 8(b)(vi) of the 2006 Plan (embezzlement, fraud, dishonesty , nonpayment of any obligation owed to the Corporation, breach of fiduciary duty or
deliberate disregard of Corporation rules resulting in loss, damage or injury to the Corporation, an unauthorized disclosure of any Corporation trade secret or
confidential information, any conduct constituting unfair competition, inducing any customer to breach a contract with the Corporation or inducing any principal for whom
the Corporation acts as agent to terminate such agency relationship), the vesting of your RSUs may be suspended pending a determination of whether an act of
misconduct has been committed. If the Corporation determines that you have committed an act of misconduct, all RSUs not vested as of the date the Corporation was
notified that you may have committed an act of misconduct will be cancelled and neither you nor any beneficiary will be entitled to any claim with respect to the RSUs
whatsoever . Any determination by the Committee or an Authorized Of ficer with respect to the foregoing will be final, conclusive, and binding on all interested parties.
6. TERMINA TION OF EMPLOYMENT
Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if your employment by the Corporation or any Subsidiary terminates for any reason, whether voluntarily or
involuntarily , other than on account of death or Disablement (defined below), all RSUs not then vested will be cancelled on the date of employment termination,
regardless of whether such employment termination is as a result of a divestiture or otherwise. For purposes of this Section 6, your employment with any partnership,
joint venture or corporation not meeting the requirements of a Subsidiary in which the Corporation or a Subsidiary is a party will be considered employment for purposes
of this provision if either (a) the entity is designated by the Committee as a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision or (b) you are specifically designated as an
employee of a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision.
For purposes of this provision, your employment is not deemed terminated if, prior to sixty (60) days after the date of termination from the Corporation or a Subsidiary ,
you are rehired by the Corporation or a Subsidiary on a basis that would make you eligible for future Intel RSU grants. In addition, your transfer from the Corporation to
any Subsidiary or from any one Subsidiary to another , or from a Subsidiary to the Corporation is not deemed a termination of employment.
7. DEATH
Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you die while employed by the Corporation or any Subsidiary , your RSUs will become one hundred percent
(100%) vested.
8. DISABLEMENT
Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if your employment terminates as a result of Disablement, your RSUs will become one hundred percent
(100%) vested upon the later of the date of your termination of employment due to your Disablement or the date of determination of your Disablement.
For purposes of this Section 8, “Disablement” will be determined in accordance with the standards and procedures of the then-current Long T erm Disability Plan
maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, and in the event you are not a participant in a then-current Long T erm Disability Plan maintained by
the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, “Disablement” will have the same meaning as disablement is defined in the Intel Long T erm Disability Plan, which is
generally a physical condition arising from an illness or injury , which renders an individual incapable of performing work in any occupation, as determined by the
Corporation.
9. TAX WITHHOLDING
To the extent RSUs are subject to tax withholding obligations, the taxable amount will be based on the Market V alue on the date of the taxable event. RSUs are taxable
in accordance with the existing or future tax laws of the country in which you reside or are employed on the grant or vest dates, or during the vesting period. Your RSUs
may be taxable in more than one country , based on your country of citizenship and the countries in which you resided or were employed on the Grant Date, vest date or
during the vesting period.
You will make arrangements satisfactory to the Corporation (or the Subsidiary that employs you, if your Subsidiary is involved in the administration of the 2006 Plan) for
the payment and satisfaction of any income tax, social security tax, payroll tax, social taxes, applicable national or local taxes, or payment on account of other tax
related to withholding obligations that arise by reason of granting or vesting of RSUs or sale of Common Stock shares from vested RSUs (whichever is applicable).

The Corporation will not be required to issue or lift any restrictions on shares of the Common Stock pursuant to your RSUs or to recognize any purported transfer of
shares of the Common Stock until such obligations are satisfied.
Unless provided otherwise by the Committee, these obligations will be satisfied by the Corporation withholding a number of shares of Common Stock that would
otherwise be issued under the RSUs that the Corporation determines has a Market V alue suf ficient to meet the tax withholding obligations. In the event that the
Committee provides that these obligations will not be satisfied under the method described in the previous sentence, you authorize UBS Financial Services Inc.,
E*TRADE Financial Corporate Services, Inc, or any successor plan administrator , to sell a number of shares of Common Stock that are issued under the RSUs, which
the Corporation determines is suf ficient to generate an amount that meets the tax withholding obligations plus additional shares to account for rounding and market
fluctuations, and to pay such tax withholding to the Corporation. The shares may be sold as part of a block trade with other participants of the 2006 Plan in which all
participants receive an average price. For this purpose, "Market V alue" will be calculated as the average of the highest and lowest sales prices of the Common Stock as
reported by NASDAQ on the day your RSUs vest. The future value of the underlying shares of Common Stock is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty .
You are ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by you in connection with your RSUs, regardless of any action the Corporation takes or any transaction
pursuant to this Section 9 with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the RSUs. The Corporation makes no representation or
undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant, issuance, vesting or settlement of the RSUs or the subsequent sale of any of the
shares of Common Stock underlying the RSUs that vest. The Corporation does not commit and is under no obligation to structure the RSU program to reduce or
eliminate your tax liability .
10. RIGHTS AS A ST OCKHOLDER
Your RSUs may not be otherwise transferred or assigned, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of in any way , whether by operation of law or otherwise, and
may not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Any attempt to transfer , assign, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of your RSUs other than as permitted
above, will be void and unenforceable against the Corporation.
You will have the rights of a stockholder only after shares of the Common Stock have been issued to you following vesting of your RSUs and satisfaction of all other
conditions to the issuance of those shares as set forth in this Agreement. RSUs will not entitle you to any rights of a stockholder of Common Stock and there are no
voting or dividend rights with respect to your RSUs. RSUs will remain terminable pursuant to this Agreement at all times until they vest and convert into shares. As a
condition to having the right to receive shares of Common Stock pursuant to your RSUs, you acknowledge that unvested RSUs will have no value for purposes of any
aspect of your employment relationship with the Corporation or a Subsidiary .
11. DISPUTES
Any question concerning the interpretation of this Agreement, your Notice of Grant, the RSUs or the 2006 Plan, any adjustments required to be made thereunder , and
any controversy that may arise under this Agreement, your Notice of Grant, the RSUs or the 2006 Plan will be determined by the Committee (including any person(s) to
whom the Committee has delegated its authority) in its sole and absolute discretion. Such decision by the Committee will be final and binding unless determined
pursuant to Section 14(e) to have been arbitrary and capricious.
12. AMENDMENTS
The 2006 Plan and RSUs may be amended or altered by the Committee or the Board of Directors of the Corporation to the extent provided in the 2006 Plan.

superseded by this Agreement and your Notice of Grant. You hereby acknowledge that a copy of the 2006 Plan has been made available to you.
The grant of RSUs to an employee in any one year , or at any time, does not obligate the Corporation or any Subsidiary to make a grant in any future year or in
any given amount and should not create an expectation that the Corporation or any Subsidiary might make a grant in any future year or in any given amount.
(b) To the extent that the grant of RSUs refers to the Common Stock of Intel Corporation, and as required by the laws of your country of residence or employment,
only authorized but unissued shares thereof will be utilized for delivery upon vesting in accord with the terms hereof.
(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any changes in law or the financial or tax accounting rules applicable to the RSUs covered by this
Agreement will occur , the Corporation may , in its sole discretion, (1) modify this Agreement to impose such restrictions or procedures with respect to the RSUs
(whether vested or unvested), the shares issued or issuable pursuant to the RSUs and/or any proceeds or payments from or relating to such shares as it
determines to be necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable law or to address, comply with or of fset the economic ef fect to the Corporation of any
accounting or administrative matters relating thereto, or (2) cancel and cause a forfeiture with respect to any unvested RSUs at the time of such determination.
(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement creates or implies an employment contract or term of employment upon which you may rely .
(e) Because this Agreement relates to terms and conditions under which you may be issued shares of Common Stock of Intel Corporation, a Delaware

Delaware or other jurisdictions. Any action, suit, or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the RSUs granted hereunder will be brought in the state or federal
courts of competent jurisdiction in the State of California.

(h) In consideration of the grant of RSUs, no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages will arise from termination of your RSUs or diminution in value of
the RSUs or Common Stock acquired through vested RSUs resulting from termination of your active employment by the Corporation (for any reason
whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local labor laws) and you hereby release the Corporation from any such claim that may arise; if, notwithstanding
the foregoing, any such claim is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen, then you will be deemed irrevocably to have waived your entitlement
to pursue such claim.
(i) Notwithstanding any terms or conditions of the 2006 Plan to the contrary , in the event of involuntary termination of your employment (whether or not in breach
of local labor laws), your right to receive the RSUs and vest in RSUs under the 2006 Plan, if any , will terminate ef fective as of the date that you are no longer
actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law ( e.g., active employment would not include a period of “garden
leave” or similar period pursuant to local law); furthermore, in the event of involuntary termination of employment (whether or not in breach of local labor laws),
your right to sell shares of Common Stock that converted from vested RSUs after termination of employment, if any , will be measured by the date of termination
of your active employment and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law .
(j) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, the Notice of Grant or the 2006 Plan to the contrary , if, at the time of your termination of employment with the
Corporation,  you are a “specified employee” as defined in Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code ("Code"), and one or more of the payments or benefits
received or to be received by you pursuant to the RSUs would constitute deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, no such payment or benefit will be
provided under the RSUs until the earliest of (A) the date which is six (6) months after  your "separation from service” for any reason, other than death or

of the Code) or (C) the ef fective date of a “change in the ownership or ef fective control” of the Corporation (as such term is used in Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of
the Code). The provisions of this Section 14(j) will only apply to the extent required to avoid your incurrence of any penalty tax or interest under Section 409A
of the Code or any regulations or T reasury guidance promulgated thereunder . In addition, if any provision of the RSUs would cause you to incur any penalty tax
or interest under Section 409A of the Code or any regulations or T reasury guidance promulgated thereunder , the Corporation may reform such provision to
maintain to the maximum extent practicable the original intent of the applicable provision without violating the provisions of Section 409A of the Code.
