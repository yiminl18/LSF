FOR WARD-LOOKING INFORMA TION AND F ACTORS THA T MA Y AFFECT FUTURE RESUL TS
This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements. We also provide forward-looking statements in other materials we release to the public, as well as public oral statements. Given their
forward-looking nature, these statements involve substantial risks, uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions.
We have tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements by using words such as “will,” “may,” “could,” “likely,” “ongoing,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,”
“believe,” “assume,” “target,” “forecast,” “guidance,” “goal,” “objective,” “aim,” “seek,” “potential,” “hope” and other words and terms of similar meaning or by using future dates.
We include forward-looking information in our discussion of the following, among other topics:
•our anticipated operating and financial performance, reorganizations, business plans, strategy and prospects;
•expectations for our product pipeline, in-line products and product candidates, including anticipated regulatory submissions, data read-outs, study starts, approvals, launches, clinical trial

In particular, forward-looking information in this Form 10-K includes statements relating to specific future actions, performance and effects, including, among others, the expected benefits of
the organizational changes to our operations; our 2023 revenue expectations; our ongoing efforts to respond to COVID-19, including our plans and expectations regarding Comirnaty and

from certain of our initiatives, including our Transforming to a More Focused Company program; our planned capital spending; and the expected benefit payments from and employer
contributions to our benefit plans.
Given their nature, we cannot assure that any outcome expressed in these forward-looking statements will be realized in whole or in part. Actual outcomes may vary materially from past
results and those anticipated, estimated, implied or projected. These forward-looking statements may be affected by underlying assumptions that may prove inaccurate or incomplete, or by
known or unknown risks and uncertainties, including those described in this section and in the Item 1A. Risk Factors section in this Form 10-K.
Therefore, you are cautioned not to unduly rely on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable securities law. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures
we make on related subjects.
Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified below, as well as those discussed in the Item 1A. Risk Factors section in this Form 10-K and within MD&A. We note
these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The occurrence of any of the risks identified below, in the Item 1A. Risk Factors section in this
Form 10-K, or within MD&A, or other risks currently unknown, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, or we may be required to
increase our accruals for contingencies. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all
potential risks or uncertainties:

PART I
ITEM 1. BUSINESS
ABOUT PFIZER
Pfizer Inc. is a research-based, global biopharmaceutical company. We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives
through the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide. We work across developed and emerging markets to advance
wellness, prevention, treatments and cures that challenge the most feared diseases of our time. We collaborate with healthcare providers, governments and local communities to support
and expand access to reliable, affordable healthcare around the world. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 2, 1942.
Most of our revenues come from the manufacture and sale of biopharmaceutical products. We believe that our medicines and vaccines provide significant value for healthcare providers and
patients, through improved treatment of diseases, improvements in health, wellness and productivity as well as by reducing other healthcare costs, such as emergency room or
hospitalization. We seek to enhance the value of our medicines and vaccines and actively engage in dialogues about how we can best work with patients, physicians and payers to prevent
and treat disease and improve outcomes. We seek to maximize patient access and evaluate our pricing arrangements and contracting methods with payers to minimize adverse impact on
our revenues within the current legal and pricing structures.
We are committed to fulfilling our purpose: Breakthroughs that change patients’ lives. Our purpose fuels everything we do and reflects both our passion for science and our commitment to
patients.
In addition, Pfizer continues to enhance its ESG strategy, which is focused on six areas where we see opportunities to create a meaningful impact: product innovation; equitable access and
pricing; product quality and safety; diversity, equity and inclusion; climate change; and business ethics.
We are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product pipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through
various business development activities. We view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies and seek to generate growth by pursuing opportunities and transactions
that have the potential to strengthen our business and our capabilities. We assess our business, assets and scientific capabilities/portfolio as part of our regular, ongoing portfolio review
process and also continue to consider business development activities that will help advance our business strategy.
Our significant recent business development activities in 2022 include, among others: (i) the March 2022 acquisition of Arena, a clinical stage company developing innovative potential
therapies for the treatment of several immuno-inflammatory diseases; (ii) the October 2022 acquisition of GBT, a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development and
delivery of life-changing treatments that provide hope to underserved patient communities, starting with sickle cell disease; and (iii) the October 2022 acquisition of Biohaven, the maker of
Nurtec ODT/Vydura (rimegepant), an innovative therapy for both acute treatment of migraine and prevention of episodic migraine in adults. For a further discussion of our strategy and our
business development initiatives, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook section within MD&A and Note 2.
COMMERCIAL  OPERA TIONS
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we began managing our commercial operations through a global structure consisting of two operating segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma, our
innovative science-based biopharmaceutical business, and PC1, our global contract development and manufacturing organization and a leading supplier of specialty active pharmaceutical
ingredients.
Beginning in the third quarter of 2022, we made several organizational changes to further transform our operations to better leverage our expertise in certain areas and in anticipation of
potential future new product or indication launches.
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 3
The changes include establishing a new commercial structure within Biopharma, optimizing our end-to-end R&D operations and further prioritizing our internal R&D portfolio, as well as
realigning certain enabling and platform functions across the organization to ensure alignment with this new operating structure, which is designed to better support and optimize
performance across three broad customer groups as follows:

For additional information on our operating segments and products, including product revenues, see Note 17, and for additional information on the key operational revenue drivers of our
business, see the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income section within MD&A. For a discussion of the risks associated with our dependence on certain of our major products,
see the Item 1A. Risk Factors—Concentration section in this Form 10-K.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
R&D is at the heart of fulfilling our purpose to deliver breakthroughs that change patients’ lives as we work to translate advanced science and technologies into the therapies that may be the
most impactful for patients. In addition to discovering and developing new products, our R&D efforts seek to add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness and ease of
dosing and by discovering potential new indications.
Our R&D Priorities and Strategy. Our R&D priorities include:
•delivering a pipeline of highly differentiated medicines and vaccines where we have a unique opportunity to bring the most important new therapies to patients in need;
•advancing our capabilities that can position us for long-term R&D leadership; and
•advancing new models for partnerships with creativity, flexibility and urgency to deliver innovation to patients as quickly as possible.
To that end, our R&D primarily focuses on our main therapeutic areas, which are inflammation and immunology, internal medicine, oncology, rare diseases, vaccines, and anti-infectives.
While a significant portion of our R&D is internal, we also seek promising chemical and biological lead molecules and innovative technologies developed by others to incorporate into our
discovery and development processes or projects, as well as our portfolio. We do so by entering into collaboration, alliance and license agreements with universities, biotechnology
companies and other firms as well as through acquisitions and investments. These collaboration, alliance and license agreements and investments allow us to share knowledge, risk and
cost. They also enable us to access external scientific and technological expertise, as well as provide us the opportunity to advance our own products and in-licensed or acquired products.
For information on certain of these collaborations, alliances and license arrangements and investments, see Note 2.
Our R&D Operations. In 2022, we continued to strengthen our global R&D operations and pursue strategies to improve R&D productivity to achieve a sustainable pipeline that is positioned
to deliver value in the near term and over time. Our R&D activity is conducted through various platform functions that operate in parallel within our global operations, including the following:
•WRDM. Research units within WRDM are generally responsible for research and early-stage development assets for our business (assets that have not yet achieved proof-of-concept)
and are organized by therapeutic area to enhance flexibility, cohesiveness and focus. We can rapidly redeploy resources within a research unit and between various projects to leverage,
as necessary, common skills, expertise or focus. Science-based platform-services organizations within WRDM provide technical expertise and other services to various R&D projects and
are organized into science-based functions. These organizations allow us to react more quickly and effectively to evolving needs by sharing resources among projects, candidates and
targets across therapeutic areas and phases of development.
•GPD. Our GPD organization is a unified center for clinical development and regulatory activities that is generally responsible for the clinical development strategy and operational
execution of clinical trials for both early- and late-stage clinical assets in Pfizer’s pipeline.
We manage R&D operations on a total-company basis through our platform functions described above. Specifically, the Portfolio Management Team (PMT), composed of senior executives,
is accountable for aligning resources among all of our WRDM, GPD and R&D projects and for seeking to ensure optimal capital allocation across the innovative R&D portfolio. We believe
that this approach also serves to maximize accountability and flexibility.
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 4
We do not disaggregate total R&D expense by development phase or by therapeutic area since, as described above, we do not manage all of our R&D operations by development phase or
by therapeutic area. Further, as we are able to adjust a significant portion of our spending quickly, we believe that any prior-period information about R&D expense by development phase or
by therapeutic area would not necessarily be representative of future spending.
For additional information, see the Costs and Expenses—Research and Development Expenses section within MD&A and Note 17.
Our R&D Pipeline. The process of drug and biological product discovery from initiation through development and to potential regulatory approval is lengthy and can take more than ten
years. As of January 31, 2023, we had the following number of projects in various stages of R&D:
Development of a single compound is often pursued as part of multiple programs. While our drug candidates may or may not receive regulatory approval, new candidates entering clinical
development phases are the foundation for future products. Information concerning several of our drug candidates in development, as well as supplemental filings for existing products, is
set forth in the Product Developments section within MD&A. The discovery and development of drugs, vaccines and biological products are time consuming, costly and unpredictable. For
information on the risks associated with R&D, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors—Research and Development section in this Form 10-K.
COLLABORA TION AND CO-PROMOTION
We use collaboration and/or co-promotion arrangements to enhance our development, R&D, sales and distribution of certain biopharmaceutical products, which include, among others, the
following:
•Comirnaty is an mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine to help prevent COVID-19, which is being jointly developed and commercialized with BioNTech. Pfizer and BioNTech equally share
the costs of development for the Comirnaty program. Comirnaty has been granted an approval or an authorization in many countries around the world in populations varying by country.
We also share gross profits equally from commercialization of Comirnaty and are working jointly with BioNTech in our respective territories to commercialize the vaccine worldwide
(excluding China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan), subject to regulatory authorizations or approvals market by market. For discussion on Comirnaty, see the Overview of Our
Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook—COVID-19 section within MD&A.
•Eliquis (apixaban) is part of the Novel Oral Anticoagulant market and was jointly developed and commercialized with BMS as an alternative treatment option to warfarin in appropriate
patients. We fund between 50% and 60% of all development costs depending on the study, and profits and losses are shared equally except in certain countries where we commercialize
Eliquis and pay a percentage of net sales to BMS. In certain smaller markets we have full commercialization rights and BMS supplies the product to us at cost plus a percentage of the
net sales to end-customers.
•Xtandi (enzalutamide) is an androgen receptor inhibitor that blocks multiple steps in the androgen receptor signaling pathway within tumor cells that is being developed and
commercialized in collaboration with Astellas. We share equally in the gross profits and losses related to U.S. net sales and also share equally all Xtandi commercialization costs
attributable to the U.S. market, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, we share certain development and other collaboration expenses. For international net sales we receive royalties
based on a tiered percentage.
•Bavencio (avelumab) is a human anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody that is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with Merck KGaA. We jointly fund the
majority of development and commercialization costs and split profits equally related to net sales generated from any products containing avelumab.
•Orgovyx (relugolix) is an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist for the treatment of adult patients with advanced prostate cancer that is being developed and
commercialized with Myovant. The companies are also collaborating on Myfembree (relugolix 40 mg, estradiol 1.0 mg, and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) for heavy menstrual bleeding
associated with uterine fibroids in premenopausal women and the management of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis in premenopausal women. The companies
equally share profits and allowable expenses in the U.S. for Orgovyx, and in the U.S. and Canada for Myfembree, with Myovant bearing our share of allowable expenses up to a
maximum of $50 million in 2022. Pfizer does not have rights outside of these markets. Myovant remains responsible for regulatory interactions and drug supply and continues to lead
clinical development for the relugolix combination tablet.
Revenues associated with these arrangements are included in Alliance revenues (except in certain markets where we have direct sales and except for the majority of revenues for
Comirnaty, which are included as direct product revenues). In addition, we have collaboration arrangements for the development and commercialization of certain pipeline products that are
in development stage, including, among others, (i) with BioNTech to develop a modified mRNA-based vaccine for the prevention of varicella zoster (Shingles), and (ii) with Valneva to co-
develop and commercialize Valneva’s Lyme disease vaccine candidate, VLA15. For further discussion of collaboration and co-promotion agreements, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors—
Collaborations and Other Relationships with Third Parties section in this Form 10-K and Notes 2 and 17.
INTERNA TIONAL  OPERA TIONS
Our operations are conducted globally, and we supply our medicines and vaccines to over 185 countries and territories. Emerging markets are an important component of our strategy for
global leadership, and our commercial structure recognizes that the demographics and rising economic power of the fastest-growing emerging markets are becoming more closely aligned
with the profile found within developed markets. Urbanization and the rise of the middle class in emerging markets provide potential growth opportunities for our products.
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 5
Revenues from operations outside the U.S. of $57.9 billion accounted for 58% of our total revenues in 2022. Revenues exceeded $500 million in each of 24, 21 and 8 countries outside the
U.S. in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in the number of countries exceeding $500 million in revenues in 2022 and 2021 was primarily driven by Comirnaty as well as, in
2022, Paxlovid. As a percentage of revenues, our largest country outside the U.S. was Japan in 2022. For a geographic breakdown of revenues, see the Revenues by Geography section
within MD&A and Note 17B.
Our international operations are subject to risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries. For additional information, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors—Global Operations and Item 1.
Business—Government Regulation and Price Constraints sections in this Form 10-K.
SALES AND MARKETING
Our prescription biopharmaceutical products, with the exception of Paxlovid, are sold principally to wholesalers, but we also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies
and pharmacies. In 2022, we principally sold Paxlovid to government agencies. In the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines directly to the federal government, CDC, wholesalers, individual
provider offices, retail pharmacies and integrated delivery systems. Outside the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines to government and non-government institutions. Certain of these
government contracts may be renegotiated or terminated at the discretion of a government entity. In addition, our contracts with government and supranational organizations for the sales of
Comirnaty and Paxlovid, which are binding contracts, represented a significant amount of revenues in 2022. To date, we primarily sold Comirnaty and Paxlovid globally under government
contracts. We expect sales of Comirnaty and Paxlovid in the U.S. will transition to commercial channels in the second half of 2023. We also seek to gain access for our products on
formularies, which are lists of approved medicines available to members of healthcare programs or PBMs. PBMs use various benefit designs, such as tiered co-pays for formulary products,
to drive utilization of products in preferred formulary positions. We may also work with payers on disease management programs that help to develop tools and materials to educate patients
and physicians on key disease areas. For information on our significant customers, see Note 17C.
We promote our products to healthcare providers and patients consistent with applicable laws. Through our marketing organizations, we explain the approved uses, benefits and risks of our
products to healthcare providers and patients; MCOs that provide insurance coverage, such as hospitals, integrated delivery systems, PBMs and health plans; and employers and
government agencies who hire MCOs to provide health benefits to their employees. In the U.S., we market directly to consumers through direct-to-consumer advertising that seeks to
communicate the approved uses, benefits and risks of our products while motivating people to have meaningful conversations with their doctors. In addition, we sponsor general advertising
to educate the public on disease awareness, prevention and wellness, important public health issues and our patient assistance programs.
As part of our commitment to engaging our customers in the manner they prefer, we took a hybrid approach of virtual and in person engagements and see positive customer response to
both approaches. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we adapted our promotional platform by amplifying our digital capabilities to reach healthcare professionals and customers to provide
critical education and information, including increasing the scale of our remote engagement.
PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY  RIGHTS
Patents. We own or license a number of patents covering pharmaceutical and other products, their uses, formulations, and product manufacturing processes.
Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is
obtained. The scope of protection afforded by a patent can vary from country to country and depends on the patent type, the scope of its patent claims and the availability of legal remedies.
Patent term extensions (PTE) may be available in some countries to compensate for a loss of patent term due to delay in a product’s approval due to the regulatory requirements. One of
the primary considerations in limiting our operations in some countries outside the U.S. is the lack of effective intellectual property protection for our products, although international and U.S.
free trade agreements have included some global protection of intellectual property rights. For additional information, see the Item 1. Business—Government Regulation and Price
Constraints section in this Form 10-K.
In various markets, a period of regulatory exclusivity may be provided for drugs or vaccines upon approval. The scope and term of such exclusivity will vary but, in general, the period will
run concurrently with the term of any existing patent rights associated with the drug at the time of approval.
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 6
Based on current sales, and considering the competition with products sold by our competitors, the patent rights we consider most significant in relation to our business as a whole, together
with the year in which the basic product patent expires, are as follows:

Unless otherwise indicated, the years pertain to the basic product patent expiration, including granted PTEs, supplementary protection certificates (SPC) or pediatric exclusivity periods. SPCs are included when
granted in three out of five major European markets (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the U.K.). Noted in parentheses is the projected year of expiry of the earliest pending patent term extension in the U.S. or
Japan and/or SPC application in Europe, the term of which, if granted, may be shorter than originally requested due to a number of factors. In some instances, there are later-expiring patents relating to our
products which may or may not protect our product from generic or biosimilar competition after the expiration of the basic patent.
Expiry is provided by regulatory exclusivity in this market.
The Europe patent that covers the combination of the 13 serotype conjugates of Prevenar 13 was revoked following an opposition and has now been withdrawn. There are other Europe patents and pending
applications covering the formulation, various aspects of the manufacturing process, and the combination of serotype conjugates of Prevenar 13 that remain in force.
Eliquis was developed and is being commercialized in collaboration with BMS. In the U.S., we and BMS previously settled certain patent litigations with a number of generic companies permitting their launch of a
generic version of Eliquis on April 1, 2028 (the settled generic companies). We continued to litigate against three remaining generic companies and following the resolution of the litigation in our favor, the three
generic companies are not permitted to launch their products until the 2031 expiration date of the formulation patent. Both the composition of matter patent expiring in November 2026 and the formulation patent
expiring in 2031 may be subject to future challenges. While we cannot predict the outcome of any potential future litigation, there are certain potential alternatives that might occur which could potentially permit
generic launch prior to April 1, 2028: (a) if the formulation patent is held invalid or not infringed in future litigation, through appeal, the settled generic companies and any successful future litigant would be
permitted to launch on November 21, 2026; or (b) if both patents are held invalid or not infringed in future litigation, through appeal, the settled generic companies and any successful future litigant could launch
products immediately upon such an adverse decision.
Refer to Note 16A1 for more information.
Xtandi is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with Astellas, which has exclusive commercialization rights for Xtandi outside the U.S. Pfizer receives tiered royalties as a percentage of
international Xtandi net sales.
Vyndaqel (tafamidis meglumine) basic patent expiry in Japan is August 2026 for treatment of polyneuropathy. Vynmac (tafamidis) was approved in Japan for treatment of cardiomyopathy with regulatory
exclusivity expiring in March 2029.
Product not yet approved or authorized in this market.
We have exclusive rights to Braftovi and Mektovi in the U.S., Canada and certain emerging markets. The Pierre Fabre Group has exclusive rights to commercialize both products in Europe and Ono has exclusive
rights to commercialize both products in Japan. We receive royalties from The Pierre Fabre Group and Ono on sales of Braftovi and Mektovi in majority of markets outside the U.S.
Mektovi U.S. expiry is provided by a method of use patent.
Ngenla is being developed in collaboration with OPKO.
Expiry expected to be provided by regulatory exclusivity in this market.
The basic product patent application has been filed in these markets. If granted, a full term is expected in these markets. Product is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with BioNTech.
Pfizer does not have co-promotion rights for this product in Germany.
Loss of Intellectual Property Rights. The loss, expiration or invalidation of intellectual property rights, patent litigation settlements and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights can
have a material adverse effect on our revenues. Once patent protection has expired or has been lost prior to the expiration date as a result of a legal challenge, we typically lose exclusivity
on these products, and generic and biosimilar pharmaceutical manufacturers generally produce identical or highly similar products and sell them for a lower price. The date at which generic

biosimilar competition commences may be different from the date that the patent or regulatory exclusivity expires. However, when generic or biosimilar competition does commence, the
resulting price competition can substantially decrease our revenues for the impacted products, often in a very short period of time. Also, if one of our product-related patents is found to be
invalid by judicial, court or regulatory or administrative proceedings, generic or biosimilar products could be introduced, resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products.
We continue to vigorously defend our patent rights against infringement, and we will continue to support efforts that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary
steps to help ensure appropriate patient access. For additional information, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors—Competitive Products, —Intellectual Property Protection and —Third-Party
Intellectual Property Claims sections in this Form 10-K and Note 16A1.
Certain of our products have experienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years, and we expect certain products to face increased
generic competition over the next few years. For example, the basic product patent for Sutent expired in the U.S. in 2021 and in Europe in 2022. There is no assurance that a particular
product will enjoy market exclusivity for the full time period that appears in the estimates included in this Form 10-K or that we assume when we provide our financial guidance. For
additional information on the impact of LOEs on our revenues, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook—Our 2022 Performance section within
MD&A.
Trademarks. Our products are sold under brand-name and logo trademarks and trade dress. Registrations generally are for fixed, but renewable, terms and protection is provided in some
countries for as long as the mark is used while in others, for as long as it is registered. Protecting our trademarks is of material importance to Pfizer.
COMPETITION
Our business is conducted in intensely competitive and often highly regulated markets. Many of our products face competition in the form of branded or generic drugs or biosimilars that
treat similar diseases or indications. The principal forms of competition include efficacy, safety, ease of use and cost. Though the means of competition vary among our products,
demonstrating the value of our products is a critical factor for success.
We compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat or prevent diseases or indications similar to those treated or prevented by our major products. These
competitors include other worldwide research-based biopharmaceutical companies, smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus and generic drug and biosimilar
manufacturers. Our competitors also may devote substantial funds and resources to R&D and their successful R&D could result in erosion of the sales of our existing products and potential
sales of products in development, as well as unanticipated product obsolescence. In addition, several of our competitors operate without large R&D expenses and make a regular practice of
challenging our product patents before their expiration.
To address competitive trends we continually emphasize innovation, which is underscored by our multi-billion-dollar investment in R&D, as well as our business development transactions,
both designed to result in a strong and differentiated product pipeline. Our investment in research continues even after drug or vaccine approval as we seek to further demonstrate the value
of our products for the conditions they treat or prevent, as well as potential new applications. We educate patients, physicians, payers and global health authorities on the benefits and risks
of our medicines and vaccines, and seek to continually enhance the organizational effectiveness of our biopharmaceutical functions, including to accurately and ethically launch and market
our products to our customers.
Operating conditions have also shifted as a result of increased global competitive pressures, industry regulation and cost containment. We continue to evaluate, adapt and improve our
organization and business practices in an effort to better meet customer and public needs. We believe that we have taken an industry-leading role in evolving our approaches to U.S. direct-
to-consumer advertising, interactions with, and payments to, healthcare professionals and medical education grants. We also continue to sponsor programs to address patient affordability
and access barriers, as we strive to advance fundamental health system change through our support for better healthcare solutions.
Our vaccines may face competition, including from the introduction of alternative vaccines or “next-generation” vaccines prior to or after the expiration of their patents, which may adversely
affect our future results.
Our biosimilars, which include biosimilars of certain inflammation & immunology and oncology biologic medicines, compete with branded products from competitors, as well as other
generics and biosimilars manufacturers. We seek to maximize the opportunity to establish a “first-to-market” or early market position for our biosimilars to provide customers a lower-cost
alternative immediately when available and also to potentially provide us with higher levels of sales and profitability until other competitors enter the market.
Generic Products. Generic pharmaceutical manufacturers pose one of the biggest competitive challenges to our branded small molecule products because they can market a competing
version of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent and often charge much less. Several competitors regularly challenge our product patents before their expiration. Generic
competitors often operate without large R&D expenses, as well as without costs of conveying medical information about products to the medical community. In addition, the FDA approval
process exempts generics from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy, allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the
innovator product. In China, for example, we expect to continue to face intensified competition by certain generic manufacturers in 2023 and beyond, which may result in price cuts and
volume loss of some of our products. In addition, generic versions of competitors’ branded products may also compete with our products.
MCOs that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics over brand-name drugs. Many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brand-
name drugs in their healthcare programs, including Medicaid in the U.S., and U.S. laws generally allow, and in some cases require, pharmacists to substitute generic drugs for brand-name
drugs. In a small subset of states, prescribing physicians are able to expressly prevent such substitution.
Biosimilars. Certain of our biologic products, including Enbrel (we market Enbrel outside the U.S. and Canada), already face, or may face in the future, competition from biosimilars (also
referred to as follow-on biologics). Biosimilars are versions of biologic medicines that have been developed and proven to be highly similar to the original biologic in terms of safety and
efficacy and that have no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity or potency. Biosimilars have the potential to offer high-quality, lower-cost alternatives to innovative biologic
medicines. In the U.S., biosimilars referencing innovative biologic products are approved under the U.S. Public Health Service Act.
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 8
PRICING PRESSURES AND MANAGED CARE ORGANIZA TIONS
Commercial Pricing Pressures. Pricing and access pressures in the commercial sector continue to be significant. Overall, there is increasing pressure on U.S. providers to deliver healthcare
at a lower cost and to ensure that those expenditures deliver demonstrated value in terms of health outcomes. Many employers have adopted or make available high deductible health
plans, which can increase out-of-pocket costs for medicines. This trend is likely to continue. Private third-party payers, such as health plans, increasingly challenge pharmaceutical product
pricing, which could result in lower prices, lower reimbursement rates for payors and a reduction in demand for our products, including denial of coverage of our products, if lower cost
alternatives are available. Pricing pressures also may occur as a result of highly competitive insurance markets. Healthcare provider purchasers, directly or through group purchasing
organizations, are seeking enhanced discounts or implementing more rigorous bidding or purchasing review processes.
Longer term, we foresee a shift among payors and their pharmacy benefits managers in focus away from fee-for-service reimbursement towards outcomes-based payments and risk-
sharing arrangements that reward providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers for cost reductions and improved patient outcomes. These new payment models can, at times, lead to lower
prices for, and restricted access to, new medicines. At the same time, these models can also promote utilization of drugs by encouraging physicians to screen and diagnose and consider
drugs as a means of forestalling more costly medical interventions. Further, these models may also encourage payors and their pharmacy benefits managers to cover higher cost drugs
where coverage is tied to patient outcomes and other quality incentives.
The impact of COVID-19 and related large-scale healthcare disruptions on the pace of adoption of value-based payment models remains unclear. Both payors and providers may resist
adopting such models or choose to adopt such models at a slower pace if the incentives available do not outweigh the financial risk involved. Unprecedented pressures on critical care and
the reductions in elective surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic undermined revenue predictability for hospitals and other institutional providers. As a result, providers may weigh their
ability to take on the financial risk of downside value-based payment models. In contrast, providers in more advanced value-based payment models, such as full capitation, a fixed amount
paid in advance per patient per unit of time-period, generally found their revenues remained steady during the pandemic, which may ultimately encourage the growth of such models. Going
forward, we expect continued focus on value-based payment models that support financial resiliency and advance health care equity by incorporating features intended to reduce disparities
in health care quality and access experienced by underrepresented and underserved populations.
We believe medicines and vaccines are the most efficient and effective use of healthcare dollars based on the value they deliver to the overall healthcare system. We work with law makers
and advocate for solutions that effectively improve patient health outcomes, lower costs to the healthcare system, and help ensure access to medicines and vaccines within an efficient and
affordable healthcare system. This includes assessing our go-to market model to address patient affordability challenges. We have engaged with major payors and the U.S. government to
explore opportunities to improve access and reimbursement in an effort to drive pro-patient policies. In addition, in response to the evolving U.S. and global healthcare spending landscape,
we work with health authorities, health technology assessment and quality measurement bodies and major U.S. payers throughout the product-development process to better understand
how these entities value our compounds and products. Further, we are developing stronger support to demonstrate the net value of the medicines and vaccines that we discover or develop,
register and manufacture.
For information on government pricing pressures, see the Item 1. Business—Government Regulation and Price Constraints and Item 1A. Risk Factors—Pricing and Reimbursement
sections in this Form 10-K.
Managed Care Organizations. The evolution of managed care in the U.S. has been a major factor in the competitiveness of the healthcare marketplace. Approximately 307 million people in
the U.S. now have some form of health insurance coverage, and the marketing of prescription drugs and vaccines to both consumers and the entities that manage coverage in the U.S.
continues to grow in importance. In particular, the influence of MCOs has increased in recent years due to the growing number of patients receiving coverage through MCOs. At the same
time, consolidation in the MCO industry has resulted in fewer, even larger MCOs, which enhances those MCOs’ ability to negotiate lower pricing and further increases their importance to
our business. Since MCOs seek to contain and reduce healthcare expenditures, their growing influence has increased downward pressure on drug prices, as well as negatively impacted
revenues.
MCOs and their PBMs typically negotiate prices with pharmaceutical providers by using formularies (which are lists of approved medicines available to MCO members), clinical protocols
(which require prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or require the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a
branded medicine), volume purchasing, long-term contracts and their ability to influence volume and market share of prescription drugs. In addition, by placing branded medicines on higher-
tier or non-preferred status in their formularies, MCOs transfer to the patient higher patient out-of-pocket expenses. This financial disincentive is a tool for MCOs to manage drug costs and
channel patients to medicines preferred by the MCOs. We expect payment reforms for MCOs will continue to evolve with increased emphasis on expanded participation and on removing
barriers to equitable health care.
The breadth of the products covered by formularies can vary considerably from one MCO to another, and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of
particular medical problems. MCOs emphasize primary and preventive care, out-patient treatment and procedures performed at doctors’ offices and clinics as ways to manage costs.
Hospitalization and surgery, typically the most expensive forms of treatment, are carefully managed, and drugs that can help in chronic care management and reduce the need for
hospitalization, professional therapy or surgery may become favored first-line treatments for certain diseases. At the same time, MCOs may seek to exclude high-cost drugs from
formularies in their efforts to manage and lower their costs.
Exclusion of a product from a formulary or other MCO-implemented restrictions can significantly impact drug usage in the MCO patient population and beyond. Consequently,
pharmaceutical companies compete to gain access to formularies for their products, typically on the basis of unique product features, such as greater efficacy, better patient ease of use, or
fewer side effects, as well as the overall cost of the therapy. We continue to seek to ensure that our major products are included on MCO formularies. However, increasingly our branded
products are being placed on the higher tiers or in a non-preferred status. For additional information, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors—Managed Care Trends section in this Form 10-K.
RAW MA TERIALS
We procure raw materials essential to our business from numerous suppliers worldwide. In general, these materials have been available in sufficient quantities to support our demand and in
many cases are available from multiple suppliers. No significant impact to our operations due to the availability of raw materials is currently anticipated in 2023. However, we are seeing an
increase in overall demand in the industry for certain components and raw materials, which could potentially result in constraining available supply leading to a possible future impact on our
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 9
business. We are continuing to monitor and implement mitigation strategies in an effort to reduce any potential risk or impact, including active supplier management, qualification of
additional suppliers and advanced purchasing to the extent possible.
GOVERNMENT REGULA TION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS
We are subject to extensive regulation by government authorities in the countries in which we do business. This includes laws and regulations governing the operations of
biopharmaceutical companies, such as the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products, pricing (including discounts and rebates) and data privacy, among others. These laws and
regulations may require administrative guidance for implementation, and a failure to comply could subject us to legal and/or administrative actions. Enforcement measures may include
substantial fines and/or penalties, orders to stop non-compliant activities, criminal charges, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, delays in product approvals, exclusion from
participation in government programs or contracts as well as limitations on conducting business in applicable jurisdictions, and could result in harm to our reputation and business. For
additional information, see Note 16A. Compliance with these laws and regulations may be costly, and may require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure
compliance. While capital expenditures or operating costs for compliance with government regulations cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not currently anticipate they will have a
material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position.
In the United States
Drug and Biologic Regulation. The FDA, pursuant to the FFDCA, the Public Health Service Act and other federal statutes and regulations, extensively regulates pre- and post-marketing
activities related to our biopharmaceutical products. The regulations govern areas such as the safety and efficacy of medicines and vaccines, clinical trials, advertising and promotion,
quality control, manufacturing, labeling, distribution, post-marketing safety surveillance and reporting, and record keeping. Other U.S. federal agencies, including the DEA, also regulate
certain of our products and activities.
For a biopharmaceutical company to market a drug or a biologic product, including vaccines, in the U.S., the FDA must evaluate whether the product is safe and effective for its intended
use. If the FDA determines that the drug or biologic is safe and effective, the FDA will approve the product’s NDA or BLA (or supplemental NDA or supplemental BLA), as appropriate.
A drug or biologic may be subject to postmarketing commitments, which are studies or clinical trials that the product sponsor agrees to conduct, or postmarketing requirements, which are
studies or clinical trials that are required as a condition of approval. In addition, we are also required to report adverse events and comply with cGMP (the FDA regulations that govern all
aspects of manufacturing quality for pharmaceuticals) and the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (the law that, among other things, sets forth requirements related to product tracing, product
identifiers and verification for manufacturers, wholesale distributors, repackagers and dispensers to facilitate the tracing of product through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain), as
well as advertising and promotion regulations. For additional information, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors—Development, Regulatory Approval and Marketing of Products and —Post-
Authorization/Approval Data sections in this Form 10-K.
In the context of public health emergencies, like the COVID-19 pandemic, we may apply to the FDA for an EUA, which, if granted, allows for the distribution and use of our products during
the declared emergency, in accordance with the conditions set forth in the EUA, unless the EUA is terminated by the government. Although the criteria for an EUA differ from the criteria for
approval of an NDA or BLA, EUAs nevertheless require the development and submission of data to satisfy the relevant FDA standards, and a number of ongoing obligations. The FDA
generally expects EUA holders to work toward submission of full applications, such as a BLA or an NDA, as soon as possible.
Biosimilar Regulation. The FDA is responsible for approval of biosimilars. Innovator biologics, or reference products, are entitled to 12 years exclusivity. Applications for biosimilars may not
be submitted until four years after the date on which the reference product was first licensed and may not be approved until 12 years after the reference product was first licensed.
Sales and Marketing Regulations. Our marketing practices are subject to state laws, as well as federal laws, such as the Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, intended to prevent
fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits corruptly soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying anything of value to generate business. The False Claims Act
generally prohibits anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, any claims for payment for goods or services, including to government payers, such as
Medicare and Medicaid, that are false or fraudulent and generally treat claims generated through kickbacks as false or fraudulent. The federal government and states also regulate sales
and marketing activities and financial interactions between manufacturers and healthcare providers, requiring disclosure to government authorities and the public of such interactions, and
the adoption of compliance standards or programs. State attorneys general have also taken action to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false
advertising laws.
Pricing, Reimbursement and Access Regulations. Pricing and reimbursement for our products depend in part on government regulation. Any significant efforts at the federal or state levels to
reform the healthcare system by changing the way healthcare is provided or funded or more directly impose controls on drug pricing, government reimbursement, and access to medicines
and vaccines on public and private insurance plans could have a material impact on us.
In addition, in order to have our products covered by Medicaid, we must offer discounts or rebates on purchases of pharmaceutical products under various federal and state programs. We
also must report specific prices to government agencies. The calculations necessary to determine the prices reported are complex and the failure to do so accurately may expose us to
enforcement measures. See the discussion regarding rebates in the Revenue Deductions section within MD&A and Note 1G.
Government and private payers routinely seek to manage utilization and control the costs of our products, and there is considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical
pricing. Efforts by states and the federal government to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including proposed actions to facilitate drug importation, limit reimbursement
to lower international reference prices, require deep discounts, and require manufacturers to report and make public price increases and sometimes a written justification for the increase,
could adversely affect our business if implemented. We expect to see continued focus by Congress and the Biden Administration on regulating pricing, which could result in legislative and
regulatory changes designed to control costs. For example, in August 2022, the IRA was signed into law, which, among other things, requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in
price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023), and
replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). We continue to evaluate the impact of the IRA on our business, operations and
financial condition and results as the full effect of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain. In addition, changes to the Medicaid program or the federal
340B drug pricing program, which imposes ceilings on prices that drug manufacturers can charge for medications sold to certain health care facilities, could have a material impact on our
business. For example,
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 10
certain changes finalized by the CMS in December 2020 for the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program may increase our Medicaid liability, including for drugs that are considered to be “new
formulations” of existing drugs. Additional changes to the 340B program are undergoing review and their status is unclear. In 2022, we implemented a policy that will help improve contract
pharmacy integrity. The HHS has sent letters to numerous manufacturers that have also implemented contract pharmacy integrity initiatives expressing the view that their programs are in
violation of the 340B statute, and referring those programs for potential enforcement action. Several manufacturers have challenged HHS’s enforcement letters in federal court and litigation
is ongoing in those cases. We believe that our program is consistent with the statute. Additional legal or legislative developments at the federal or state level with respect to the 340B
program may have an adverse impact on our integrity initiative, and we may face enforcement action or penalties, depending upon such developments. For additional information, see the
Item 1A. Risk Factors—Pricing and Reimbursement section in this Form 10-K.
A majority of states use preferred drug lists to manage access to pharmaceutical products under Medicaid, including some of our products. For example, access to our products under the
Medicaid managed care programs typically is determined by the health plans with which state Medicaid agencies contract to provide services to beneficiaries. States seek to control
healthcare costs related to Medicaid and other state healthcare programs, including the implementation of supplemental rebate agreements under the Medicaid drug rebate program tied to
patient outcomes. States’ budgets were impacted less by the COVID-19 pandemic than expected and are generally growing. However, we expect states will continue to seek cost cutting
within Medicaid, which may focus on managed care capitation payments and/or formulary management. States may also advance drug-pricing initiatives with a focus on affordability review
boards, financial penalties related to pricing practices, manufacturer pricing and reporting requirements, as well as regulation of prescription drug assistance, copay accumulator, or copay
maximizer programs in the commercial market. Payers may promote generic drugs and biosimilars more aggressively to generate savings and attempt to stimulate additional price
competition. In addition, we expect that consolidation and integration among pharmacy chains, wholesalers and PBMs will increase pricing pressures in the industry. For additional
information, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors—Managed Care Trends section in this Form 10-K.
Anti-Corruption. The FCPA prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government
staff member, political party or political candidate to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries.
Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations.
Data Privacy. The collection and use of personal data by us is increasingly important to our business and is subject to various federal and state privacy and data security laws and
regulations, including oversight by various regulatory and other governmental bodies. Such laws and regulations continue to evolve and are increasingly being enforced vigorously.
Outside the United States
New Drug Approvals. In the EU, the EMA conducts the scientific evaluation, supervision and safety monitoring of our innovative medicinal products, and employs a centralized procedure for
approval for the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA) countries. In the U.K., the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency is the sole regulatory authority. In Japan, the
Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device Agency is involved in a wide range of regulatory activities, including clinical studies, approvals, post-marketing reviews and pharmaceutical safety. In
China, the National Medical Product Administration is the primary regulatory authority for approving and supervising medicines. Health authorities in many middle- and lower-income
countries require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority (e.g., the FDA or EMA) before they begin to conduct their application review process and/or issue their final
approval.
Pharmacovigilance. In the EU, the EMA’s PRAC is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations on product safety issues. Outside developed markets, pharmacovigilance
requirements vary and are generally not as extensive, but there is a trend toward increasing regulation.
Pricing and Reimbursement. Certain governments, including in the different EU member states, the U.K., Japan, China, Canada and South Korea, provide healthcare at low-to-zero direct
cost to consumers at the point of care and have significant power to regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored
healthcare system, particularly under recent global financing pressures. Governments globally may use a variety of measures to control costs, including, among others, proposing price
reform or legislation, cross country collaboration and procurement, price cuts, mandatory rebates, health technology assessments, forced localization as a condition of market access,
“international reference pricing” (i.e., the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries), QCE processes and VBP. In addition, the international
patchwork of price regulation, differing economic conditions and incomplete value assessments across countries has led to varying access to quality medicines in many markets and some
third-party trade in our products between countries. Several important multilateral organizations such as the World Health Organization are increasing scrutiny of international
pharmaceutical pricing through policy recommendations and sponsorship of programs, such as “The Oslo Medicines Initiative” which aims to ensure “affordability for high-priced medicines”.
In November 2020, the EC published its Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe which envisions a broad range of new initiatives and legislation including a significant focus on tackling the
persisting inequalities on access, affordability and availability of medicines across the EU.
In China, pricing pressures have increased in recent years because of an overall focus on healthcare cost containment with the central government emphasizing improved health outcomes
and decreased drug prices as key indicators of progress towards its healthcare reform. For patented products, drug prices have decreased dramatically as a result of adding innovative
drugs (including oncology medicines and orphan drugs) to the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) via access-price negotiation. In the off-patent space, numerous local generics
have been officially deemed bioequivalent under a QCE process that required generic drugs to pass a test to assess their bioequivalence to a qualified reference drug (typically the
originator drug). A centralized VBP program—a tendering process where a certain portion of included molecule volumes are guaranteed to tender winners—aims to contain healthcare costs
by driving utilization of generics that have passed QCE. This has resulted in further lowering the price of medicines, especially off-patent medicines; this trend is expected to continue.
Furthermore, the Chinese government has promulgated price bidding rules in June 2022 for enlisting off-patent products (excluding VBP products and certain products directly priced by
government) onto the NRDL with the goal of unifying the reimbursement price between QCE-approved generic medicines and the applicable original medicines. Pfizer, along with most off-
patent originators, have mostly not been successful in the VBP bidding process. The government has indicated that additional post-LOE drugs (including biological products) could be
subjected to VBP qualification in future rounds. Certain of our products, such as Sulperazon and Vfend injectables, are likely to be included in future rounds. While certain details of future
QCE expansion have been made available, we are unable to determine the impact on our business and financial condition until the initiation of these future rounds.
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 11
Healthcare Provider Transparency and Disclosures. Several countries have implemented laws requiring (or industry trade associations have recommended) disclosure of transfers of value
made by pharmaceutical companies to healthcare providers and/or healthcare organizations, such as academic teaching hospitals.
Intellectual Property. Reliable patent protection and enforcement around the world are among the key factors we consider for continued business and R&D investment. The WTO
Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (WTO-TRIPS) requires participant countries to provide patent and other intellectual property-related protection for
pharmaceutical products by law, with a time-limited exemption provided for least-developed countries. While some countries have made improvements, we still face patent grant,
enforcement and other intellectual property challenges in many countries.
While the global intellectual property policy environment has generally improved following implementation of WTO-TRIPS and bilateral/multilateral trade agreements, our growth and ability
to bring new product innovation to patients depends on further progress in intellectual property protection. In certain developed international markets, governments maintain relatively
effective intellectual property policies. However, in the EU, pursuant to the ongoing review of pharmaceutical intellectual property and regulatory incentives, legislative proposals expected to
be introduced in 2023 may result in the reduction of certain protections. In several emerging market countries, governments have used intellectual property policies as a tool to force
innovators to accept less than fair value for medicines, as well as to advance industrial policy and localization goals. The WTO continues to address the role of intellectual property in the
context of the COVID-19 pandemic response. This includes the June 2022 Ministerial Decision on the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, which seeks to
make it easier for certain WTO members to issue a compulsory license on COVID-19 vaccines, and discussions continue on whether to expand that decision to COVID-19 therapeutics and
diagnostics.
Considerable political and economic pressure has weakened current intellectual property protection in some countries and has led to policies such as more restrictive standards for
obtaining patents and more difficult procedures for patenting biopharmaceutical inventions, restrictions on patenting certain types of inventions, revocation of patents, laws or regulations
that promote or provide broad discretion to issue a compulsory license, weak intellectual property enforcement and failure to implement effective regulatory data protection.
Our industry advocacy efforts focus on seeking a fair and transparent business environment for foreign manufacturers, underscoring the importance of strong intellectual property systems
for local innovative industries and helping improve patients’ access to innovative medicines and vaccines.
Data Privacy. Outside of the U.S., many countries have privacy and data security laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personal data, including but not limited to, the
EU’s General Data Protection Regulations and China’s Personal Information Protection Law. The legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is
also rapidly evolving as countries continue to adopt new and updated privacy and data security laws. The interpretation and application of such laws and regulations remain uncertain and
continues to evolve. In addition, enforcement of such laws and regulations is increasing.
ENVIRONMENT AL MATTERS
Our operations are affected by national, state and/or local environmental laws. We have made, and intend to continue to make, the expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable
laws. We also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites. We incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2022 for environmental
compliance purposes and for the clean-up of certain past industrial activity as follows: $88 million in environment-related capital expenditures and $148 million in other environment-related
expenses.
While capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not currently anticipate they will have a material effect on our capital
expenditures or financial position. See also Note 16A3.
As a science guided organization, we take a proactive approach to our environmental sustainability initiatives. In 2022, we announced a new goal to further reduce GHG emissions and
achieve the Science Based Target Initiative’s voluntary Net-Zero Standard by 2040. As part of this goal, Pfizer aims to decrease its GHG emissions by 95% and its value chain emissions by
90% from 2019 levels by 2040. To support our goal, we are developing our emission reduction plan, which will include strategies to achieve reductions throughout our value chain including
investing in new technologies and innovative climate solutions, and urging all of our suppliers to unite with us in making a commitment to action and integrating ambitious climate impact
reduction targets into their management processes. Related expenses and capital spending incurred for 2022 were not material to our consolidated financial statements. While capital and
operational expenditures will be incurred to meet our goal, we do not currently anticipate they will have a material effect on our financial position in the near term. Longer term uncertainties
regarding availability of commercially available technologies among others make it difficult to predict the financial impact of meeting the goal and we will continue to assess and monitor the
financial impact of the emission reduction plan.
For a discussion of the risks associated with climate change and our environmental initiatives, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors—Climate Change and Sustainability section in this Form 10-K.
HUMAN CAPIT AL
Our purpose is: Breakthroughs that change patients’ lives. These breakthroughs are delivered through the relentless collaboration of our talented workforce. As of December 31, 2022, we
employed approximately 83,000 people worldwide, with approximately 32,000 based in the U.S. Women compose approximately 51% of our global workforce, and approximately 37% of our
U.S.-based employees are individuals with ethnically diverse backgrounds.
Our continued success links directly to the commitment, engagement and performance of our employees. It is important that we not only attract and retain the best and brightest diverse
talent, but also ensure they remain engaged and can thrive in an environment that is committed to helping them grow, succeed and contribute directly to achieving our purpose. As part of
these efforts, we strive for an inclusive and empowering work environment, adopting practices to simplify processes and remove needless complexity, rewarding both performance and
leadership skills, fostering career growth and internal mobility and offering competitive compensation and benefits programs that encourage mental and physical well being.
Core Values. To fully realize Pfizer’s purpose we have established a clear set of goals regarding what we need to achieve for patients and how we will go about achieving them. The “how” is
represented by four simple, powerful company values – Courage, Excellence, Equity and Joy.
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 12
Each value defines our company and our culture:
•Courage: Breakthroughs start by challenging convention – especially in the face of uncertainty or adversity. This happens when we think big, speak up and are decisive.
•Excellence: We can only change patients’ lives when we perform at our best together. This happens when we focus on what matters, agree who does what and measure outcomes.
•Equity: Every person deserves to be seen, heard and cared for. This happens when we are inclusive, act with integrity and reduce health care disparities.
•Joy: We give ourselves to our work, and it also gives to us. We find joy when we take pride, recognize one another and have fun.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. At Pfizer, every person deserves to be seen, heard and cared for. We embed diversity, equity and inclusion in our workplace and our purpose of delivering
breakthroughs that change patients’ lives. As we work to bring together people with different backgrounds, perspectives and experiences we take specific actions to help foster an inclusive
environment within Pfizer and beyond, including, among others: (i) building a more inclusive colleague experience through representation and meaningful connections; (ii) advancing
equitable health outcomes by evaluating our work through the lens of the communities we serve, (iii) providing resources on allyship and the science behind inclusion to support all
colleagues in having courageous conversations about equity, race and the avoidance of bias; (iv) working to help transform society with external diversity, equity and inclusion partnerships,
including deploying capital, engaging diverse suppliers and amplifying equity initiatives; and (v) working to help ensure demographics of clinical trials correlate to those of the countries
where trials are taking place.
Colleague Engagement. To attract, develop and inspire the brightest talent, we aim to support our colleagues by engaging and partnering with them to help ensure they feel they are part of
a community. We understand the importance of continuously listening and responding to colleague feedback and our annual engagement survey, Pfizer Pulse, provides a forum for our
colleagues to give structured feedback about their colleague experience. Through this survey, we measure and track key areas of the overall colleague experience and equip leaders with
actionable insights for discussion and follow up. Regular topics in the survey include: (i) employee engagement, such as colleagues’ commitment to and advocacy for Pfizer; (ii) purpose,
including how colleagues’ work connects with our purpose; (iii) inclusion, such as having a climate in which diverse perspectives are valued; and (iv) growth, including the ability for
colleagues to gain new experiences that align with their individual career goals.
In 2022, we continued to maintain low turnover rates relative to the pharmaceutical industry and in our 2022 Pfizer Pulse survey, on average, 88% of colleagues reported feeling engaged,
as measured by pride in working at Pfizer, willingness to recommend Pfizer as a great place to work and intent to stay. In addition, 93% of the colleagues agreed that their daily work
contributes to our purpose.
Performance, Leadership and Growth. We are committed to helping our colleagues reach their full potential by rewarding both their performance and leadership skills and by providing
opportunities for growth and development. Our performance management approach—called Performance and Leadership Insights—is based on six-month semesters during which our
colleagues and their managers set goals, receive feedback and meet to discuss performance. These conversations are meant to help colleagues grow and develop by evaluating
performance (what the colleague achieved, measured by outcomes), leadership (how they achieved it, taking into account Pfizer’s values of courage, excellence, equity and joy), and
identifying areas of growth that help move colleagues towards fulfilling their career goals and their potential.
In 2022, Pfizer continued the shift from a traditional, linear view of career growth to one that is built on aspirations and empowers individuals to boldly own their growth journey. We
deepened our efforts to redefine growth as a fluid process that promotes incremental in-role growth or mobility along horizontal, vertical or diagonal individualized pathways—what we are
calling “Zig-Zag” growth. Our commitments to colleague development consist of specific actions to encourage non-linear “zig-zag” career growth paths for all colleagues, including (i) a
common language around growth—along with a guiding framework—to help colleagues identify their next best growth experience, (ii) tools and resources to encourage growth
conversations and offer transparency on the sources of growth available, and (iii) a variety of opportunities to grow through experiences, connections with others and learning programs,
including mentoring, job rotations, experiential projects, skill-based volunteering and personalized learning pathways that address a variety of topics, including leadership and management
skills and industry- and job-specific learning, as well as general business, manufacturing, finance and technology skills.
Health, Safety and Well-Being. Protecting the health, safety and well-being of colleagues and contingent workers, all of whom are essential to delivering our business objectives, is an
integral part of how we operate. Our Global Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) Policy and supporting standards outline our approach to assessment, evaluation, elimination, and mitigation
of EHS risks across our operations globally. In 2022, we continued to carry out our COVID-19 pandemic preparedness and response procedures to help ensure on-site workers at all of our
locations globally remained safe and healthy. These precautions have been instrumental in protecting our workforce and helping ensure a continued supply of medicines and vaccines to
patients. During 2022, we (i) continued to provide vaccinations for COVID-19 and other diseases to colleagues in countries where employer vaccination programs are permitted, (ii)
broadened our partnership with Thrive Global, a wellness and organizational change initiative with a primary focus on colleague mental health and wellness, (iii) provided educational
webinars and information sessions on mental health and well-being, nutrition and work life balance through our employee assistance program provider, including targeted support for our
colleagues in Russia and Ukraine, and (iv) shared wellness tips through the global Pfizer World intranet platform. In addition, as public health recommendations supported the return of
colleagues to office locations on a more regular basis, Pfizer ensured benefits and processes were in place to reinforce personal wellness and work life balance. For example, beginning in
2023 we are implementing a new, flexible working model that enables work to be regularly conducted from home while maintaining regular on-site collaboration to provide greater flexibility
for many of our colleagues.
Pay Equity. Our commitment to pay equity for all colleagues is based in our value of Equity and our intention to continue to build a diverse and inclusive workforce. We are committed to
equitable pay practices at Pfizer for employees based on role, education, experience, performance, and location and we conduct and report publicly on pay equity on an annual basis.
Additional information regarding our human capital programs and initiatives is available in the “About—Careers” section of Pfizer’s website and our ESG Report.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
This section describes the material risks to our business, which should be considered carefully in addition to the other information in this report and our other filings with the SEC. Investors
should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the following is not meant to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. Additionally,
our business is subject to general risks applicable to any company, such as economic conditions, geopolitical events, extreme weather and natural disasters. If known or unknown risks or
uncertainties materialize, our business operations, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results), cash flows, prospects, reputation or credit ratings
could be adversely affected now and in the future, potentially in a material way. The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements, as discussed in the Forward-
Looking Information and Factors that May Affect Future Results section in this Form 10-K.
RISKS RELA TED T O OUR BUSINESS, INDUSTR Y AND OPERA TIONS:
MANAGED CARE TRENDS
Private payers, such as health plans, and other managed care entities, such as PBMs, continue to take action to manage the utilization and costs of drugs. The negotiating power of MCOs
and other private third-party payers has increased due to consolidation, and they, along with governments, increasingly employ formularies to control costs and encourage utilization of
certain drugs, including through the use of formulary inclusion or favorable formulary placement. These initiatives have increased consumers’ interest and input in medication choices, as
they pay for a larger portion of their prescription costs and may cause them to favor lower-cost generic alternatives. We may fail to obtain or maintain timely or adequate pricing or formulary
placement of our products, or fail to obtain such formulary placement at favorable pricing.
The growing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceutical medicines that treat rare or life-threatening conditions, which typically have smaller patient populations, combined
with their relative higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products, also has generated increased payer interest in developing cost-containment strategies targeted to this
sector.
Third-party payers also use additional measures such as new-to-market blocks, exclusion lists, indication-based pricing and value-based pricing/contracting to improve their cost
containment efforts. Such payers are also increasingly imposing utilization management tools, such as clinical protocols, requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic
product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine. As the U.S. private third-party payer market
consolidates further and as more drugs become available in generic form, we may face greater pricing pressure from private third-party payers as they continue to drive more of their
patients to use lower cost generic alternatives.
Also, business arrangements in this area are subject to a high degree of government scrutiny, and available safe harbors under applicable federal and state fraud and abuse laws are
subject to change through legislative and regulatory action, as well as evolving judicial interpretations. Our approach to these arrangements may also be informed by such government and
industry guidance.
COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS
Competitive product launches may erode future sales of our products, including our existing products and those currently under development, or result in unanticipated product
obsolescence. Such launches continue to occur, and potentially competitive products are in various stages of development. We cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the
introduction of competitive products that treat or prevent diseases and conditions like those treated or prevented by our in-line products and product candidates.
Some of our competitors may have competitive, technical or other advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes or greater experience in particular therapeutic
areas, and consolidation among certain pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can enhance such advantages. These advantages may make it difficult for us to compete with them
successfully to discover, develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or indications they may bring to market. Our products have been
competing and may continue to compete, and our product candidates may compete, against products or product candidates that offer higher rebates or discounts, lower prices, equivalent
or superior efficacy, better safety profiles, easier administration, earlier market availability or other competitive features. If we are unable to compete effectively, this could reduce sales,
which could negatively impact our results of operations.
In addition, competition from manufacturers of generic drugs, including from generic versions of competitors’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity, is a major challenge for our
branded products. Certain of our products have experienced significant generic competition over the last few years. For additional information, see the Item 1. Business—Patents and Other
Intellectual Property Rights section in this Form 10-K. In China, we expect to continue to face intense competition by certain generic manufacturers, which have resulted, and may result in
the future, in price cuts and volume loss of some of our products.
In addition, our patented products may face generic or biosimilar competition before patent exclusivity expires, including from “at-risk” launch (despite pending patent infringement litigation
against the generic or biosimilar product) by a manufacturer of a generic or biosimilar version of one of our patented products. Generic and biosimilar manufacturers have filed or could file
applications with the FDA seeking approval of product candidates that they claim do not infringe our patents or claim that our patents are not valid. Our licensing and collaboration partners
also face challenges by generic drug manufacturers to patents covering products for which we have licenses or co-promotion rights.
We may become subject to competition from biosimilars referencing our biologic products if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for such biosimilars.
We also commercialize biosimilar products that compete with products of others, including other biosimilar products. The entry to the market of competing biosimilars is expected to increase
pricing pressures on our biosimilar products. Uptake of our biosimilars may be lower due to various factors, such as anti-competitive practices, access challenges where our product may
not receive appropriate coverage/reimbursement access or remains in a disadvantaged position relative to an innovator product, physician reluctance to prescribe biosimilars for existing
patients taking the innovative product, or misaligned financial incentives for certain prescribers.
For additional information on competition our products face, see the Item 1. Business—Competition section in this Form 10-K.
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 14
CONCENTRATION
We recorded direct product and/or Alliance revenues of more than $1 billion for each of ten products that collectively accounted for 82% of our total revenues in 2022. In particular,
Comirnaty and Paxlovid together accounted for 57% of our total revenues in 2022. For additional information, see Notes 1 and 17. If these products or any of our other major products were
to experience loss of patent protection (if applicable), changes in prescription or vaccination purchasing or growth rates, reduced product demand, material product liability litigation,
unexpected side effects or safety concerns, regulatory proceedings or investigations, lower governmental and/or regulatory confidence, negative publicity affecting doctor or patient
confidence, pressure from competitive products, changes in labeling, pricing and access pressures or supply shortages or if a new, more effective product should be introduced, the adverse
impact on our revenues could be significant. In particular, certain of our products have experienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few
years, and patents covering a number of our best-selling products are, or have been, the subject of pending legal challenges. For additional information on our patents, see the Item 1.
Business—Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights section in this Form 10-K. For Comirnaty and Paxlovid, while we believe that these products have the potential to provide ongoing
revenue streams for Pfizer for the foreseeable future, revenues of these products following the COVID-19 pandemic may not be at similar levels as those generated during the pandemic.
For 2023, our revenue guidance for Comirnaty and Paxlovid as of January 31, 2023 is significantly lower than the 2022 revenues from these products. For information on risks associated
with Comirnaty and Paxlovid, see the COVID-19 section below.
In addition, we sell our prescription biopharmaceutical products, with the exception of Paxlovid, principally to wholesalers, but we also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government
agencies and pharmacies. In 2022, we principally sold Paxlovid to government agencies. We primarily sell our vaccines in the U.S. directly to the federal government, CDC, wholesalers,
individual provider offices, retail pharmacies and integrated delivery systems. Outside the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines to government and non-government institutions. For additional
information, see Note 17C. If one of our significant customers should encounter financial or other difficulties, it might decrease the amount of business such customer does with us and/or
we might be unable to timely collect all the amounts that such customer owes us or at all, which could negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, we expect that consolidation
and integration of pharmacy chains and wholesalers will increase competitive and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers, including us.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The discovery and development of new products, as well as the development of additional uses for existing products, are necessary for the continued strength of our business. Our product
lines must be replenished over time to offset revenue losses when products lose exclusivity or market share or to respond to healthcare and innovation trends, as well as to provide for
earnings growth, primarily through internal R&D or through collaborations, acquisitions, JVs, licensing or other arrangements. Growth depends in large part on our ability to identify and
develop new products or new indications for existing products that address unmet medical needs and receive reimbursement from payers. However, balancing current growth, investment
for future growth and the delivery of shareholder return remains a major challenge. The costs of product development continue to be high, as are regulatory requirements in many
therapeutic areas, which may affect the number of candidates we are able to fund as well as the sustainability of the R&D portfolio. Decisions made early in the development process of a
drug or vaccine candidate can have a substantial impact on the marketing strategy and payer reimbursement possibilities if the candidate receives regulatory approval. We try to plan
clinical trials prudently and to reasonably anticipate and address challenges, but there is no assurance that an optimal balance between trial conduct, speed and desired outcome will be
achieved.
Additionally, our product candidates can fail at any stage of the R&D process, and may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of R&D. We may fail to correctly identify
indications for which our science is promising or allocate R&D investment resources efficiently, and failure to invest in the right technology platforms, therapeutic areas, product classes,
geographic markets and/or licensing opportunities could adversely impact the productivity of our pipeline. Further, even if we identify areas with the greatest commercial potential, the
scientific approach may not succeed despite the significant investment required for R&D, and the product may not be as competitive as expected because of the highly dynamic market
environment and the hurdles in terms of access and reimbursement. For example, our gene therapy product candidates are based on a novel technology with only a few gene therapies
approved to date, which makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of development and the ability to obtain regulatory approval. Further, gene therapy may face difficulties in gaining the
acceptance of patients or the medical community.
GLOBAL OPERATIONS
We operate on a global scale and could be affected by currency fluctuations; capital and exchange controls; local and global economic conditions including inflation, recession, volatility
and/or lack of liquidity in capital markets; expropriation and other restrictive government actions; changes in intellectual property; legal protections and remedies; trade regulations; tax laws
and regulations; and procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, and marketing of, reimbursement for and access to our products, as well as impacts of political or civil
unrest or military action, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and its economic consequences, geopolitical instability, terrorist activity, unstable governments and legal
systems, inter-governmental disputes, public health outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, natural disasters or disruptions related to climate change.
Some emerging market countries may be particularly vulnerable to periods of financial or political instability or significant currency fluctuations or may have limited resources for healthcare
spending. As a result of these and other factors, our strategy to grow in emerging markets may not be successful, and growth rates in these markets may not be sustainable. Additionally,
local economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of payers, as well as our distributors, customers, suppliers and service providers, to pay for our products, or otherwise to buy
necessary inventory or raw materials, and to perform their obligations under agreements with us.
Government financing and economic pressures can lead to negative pricing pressure in various markets where governments take an active role in setting prices, access criteria (e.g.,
through health technology assessments) or other means of cost control. For additional information on government pricing pressures, see the Item 1. Business—Government Regulation and
Price Constraints section in this Form 10-K.
We continue to monitor the global trade environment and potential trade conflicts and impediments that could impact our business. If trade restrictions or tariffs reduce global economic
activity, potential impacts could include declining sales; increased costs; volatility in foreign exchange rates; a decline in the value of our financial assets and pension plan investments;
required increases of our pension funding obligations; increased government cost control efforts; delays or failures in the performance of customers, suppliers and other third parties on
whom we may depend for the performance of our business; and the risk that our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be adequate.
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 15
We operate in many countries and transact in many different currencies. Changes in the value of those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, or high inflation in those countries, can impact
our revenues, costs and expenses and our financial guidance. Significant portions of our revenues, costs and expenses, as well as our substantial international net assets, are exposed to
exchange rate changes. 58% of our total 2022 revenues were derived from international operations, including 26% from Europe and 20% from Japan, China and the rest of the Asia Pacific
region. Future changes in exchange rates or economic conditions and the impact they may have on our results of operations, financial condition or business are difficult to predict. For
additional information about our exposure to foreign currency risk, see the Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital Resources and Market Risk section within MD&A.
In addition, our borrowing, pension benefit and postretirement benefit obligations and interest-bearing investments are subject to risk from changes in interest and exchange rates. The risks
related to interest-bearing investments and borrowings and the measures we have taken to help contain them are discussed in the Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital
Resources and Market Risk section within MD&A and Note 7E. For additional details on critical accounting estimates and assumptions for our benefit plans, see the Significant Accounting
Policies and Application of Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions—Benefit Plans section within MD&A and Note 11.
PRODUCT MANUFACTURING, SALES AND MARKETING RISKS
We could encounter difficulties, delays or inefficiencies in our supply chain, product manufacturing and distribution networks, as well as sales or marketing, due to regulatory actions, shut-
downs, work stoppages or strikes, approval delays, withdrawals, recalls, penalties, supply disruptions, shortages or stock-outs at our facilities or third-party facilities that we rely on,
reputational harm, the impact to our facilities due to health pandemics or natural or man-made disasters, including as a result of climate change, product liability or unanticipated costs.
Examples of such difficulties or delays include the inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand; challenges related to component materials to maintain supply and/or
appropriate quality standards throughout our supply network and/or comply with applicable regulations; inability to supply certain products due to voluntary product recalls; and supply chain
disruptions at our facilities or at a supplier or vendor. In addition, we engage contract manufacturers, and, from time to time, our contract manufacturers may face difficulties or are unable to
manufacture our products at the necessary quantity or quality levels.
Regulatory agencies periodically inspect our manufacturing facilities, as well as third-party facilities that we rely on, to evaluate compliance with cGMP or other applicable requirements.
Failure to comply with these requirements may subject us to possible legal or regulatory actions, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctions,
debarment, product recalls, delays or denials of product approvals, import bans or denials of import certifications.
In 2021, Pfizer recalled all lots of Chantix in the U.S. due to the presence of a nitrosamine, N-nitroso-varenicline, at or above the FDA interim acceptable intake limit. We currently also have
a voluntary recall across multiple markets and a global pause in shipments of Chantix. Technical solutions are being pursued to reduce nitrosamine levels in Chantix to enable return to
market. In response to requests from various regulatory authorities, manufacturers across the pharmaceutical industry, including Pfizer, are evaluating their product portfolios for the
potential presence or formation of nitrosamines. This has led to additional voluntary recalls initiated for other products in 2022, and may lead to additional recalls or other market actions for
Pfizer products.
COLLABORATIONS AND OTHER RELATIONSHIPS WITH THIRD PARTIES
We depend on third-party collaborators, service providers, and others in the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of our products and product candidates and also
enter into JVs and other business development transactions. To achieve expected longer-term benefits, we may make substantial upfront payments as part of these transactions, which may
negatively impact our earnings or cash flows. We rely heavily on these parties for multiple aspects of our drug development, manufacturing and commercialization activities, but we do not
control many aspects of those activities. We also outsource certain services, including activities related to transaction processing, accounting, IT, manufacturing, clinical trial recruitment and
execution, clinical lab services, non-clinical research, safety services, integrated facilities management and other areas. Failure by one or more of the third-party collaborators, service
providers and others to complete activities on schedule or in accordance with our expectations or to meet their contractual or other obligations to us; failure of one or more of these parties to
comply with applicable laws or regulations; disruptions in one or more of these parties’ businesses, including unexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials or components, cyber-
attacks on supplier systems, labor disputes or shortage and inclement weather, as well as natural or man-made disasters or pandemics; or any disruption in the relationships between us
and these parties, could delay or prevent the development, approval, manufacturing or commercialization of our products and product candidates, expose us to suboptimal quality of service
delivery or deliverables, result in repercussions such as missed deadlines or other timeliness issues, erroneous data and supply disruptions, and could also result in non-compliance with
legal or regulatory requirements or industry standards or subject us to reputational harm, all with potential negative implications for our product pipeline and business. Further, our Alliance
revenues will be adversely affected by the termination or expiration of collaboration and co-promotion agreements that we have entered into and that we may enter into from time to time.
COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS
Our reputation, in-line and pipeline portfolios render our medicines and vaccines prime targets for counterfeiters. Counterfeits pose a significant risk to patient health and safety because of
the conditions under which they are manufactured—often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected, and unsanitary sites—as well as the lack of regulation of their contents. Failure to
mitigate this threat could adversely impact Pfizer’s patients, potentially causing them harm. This situation, in turn, may result in the loss of patient confidence in the Pfizer name and in the
integrity of our medicines and vaccines, and potentially impact our business through lost sales, product recalls, and possible litigation.
The prevalence of counterfeit medicines is an industry-wide issue due to a variety of factors, including the adoption of e-commerce. The increased adoption during the COVID-19 pandemic
further exposed consumers to fake prescription treatments via the internet as access to traditional brick and mortar pharmacies or authorized full-service internet pharmacies that offer
authentic treatments may have been hindered. The internet exposes patients to greater risk as it is a preferred vehicle for dangerous counterfeit offers and scams that target unsuspecting
consumers. Traffic to these generally deceptive pharmacy sites is largely driven by misplaced trust in sophisticated internet retailers and social media offers coupled with the convenience e-
commerce affords consumers. Counterfeiters generally target any medicine or vaccine boasting strong demand and we have observed heightened counterfeit and fraud attempts to our
internal medicine portfolio, as well as products utilized in the treatment of COVID-19.
We consistently invest in an enterprise-wide strategy to aggressively combat counterfeit threats by educating patients and health care providers about the risks, investing in innovative
technologies to detect and disrupt sophisticated internet offers and scams, proactively monitoring and
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 16
interdicting supply with the help of law enforcement, and advising legislators and regulators. However, our efforts and those of others may not be entirely successful, and the presence of
counterfeit medicines may continue to increase.
RISKS RELA TED T O GOVERNMENT REGULA TION AND LEGAL  PROCEEDINGS:
PRICING AND REIMBURSEMENT
U.S. and international governmental regulations that mandate price controls or limitations on patient access to our products or establish prices paid by government entities or programs for
our products impact our business, and our future results could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations or policies. The adoption of restrictive price controls in new jurisdictions,
more restrictive controls in existing jurisdictions or the failure to obtain or maintain timely or adequate pricing could also adversely impact revenue. We expect pricing pressures will continue
globally.
In the U.S., pharmaceutical product pricing is subject to government and public scrutiny and calls for reform, and many of our products are subject to increasing pricing pressures as a
result. We expect to see continued focus by the Federal government on regulating pricing which could result in legislative and regulatory changes designed to control costs. For example, in
August 2022, the IRA was signed into law, which, among other things, requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare, imposes rebates under
Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation, and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program. Some
states have implemented, and others are considering, patient access constraints or cost cutting under the Medicaid program, and some are considering measures that would apply to
broader segments of their populations that are not Medicaid-eligible. State legislatures also have continued to focus on addressing drug costs, generally by increasing price transparency or
limiting drug price increases. Measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including legislation on drug importation, could adversely affect our business. For
additional information on U.S. pricing and reimbursement, see the Item 1. Business—Government Regulation and Price Constraints section in this Form 10-K.
We encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in which we operate. In certain markets, such as in EU member states, the U.K., Japan, China, Canada and
South Korea, governments have significant power as large single payers to regulate prices, access criteria, or impose other means of cost control, particularly as a result of recent global
financing pressures. For example, the QCE and VBP tender process in China has resulted in significant price cuts for off-patent medicines. For additional information regarding these
government initiatives, see the Item 1. Business—Government Regulation and Price Constraints section in this Form 10-K. We anticipate that these and similar initiatives will continue to
increase pricing pressures in China and elsewhere in the future. In addition, in many countries, with respect to our vaccines, we participate in a tender process for selection in national
immunization programs. Failure to secure participation in national immunization programs or to obtain acceptable pricing in the tender process could adversely affect our business. We also
anticipate pricing pressures will be amplified by COVID-19 induced budget deficits and focus on pricing for COVID-19 treatments and vaccines.
U.S. HEALTHCARE REGULATION
The U.S. healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. Any significant efforts at the U.S. federal or state levels to reform the healthcare system by
changing the way healthcare is provided or funded could have a material impact on us. For additional information on U.S. healthcare regulation, see the Item 1. Business––Government
Regulation and Price Constraints section in this Form 10-K.
Other U.S. federal or state legislative or regulatory action and/or policy efforts could adversely affect our business, including, among others, general budget control actions, changes in
patent laws, the importation of prescription drugs to the U.S. at prices that are regulated by foreign governments, revisions to reimbursement of biopharmaceuticals under government
programs that could reference international prices or require new discounts, limitations on interactions with healthcare professionals and other industry stakeholders, or the use of
comparative effectiveness methodologies that could be implemented in a manner that focuses primarily on cost differences and minimizes the therapeutic differences among pharmaceutical
products and restricts access to innovative medicines.
A reduction of U.S. federal spending on entitlement programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, may affect payment for our products or services provided using our products. Any other
significant spending reductions or cost controls affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented could have an adverse impact
on our results of operations.
DEVELOPMENT, REGULATORY APPROVAL AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS
The discovery and development of drugs, vaccines and biological products are time consuming, costly and unpredictable. The outcome is inherently uncertain and involves a high degree of
risk due to the following factors, among others:
•The process from early discovery to design and adequate implementation of clinical trials to regulatory approval can take many years.
•Product candidates can and do fail at any stage of the process, including as the result of unfavorable pre-clinical and clinical trial results, or unfavorable new pre-clinical or clinical data
and further analyses of existing pre-clinical or clinical data, including results that may not support further clinical development of the product candidate or indication.
•We may need to amend our clinical trial protocols or conduct additional clinical trials under certain circumstances, for example, to further assess appropriate dosage or collect additional
safety data.
•We may not be able to meet anticipated pre-clinical or clinical endpoints, commencement and/or completion dates for our pre-clinical or clinical trials, regulatory submission dates,
regulatory approval dates and/or launch dates.
•We may not be able to successfully address all the comments received from regulatory authorities such as the FDA and the EMA, or be able to obtain approval for new products and
indications from regulators.
Regulatory approvals of our products depend on myriad factors, including regulatory determinations as to the product’s safety and efficacy. In the context of public health emergencies like
the COVID-19 pandemic, regulators evaluate various factors and criteria to potentially allow for marketing authorization on an emergency or conditional basis. Additionally, clinical trial and
other product data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments by regulatory authorities. As a result of regulatory interpretations and assessments or other developments that
occur during the review process, and even after a product is authorized or approved for marketing, a product’s commercial potential could be adversely affected by potential emerging
concerns or regulatory decisions regarding or impacting labeling or marketing, manufacturing processes, safety and/or other matters, including decisions relating to emerging developments
regarding potential product impurities.
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 17
We may not be able to receive or maintain favorable recommendations by technical or advisory committees, such as the ACIP or any FDA Advisory Committee that may be convened to
review our applications such as EUAs, NDAs or BLAs, which may impact the potential marketing and use of our products. Further, claims and concerns that may arise regarding the safety
and efficacy of in-line products and product candidates can negatively impact product sales, and potentially lead to product recalls or withdrawals, including regulator-directed risk
evaluations and assessments, and/or consumer fraud, product liability and other litigation and claims. Further regulatory agency requirements may result in a more challenging, expensive
and lengthy regulatory approval process than anticipated due to requests for, among other things, additional or more extensive clinical trials prior to granting approval, or increased post-
approval requirements. For these and other reasons discussed in this Risk Factors section, we may not obtain the approvals we expect within the timeframe we anticipate, or at all.
POST-AUTHORIZATION/APPROVAL DATA
As a condition to granting marketing authorization or approval of a product, the FDA may require additional clinical trials or other studies. The results generated in these trials could result in
the loss of marketing approval, changes in labeling, and/or new or increased concerns about the side effects, efficacy or safety. Regulatory agencies in countries outside the U.S. often have
similar regulations and may impose comparable requirements. Post-marketing studies and clinical trials, whether conducted by us or by others, whether mandated by regulatory agencies or
conducted voluntarily, and other emerging data about products, such as adverse event reports, may also adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products. Further, if
safety or efficacy concerns are raised about a product in the same class as one of our products, those concerns could implicate the entire class; and this, in turn, could have an adverse
impact on the availability or commercial viability of our product(s) as well as other products in the class. The potential regulatory and commercial implications of post-marketing study results
typically cannot immediately be determined. For example, in December 2021, in light of the results from the completed required postmarketing safety study of Xeljanz, ORAL Surveillance
(A3921133), the U.S. label for Xeljanz was revised. In addition, in November 2022, the EMA concluded their assessment of JAK inhibitors authorized for inflammatory diseases in the EU,
including Xeljanz and Cibinqo, and recommended that risk minimization measures, including special warnings and precautions for use, should be revised and harmonized for all such JAK
inhibitors. The resulting label changes are expected to be finalized in the first quarter of 2023. We continue to work with regulatory agencies worldwide to review the full results and analyses
of ORAL Surveillance and their impact on product labeling.
The terms of our EUA for Comirnaty require that we conduct post-observational studies to evaluate the association between the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine, and Pfizer-BioNTech
COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent, and a pre-specified list of adverse events of special interest, including myocarditis and pericarditis, along with deaths and hospitalizations, and severe COVID-
19. The required study populations include individuals specified in our December 2022 authorization letter (reissued) as well as populations of interest, such as healthcare workers, pregnant
women, immunocompromised individuals and subpopulations with specific comorbidities. Additionally, in relation to the FDA approval for Comirnaty, we are required to complete certain
postmarketing study requirements and commitments through 2024 and beyond. The terms of our EUA for Paxlovid require monitoring of a genomic database(s) for the emergence of global
viral variants of SARS-CoV-2 and providing reports to the FDA on a monthly basis summarizing any findings. Also, the FDA may require Pfizer to assess the activity of the authorized
Paxlovid against any global SARS-CoV-2 variant(s) of interest and complete certain other analyses and studies as identified in our October 2022 EUA.
LEGAL MATTERS
We are and may be involved in various legal proceedings, including patent litigation, product liability and other product-related litigation, including personal injury, consumer, off-label
promotion, securities, antitrust and breach of contract claims, commercial and other asserted and unasserted matters, environmental, government and tax investigations, employment, tax
litigation and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and excessive verdicts do occur. Although we
believe that our claims and defenses in matters in which we are a defendant are substantial, we could in the future incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations
regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Claims against our patents include challenges to the coverage and/or validity of our patents on various products or processes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these
matters, and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the product at issue, which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that product and could materially
affect future results of operations.
We are also involved in government investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business. There continues to be a significant volume of government investigations and litigation
against companies operating in our industry, both in the U.S. and around the world. Government investigations and actions could result in substantial criminal and civil fines and/or criminal
charges, limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, corporate integrity or deferred prosecution agreements and other disciplinary actions, as well as reputational
harm, including as a result of increased public interest in the matter. In addition, in a qui tam lawsuit in which the government declines to intervene, the relator may still pursue a suit for the
recovery of civil damages and penalties on behalf of the government.
Our sales and marketing activities, the pricing of our products and other aspects of our business are subject to extensive regulation under the FFDCA, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program,
the FCPA and other federal and state statutes, including those discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, as well as the Anti-Kickback Statute, anti-bribery laws, the False Claims Act, and
similar laws in international jurisdictions. In addition to the potential for changes to relevant laws, the compliance and enforcement landscape is informed by government litigation, settlement
precedent, advisory opinions, and special fraud alerts. Our approach to certain practices may evolve over time in light of these types of developments. Requirements or industry standards
in the U.S. and certain jurisdictions abroad require pharmaceutical manufacturers to track and disclose financial interactions with healthcare professionals and healthcare providers and can
increase government and public scrutiny of such financial interactions. If an interaction is found to be improper, government enforcement actions and penalties could result. Like many
companies in our industry, we have from time-to-time received, and may receive in the future, inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information demands from government authorities.
In addition, we have been subject to claims and other actions related to our business activities, brought by governmental authorities, as well as consumers and private payers. In some
instances, we have incurred significant expense, civil payments, fines and other adverse consequences as a result of these claims, actions and inquiries. Such claims, actions and inquiries
may relate to alleged non-compliance with laws and regulations associated with the dissemination of product (approved and unapproved) information, potentially resulting in government
enforcement action and reputational damage. This risk may be heightened by digital marketing, including social media, mobile applications and blogger outreach.
In connection with the resolution of a U.S. government investigation concerning independent copay assistance organizations that provide financial assistance to Medicare patients, in 2018,
we entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) with the Office of the Inspector General of the HHS, which is effective for a period of five years. In the CIA, we agreed to implement
and/or maintain certain compliance program elements to promote compliance with federal healthcare program requirements. Breaches of the CIA could result in severe sanctions against
us.
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 18
We and certain of our subsidiaries are also subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business relating to legal claims and proceedings, including environmental
contingencies. Amounts recorded for legal and environmental contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on
estimates and assumptions. While we have accrued for worldwide legal liabilities, no guarantee exists that additional costs will not be incurred or additional payments will not be required
beyond the amounts accrued.
For additional information, including information regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved in, see Note 16A.
RISKS RELA TED T O INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY , TECHNOLOGY  AND SECURITY :
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION
Our success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products. We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property, including patent,
trademark, trade dress, copyright, trade secret and domain name protection laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights.
If we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection, we may not be able to prevent third parties from launching generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products,
from using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours. Our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued
patents or be granted on a timely basis. Similarly, any term extensions that we seek may not be granted on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, our issued patents may not contain claims
sufficiently broad to protect us against claims regarding validity, enforceability, scope and effective term made by parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any
competitive advantage, including exclusivity in a particular product area.
Further, legal or regulatory action by various stakeholders or governments could potentially result in us not seeking intellectual property protection for or agreeing not to enforce or being
restricted from enforcing intellectual property related to our products. The WTO continues to address the role of intellectual property in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic response. This
includes the June 2022 Ministerial Decision on the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, which seeks to make it easier for certain WTO members to issue a
compulsory license on COVID-19 vaccines, and discussions continue on whether to expand that decision to COVID-19 therapeutics and diagnostics.
The scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries, as individual countries have distinct patent laws, and our ability to enforce our patents depends on the laws of each
country, its enforcement practices, and the extent to which certain countries engage in policies or practices that weaken a country’s intellectual property framework (e.g., laws or regulations
that promote or provide broad discretion to issue a compulsory license). In countries that provide some form of regulatory exclusivity, mechanisms exist permitting some form of challenge to
our patents by competitors or generic drug marketers prior to or immediately following the expiration of such regulatory exclusivity, and generic companies are employing aggressive
strategies, such as “at risk” launches that challenge our patent rights. Most of the suits involve claims by generic drug manufacturers that patents covering our products, uses, processes or
dosage forms are invalid and/or do not cover the product of the generic or biosimilar drug manufacturer. Independent actions have been filed alleging that our assertions of, or attempts to
enforce, patent rights with respect to certain products constitute unfair competition and/or violations of antitrust laws. Such claims may also be brought as counterclaims to actions we bring
to enforce our patents. We are also party to other patent damages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers, payers, governments or other parties are
seeking damages from us for alleged delay of generic entry. We also are often involved in other proceedings, such as inter partes review, post-grant review, re-examination or opposition
proceedings, before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office, or other foreign counterparts relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of
others. Also, if one of our patents or a competitors’ patents is found to be invalid in such proceedings, generic or biosimilar products could be introduced into the market resulting in the
erosion of sales of our existing products. For additional information, including information regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved, see Note 16A1. Further, if we are
unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property, our operating results and financial condition
could be adversely affected.
We currently hold trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending in many jurisdictions, any of which may be the subject of a governmental or third-party objection, which
could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the trademark. As our products mature, our reliance on our trademarks and trade dress to differentiate us from our competitors increases and,
as a result, our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting, registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe, dilute or otherwise
violate our rights. We seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our employees, consultants, other advisors and other
third parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their relationship with us. Despite these efforts and precautions, we may be
unable to prevent a third-party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization, and legal remedies may not
adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use. Further, others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that
circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise.
THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS
A properly functioning intellectual property regime is essential to our business model. We are committed to respecting the valid intellectual property rights of other companies, but the patent
granting process is imperfect. Accordingly, the pursuit of valid business opportunities may require us to challenge intellectual property rights held by others that we believe were improperly
granted, including challenges through negotiation and litigation, and such challenges may not always be successful.
Part of our business depends upon identifying biosimilar opportunities and launching products to take advantage of those opportunities, which may involve litigation, associated costs and
time delays, and may ultimately not be successful. These opportunities may arise in situations where patent protection of equivalent branded products has expired or been declared invalid,
or where products do not infringe the patents of others. In some circumstances we may take action, such as litigation, asserting that our products do not infringe patents of existing products
or that those patents are invalid or unenforceable in order to achieve a “first-to-market” or early market position for our products.
Third parties may claim that our products infringe one or more patents owned or controlled by them. Claims of intellectual property infringement can be costly and time-consuming to
resolve, may delay or prevent product launches, and may result in significant royalty payments or damages or potential licensing agreements. For example, our R&D in a therapeutic area
may not be first and another company or entity may have obtained relevant patents before us. We are involved in patent-related disputes with third parties over our attempts to market
pharmaceutical products, including related to Comirnaty and Paxlovid. As we expand our mRNA portfolio, such patent-related disputes may increase. Once we have final
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 19
regulatory approval of the related products, we may decide to commercially market these products even though associated legal proceedings (including any appeals) have not been
resolved (i.e., “at-risk” launch). If one of our marketed products (or a product of our collaboration/licensing partners) is found to infringe valid patent rights of a third party, such third party
may be awarded significant damages or royalty payments, or we may be prevented from further sales of that product. Such damages may be enhanced as much as three-fold if we or one
of our subsidiaries is found to have willfully infringed valid patent rights of a third party.
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND SECURITY
Significant disruptions of IT systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our business. We extensively rely upon sophisticated IT systems (including cloud services) to
operate our business. We produce, collect, process, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information (including personal information and intellectual property), and we deploy
and operate an array of technical and procedural controls to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of such confidential information. The Company develops and operates
digital systems to engage patients, healthcare providers, governments, payers and supply chain partners to conduct business and deliver medicines, digital diagnostics, clinical trials and
digital therapies. Such systems include mobile applications, wearable devices, internet websites and other digital technologies that may be targets of attack. We have outsourced significant
elements of our operations, including significant elements of our IT infrastructure and, as a result, we manage relationships with many third-party providers who may or could have access to
our confidential information. We rely on technology developed, supplied and/or maintained by third-parties that may make us vulnerable to “supply chain” style cyber-attacks. Further,
technology and security vulnerabilities of acquisitions, business partners or third-party providers may not be identified during due diligence or soon enough to mitigate exploitation. The size
and complexity of our IT and information security systems, and those of our third-party providers (and the large amounts of confidential information that is present on them), make such
systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by, but not limited to, our employees, contingent workers, service
providers, business partners, customers or malicious attackers. As a global pharmaceutical company, our systems and assets are the target of frequent cyber-attacks. Such cyber-attacks
are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives (including, but not limited to, industrial espionage, extortion, property
destruction and personal information theft) and expertise, including, but not limited to, organized criminal groups, “hacktivists,” nation states, employees, business partners and others. Due
to the nature of some of these attacks, there is a risk that they may remain undetected for a period of time. While we have invested in the protection of data and IT and develop and maintain
systems and controls, our efforts may not prevent service interruptions, extortion, theft of confidential, personal or proprietary information, compromise of data integrity or unauthorized
information disclosure. Any technology service interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss of personal data, confidential
information or intellectual property. Such incidents could require disclosure to government authorities and/or regulators and could require notification to impacted individuals and any incident
could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us. We maintain cyber liability insurance; however, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal,
business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems.
GENERAL  RISKS
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
One enabler of our growth strategy is to expand our in-line products and product pipeline through various forms of business development, which can include alliances, licenses, JVs,
collaborations, equity- or debt-based investments, dispositions, divestments, mergers and acquisitions. The success of our business development activities is dependent on the availability
and accurate evaluation of appropriate opportunities, competition from others that are seeking similar opportunities and our ability to successfully identify, structure and execute
transactions, including the ability to satisfy closing conditions in the anticipated timeframes or at all, and our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and develop and
commercialize acquired products. Pursuing, executing and consummating these transactions may require substantial investment, which may require us to obtain additional equity or debt
financing, which could result in increased leverage and/or a downgrade of our credit ratings. The success of our business development transactions depends on our ability to realize the
anticipated benefits of the transaction and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. Unsuccessful clinical trials, regulatory hurdles and
commercialization challenges may adversely impact revenue and income contribution from acquired products and businesses. We may fail to generate expected revenue growth for an
acquired product or business or we may fail to achieve anticipated cost savings within expected time frames or at all. In certain transactions, we may agree to provide certain transition
services for an extended period of time, which may divert our focus and resources that would otherwise be invested into maintaining or growing our business. Similarly, the accretive impact
anticipated from certain transactions may not be realized or may be delayed. Integration of these products or businesses may result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing
business, including third-party relationships, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. Further, while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities through, among other
things, due diligence, we may be exposed to risks and liabilities as a result of business development transactions. There is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses
or enter into strategic business relationships on favorable terms ahead of our competitors, or that such acquisitions or strategic business development relationships will be accretive to
earnings or improve our competitive position.
Where we invest in or otherwise obtain debt or equity securities of third parties in connection with business development transactions, such as our ownership interest in Haleon, we may be
unable to direct or influence the management, operational decisions and policies of such companies and the value of the acquired securities will fluctuate and may lose value. Any future
distribution or sale of such securities will be subject to prevailing market conditions and other factors, including the size of our ownership stake, at the time of such distribution or sale and
there is no assurance that such securities will ultimately be sold at an attractive price or at all.
COVID-19
COVID-19 has impacted and may continue to impact our business, operations and financial condition and results. COVID-19-related risks and challenges for our business, include, among
others: decreased product demand, due to reduced new prescriptions or refills of existing prescriptions and reduced demand for products used in procedures, or as a result of
unemployment or increased focus on COVID-19 vaccination; impacts due to travel limitations and mobility restrictions in some jurisdictions; manufacturing disruptions and delays; supply
chain disruptions and shortages, including challenges related to reliance on third-party suppliers resulting in reduced availability of materials or components used in the development,
manufacturing, distribution or administration of our products; disruptions to pipeline development and clinical trials, including challenges related to enrolling certain clinical trials and accruing
a sufficient number of cases in certain clinical trials; challenges presented by reallocating resources to assist in responding to COVID-19; costs associated with COVID-19, including
increased supply chain costs and additional R&D costs incurred in our efforts to develop Comirnaty and Paxlovid; challenges related to our business
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 20
development initiatives; interruptions or delays in the operations of regulatory authorities, which may delay potential approval of new products we are developing, potential label expansions
for existing products and the launch of newly-approved products; challenges operating in a virtual or hybrid work environment; increased cyber threats and attack attempts; challenges
related to our intellectual property, both domestically and internationally, including in response to any pressure, or legal or regulatory action by, various stakeholders or governments that
could potentially result in us not seeking intellectual property protection for or agreeing not to enforce or being restricted from enforcing intellectual property rights related to our products,
including Comirnaty and Paxlovid; challenges related to conducting oversight and monitoring of regulated activities in a virtual or hybrid environment; challenges related to our human capital
and talent development; challenges related to vaccine mandates; and other challenges presented by disruptions to our normal operations in response to COVID-19, as well as uncertainties
regarding the impact of COVID-19, and government or regulatory actions to contain the virus or control the supply of medicines and vaccines.
The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business going forward will depend on many factors, and we have made certain assumptions regarding COVID-19 for purposes of our
operational planning and financial projections, including assumptions regarding the global macroeconomic impact of COVID-19, as well as the demand, revenues, supply, contracts and
commercial markets for our COVID-19 products, which remain dynamic. Despite careful tracking and planning, we are unable to accurately predict the extent of the impact of COVID-19 on
our business, operations and financial condition and results due to the uncertainty of future developments. In particular, we believe the ultimate impact on our business, operations and
financial condition and results will be affected by, among other things, the emergence, infectiousness and severity of the predominant strains of the SAR-CoV-2 virus, the safety, efficacy,
availability and public adherence of vaccines, boosters and treatments for COVID-19, proportion of the population that receives a vaccine or treatment for COVID-19, patient demand and
market share for Comirnaty and Paxlovid, timing for delivery, and potential other amendments to the terms, of contracted doses or treatment courses to certain markets, timing and
effectiveness for the expected transition to the commercial market for Comirnaty and Paxlovid, the global macroeconomic impact of COVID-19 and governmental responses or regulatory
actions to contain the virus or control supply of medicines and vaccines. COVID-19 may also affect our business, operations or financial condition and results in a manner that is not
presently known to us or that we currently do not consider as presenting significant risks.
We also face risks and uncertainties related to our efforts to develop and commercialize our COVID-19 products, as well as challenges related to their manufacturing, supply and
distribution, including, among others:
•uncertainties inherent in R&D, including the ability to meet anticipated clinical endpoints, commencement and/or completion dates for clinical trials, regulatory submission dates,
regulatory approval dates and/or launch dates, as well as risks associated with pre-clinical and clinical data (including Phase 1/2/3 or Phase 4 data for Comirnaty, any monovalent,
bivalent or variant-adapted vaccine candidates or any other vaccine candidate in the BNT162 program or Paxlovid or any future COVID-19 treatment) in any of our studies in pediatrics,
adolescents or adults or real world evidence, including the possibility of unfavorable new pre-clinical, clinical or safety data and further analyses of existing pre-clinical, clinical or safety
data or further information regarding the quality of pre-clinical, clinical or safety data, including by audit or inspection;
•the ability to produce comparable clinical or other results for Comirnaty, any monovalent, bivalent or variant-adapted vaccine candidates or other vaccines that may result from the
BNT162 program, Paxlovid or any future COVID-19 treatment or any other COVID-19 program, including the rate of effectiveness and/or efficacy, safety and tolerability profile observed
to date, in additional analyses of the Phase 3 trial for any such products and additional studies, in real-world data studies or in larger, more diverse populations following
commercialization;
•the ability of Comirnaty, any monovalent, bivalent or variant-adapted vaccine candidates or any future vaccine to prevent, or Paxlovid or any future COVID-19 treatment to be effective
against, COVID-19 caused by emerging virus variants;
•the risk that demand for any products may be reduced, no longer exist or not meet expectations, which may lead to excess inventory on-hand and/or in the channel or reduced revenues;
•challenges related to a transition to the commercial market for any of our products;
•uncertainties related to the public’s adherence to vaccines, boosters and treatments;
•the risk that more widespread use of Comirnaty or Paxlovid will lead to new information about efficacy, safety or other developments, including the risk of additional adverse reactions,
some of which may be serious;
•the risk that pre-clinical and clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments, including during the peer review/publication process, in the scientific community
generally, and by regulatory authorities;
•whether and when additional data from the BNT162 mRNA vaccine program, Paxlovid or other COVID-19 programs will be published in scientific journal publications and, if so, when and
with what modifications and interpretations;
•whether regulatory authorities will be satisfied with the design of and results from existing or future pre-clinical and clinical studies;
•whether and when submissions to request emergency use or conditional marketing authorizations for Comirnaty or any future vaccines in additional populations, for a potential booster
dose for Comirnaty, any monovalent or bivalent vaccine candidates or any potential future vaccines (including potential future annual boosters or re-vaccinations), and/or biologics license
and/or EUA applications or amendments to any such applications may be filed in particular jurisdictions for Comirnaty, any monovalent or bivalent vaccine candidates or any other
potential vaccines that may arise from the BNT162 program, including a potential variant-based, higher dose, or bivalent vaccine or any other potential vaccines, and if obtained, whether
or when such EUA or licenses, or existing EUAs, will expire or terminate;
•whether and when submissions to request emergency use or conditional marketing authorizations for Paxlovid or any future COVID-19 treatment and/or any drug applications and/or EUA
applications or amendments to any such applications for any indication for Paxlovid or any future COVID-19 treatment may be filed in particular jurisdictions, and if obtained, whether or
when such EUA or licenses, or existing EUAs, will expire or terminate;
•whether and when any application that may be pending or filed for Comirnaty, any monovalent, bivalent or variant-adapted vaccine candidates or other vaccines that may result from the
BNT162 program, Paxlovid or any future COVID-19 treatment or any other COVID-19 program may be approved by particular regulatory authorities, which will depend on myriad factors,
including making a determination as to whether the vaccine’s or drug’s benefits outweigh its known risks and determination of the vaccine’s or drug’s efficacy and, if approved, whether it
will be commercially successful;
•decisions by regulatory authorities impacting labeling or marketing, manufacturing processes, safety and/or other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of a
vaccine or drug, including the authorization or approval of products or therapies developed by other companies;
•disruptions in the relationships between us and our collaboration partners, clinical trial sites or third-party suppliers, including our relationship with BioNTech;
•the risk that other companies may produce superior or competitive products;
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 21
•risks related to the availability of raw materials to manufacture or test any such products;
•challenges related to our vaccine’s formulation, dosing schedule and attendant storage, distribution and administration requirements, including risks related to storage and handling after
delivery by us;
•challenges and risks related to medication errors such as prescribing or dispensing the wrong strength, improper dosing and self-administration errors;
•the risk that we may not be able to successfully develop other vaccine formulations, booster doses or potential future annual boosters or re-vaccinations or new variant-based or next
generation vaccines or next generation COVID-19 treatments;
•the risk that we may not be able to recoup costs associated with our R&D and manufacturing efforts;
•risks associated with any changes in the way we approach or provide research funding for the BNT162 program, Paxlovid or any other COVID-19 program;
•challenges and risks associated with the pace of our development programs;
•the risk that we may not be able to maintain manufacturing capacity or access to logistics or supply channels commensurate with global demand for our COVID-19 products, which would
negatively impact our ability to supply our COVID-19 products within the projected time periods;
•risks related to our ability to achieve our revenue forecasts for Comirnaty and Paxlovid or any potential future COVID-19 vaccines or treatments;
•whether and when additional supply or purchase agreements will be reached or existing agreements will be completed or renegotiated;
•uncertainties regarding the ability to obtain recommendations from vaccine or treatment advisory or technical committees and other public health authorities and uncertainties regarding
the commercial impact of any such recommendations;
•pricing and access challenges for such products;
•challenges related to public confidence in, or awareness of Comirnaty or Paxlovid, including challenges driven by misinformation or disinformation, access, concerns about clinical data
integrity, or prescriber and pharmacy education;
•uncertainties around future changes to applicable healthcare policies and guidelines issued by the U.S. federal government in connection with the declared termination of the federal
government’s COVID-19 public health emergency as of May 11, 2023;
•trade restrictions;
•the risk that we may owe third-party royalties or have other claims asserted related to Comirnaty or Paxlovid; and
•competitive developments.
CLIMATE CHANGE AND SUSTAINABILITY
Pfizer is subject to transitional and physical risks related to climate change. Transitional risks include, for example, a disorderly global transition away from fossil fuels that may result in
increased energy prices; customer preference for low or no-carbon products; stakeholder pressure to decarbonize assets; or new legal or regulatory requirements that result in new or
expanded carbon pricing, taxes, restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions, and increased greenhouse gas disclosure and transparency. These risks could increase operating costs,
including the cost of our electricity and energy use, or other compliance costs. Physical risks to our operations include water stress and drought; flooding and storm surge; wildfires; extreme
temperatures and storms, which could impact pharmaceutical production, increase costs, or disrupt supply chains of medicines for patients. Our supply chain is likely subject to these same
transitional and physical risks and would likely pass along any increased costs to us. We do not anticipate that these risks will have a material financial impact to the company in the near
term.
In June 2022, Pfizer established our fourth consecutive greenhouse gas reduction goal with new near- and long-term targets to achieve the Science Based Target Initiative’s voluntary Net-
Zero Standard by 2040. While we are working to develop emission reduction plans to achieve our voluntary climate goals, various factors, including the long time horizons and commercial
availability of new technologies to enable the emission reductions, in the time and scale needed, may present inherent risk in our ability to meet these goals. Additionally, success may
depend on the actions of governments and third parties and may require, among other things, significant capital investment; research and development; and government policies and
incentives to foster innovation and reduce costs of technologies that may not currently exist or be available at scale.
Governmental authorities, non-governmental organizations, customers, investors, employees, and other stakeholders are increasingly sensitive to ESG matters, such as equitable access to
medicines and vaccines, product quality and safety, diversity, equity and inclusion, environmental stewardship, support for local communities, value chain environmental and social due
diligence, corporate governance and transparency, and addressing human capital factors in our operations. In addition, governments and the public expect companies like us to report on
our business practices with respect to human rights, responsible sourcing and environmental impact, as well as the actions of our third-party contractors and suppliers around the world.
This focus on ESG matters may lead to new expectations or requirements that could result in increased costs associated with research, development, manufacture, or distribution of our
products. Our ability to compete could also be affected by changing customer preferences and requirements, such as growing demand for companies to establish validated Net Zero targets
or offer more sustainable products. While we strive to improve our ESG performance and meet our voluntary goals, if we do not meet, or are perceived not to meet, our goals or other
stakeholder expectations in key ESG areas, we risk negative stakeholder reaction, including from proxy advisory services, as well as damage to our brand and reputation, reduced demand
for our products or other negative impacts on our business and operations. While we monitor a broad range of ESG matters, we cannot be certain that we will manage such matters
successfully, or that we will successfully meet the expectations of investors, employees, consumers, governments and other stakeholders.
MARKET FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS
Changes in the fair value of certain equity investments need to be recognized in net income that may result in increased volatility of our income. For additional information, see Note 4 and
the Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital Resources and Market Risk section within MD&A.
Our pension benefit obligations and postretirement benefit obligations are subject to volatility from changes in the fair value of equity investments and other investment risk in the assets
funding these plans. For additional information, see the Significant Accounting Policies and Application of Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions—Benefit Plans section within
MD&A and Note 11.
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 22
COST AND EXPENSE CONTROL AND NONORDINARY EVENTS
Growth in costs and expenses, changes in product and geographic mix and the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings, internal reorganizations, product withdrawals, recalls and
other unusual events that could result from evolving business strategies, evaluation of asset realization and organizational restructuring could adversely affect future results. Such risks and
uncertainties include, in particular, our ability to realize the projected benefits of our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives, other corporate strategic initiatives and any acquisitions,
divestitures or other initiatives, as well as potential disruption of ongoing business.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS, GOODWILL AND EQUITY-METHOD INVESTMENTS
Our consolidated balance sheet contains significant amounts of intangible assets, including IPR&D and goodwill. For IPR&D assets, the risk of failure is significant, and there can be no
certainty that these assets ultimately will yield successful products. Our ability to realize value on these significant investments is often contingent upon, among other things, regulatory
approvals and market acceptance. As such, IPR&D assets may become impaired and/or be written off in the future if the associated R&D effort is abandoned or is curtailed. For goodwill, all
reporting units can confront events and circumstances that can lead to a goodwill impairment charge such as, among other things, unanticipated competition, an adverse action or
assessment by a regulator, a significant adverse change in legal matters or in the business climate and/or a failure to replace the contributions of products that lose exclusivity. Our other
intangible assets, including developed technology rights and brands, face similar risks for impairment. Our equity-method investments may also be subject to impairment charges that may
result from the occurrence of unexpected adverse events or management decisions that impact our estimates of expected cash flows to be generated from these investments. We may
recognize impairment charges as a result of a weak economic environment, events related to particular customers or asset types, challenging market conditions or decisions by
management. Any such impairment charge of our intangible assets, goodwill and equity-method investments may be significant. For additional details, see the Significant Accounting
Policies and Application of Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions—Asset Impairments section within MD&A.
CHANGES IN LAWS AND ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Our future results could be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation, including, among others, changes in accounting standards, tax laws and regulations
internationally and in the U.S. (including, among other things, the recently enacted IRA, changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation, including, among others, the adoption of
global minimum taxation requirements outside the U.S. and potential changes to existing tax law by the current U.S. Presidential administration and Congress), competition laws, privacy
laws and environmental laws in the U.S. and other countries. For additional information on changes in tax laws or rates or accounting standards, see the Provision/(Benefit) for Taxes on
Income and New Accounting Standards sections within MD&A and Note 1B.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
We own and lease space globally for sales and marketing, customer service, regulatory compliance, R&D, manufacturing and distribution and corporate enabling functions. In many
locations, our business and operations are co-located to achieve synergy and operational efficiencies. Our global headquarters are located in New York City. In February 2023, we relocated
our global headquarters to the Spiral, an office building in the Hudson Yards neighborhood of New York City. We continue to advance our global workplace strategy to provide workplaces
that enable collaboration and foster innovation. As of December 31, 2022, we had 301 owned and leased properties, amounting to approximately 40 million square feet.
Our PGS division is headquartered in various locations, with leadership teams primarily in New York City and in Peapack, New Jersey. As of December 31, 2022, PGS had responsibility for
36 plants around the world, which manufacture products for our commercial divisions, including in Belgium, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Singapore and the U.S. Our PGS division
expects to exit the Perth, Australia site in early 2023. PGS also operates multiple distribution facilities around the world.
In general, we believe that our properties, including the principal properties described above, are well-maintained, adequate and suitable for their current requirements and for our
operations in the foreseeable future. See Note 9 for amounts invested in land, buildings and equipment.
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Certain legal proceedings in which we are involved are discussed in Note 16A.

References to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. Although foreign exchange rate changes are part of our
business, they are not within our control and since they can mask positive or negative trends in the business, we believe presenting operational variances excluding these foreign exchange
changes provides useful information to evaluate our results.
Our Business and Strategy ––Pfizer Inc. is a research-based, global biopharmaceutical company. We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend
and significantly improve their lives. See the Item 1. Business––About Pfizer section in this Form 10-K. Pfizer is committed to working towards equitable and affordable access to our
medicines and vaccines for people around the world. As a science-driven global biopharmaceutical company, we remain focused on advancing our pipeline, supporting our marketed brands
and deploying capital responsibly, with a focus on initiatives that can help contribute to our long-term revenue and future growth. Our ability to fulfill our purpose, Breakthroughs that change
patients’ lives, remains a core focus and underscores our commitment to addressing the needs of society to help sustain long-term value creation for all stakeholders. Most of our revenues
come from the manufacture and sale of biopharmaceutical products. We believe that our medicines and vaccines provide significant value for healthcare providers and patients and seek to
enhance their value by continuously evaluating how we can best collaborate with patients, physicians and payers to support and expand patient access to reliable, affordable healthcare
around the world. In addition, we continually seek to expand and broaden our product portfolio offerings through prioritized development of our pipeline and acquisitions targeted at critical
unmet patient needs. As a result, our commercial organizational structure and R&D operations are critical to the successful execution of our business strategy. In 2023, we are making
additional investments in both R&D and SI&A to support Pfizer’s near- and longer-term growth plans, including to support anticipated new launches, commercial launch of COVID-19
products, potential high-value pipeline programs and recently acquired assets.
With the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019, the spin-off of our former Upjohn Business in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the sale of our Meridian subsidiary in the fourth
quarter of 2021, Pfizer transformed into a more focused, global leader in science-based innovative medicines and vaccines engaged in the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing,
sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we began managing our commercial operations through a global structure consisting of two
operating segments: Biopharma and PC1. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. See Note 1A and Item 1. Business––Commercial Operations in this Form 10-K for additional
information. We expect to incur costs of approximately $700 million in connection with separating Upjohn, of which approximately 85% has been incurred since inception and through
December 31, 2022. These charges include costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and transaction costs.
Beginning in 2019, we took action through our Transforming to a More Focused Company restructuring program to ensure our cost base and support model aligned appropriately with our
operating structure. In the third quarter of 2022, we made several organizational changes to further transform our operations to better leverage our expertise in certain areas and in
anticipation of potential future new product or indication launches, and in the fourth quarter of 2022, we began taking steps to optimize our end-to-end R&D operations to reduce costs and
cycle times as well as to further prioritize our internal R&D portfolio in areas where our capabilities are differentiated while increasing external innovation efforts to leverage an expanding
and productive biotech sector. See Note 3 for additional information. For a description of savings related to this
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 26
program, see the Costs and Expenses––Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives section of this MD&A.
R&D: We believe we have a strong pipeline and are well-positioned for future growth. R&D is at the heart of fulfilling our purpose to deliver breakthroughs that change patients’ lives as we
work to translate advanced science and technologies into the therapies that may be the most impactful for patients. Innovation, drug discovery and development are critical to our success.
In addition to discovering and developing new products, our R&D efforts seek to add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness and ease of dosing and by discovering
potential new indications. See the Item 1. Business—Research and Development section in this Form 10-K for our R&D priorities and strategy.
We seek to leverage a strong pipeline, organize around expected operational growth drivers and capitalize on trends creating long-term growth opportunities, including:
•an aging global population that is generating increased demand for innovative medicines and vaccines that address patients’ unmet needs; and
•advances in both biological science and platform technologies that are enhancing the delivery of breakthrough new medicines and vaccines.
Our Business Development Initiatives ––We are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product pipeline and maximizing the
value of our existing products, but also through various business development activities. We view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies and seek to generate
growth by pursuing opportunities and transactions that have the potential to strengthen our business and our capabilities. We assess our business, assets and scientific capabilities/portfolio
as part of our regular, ongoing portfolio review process and also continue to consider business development activities that will help advance our business strategy.
For additional information, including discussion of recent significant business development activities, see Note 2.
Our 2022 Performance
Revenues––Revenues increased $19.0 billion, or 23%, to $100.3 billion in 2022 from $81.3 billion in 2021, reflecting an operational increase of $24.6 billion, or 30%, as well as an
unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $5.5 billion, or 7%. The operational increase was primarily driven by growth from Paxlovid and Comirnaty.
Excluding the impact of Paxlovid and Comirnaty, revenues increased 2% operationally, reflecting strong growth in the Prevnar family, Eliquis and the Vyndaqel family, as well as revenue
from recently acquired products, Nurtec ODT/Vydura and Oxbryta, partially offset by declines in Xeljanz, Chantix/Champix, Sutent, certain Comirnaty-related manufacturing activities
performed on behalf of BioNTech (which are included in the PC1 contract development and manufacturing organization) and Ibrance.
The following outlines the components of the net change in revenues:
As of January 31, 2023, on a total company basis, we forecasted revenues in 2023 of $67 billion to $71 billion, reflecting an operational decline of 31% at the midpoint from 2022 results,
which we expect will also have an unfavorable impact on Income from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes on income. The total company expected revenue declines in
2023 are driven by an expected reduction in sales of our COVID-19 products, partially offset by expected operational growth from our non-COVID-19 in-line portfolio, anticipated new
product launches, and recently acquired products.
See the Revenues by Geography and Revenues––Selected Product Discussion sections within MD&A for more information, including a discussion of key drivers of our revenue
performance. See also The Global Economic Environment––COVID-19 section below for information about our COVID-19 products, including expectations for 2023. For information
regarding the primary indications or class of certain products, see Note 17C.
Income from Continuing Operations Before Provision/(Benefit) for Taxes on Income––The increase in Income from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes on income of
$10.4 billion, to $34.7 billion in 2022 from $24.3 billion in 2021, was primarily attributable to higher revenues and lower Acquired in-process research and development expenses, partially
offset by (i) an increase in Cost of sales, (ii) net losses on equity securities in 2022 versus net gains on equity securities in 2021, (iii) lower net periodic benefit credits associated with
pension and other postretirement plans, and (iv) increases in Research and development expenses, Selling, informational and administrative expenses, and Restructuring charges and
certain acquisition-related costs.
See the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income within MD&A and Note 4 for additional information. See also The Global Economic Environment––COVID-19 section below for
information about our COVID-19 products, including expectations for 2023.
For information on our tax provision and effective tax rate, see the Provision/(Benefit) for Taxes on Income section within MD&A and Note 5.
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 27
Our Operating Environment ––We, like other businesses in our industry, are subject to certain industry-specific challenges. These include, among others, the topics listed below. See
also the Item 1. Business––Government Regulation and Price Constraints and Item 1A. Risk Factors sections in this Form 10-K.
Regulatory Environment––Pipeline Productivity––Our product lines must be replenished over time to offset revenue losses when products lose exclusivity or market share or to respond to
healthcare and innovation trends, as well as to provide for earnings growth. As a result, we devote considerable resources to our R&D activities which, while essential to our growth,
incorporate a high degree of risk and cost, including whether a particular product candidate or new indication for an in-line product will achieve the desired clinical endpoint or safety profile,
will be approved by regulators or will be successful commercially. Clinical trials are conducted to determine, among other things, whether an investigational drug or device is safe and
effective for a particular patient population. After a product has been approved or authorized and launched, we continue to monitor its safety as long as it is available to patients, including
conducting postmarketing trials, voluntarily or pursuant to a regulatory request. For the entire life of the product, we collect safety data and report safety information to the FDA and other
regulators. Regulatory authorities evaluate potential safety concerns and take any regulatory action deemed necessary and appropriate. Such action(s) may include: updating a product’s
labeling, restricting its use, communicating new safety information or, in rare cases, seeking to suspend or remove a product from the market.
Intellectual Property Rights and Collaboration/Licensing Rights––The loss, expiration or invalidation of intellectual property rights, patent litigation settlements and the expiration of co-
promotion and licensing rights can have a material adverse effect on our revenues. Certain of our products have experienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in
certain markets in the last few years, and we expect certain products to face increased generic competition over the next few years. While additional patent expiries will continue, we expect
a moderate impact of reduced revenues due to patent expiries from 2023 through 2025. We anticipate a more significant impact of reduced revenues from patent expiries in 2026 through
2030 as several of our in-line products experience patent-based expirations. We continue to vigorously defend our patent rights against infringement, and we will continue to support efforts
that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to help ensure appropriate patient access.
For additional information on patent rights we consider most significant to our business as a whole, see the Item 1. Business––Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights section in this
Form 10-K. For a discussion of recent developments with respect to patent litigation, see Note 16A1.
Regulatory Environment/Pricing and Access––Government and Other Payer Group Pressures––The pricing of medicines and vaccines by pharmaceutical manufacturers and the cost of
healthcare, which includes medicines, vaccines, medical services and hospital services, continues to be important to payers, governments, patients, and other stakeholders. Federal and
state governments and private third-party payers in the U.S. continue to take action to manage the utilization of drugs and cost of drugs, including increasingly employing formularies to
control costs by taking into account discounts in connection with decisions about formulary inclusion or favorable formulary placement. We consider a number of factors impacting the
pricing of our medicines and vaccines. Within the U.S., we often engage with patients, doctors and healthcare plans. We also often provide significant discounts from the list price to
insurers, including PBMs and MCOs. The price that patients pay in the U.S. for prescribed medicines and vaccines is ultimately set by healthcare providers and insurers. Governments
globally, as well as private third-party payers in the U.S., may use a variety of measures to control costs, including, among others, proposing pricing reform or legislation, employing
formularies to control costs, cross country collaboration and procurement, price cuts, mandatory rebates, health technology assessments, forced localization as a condition of market
access, “international reference pricing” (i.e., the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries), QCE processes and VBP. We anticipate that these
and similar initiatives will continue to increase pricing and access pressures globally. In the U.S., we expect to see continued focus by Congress and the Biden Administration on regulating
pricing, which could result in legislative and regulatory changes designed to control costs, such as the IRA that was signed into law in August 2022. We continue to evaluate the impact of
the IRA on our business, operations and financial condition and results as the full effect of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain. In addition, changes
to the Medicaid program or the federal 340B drug pricing program, including legal or legislative developments at the federal or state level with respect to the 340B program, could have a
material impact on our business. For additional information, see the Item 1. Business––Pricing Pressures and Managed Care Organizations and ––Government Regulation and Price
Constraints and the Item 1A. Risk Factors––Pricing and Reimbursement sections in this Form 10-K.
Product Supply––We periodically encounter supply delays, disruptions and shortages, including due to voluntary product recalls. In response to requests from various regulatory authorities,
manufacturers across the pharmaceutical industry, including Pfizer, are evaluating their product portfolios for the potential presence or formation of nitrosamines. This has led to recalls,
including our voluntary recall of Chantix in 2021 and additional voluntary recalls initiated for other products in 2022 due to the presence of nitrosamines above the FDA interim acceptable
intake limit, and may lead to additional recalls or other market actions for Pfizer products.
Regarding our supply chain generally, in 2022 and to date, we have not seen a significant disruption, and all of our manufacturing sites globally have continued to operate at or near normal
levels; however, we are seeing an increase in overall demand in the industry for certain components and raw materials, which could potentially result in constraining available supply leading
to a possible future impact on our business. We are continuing to monitor and implement mitigation strategies in an effort to reduce any potential risk or impact including active supplier
management, qualification of additional suppliers and advanced purchasing to the extent possible. For information on risks related to product manufacturing, see the Item 1A. Risk
Factors––Product Manufacturing, Sales and Marketing Risks section in this Form 10-K.
The Global Economic Environment ––In addition to the industry-specific factors discussed above, we, like other businesses of our size and global extent of activities, are exposed to
economic cycles. Certain factors in the global economic environment that may impact our global operations include, among other things, currency fluctuations, capital and exchange
controls, local and global economic conditions including inflation, recession, volatility and/or lack of liquidity in capital markets, expropriation and other restrictive government actions,
changes in intellectual property, legal protections and remedies, trade regulations, tax laws and regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, and
marketing of, reimbursement for and access to our products, as well as impacts of political or civil unrest or military action, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and its
economic consequences, geopolitical instability, terrorist activity, unstable governments and legal systems, inter-governmental disputes, public health outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics,
natural disasters or disruptions related to climate change. Government pressures can lead to negative pricing pressure in various markets where governments take an active role in setting
prices, access criteria or other means of cost control. For additional information on risks related to our global operations, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors—Global Operations section in this
Form 10-K.
COVID-19––In response to COVID-19, we have developed Paxlovid and collaborated with BioNTech to jointly develop Comirnaty, including booster doses of an Omicron-adapted bivalent
vaccine. As part of our strategy for COVID-19, we are continuing to make significant additional
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 28
investments in breakthrough science and global manufacturing. This includes continuing to evaluate Comirnaty and Paxlovid, including against new variants of concern, developing
monovalent, bivalent and variant adapted vaccine candidates and booster doses and developing potential combination respiratory vaccines and potential next generation vaccines and
therapies. We are also evaluating Paxlovid for additional populations. For additional information, including our continuing late-stage development efforts for Paxlovid, see the Product
Developments section within MD&A.
In 2022 and to date, we principally sold Comirnaty and Paxlovid globally under government contracts. We expect sales of Comirnaty in the U.S. will transition to traditional commercial
market sales in the second half of 2023, triggered by the expiration of current contracts and the vaccines purchased through them becoming either depleted or not usable against new
variants. Internationally, we expect sales of Comirnaty in international developed markets to generally be under government contracts in 2023, and in emerging markets, under a
combination of private channels and government contracts; in both cases, we expect to generally transition to commercial markets starting in 2024. For Paxlovid, we expect 2023 to be a
transitional year as we expect to start selling Paxlovid through the commercial channels in the second half of 2023 rather than significant government purchases. We also remain committed
to helping ensure broad and equitable access to our COVID-19 products to eligible patients around the world. Revenues from our COVID-19 products are expected to go from their peak in
2022 to their low point in 2023 before potentially returning to growth in 2024. While patient demand for our COVID-19 products is expected to remain strong throughout 2023, much of that
demand is expected to be fulfilled by existing supply of products that were delivered to governments and recorded as revenues in 2022. As of January 31, 2023, we forecasted Comirnaty
revenues of approximately $13.5 billion in 2023, down 64% from actual 2022 results, with gross profit to be split evenly with BioNTech, and Paxlovid revenues of approximately $8 billion in
2023, down 58% from actual 2022 results. Guidance for both products includes, among other things, anticipated sales through traditional commercial markets in the U.S. in the second half
of 2023 and assumes prior absorption of existing government supply from advanced purchase agreements from 2022. These forecasts are based on estimates and assumptions that are
subject to significant uncertainties, including, among others, patient demand which could be significantly impacted by the infectiousness and severity of the predominant strains of the SAR-
CoV-2 virus during 2023, proportion of the population that receives a vaccine or is treated with an oral antiviral treatment, the number of doses per vaccinated person per year, number of
symptomatic infections, market share of Comirnaty and Paxlovid, timing and terms for delivery of the contracted doses of Comirnaty to the EC, Paxlovid sales to China and the timing for
transitioning Comirnaty and Paxlovid sales to the commercial market in the U.S.
In addition to our introduction of Comirnaty and Paxlovid, COVID-19 has impacted our business, operations and financial condition and results. For example, COVID-19 had varying impacts
on patient visits, vaccinations, elective surgeries, cancer screenings and routine testing, which affected prescriptions or refills of existing prescriptions and demand for products used in
procedures. As part of our on-going monitoring and assessment, we have made certain assumptions regarding COVID-19 for purposes of our operational planning and financial projections,
including assumptions regarding the global macroeconomic impact of COVID-19, as well as the demand, revenues, supply, contracts and commercial markets for our COVID-19 products,
which remain dynamic. Despite careful tracking and planning, we are unable to accurately predict the extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business, operations and financial condition
and results due to the uncertainty of future developments. We will continue to pursue efforts to maintain the continuity of our operations while monitoring for new developments related to
COVID-19. Future developments could result in additional favorable or unfavorable impacts on our business, operations or financial condition and results. For information on risks
associated with COVID-19 and our COVID-19 products, as well as COVID-19 intellectual property disputes, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors—COVID-19, —Intellectual Property Protection
and ––Third-Party Intellectual Property Claims sections in this Form 10-K and Note 16A1.
Russia/Ukraine Conflict––Our global operations may be impacted by the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Consistent with our commitment to putting patients first, we are
maintaining the supply of medicines to Russia, including the provision of needed medicines to patients already enrolled in clinical trials. Effective March 14, 2022, Pfizer began donating
profits of our Russian subsidiary to causes that provide direct humanitarian support to the people of Ukraine, in addition to our ongoing efforts to support the humanitarian response in the
region. In 2022, we have donated approximately $25 million to support humanitarian relief and response efforts. We will continue to support Ukrainian relief efforts through this method until
peace is achieved. Additionally, we are not initiating new clinical trials in Russia, have stopped recruiting new patients in our ongoing clinical trials in the country, and halted all new
investments with local suppliers intended to build manufacturing capacity in Russia. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the business of our Russia and Ukraine subsidiaries
represented less than 1% of our consolidated revenues and assets, and while we are monitoring the effects of the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the situation continues to
evolve and the long-term implications, including the broader economic consequences of the conflict, are difficult to predict at this time. While as of now, we do not anticipate any significant
negative impacts on our business from this conflict, continued regional instability, geopolitical shifts, potential additional sanctions and other restrictive measures against Russia, neighboring
countries or allies of Russia, any retaliatory measures taken by Russia, neighboring countries or allies of Russia, and actions by our customers or suppliers in response to such measures
could adversely affect the global macroeconomic environment, our operations, currency exchange rates and financial markets, which could in turn adversely impact our business and results
of operations.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND APPLICA TION OF CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING ESTIMA TES AND ASSUMPTIONS
Following is a discussion about the critical accounting estimates and assumptions impacting our consolidated financial statements. Also, see Note 1C.
For a description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1. Of these policies, the following are considered critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as
they require the application of the most subjective and the most complex judgments: Acquisitions (Note 1D); Fair Value (Note 1E); Revenues (Note 1G); Asset Impairments (Note 1M); Tax
Assets and Liabilities and Income Tax Contingencies (Note 1Q); Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans (Note 1R); and Legal and Environmental Contingencies (Note 1S).
For a discussion of a recently adopted accounting standard, see Note 1B.
Acquisitions
We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at
their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date. To estimate fair value, we utilize an exit price approach from the perspective of a market participant. For further detail on acquisition
accounting, see Note 1D. For further detail on the techniques and methodologies that we use to estimate fair value, see Note 1E. Historically, intangible assets have been the most
significant fair values within our business combinations. We utilize an income approach to estimate the acquisition date fair value of intangible assets. Some of
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 29
the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include the amount and timing of projected net cash flows, the discount rate and the tax rate. For further
information on our process to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, see Asset Impairments below. We estimate the fair value of acquired inventory, including finished goods and work
in process, by determining the estimated selling price when completed, less an estimate of costs to be incurred to complete and sell the inventory, and an estimate of a reasonable profit
allowance for those manufacturing and selling efforts. The fair value of inventory is recognized in our results of operations as the inventory is sold. Some of the more significant estimates
and assumptions inherent in the estimate of the fair value of inventory include stage of completion, costs to complete, costs to dispose and selling price.
Revenues
Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized. Such variable
consideration represents chargebacks, rebates, sales allowances and sales returns. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment
are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period. Historically, adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual results or updated
expectations, have not been material to our overall business and generally have been less than 1% of revenues. Product-specific rebates, however, can have a significant impact on year-
over-year individual product revenue growth trends. If any of our ratios, factors, assessments, experiences or judgments are not indicative or accurate estimates of our future experience,
our results could be materially affected. The potential of our estimates to vary (sensitivity) differs by program, product, type of customer and geographic location. However, estimates
associated with U.S. Medicare, Medicaid and performance-based contract rebates are most at risk for material adjustment because of the extensive time delay between the recording of the
accrual and its ultimate settlement, an interval that can generally range up to one year. Because of this lag, our recording of adjustments to reflect actual amounts can incorporate revisions
of several prior quarters. Rebate accruals are product specific and, therefore for any period, are impacted by the mix of products sold as well as the forecasted channel mix for each
individual product. For further information, see the Revenue Deductions section within MD&A and Note 1G.
Asset Impairments
We review all of our long-lived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year. We perform impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill at least annually and for
all other long-lived assets whenever impairment indicators are present. When necessary, we record charges for impairments of long-lived assets for the amount by which the fair value is
less than the carrying value of these assets. Our impairment review processes are described in Note 1M.
Examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairment include:
•A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset. For example, a successful challenge of our patent rights would likely result
in generic competition earlier than expected.
•A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used such as a restriction imposed by the FDA or other regulatory authorities that could affect our ability to
manufacture or sell a product.
•An expectation of losses or reduced profits associated with an asset. This could result, for example, from a change in a government reimbursement program that results in an inability to
sustain projected product revenues and profitability. This also could result from the introduction of a competitor’s product that impacts projected revenue growth, as well as the lack of
acceptance of a product by patients, physicians and payers. For IPR&D projects, this could result from, among other things, a change in outlook based on clinical trial data, a delay in the
projected launch date or additional expenditures to commercialize the product.
Identifiable Intangible Assets––We use an income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of intangible assets, other than goodwill. We start with
a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the asset, which incorporates the consideration of a terminal value for indefinite-lived assets, and then we apply an asset-
specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions that impact our fair value estimates include: the amount and timing of
the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on the projections and the impact of technological advancements and risk
associated with IPR&D assets, as well as the selection of a long-term growth rate; the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows; and the tax
rate, which seeks to incorporate the jurisdictional mix of the projected cash flows.
While all intangible assets other than goodwill can face events and circumstances that can lead to impairment, those that are most at risk of impairment include IPR&D assets
(approximately $11.4 billion as of December 31, 2022) and newly acquired or recently impaired indefinite-lived brand assets. IPR&D assets are high-risk assets, given the uncertain nature
of R&D. Newly acquired and recently impaired indefinite-lived assets are more vulnerable to impairment as the assets are recorded at fair value and are then subsequently measured at the
lower of fair value or carrying value at the end of each reporting period. As such, immediately after acquisition or impairment, even small declines in the outlook for these assets can
negatively impact our ability to recover the carrying value and can result in an impairment charge.
Goodwill––Our goodwill impairment review work as of December 31, 2022 concluded that none of our goodwill was impaired and we do not believe the risk of impairment is significant at
this time, as the fair value of each of our reporting units is significantly higher than their respective net book values.
In our review, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Qualitative factors that we
consider include, for example, macroeconomic and industry conditions, overall financial performance and other relevant entity-specific events. If we conclude that it is more likely than not
that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we then perform a quantitative fair value test.
When we are required to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we typically use the income approach. The income approach is a forward-looking approach to estimating fair value and
relies primarily on internal forecasts. Within the income approach, we use the discounted cash flow method. We start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows for the reporting unit,
which includes the application of a terminal value, and then we apply a reporting unit-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. Some of the more significant estimates
and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of technological risk and competitive, legal
and/or regulatory forces on the projections, as well as the selection of a long-term growth rate; the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows;
and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows.
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 30
For all of our reporting units, there are a number of future events and factors that may impact future results and that could potentially have an impact on the outcome of subsequent goodwill
impairment testing. For a list of these factors, see the Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results and the Item 1A. Risk Factors sections in this Form 10-K.
Benefit Plans
For a description of our different benefit plans, see Note 11.
Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and our judgment regarding future expectations that have been deemed reasonable by management. The judgments made in
determining the costs of our benefit plans can materially impact our results of operations.
The following provides (i) at the end of each year, the expected annual rate of return on plan assets for the following year, (ii) the actual annual rate of return on plan assets achieved in
each year, and (iii) the weighted-average discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations at the end of each year for our U.S. pension plans and our international pension plans:
2022 2021 2020
U.S. Pension Plans
Expected annual rate of return on plan assets 7.5 % 6.3 % 6.8 %
Actual annual rate of return on plan assets (22.4) 9.2 14.1 
Discount rate used to measure the plan obligations 5.4 2.9 2.6 
International Pension Plans
Expected annual rate of return on plan assets 4.5 3.1 3.4 
Actual annual rate of return on plan assets (26.0) 11.4 9.7 
Discount rate used to measure the plan obligations 3.8 1.6 1.5 
For detailed assumptions associated with our benefit plans, see Note 11B.
Expected Annual Rate of Return on Plan Assets––The assumptions for the expected annual rate of return on all of our plan assets reflect our actual historical return experience and our
long-term assessment of forward-looking return expectations by asset classes, which is used to develop a weighted-average expected return based on the implementation of our targeted
asset allocation in our respective plans.
The expected annual rate of return on plan assets for our U.S. plans and international plans is applied to the fair value of plan assets at each year-end and the resulting amount is reflected
in our net periodic benefit costs in the following year.
The following illustrates the sensitivity of net periodic benefit costs to a 50 basis point decline in our assumption for the expected annual rate of return on plan assets, holding all other
assumptions constant (in millions, pre-tax):
Assumption ChangeIncrease in 2023
Net Periodic
Benefit Costs
Expected annual rate of return on plan assets 50 basis point decline $92
The actual return on plan assets resulted in a net loss on our plan assets of approximately $6.3 billion during 2022.
Discount Rate Used to Measure Plan Obligations––The weighted-average discount rate used to measure the plan obligations for our U.S. defined benefit plans is determined at least
annually and evaluated and modified, as required, to reflect the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality fixed income investments, rated AA/Aa or better, that reflect the rates at
which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. The discount rate used to measure the plan obligations for our international plans is determined at least annually by reference to
investment grade corporate bonds, rated AA/Aa or better, including, when there is sufficient data, a yield-curve approach. These discount rate determinations are made in consideration of
local requirements. The measurement of the plan obligations at the end of the year will affect the amount of service cost, interest cost and amortization expense reflected in our net periodic
benefit costs in the following year.
The following illustrates the sensitivity of net periodic benefit costs and benefit obligations to a 10 basis point decline in our assumption for the discount rate, holding all other
assumptions constant (in millions, pre-tax):
Assumption ChangeDecrease in 2023 Net
Periodic Benefit CostsIncrease to 2022
Benefit Obligations
Discount rate 10 basis point decline $6 $248
The change in the discount rates used in measuring our plan obligations as of December 31, 2022 resulted in a decrease in the measurement of our aggregate plan obligations by
approximately $6.6 billion.

The following provides an analysis of the change in worldwide revenues by geographic areas from 2021 to 2022:
(MILLIONS) Worldwide U.S. International
Operational growth/(decline):
Worldwide growth from Paxlovid, Comirnaty, the Prevnar family, Eliquis, the Vyndaqel family, Inlyta and Xtandi, partially

Decline from PC1 (329) (135) (195)
Lower revenues for Chantix/Champix and Sutent:
•The decrease in Chantix/Champix was driven by the ongoing global pause in shipments of Chantix due to the
presence of N-nitroso-varenicline above an acceptable level of intake set by various global regulators, the ultimate
timing for resolution of which may vary by country
•The decrease for Sutent primarily reflects lower volume demand in Europe and the U.S. following its loss of
exclusivity in January 2022 and August 2021, respectively (690) (396) (293)

See the Revenues––Selected Product Discussion within MD&A for additional analysis.
Emerging markets revenues decreased $604 million, or 3%, in 2022 to $20.1 billion from $20.7 billion in 2021, reflecting an operational increase of $366 million, or 2%, and an unfavorable
impact from foreign exchange of approximately 5%. The operational increase in emerging markets revenues was primarily driven by growth from Paxlovid, Sulperazon and Nimenrix,
partially offset by declines in Comirnaty and certain Comirnaty-related manufacturing activities performed on behalf of BioNTech. For an analysis of the change in emerging market revenues
from 2020 to 2021, see the Revenues by Geography section within MD&A in our 2021 Form 10-K.
Revenue Deductions ––Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are
recognized. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions
on gross sales for a reporting period. Historically, adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual results or updated expectations, have not been material to our overall business and
generally have been less than 1% of revenues. Product-specific rebates, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product revenue growth trends.
The following presents information about revenue deductions:

For a discussion of the drivers of change for 2021 v. 2020, see the Costs and Expenses section within MD&A in our 2021 Form 10-K.
Cost of Sales
2022 v. 2021
Cost of sales increased $3.5 billion, primarily due to:
•an unfavorable impact of $4.0 billion due to increased sales of Comirnaty, which includes a charge for the 50% gross profit split with BioNTech and applicable royalty expenses;
•inventory write-offs and other charges related to Paxlovid and Comirnaty of $1.1 billion and $600 million, respectively; and
•an increase of $1.3 billion due to increased sales of Paxlovid,
partially offset by:
•a $3.3 billion favorable impact of foreign exchange and hedging activity.
The decrease in Cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to the favorable impacts of Paxlovid, foreign exchange and higher Alliance revenues, partially offset by higher
sales of Comirnaty, as well as the inventory write-offs and other charges related to Paxlovid and Comirnaty, respectively, discussed above.
Selling, Informational and Administrative Expenses
2022 v. 2021
Selling, informational and administrative expenses increased $974 million, mostly due to:
•an increase of $1.3 billion for Paxlovid and Comirnaty marketing and promotional expenses and a higher provision for U.S. healthcare reform fees based on sales of Paxlovid; and
•an increase of $540 million for marketing and promotional expenses for recently acquired and launched products,
partially offset by:
•a $414 million favorable impact of foreign exchange;
•a $320 million decrease in spending across multiple customer groups; and
•a decrease of $270 million in our liability to be paid to participants of our supplemental savings plan.
Research and Development Expenses
2022 v. 2021
Research and development expenses increased $1.1 billion, primarily due to:
•increased investments of $1.3 billion for certain vaccine and oncology programs as well as costs to develop recently acquired assets, partially offset by lower spending of $480 million for
various late-stage clinical programs and programs to treat COVID-19.
2021 v. 2020
Research and development expenses increased $1.7 billion, mainly due to increased investments of $1.2 billion across multiple therapeutic areas, including additional spending related to
the development of the oral COVID-19 treatment program.(a)

Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 34
Acquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses
2022 v. 2021
Acquired in-process research and development expenses decreased $2.5 billion largely due to:
•a charge of $2.1 billion related to our asset acquisition of Trillium in 2021; and
•an upfront payment to Arvinas and a premium paid on our equity investment in Arvinas totaling $706 million in 2021,
partially offset by:
•acquired IPR&D incurred in 2022, including $426 million related to our asset acquisition of ReViral in 2022.
2021 v. 2020
Acquired in-process research and development expenses increased $2.8 billion mainly due to:
•a $2.1 billion charge related to our asset acquisition of Trillium; and
•a net increase in charges of $602 million for upfront and milestone payments on collaboration and licensing arrangements, driven by payments to Arvinas and Beam.
See Notes 2A, 2D and 2E for additional information.
Amortization of Intangible Assets
2022 v. 2021
Amortization of intangible assets decreased $91 million, primarily due to lower amortization of Comirnaty sales milestones to BioNTech, as well as lower amortization of intangible assets
related to Prevnar and fully amortized assets, partially offset by amortization of intangible assets from our acquisitions of Biohaven and GBT. See Notes 2A and 10A for additional
information.
Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives
Transforming to a More Focused Company Program––For a description of our program and actual costs, see Note 3. The program savings discussed below may be rounded and represent
approximations. In connection with restructuring our corporate enabling functions, we achieved gross cost savings of $1.0 billion, or net cost savings, excluding merit and inflation growth
and certain real estate cost increases, of $700 million, in the two year period from 2021 through 2022. In connection with transforming our commercial go-to market strategy, we expect net
cost savings of $1.4 billion, to be achieved primarily from 2022 through 2024. In connection with manufacturing network optimization, we expect net cost savings of $550 million to be
achieved primarily from 2020 through 2023. In connection with optimizing our end-to-end R&D operations, we expect net cost savings of $2.3 billion to be achieved primarily from 2023
through 2025.
Certain qualifying costs for this program were recorded in 2022, 2021 and 2020, and are reflected as Certain Significant Items and excluded from our non-GAAP measure of Adjusted
Income. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measure: Adjusted Income section of this MD&A.
In addition to this program, we continuously monitor our operations for cost reduction and/or productivity opportunities, especially in light of the losses of exclusivity and the expiration of
collaborative arrangements for various products.
Other (Income)/Deductions––Net
2022 v. 2021
The period-over-period change of $5.1 billion resulting in net other deductions in 2022 compared to net other income in 2021 was primarily driven by net losses recognized on equity
securities in 2022 versus net gains recognized in 2021, lower net periodic benefit credits, and higher asset impairment charges.

Being developed in collaboration with Myovant. In January 2023, the FDA approved the sNDA to include data from the Randomized Withdrawal Study into section 14 of the label.
Being developed in collaboration with OPKO.
In October 2022, the CDC’s ACIP voted to recommend a single dose of Prevnar 20 to help protect adults previously vaccinated with Prevnar 13 or both Prevnar 13 and PPSV23 against invasive disease and
pneumonia caused by the 20 Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes in Prevnar 20.
In June 2022, we announced the submission of an NDA to the FDA for approval of Paxlovid for the treatment of COVID-19 in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals who are at high risk for progression to
severe illness from COVID-19. In December 2022, Pfizer announced the FDA has extended the review period for the NDA for Paxlovid. At the request of the FDA, Pfizer recently submitted additional analyses of
efficacy and safety data from the pivotal Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients and supportive Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in Standard-Risk Patients trials to be
considered as part of its NDA for Paxlovid. Results from these analyses are consistent with previously disclosed efficacy and safety data for the trials. In order to allow time for a full review of the application,
including the additional data analyses submitted, the FDA has extended the Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date by three months to May 2023.
In December 2021, in light of the results from the completed required postmarketing safety study of Xeljanz, ORAL Surveillance (A3921133), the U.S. label for Xeljanz was revised. In
addition, in November 2022, the EMA concluded their assessment of JAK inhibitors authorized for inflammatory diseases in the EU, including Xeljanz and Cibinqo, and recommended that
risk minimization measures, including special warnings and precautions for use, should be revised and harmonized for all such JAK inhibitors. The resulting label changes are expected to
be finalized in the first quarter of 2023. We continue to work with regulatory agencies worldwide to review the full results and analyses of ORAL Surveillance and their impact on product
labeling. For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors—Post-Authorization/Approval Data.
In China, the following products received regulatory approvals in the last twelve months: Paxlovid for COVID-19 infection in February 2022; Cibinqo for atopic dermatitis in April 2022;
Lorbrena for non-small cell lung cancer (first line and second line therapy) in April 2022; Xeljanz for ankylosing spondylitis in April 2022; Cresemba (IV formulation) for the treatment of adult

NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL  MEASURE: ADJUSTED INCOME
Adjusted income is an alternative measure of performance used by management to evaluate our overall performance as a supplement to our GAAP Reported performance measures. As
such, we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure. We use Adjusted income, certain components of Adjusted income and Adjusted
diluted EPS to present the results of our major operations––the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide––prior to
considering certain income statement elements as follows:

Adjusted income measure
Adjusted diluted EPSEPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders––diluted  before the impact of
amortization of intangible assets, certain acquisition-related items, discontinued
operations and certain significant items
Most directly comparable GAAP measure.
The short-term incentive plans for substantially all non-sales-force employees worldwide are funded from a pool based on our performance, measured in significant part versus three budgeted metrics, one of which
is Adjusted diluted EPS (as defined for annual incentive compensation purposes), which is derived from Adjusted income and accounts for 40% of the bonus pool funding tied to financial performance. Additionally,
the payout for performance share awards is determined in part by Adjusted net income, which is derived from Adjusted income. Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we no longer exclude any expenses for
acquired IPR&D from our non-GAAP Adjusted results but we continue to exclude certain of these expenses for our financial results for annual incentive compensation purposes. The bonus pool funding, which is
largely based on financial performance, is adjusted by our R&D pipeline performance, as measured by four metrics, and performance against certain of our ESG metrics, and may be further modified by our
Compensation Committee’s assessment of other factors.
Adjusted income and its components and Adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, are limited in
their usefulness to investors. Because of their non-standardized definitions, they may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies and are presented to
permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance. A limitation of these measures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all events
during a period, and do not provide a comparable view of our performance to peers. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for their most directly comparable
GAAP measures of Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders, components of Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders and EPS attributable to Pfizer
Inc. common shareholders—diluted, respectively.
We also recognize that, as internal measures of performance, these measures have limitations, and we do not restrict our performance-management process solely to these measures. We
also use other tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance. For example, our R&D organization has productivity targets, upon which its effectiveness is measured. In
addition, total shareholder return, both on an absolute basis and relative to a publicly traded pharmaceutical index, plays a significant role in determining payouts under certain of our
incentive compensation plans.
Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, our reconciliation of certain GAAP Reported to non-GAAP Adjusted information is updated to reflect the following, and prior-period information has
been revised to conform to the current period presentation:
Adjusted Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS
Acquired IPR&D—Non-GAAP Adjusted financial measures include expenses for all acquired IPR&D costs incurred in connection with upfront and milestone payments on collaboration and
in-license agreements, including premiums on equity securities, as well as asset acquisitions of acquired IPR&D. Previously, certain of these items were excluded from our non-GAAP
Adjusted results. Acquired IPR&D expenses that previously would have been excluded from non-GAAP Adjusted income but are now included in both GAAP Reported income and non-
GAAP Adjusted income were approximately: (i) $765 million pre-tax ($665 million, net of tax), or $0.12 per share, in 2022; (ii) $3.3 billion pre-tax ($2.6 billion, net of tax), or $0.45 per share,
in 2021; and (iii) $504 million pre-tax ($397 million, net of tax), or $0.07 per share, in 2020.
Amortization of Intangible Assets—We began excluding all amortization of intangibles from non-GAAP Adjusted income, compared to excluding only amortization of intangibles related to
large mergers or acquisitions under the prior methodology, and presenting it as a separate reconciling line. Previously, the adjustment under the prior methodology was included as part of a
reconciling line entitled “Purchase accounting adjustments” that we no longer separately present. The impact of this policy change resulted in benefits on Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.06 in
2022, $0.09 in 2021 and $0.05 in 2020.
Acquisition-Related Items––Adjusted income continues to exclude certain acquisition-related items, which are comprised of transaction, integration, restructuring charges and additional
depreciation costs for business combinations because these costs are unique to each(a)
(b) (a)
(a)
(a)
(b)
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 39
transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate businesses as a result of an acquisition. We have made no adjustments for resulting synergies.
The significant costs incurred in connection with a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets, activities or employees––a natural result of acquiring a
fully integrated set of activities. For this reason, we believe that such costs incurred can be viewed differently in the context of an acquisition from those costs incurred in other, more normal,
business contexts. The integration and restructuring costs for a business combination may occur over several years, with the more significant impacts typically ending within three years of
the relevant transaction. Because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions, the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be
lengthy.
Acquisition-related items may now include purchase accounting impacts that previously would have been included as part of a reconciling line entitled “Purchase accounting adjustments”
that we no longer separately present, such as: (i) the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value; (ii) depreciation related to the
increase/decrease in fair value of acquired fixed assets; (iii) amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt and (iv) the fair value changes for contingent consideration.
Discontinued Operations––Adjusted income continues to exclude the results of discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the disposal of such operations. We
believe that this presentation is meaningful to investors because, while we review our product portfolio for strategic fit with our operations, we do not build or run our business with the intent
to discontinue parts of our business. Restatements due to discontinued operations do not impact compensation or change the Adjusted income measure for the compensation in respect of
the restated periods, but are presented for consistency across all periods.
Certain Significant Items––Adjusted income continues to exclude certain significant items representing substantive and/or unusual items that are evaluated individually on a quantitative and
qualitative basis. Certain significant items may be highly variable and difficult to predict. Furthermore, in some cases it is reasonably possible that they could reoccur in future periods. For
example, although major non-acquisition-related cost-reduction programs are specific to an event or goal with a defined term, we may have subsequent programs based on reorganizations
of the business, cost productivity or in response to LOE or economic conditions. Legal charges to resolve litigation are also related to specific cases, which are facts and circumstances
specific and, in some cases, may also be the result of litigation matters at acquired companies that were inestimable, not probable or unresolved at the date of acquisition, or legal matters
related to divested products or businesses. Gains and losses on equity securities, and pension and postretirement actuarial remeasurement gains and losses have a very high degree of
inherent market volatility, which we do not control and cannot predict with any level of certainty and because we do not believe including these gains and losses assists investors in
understanding our business or is reflective of our core operations and business. Unusual items represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their
nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that would be non-recurring; or items that relate to products we no longer sell. See the

ANAL YSIS OF THE CONSOLIDA TED ST ATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS
For a discussion of the drivers of change for 2021 versus 2020 as well as cash flows from discontinued operations in 2020, see the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows
section within MD&A in our 2021 Form 10-K.
Cash Flows from Continuing Operations
 Year Ended December 31,
(MILLIONS) 2022 2021 2020 Drivers of change 2022 v. 2021
Cash provided by/(used in):
Operating activities from continuing
operations$ 29,267 $ 32,922 $ 10,540 The change was driven primarily by a net increase in payments to BioNT ech for the gross profit split for
Comirnaty (see Note 8B ) and an increase in noncurrent inventories primarily driven by a strategic build
for Paxlovid (see Note 8A ), partially of fset by higher net income adjusted for non-cash items and the
timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business.
Investing activities from continuing
operations$ (15,783)$ (22,534)$ (4,162)The change was driven mainly by a $17.4 billion increase in proceeds from redemptions of short-term
investments with original maturities of greater than three months, a $7.6 billion decrease in net
purchases of short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less and a $4.0 billion
dividend received from the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2022 that was allocated to investing activities
(see Note 2C ), partially of fset by cash paid for acquisitions in 2022 of $23.0 billion (Biohaven,
$11.5 billion, Arena, $6.2 billion and GBT , $5.2 billion), net of cash acquired (see Note 2A ).
Financing activities from continuing
operations$ (14,834)$ (9,816)$ (21,640)The change was driven mostly by $2.0 billion of purchases of the Company’ s common stock in 2022, a
$1.3 billion increase in repayments of long-term debt, and a $997 million decrease in proceeds from the
issuance of long-term debt.
Cash Flows from Discontinued Operations––In 2021, cash flows from discontinued operations primarily relate to our former Meridian subsidiary, Upjohn Business and the Mylan-Japan
collaboration (see Note 2B).
ANAL YSIS OF FINANCIAL  CONDITION, LIQUIDITY , CAPIT AL RESOURCES AND MARKET RISK
Due to our significant operating cash flows, which is a key strength of our liquidity and capital resources and our primary funding source, as well as our financial assets, access to capital
markets, revolving credit agreements, and available lines of credit, we believe that we have, and will maintain, the ability to meet our liquidity needs to support ongoing operations, our
capital allocation objectives, and our contractual and other obligations for the foreseeable future.
We focus efforts to optimize operating cash flows through achieving working capital efficiencies that target accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable, and other working capital.
Excess cash from operating cash flows is invested in money market funds and available-for-sale debt securities which consist of primarily high-quality, highly liquid, well-diversified debt
securities. We have taken, and will continue to take, a conservative approach to our financial investments and monitoring of our liquidity position in response to market changes. We typically

Credit Ratings––The cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings, and an increase or decrease in our credit rating could have a beneficial or adverse effect on
financing. Our long-term debt is rated high-quality by both S&P and Moody’s. In November 2022, Moody’s increased the rating on our long-term debt from A2 to A1 as well as the outlook on
our long-term debt to Stable; S&P continues to rate the outlook of our long-term debt as Stable since November 2020.
The current ratings assigned to our commercial paper and senior unsecured long-term debt:
NAME OF RATING AGENCY Pfizer Short-Term Rating Pfizer Long-Term Rating Outlook/Watch
Moody’s P-1 A1 Stable
S&P A-1+ A+ Stable
A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and the rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should be
evaluated independently of any other rating.
Capital Allocation Framework––Our capital allocation framework is primarily devised to facilitate (i) the achievement of medical breakthroughs through R&D investments and business
development activities and (ii) returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. See the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and
Outlook—Our Business and Strategy section of this MD&A.
Our current and projected dividends provide a return to shareholders while maintaining sufficient capital to invest in growing our business. Our dividends are not restricted by debt
covenants. While the dividend level remains a decision of Pfizer’s BOD and will continue to be evaluated in the context of future business performance, we currently believe that we can
support future annual dividend increases, barring significant unforeseen events. In December 2022, our BOD declared a first-quarter dividend of $0.41 per share, payable on March 3, 2023,
to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 27, 2023. The first-quarter 2023 cash dividend will be our 337th consecutive quarterly dividend.
In the first quarter of 2022, we purchased 39 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $2.0 billion under our publicly announced share purchase plan. See Note 12 for more
information. At December 31, 2022, our remaining share-purchase authorization was approximately $3.3 billion.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual, and Other Obligations––In the ordinary course of business, (i) we enter into off-balance sheet arrangements that may result in
contractual and other obligations and (ii) in connection with the sale of assets and businesses and other transactions, we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that
may arise in connection with the transaction or that are related to events and activities. For more information on guarantees and indemnifications, see Note 16B.
Additionally, certain of our co-promotion or license agreements give our licensors or partners the rights to negotiate for, or in some cases to obtain under certain financial conditions, co-
promotion or other rights in specified countries with respect to certain of our products. Furthermore, collaboration, licensing or other R&D arrangements may give rise to potential milestone
payments. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and/or commercialization milestones,
which may span several years and which may never occur.
Our significant contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2022 consisted of:
•Long-term debt, including current portion (see Note 7D) and related interest payments;
•Estimated cash payments related to the TCJA repatriation estimated tax liability (see Note 5). Estimated future payments related to the TCJA repatriation tax liability that will occur after
December 31, 2022 total $7.0 billion, of which an estimated $1.0 billion is to be paid in the next twelve months and an estimated $6.0 billion is to be paid in periods thereafter. Our
obligations may vary as a result of changes in our uncertain tax positions and/or availability of attributes such as foreign tax and other credit carryforwards;
•Certain commitments totaling $4.4 billion, of which an estimated $1.4 billion is to be paid in the next twelve months, and $3.0 billion in periods thereafter (see Note 16C);
•Purchases of property plant and equipment (see Note 9). In 2023, we expect to spend approximately $3.9 billion on property, plant and equipment; and
•Future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases (see Note 15).
In March 2022, in connection with GSK’s previously announced planned demerger, the Consumer Healthcare JV issued notes of $8.75 billion, €2.35 billion and £700 million with various
maturities. GSK guaranteed the notes and we agreed to indemnify GSK for 32% of any amount payable by GSK. In conjunction with the completion of GSK’s demerger transactions in July
2022, GSK’s guarantee and our related indemnification of GSK’s guarantee were terminated. See Note 2C.
Global Economic Conditions––Venezuela and Argentina operations, and beginning in our second quarter of 2022, our operations in Turkey function in a hyperinflationary economy. The
impact to Pfizer is not considered material. For additional information on the global economic environment, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors––Global Operations section in this Form 10-K.
Market Risk––We are subject to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, and equity price risk. The objective of our financial risk management program is to minimize the impact of foreign
exchange rate and interest rate movements on our earnings. We address such exposures through a combination of operational means and financial instruments. For more information on
how we manage our foreign exchange and interest rate risks, see Notes 1F and 7E, as well as the Item 1A. Risk Factors—Global Operations section in this Form 10-K for key currencies in
which we operate. Our sensitivity analyses of such risks are discussed below.
Foreign Exchange Risk—The fair values of our financial instrument holdings are analyzed at year-end to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes. In this analysis,
holding all other assumptions constant and assuming that a change in one currency’s rate relative to the U.S. dollar would not have any effect on another currency’s rates relative to the U.S.
dollar, if the dollar were to appreciate against all other currencies by 10%, as of December 31, 2022, the expected adverse impact on our net income would not be significant.
Interest Rate Risk—The fair values of our financial instrument holdings are analyzed at year-end to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes. In this analysis, holding all other
assumptions constant and assuming a parallel shift in the interest rate curve for all maturities and for all instruments, if there were a one hundred basis point decrease in interest rates as of
December 31, 2022, the expected adverse impact on our net income would not be significant.
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 43
Equity Price Risk––We hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values in life science companies as a result of certain business development transactions. While we are holding
such securities, we are subject to equity price risk, and this may increase the volatility of our income in future periods due to changes in the fair value of equity investments. From time to
time, we will sell such equity securities based on our business considerations, which may include limiting our price risk. Our equity securities with readily determinable fair values are
analyzed at year-end to determine their sensitivity to equity price rate changes. In this sensitivity analysis, the expected adverse impact on our net income would not be significant.
LIBOR––From time to time, we issued variable rate debt or entered into interest rate derivatives based on LIBOR. The most commonly used U.S. dollar LIBOR rates will cease publication
after June 30, 2023, and all other LIBOR rates ceased publication as of December 31, 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve has selected the Secured Overnight Funding Rate (SOFR) as the
preferred alternative reference rate. We have been updating our systems and all of our LIBOR-based contracts as of December 31, 2022 contain fallback language to accommodate an
alternative reference rate. We do not expect the transition to have a significant impact on our business or financial condition.
NEW ACCOUNTING ST ANDARDS
Recently Adopted Accounting Standard
See Note 1B.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards, Not Adopted as of December 31, 2022
Standard/Description Effective DateEffect on the Financial
Statements
Reference rate reform provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the guidance for
contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate
expected to be discontinued after 2021 because of reference rate reform.
The new guidance provides the following optional expedients:
1. Simplify accounting analyses under current U.S. GAAP for contract modifications.
2. Simplify the assessment of hedge effectiveness and allow hedging relationships affected by reference rate
reform to continue.
3. Allow a one-time election to sell or transfer debt securities classified as held to maturity that reference a
rate affected by reference rate reform.Elections can be adopted
prospectively at any time through
December 31, 2024.We will apply certain of the optional
expedients on hedge accounting
relationships and related contracts,
if necessary. We do not expect this
new guidance to have a material
impact on our consolidated financial
statements.
In June 2022, the FASB issued final guidance to clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of an
equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not
considered when measuring fair value. Recognizing a contractual sale restriction as a separate unit of
account is not permitted.January 1, 2024, with early adoption
permitted.We are assessing the impact, but
currently do not expect this new
guidance to have a material impact
on our consolidated financial
statements.
In September 2022, the FASB issued final guidance to enhance transparency about an entity’s use of
supplier finance programs. Under the final guidance, the buyer in a supplier finance program is required to
disclose information about the key terms of the program, outstanding confirmed amounts as of the end of the
period, a rollforward of such amounts during each annual period, and a description of where in the financial
statements outstanding amounts are presented.January 1, 2023, except for the
amendment on rollforward
information, which is effective January
1, 2024. Early adoption is permitted.This new guidance will result in
increased disclosures in the notes
to our financial statements.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
Pfizer Inc.:
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the
consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31,
2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 23, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements
based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a
test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a
whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Evaluation of the U.S. Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based contract rebates accrual
As discussed in Note 1G to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records estimated deductions for Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based contract rebates
(collectively, U.S. rebates) as a reduction to gross product revenues. The accrual for U.S. rebates is recorded in the same period that the corresponding revenues are recognized. The
length of time between when a sale is made and when the U.S. rebate is paid by the Company can be as long as one year, which increases the need for significant management
judgment and knowledge of market conditions and practices in estimating the accrual.
We identified the evaluation of the U.S. rebates accrual as a critical audit matter because the evaluation of the product-specific experience ratio assumption involved especially
challenging auditor judgment. The product-specific experience ratio assumption relates to estimating which of the Company’s revenue transactions will ultimately be subject to a related
rebate.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls
over the Company’s U.S. rebates accrual process related to the development of the product-specific experience ratio assumptions. We estimated the U.S. rebates accrual using internal
information and historical data and compared the result to the Company’s estimated U.S. rebates accrual. We evaluated the Company’s ability to accurately estimate the accrual for U.S.
rebates by comparing historically recorded accruals to the actual amount that was ultimately paid by the Company.
Evaluation of gross unrecognized tax benefits
As discussed in Notes 5D and 1Q, the Company’s tax positions are subject to audit by local taxing authorities in each respective tax jurisdiction, and the resolution of such audits may
span multiple years. Since tax law is complex and often subject to varied interpretations and judgments, it is uncertain whether some of the Company’s tax positions will be sustained
upon audit. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding associated interest, of $4.5 billion.
We identified the evaluation of certain of the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter because a high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and
knowledge, and complex auditor judgment was required in evaluating the Company’s interpretation of tax law and its estimate of the ultimate resolution of its tax positions.
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 45
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of an internal control over the
Company’s liability for unrecognized tax position process related to (1) interpretation of tax law, (2) evaluation of which of the Company’s tax positions may not be sustained upon audit,
and (3) estimation and recording of the gross unrecognized tax benefits. We involved tax and valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating the
Company’s interpretation of tax laws, including the assessment of transfer pricing practices in accordance with applicable tax laws and regulations. We inspected settlements with
applicable taxing authorities, including assessing the expiration of statutes of limitations. We tested the calculation of the liability for uncertain tax positions, including an evaluation of the
Company’s assessment of the technical merits of tax positions and estimates of the amount of tax benefits expected to be sustained.
Evaluation of product liability and other product-related litigation
As discussed in Notes 1S. and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is involved in product liability and other product-related litigation, which can include personal
injury, consumer, off-label promotion, securities, antitrust and breach of contract claims, among others. Certain of these pending product and other product-related legal proceedings
could result in losses that could be substantial. The accrued liability and/or disclosure for the pending product liability and other product-related legal proceedings requires a complex
series of judgments by the Company about future events, which involves a number of uncertainties.
We identified the evaluation of product liability and other product-related litigation as a critical audit matter. Challenging auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Company’s
judgments about future events and uncertainties.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls
over the Company’s product liability and other product-related litigation processes, including controls related to (1) the evaluation of information from external and internal legal counsel,
(2) forward-looking expectations, and (3) new legal proceedings, or other legal proceedings not currently reserved or disclosed. We read letters received directly from the Company’s
external and internal legal counsel that described the Company’s probable or reasonably possible legal contingency to pending product liability and other product-related legal
proceedings. We inspected the Company’s minutes from meetings of the Audit Committee, which included the status of key litigation matters. We evaluated the Company’s ability to
estimate its monetary exposure to pending product and other product-related legal proceedings by comparing historically recorded liabilities to actual monetary amounts incurred upon
resolution of prior legal matters. We analyzed relevant publicly available information about the Company, its competitors, and the industry.
 
We have not been able to determine the specific year that we or our predecessor firms began serving as the Company’s auditor, however, we are aware that we or our predecessor firms
have served as the Company’s auditor since at least 1942.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
Note 1. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies
A. Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our parent company and all subsidiaries and are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The decision of whether or not to
consolidate an entity for financial reporting purposes requires consideration of majority voting interests, as well as effective economic or other control over the entity. Typically, we do not
seek control by means other than voting interests. For subsidiaries operating outside the U.S., the financial information is included as of and for the year ended November 30 for each year
presented. Pfizer's fiscal year-end for U.S. subsidiaries is as of and for the year ended December 31 for each year presented. Substantially all unremitted earnings of international
subsidiaries are free of legal and contractual restrictions. All significant transactions among our subsidiaries have been eliminated.
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, we reorganized our commercial operations and began to manage our commercial operations through a global structure consisting of two operating
segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma, our innovative science-based biopharmaceutical business, and PC1, our global contract development and manufacturing organization
and a leading supplier of specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients. Beginning in the third quarter of 2022, we made several additional organizational changes to further transform our
operations to better leverage our expertise in certain areas and in anticipation of potential future new product or indication launches. These changes include establishing a new commercial
structure within Biopharma, optimizing our end-to-end R&D operations and further prioritizing our internal R&D portfolio, as well as realigning certain enabling and platform functions across
the organization to ensure alignment with this new operating structure. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. See Note 17.
On December 31, 2021, we completed the sale of our Meridian subsidiary, the manufacturer of EpiPen and other auto-injector products. Prior to its sale, Meridian was managed within the
former Hospital product portfolio. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, the financial results of Meridian were reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. On December
21, 2020, Pfizer and Viatris completed the termination of a pre-existing strategic collaboration between Pfizer and Mylan for generic drugs in Japan (the Mylan-Japan collaboration) pursuant
to an agreement dated November 13, 2020, and we transferred related inventories and operations that were part of the Mylan-Japan collaboration to Viatris. On November 16, 2020, we
completed the spin-off and the combination of our Upjohn Business with Mylan to form Viatris. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, the financial results of the Upjohn Business and the
Mylan-Japan collaboration were reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Upon completion of the spin-off of the Upjohn Business on November 16, 2020, the Upjohn
assets and liabilities were derecognized from our consolidated balance sheet and are reflected in Retained Earnings–Distribution of Upjohn Business in the consolidated statement of equity.
Prior to the spin-off of the Upjohn Business in November 2020, the Upjohn Business, the Mylan-Japan collaboration and Meridian were managed as part of our former Upjohn operating
segment. With the separation of the Upjohn Business, the Mylan-Japan collaboration and Meridian, as well as the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019, Pfizer transformed into
a more focused, global leader in science-based innovative medicines and vaccines. In addition, other acquisitions and business development activities completed in 2022, 2021 and 2020
impacted financial results in the periods presented. See Note 2.
We have made certain reclassification adjustments to conform prior-period amounts to the current presentation, mainly for acquired IPR&D expenses (see Note 1L). Certain amounts in the
consolidated financial statements and associated notes may not add due to rounding. All percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts.
B. New Accounting Standard Adopted in 2022
On January 1, 2022, we early adopted a new accounting standard for contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination. Under the new standard, acquired contract
assets and contract liabilities are required to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606. This new
guidance generally results in the acquirer recognizing contract assets and contract liabilities at the same amounts that were recorded by the acquiree. Previously, these amounts were
recognized by the acquirer at fair value as of the acquisition date. We adopted this new standard on a prospective basis and there was no impact to our consolidated financial statements.
C. Estimates and Assumptions
In preparing these financial statements, we use certain estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. These estimates and assumptions can impact all elements
of our financial statements. For example, in the consolidated statements of income, estimates are used when accounting for deductions from revenues, determining the cost of inventory
that is sold, allocating cost in the form of depreciation and amortization, and estimating restructuring charges and the impact of contingencies, as well as determining provisions for taxes on
income. On the consolidated balance sheets, estimates are used in determining the valuation and recoverability of assets, and in determining the reported amounts of liabilities, all of which
also impact the consolidated statements of income. Certain estimates of fair value and amounts recorded in connection with acquisitions, revenue deductions, impairment reviews,
restructuring-associated charges, investments and financial instruments, valuation allowances, pension and postretirement benefit plans, contingencies, share-based compensation, and
other calculations can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions.
Our estimates are often based on complex judgments and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, but that can be inherently uncertain and unpredictable. If our estimates and
assumptions are not representative of actual outcomes, our results could be materially impacted. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, our estimates and
assumptions may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, or unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions. We are
subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from estimated amounts, such as changes in the healthcare environment, competition, litigation, legislation and
regulations. We regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions using historical experience and expectations about the future. We adjust our estimates and assumptions when facts and
circumstances indicate the need for change.

Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
D. Acquisitions
Our consolidated financial statements include the operations of acquired businesses after the completion of the acquisitions. We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition
method of accounting, which requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date and that
the fair value of acquired IPR&D be recorded on the balance sheet. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Any excess of the consideration transferred over the assigned values of the
net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. When we acquire net assets that do not constitute a business, as defined in U.S. GAAP, no goodwill is recognized and acquired IPR&D is
expensed in Acquired in-process research and development expenses.
Contingent consideration in a business combination is included as part of the acquisition cost and is recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. Fair value is generally estimated by
using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow approach. See Note 16D. Any liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the
contingency is resolved. These changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in Other (income)/deductions––net.
E. Fair Value
We measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value, either upon initial recognition or for subsequent accounting or reporting. We estimate fair value using an exit price approach, which
requires, among other things, that we determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly market. The determination of an exit price is
considered from the perspective of market participants, considering the highest and best use of non-financial assets and, for liabilities, assuming that the risk of non-performance will be the
same before and after the transfer.
When estimating fair value, depending on the nature and complexity of the asset or liability, we may use one or all of the following techniques:
•Income approach, which is based on the present value of a future stream of net cash flows.
•Market approach, which is based on market prices and other information from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.
•Cost approach, which is based on the cost to acquire or construct comparable assets, less an allowance for functional and/or economic obsolescence.
Our fair value methodologies depend on the following types of inputs:
•Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets (Level 1 inputs).
•Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices
that are directly or indirectly observable, or inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means (Level 2 inputs).
•Unobservable inputs that reflect estimates and assumptions (Level 3 inputs).
The following inputs and valuation techniques are used to estimate the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities:
•Available-for-sale debt securities—third-party matrix-pricing model that uses significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data and credit-adjusted yield curves.
•Equity securities with readily determinable fair values—quoted market prices and observable NAV prices.
•Derivative assets and liabilities—third-party matrix-pricing model that uses inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. Where applicable, these models use market-
based observable inputs, including interest rate yield curves to discount future cash flow amounts, and forward and spot prices for currencies. The credit risk impact to our derivative
financial instruments was not significant.
•Money market funds—observable NAV prices.
We periodically review the methodologies, inputs and outputs of third-party pricing services for reasonableness. Our procedures can include, for example, referencing other third-party
pricing models, monitoring key observable inputs (like benchmark interest rates) and selectively performing test-comparisons of values with actual sales of financial instruments.
F. Foreign Currency Translation
For most of our international operations, local currencies have been determined to be the functional currencies. We translate functional currency assets and liabilities to their U.S. dollar
equivalents at exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date and income and expense amounts at average exchange rates for the period. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from
changing translation rates are recorded in Other comprehensive income/(loss). The effects of converting non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities into the functional currency
are recorded in Other (income)/deductions––net. For operations in highly inflationary economies, we translate monetary items at rates in effect as of the balance sheet date, with translation
adjustments recorded in Other (income)/deductions––net, and we translate non-monetary items at historical rates.
G. Revenues and Trade Accounts Receivable
Revenue Recognition––We record revenues from product sales when there is a transfer of control of the product from us to the customer. We typically determine transfer of control based
on when the product is shipped or delivered and title passes to the customer. For certain contracts, the finished product may temporarily be stored at our or our third-party subcontractors’
locations under a bill-and-hold arrangement. Revenue is recognized on bill-and-hold arrangements at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the product and all of the
following criteria have been met: the arrangement is substantive; the product is identified separately as belonging to the customer; the product is ready for physical transfer to the customer;
and we do not have the ability to use the product or direct it to another customer. In determining when the customer obtains control of the product, we consider certain indicators, including
whether we have a present right to payment from
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 54
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
the customer, whether title and/or significant risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer and whether customer acceptance has been received.
Our Sales Contracts––Sales on credit are typically under short-term contracts. Collections are based on market payment cycles common in various markets, with shorter cycles in the U.S.
Sales are adjusted for sales allowances, chargebacks, rebates and sales returns and cash discounts. Sales returns occur due to LOE, product recalls or a changing competitive
environment.
Deductions from Revenues––Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are
recognized. Such variable consideration represents chargebacks, rebates, sales allowances and sales returns. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as
such, knowledge and judgment is required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period.
Provisions for pharmaceutical sales returns––Provisions are based on a calculation for each market that incorporates the following, as appropriate: local returns policies and practices;
historical returns as a percentage of sales; an understanding of the reasons for past returns; estimated shelf life by product; an estimate of the amount of time between shipment and return
or lag time; and any other factors that could impact the estimate of future returns, such as LOE, product recalls or a changing competitive environment. Generally, returned products are
destroyed, and customers are refunded the sales price in the form of a credit.
We record sales incentives as a reduction of revenues at the time the related revenues are recorded or when the incentive is offered, whichever is later. We estimate the cost of our sales
incentives based on our historical experience with similar incentives programs to predict customer behavior.
The following outlines our common sales arrangements:
•Customers––Our prescription biopharmaceutical products, with the exception of Paxlovid, are sold principally to wholesalers, but we also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics,
government agencies and pharmacies. In 2022, we principally sold Paxlovid to government agencies. In the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines directly to the federal government, CDC,
wholesalers, individual provider offices, retail pharmacies and integrated delivery systems. Outside the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines to government and non-government
institutions. Prescription pharmaceutical products that ultimately are used by patients are generally covered under governmental programs, managed care programs and insurance
programs, including those managed through PBMs, and are subject to sales allowances and/or rebates payable directly to those programs. Those sales allowances and rebates are
generally negotiated, but government programs may have legislated amounts by type of product (e.g., patented or unpatented).
Specifically:
•In the U.S., we sell our products principally to distributors and hospitals. We also have contracts with managed care programs or PBMs and legislatively mandated contracts with the
federal and state governments under which we provide rebates based on medicines utilized by the lives they cover. We record provisions for Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based
contract pharmaceutical rebates based upon our experience ratio of rebates paid and actual prescriptions written during prior periods. We apply the experience ratio to the respective
period’s sales to determine the rebate accrual and related expense. This experience ratio is evaluated regularly to ensure that the historical trends are as current as practicable. We
estimate discounts on branded prescription drug sales to Medicare Part D participants in the Medicare “coverage gap,” also known as the “doughnut hole,” based on the historical
experience of beneficiary prescriptions and consideration of the utilization that is expected to result from the discount in the coverage gap. We evaluate this estimate regularly to ensure
that the historical trends and future expectations are as current as practicable. For performance-based contract rebates, we also consider current contract terms, such as changes in
formulary status and rebate rates.
•Outside the U.S., the majority of our pharmaceutical sales allowances are contractual or legislatively mandated and our estimates are based on actual invoiced sales within each period,
which reduces the risk of variations in the estimation process. In certain European countries, rebates are calculated on the government’s total unbudgeted pharmaceutical spending or on
specific product sales thresholds and we apply an estimated allocation factor against our actual invoiced sales to project the expected level of reimbursement. We obtain third-party
information that helps us to monitor the adequacy of these accruals.
•Provisions for pharmaceutical chargebacks (primarily reimbursements to U.S. wholesalers for honoring contracted prices and legislated discounts to third parties) closely approximate
actual amounts incurred, as we settle these deductions generally within two to five weeks of incurring the liability.
We recorded direct product sales and/or Alliance revenues of more than $1 billion for each of ten products in 2022, for each of nine products in 2021 and for each of seven products in 2020.
In the aggregate, these direct product sales and/or alliance product revenues represented 82% of our revenues in 2022, 75% of our revenues in 2021 and 54% of our revenues in 2020. See
Note 17C for additional information. The loss or expiration of intellectual property rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues as our contracts with customers will generally
be at lower selling prices and lower volumes due to added generic competition. We generally provide for higher sales returns during the period in which individual markets begin to near the
loss or expiration of intellectual property rights.
Our accruals for Medicare, Medicaid and related state program and performance-based contract rebates, chargebacks, sales allowances and sales returns and cash discounts are as
follows:
  As of December 31,

Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 55
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
Taxes collected from customers relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from Revenues.
Trade Accounts Receivable—Trade accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance for credit losses reflects our best estimate of expected credit losses of the
receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, current information, and forecasts of future economic conditions. In developing the estimate for expected credit losses,
trade accounts receivables are segmented into pools of assets depending on market (U.S. versus international), delinquency status, and customer type (high risk versus low risk and
government versus non-government), and fixed reserve percentages are established for each pool of trade accounts receivables.
In determining the reserve percentages for each pool of trade accounts receivables, we considered our historical experience with certain customers and customer types, regulatory and
legal environments, country and political risk, and other relevant current and future forecasted macroeconomic factors. These credit risk indicators are monitored on a quarterly basis to
determine whether there have been any changes in the economic environment that would indicate the established reserve percentages should be adjusted, and are considered on a
regional basis to reflect more geographic-specific metrics. Additionally, write-offs and recoveries of customer receivables are tracked against collections on a quarterly basis to determine
whether the reserve percentages remain appropriate. When management becomes aware of certain customer-specific factors that impact credit risk, specific allowances for these known
troubled accounts are recorded. Trade accounts receivable are written off after all reasonable means to collect the full amount (including litigation, where appropriate) have been exhausted.
During 2022 and 2021, additions to the allowance for credit losses, write-offs and recoveries of customer receivables were not material to our consolidated financial statements.
H. Collaborative Arrangements
Payments to and from our collaboration partners are presented in our consolidated statements of income based on the nature of the arrangement (including its contractual terms), the nature
of the payments and applicable accounting guidance. Under co-promotion agreements, we record the amounts received for our share of gross profits from our collaboration partners as
Alliance revenues, a component of Revenues, when our collaboration partners are the principal in the transaction and we receive a share of their net sales or profits. Alliance revenues are
recorded as we perform co-promotion activities for the collaboration and the collaboration partners sell the products to their customers. The related expenses for selling and marketing these
products including reimbursements to or from our collaboration partners for these costs are included in Selling, informational and administrative expenses. In collaborative arrangements
where we manufacture a product for our collaboration partners, we record revenues when we transfer control of the product to our collaboration partners. In collaboration arrangements
where we are the principal in the transaction, we record amounts paid to collaboration partners for their share of net sales or profits earned, and all royalty payments to collaboration
partners as Cost of sales. Royalty payments received from collaboration partners are included in Other (income)/deductions—net.
Reimbursements to or from our collaboration partners for development costs are typically recorded in Research and development expenses. Upfront payments and pre-approval milestone
payments due from us to our collaboration partners in development stage collaborations are recorded as Acquired in-process research and development expenses. Milestone payments due
from us to our collaboration partners after regulatory approval has been attained for a medicine are recorded in Identifiable intangible assets—Developed technology rights. Upfront and pre-
approval milestone payments earned from our collaboration partners by us are recognized in Other (income)/deductions—net over the development period for the products, when our
performance obligations include providing R&D services to our collaboration partners. Upfront, pre-approval and post-approval milestone payments earned by us may be recognized in
Other (income)/deductions—net immediately when earned or over other periods depending upon the nature of our performance obligations in the applicable collaboration. Where the
milestone event is regulatory approval for a medicine, we generally recognize milestone payments due to us in the transaction price when regulatory approval in the applicable jurisdiction
has been attained. We may recognize milestone payments due to us in the transaction price earlier than the milestone event in certain circumstances when recognition of the income would
not be probable of a significant reversal.
I. Cost of Sales and Inventories
Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of finished goods, work in process and raw materials is determined using average actual cost. We regularly
review our inventories for impairment and reserves are established when necessary. Inventories that are not expected to be sold within 12 months are classified as Other noncurrent assets.
See Note 8A.
J. Selling, Informational and Administrative Expenses
Selling, informational and administrative costs are expensed as incurred. Among other things, these expenses include the internal and external costs of marketing, advertising, shipping and
handling, IT and legal defense. Advertising expenses totaled approximately $2.8 billion in 2022, $2.0 billion in 2021 and $1.8 billion in 2020. Production costs are expensed as incurred and
the costs of TV, radio, and other electronic media and publications are expensed when the related advertising occurs.
K. Research and Development Expenses
R&D costs are expensed as incurred. These expenses include the costs of our proprietary R&D efforts, as well as R&D activities performed in connection with certain licensing
arrangements.
L. Acquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses
Before a compound receives regulatory approval, we record upfront and milestone payments we make to third parties under licensing and collaboration arrangements as expense. Upfront
payments are recorded when incurred, and milestone payments are recorded when the specific milestone has been achieved. Once a compound receives regulatory approval, we record
any milestone payments in Identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization and, unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite life, we typically amortize the payments on
a straight-line basis over the remaining agreement term or the expected product life cycle, whichever is shorter. In the first quarter of 2022, we began reporting acquired IPR&D expense as
a separate line item in our consolidated statements of income. Acquired in-process research and development expenses includes costs incurred in connection with (a) all upfront and
milestone payments on
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 56
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
collaboration and in-license agreements, including premiums on equity securities and (b) asset acquisitions of acquired IPR&D. These costs were previously recorded in Research and
development expenses.
M. Amortization of Intangible Assets, Depreciation and Certain Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets include:
•Property, plant and equipment, less accumulated depreciation—These assets are recorded at cost, including any significant improvements after purchase, less accumulated depreciation.
Property, plant and equipment assets, other than land and construction in progress, are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the individual assets.
Depreciation begins when the asset is ready for its intended use. For tax purposes, accelerated depreciation methods are used as allowed by tax laws.
•Identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization—These assets are recorded at fair value at acquisition. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line
basis over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized until a useful life can be determined.
•Goodwill—Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred for an acquired business over the assigned values of its net assets. Goodwill is not amortized.
Amortization of finite-lived acquired intangible assets is included in Amortization of intangible assets.
We review our long-lived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year. We perform impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill at least annually and for all
other long-lived assets whenever impairment indicators are present. When necessary, we record impairments of long-lived assets for the amount by which the fair value is less than the
carrying value of these assets.
Specifically:
•For finite-lived intangible assets, such as developed technology rights, and for other long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, whenever impairment indicators are
present, we calculate the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows for the asset, or asset group, and compare this estimated amount to the carrying amount. If the carrying amount
is greater, we record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over fair value. In addition, in all cases of an impairment review, we reevaluate the remaining useful lives of the
assets and modify them, as appropriate.
•For indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as brands and IPR&D assets, when necessary, we determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment loss, if any, for the excess of
book value over fair value. In addition, in all cases of an impairment review other than for IPR&D assets, we re-evaluate whether continuing to characterize the asset as indefinite-lived is
appropriate.
•For goodwill, when necessary, we determine the fair value of each reporting unit and record an impairment loss, if any, for the excess of the book value of the reporting unit over the
implied fair value.
N. Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives
We may incur restructuring charges in connection with acquisitions when we implement plans to restructure and integrate the acquired operations or in connection with our cost-reduction
and productivity initiatives.
•In connection with acquisition activity, we typically incur costs associated with executing the transactions, integrating the acquired operations (which may include expenditures for
consulting and the integration of systems and processes), and restructuring the combined company (which may include charges related to employees, assets and activities that will not
continue in the combined company); and
•In connection with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives, we typically incur costs and charges for site closings and other facility rationalization actions, workforce reductions and the
expansion of shared services, including the development of global systems.
Included in Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs are all restructuring charges, as well as certain other costs associated with acquiring and integrating an acquired
business. If the restructuring action results in a change in the estimated useful life of an asset, that incremental impact is classified in Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative
expenses and/or Research and development expenses, as appropriate. Employee termination costs are generally recorded when the actions are probable and estimable and include
accrued severance benefits, pension and postretirement benefits, many of which may be paid out during periods after termination. Transaction costs, such as banking, legal, accounting and
other similar costs incurred in connection with a business acquisition are expensed as incurred.
Our business and platform functions may be impacted by these actions, including sales and marketing, manufacturing and R&D, as well as our corporate enabling functions (such as digital,
global real estate operations, legal, finance, human resources, worldwide public affairs, compliance and worldwide procurement).
O. Cash Equivalents and Statement of Cash Flows
Cash equivalents include items almost as liquid as cash, such as certificates of deposit and time deposits with maturity periods of three months or less when purchased. If items meeting
this definition are part of a larger investment pool, we classify them as Short-term investments.
Cash flows for financial instruments designated as fair value or cash flow hedges may be included in operating, investing or financing activities, depending on the classification of the items
being hedged. Cash flows for financial instruments designated as net investment hedges are classified according to the nature of the hedging instrument. Cash flows for financial
instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are classified according to their purpose and accounting nature.

Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
P. Investments and Derivative Financial Instruments
The classification of an investment depends on the nature of the investment, our intent and ability to hold the investment, and the degree to which we may exercise influence. Our
investments are primarily comprised of the following:
•Public equity securities with readily determinable fair values, which are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in Other (income)/deductions—net.
•Available-for-sale debt securities, which are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in Other comprehensive income/(loss) until realized.
•Held-to-maturity debt securities, which are carried at amortized cost.
•Private equity securities without readily determinable fair values and where we have no significant influence are measured at cost minus any impairment and plus or minus adjustments
resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.
•For equity investments in common stock or in-substance common stock where we have significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, we use the equity-
method of accounting. Under the equity-method, we record our share of the investee’s income and expenses in Other (income)/deductions—net. The excess of the cost of the investment
over our share of the underlying equity in the net assets of the investee as of the acquisition date is allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee, with any remaining
excess amount allocated to goodwill. Such investments are initially recorded at cost, which is the fair value of consideration paid and typically does not include contingent consideration.
Realized gains or losses on sales of investments are determined by using the specific identification cost method.
We regularly evaluate all of our financial assets for impairment. For investments in debt and equity, if and when a decline in fair value is determined, an impairment charge is recorded and a
new cost basis in the investment is established. For equity-method investments, an impairment charge is recorded only if and when a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-
temporary.
Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value in certain balance sheet categories (see Note 7A), with changes in fair value reported in net income or, for certain qualifying hedging
relationships, in Other comprehensive income/(loss) (see Note 7E).
Q. Tax Assets and Liabilities and Income Tax Contingencies
Tax Assets and Liabilities––Current tax assets primarily include (i) tax effects for intercompany transfers of inventory within our combined group, which are recognized in the consolidated
statements of income when the inventory is sold to a third party and (ii) income tax receivables that are expected to be recovered either via refunds from taxing authorities or reductions to
future tax obligations.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using
enacted tax rates and laws. We provide a valuation allowance when we believe that our deferred tax assets are not recoverable based on an assessment of estimated future taxable income
that incorporates ongoing, prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies, that would be implemented, if necessary, to realize the deferred tax assets. Amounts recorded for valuation
allowances requires judgments about future income which can depend heavily on estimates and assumptions. All deferred tax assets and liabilities within the same tax jurisdiction are
presented as a net amount in the noncurrent section of our consolidated balance sheet.
The TCJA subjects a U.S. shareholder to current tax on global intangible low-taxed income earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The FASB Staff Q&A, Topic 740, No. 5, Accounting for
Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, states that we are permitted to make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to
reverse as global intangible low-taxed income in future years or provide for the tax expense related to such income in the year the tax is incurred. We elected to recognize deferred taxes for
temporary differences expected to reverse as global intangible low-taxed income in future years.
Other non-current tax assets primarily represent our estimate of the potential tax benefits in one tax jurisdiction that could result from the payment of income taxes in another tax jurisdiction.
These potential benefits generally result from cooperative efforts among taxing authorities, as required by tax treaties to minimize double taxation, commonly referred to as the competent
authority process. The recoverability of these assets, which we believe to be more likely than not, is dependent upon the actual payment of taxes in one tax jurisdiction and, in some cases,
the successful petition for recovery in another tax jurisdiction.
Other taxes payable as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 include liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the noncurrent portion of the repatriation tax liability for which we elected payment
over eight years through 2026. For additional information, see Note 5D for uncertain tax positions and Note 5A for the repatriation tax liability and other estimates and assumptions in
connection with the TCJA.
Income Tax Contingencies––We account for income tax contingencies using a benefit recognition model. If we consider that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit,
based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize all or a portion of the benefit. We measure the benefit by determining the amount that is greater than 50% likely of being
realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax position is examined by the taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information.
We regularly monitor our position and subsequently recognize the unrecognized tax benefit: (i) if there are changes in tax law, analogous case law or there is new information that
sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to “more likely than not”; (ii) if the statute of limitations expires; or (iii) if there is a completion of an audit
resulting in a favorable settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when we expect to pay cash within the next
12 months. Interest and penalties, if any, are recorded in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income and are classified on our consolidated balance sheet with the related tax liability.
Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but our estimates of unrecognized tax benefits and potential tax benefits
may not be representative of actual outcomes, and variation from such estimates could
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 58
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or when the statutes of limitations expire, as we treat these events as discrete items in the period of resolution.
R. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans
The majority of our employees worldwide are covered by defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we have both IRC-qualified and supplemental (non-
qualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans, as well as other postretirement benefit plans consisting primarily of medical insurance for retirees and their eligible
dependents. Net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs other than the service costs are recognized in Other (income)/deductions—net. We immediately recognize actuarial gains
and losses arising from the remeasurement of our pension and postretirement plans (MTM Accounting). Each time a pension or postretirement plan is remeasured, the actuarial gain or loss
is recognized immediately and classified as Other (income)/deductions––net. We recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of each of our defined benefit plans as an asset or liability.
The obligations are generally measured at the actuarial present value of all benefits attributable to employee service rendered, as provided by the applicable benefit formula. Our pension
and other postretirement obligations may be determined using assumptions such as discount rate, expected annual rate of return on plan assets, expected employee turnover and
participant mortality. For our pension plans, the obligation may also include assumptions as to future compensation levels. For our other postretirement benefit plans, the obligation may
include assumptions as to the expected cost of providing medical insurance benefits, as well as the extent to which those costs are shared with the employee or others (such as
governmental programs). Plan assets are measured at fair value.
S. Legal and Environmental Contingencies
We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, such as patent litigation, product liability and other product-related
litigation, commercial and other asserted or unasserted matters, environmental claims and proceedings, government investigations and guarantees and indemnifications. In assessing
contingencies related to legal and environmental proceedings that are pending against the Company, or unasserted claims that are probable of being asserted, we record accruals for these
contingencies to the extent that we conclude that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. If some amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other
amount within the range, we accrue that amount. Alternatively, when no amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the lowest amount
in the range. We record anticipated recoveries under existing insurance contracts when recovery is assured.
T. Share-Based Payments
Our compensation programs can include share-based payments. Generally, grants under share-based payment programs are accounted for at fair value and these fair values are generally
amortized on a straight-line basis or on an accelerated attribution approach over the vesting terms with the related costs recorded in Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative
expenses and/or Research and development expenses, as appropriate.
Note 2. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Equity-Method Investments, Licensing Arrangements and Collaborative Arrangements
A. Acquisitions
GBT––On October 5, 2022, we acquired GBT, a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development and delivery of life-changing treatments that provide hope to
underserved patient communities, starting with sickle cell disease, for $68.50 per share in cash. The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $5.7 billion ($5.2 billion, net of cash
acquired). In addition, $136 million in payments to GBT employees for the fair value of previously unvested long-term incentive awards was recognized as post-closing compensation
expense and recorded in Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs (see Note 3).
In connection with this business combination, we provisionally recorded: (i) $4.4 billion in Identifiable intangible assets, consisting of $3.0 billion of IPR&D and $1.4 billion of developed
technology rights with a useful life of six years, (ii) $1.1 billion of Goodwill, (iii) $681 million of inventories to be sold over approximately three years, (iv) $570 million of net deferred tax
liabilities and (v) $331 million of assumed long-term debt that was paid in full in the fourth quarter of 2022. The allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed has not yet been finalized.
Biohaven––On October 3, 2022, we acquired Biohaven, the maker of Nurtec ODT/Vydura (rimegepant), an innovative therapy approved for both acute treatment of migraine and prevention
of episodic migraine in adults. The transaction includes the acquisition of Biohaven’s CGRP programs, including rimegepant, zavegepant and a portfolio of five pre-clinical CGRP assets.
Under the terms of the agreement, we acquired all outstanding common shares of Biohaven not already owned by us for $148.50 per share, in cash, for payments of approximately $11.5
billion, plus repayment of third-party debt of $863 million and redemption of Biohaven’s redeemable preferred stock for $495 million. Effective immediately prior to the closing of the
acquisition, Biohaven completed the spin-off of Biohaven Ltd. (NYSE: BHVN), distributing Biohaven Ltd.’s shares to Biohaven shareholders. Biohaven Ltd. is a new publicly traded company
that retained Biohaven’s non-CGRP development stage pipeline compounds. Pfizer, a Biohaven shareholder, received a pro rata portion of Biohaven Ltd.’s shares in the distribution and
owns approximately 1.5% of Biohaven Ltd. as of December 31, 2022.
This acquisition follows on the November 2021 collaboration for the commercialization of rimegepant and zavegepant outside the U.S., in connection with which Pfizer acquired 2.6% of
Biohaven’s common stock (see Note 2E). Biohaven Ltd. will also have the right to receive tiered royalties from Pfizer on any annual net sales of rimegepant and zavegepant in the U.S. in
excess of $5.25 billion. This contingent consideration was determined to have no fair value as of the acquisition date. After the acquisition, we remain responsible for payment of high single
digit to mid-teen percentage tiered royalties on world-wide net sales excluding China and low to high single digit royalties on net sales in China of rimegepant and zavegepant as well as
certain regulatory approval and commercial milestone payments associated with rimegepant and zavegepant of up to $1.1 billion under pre-existing third-party license and other
agreements.
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 59
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $11.8 billion, which includes the fair value of Pfizer’s previous investment in Biohaven on the acquisition date of approximately $300
million. In connection with this business combination, we provisionally recorded: (i) $12.1 billion in Identifiable intangible assets, consisting of $11.6 billion of developed technology rights
with a useful life of 11 years and $450 million of IPR&D, (ii) $817 million of inventories to be sold over approximately two years, (iii) $797 million of Goodwill, (iv) $398 million of trade
accounts receivable, (v) $1.4 billion of assumed long-term debt that was paid in full in the fourth quarter of 2022, (vi) $566 million of net deferred tax liabilities and (vii) $477 million of Other
current liabilities. The allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed has not yet been finalized.
ReViral––On June 9, 2022, we acquired ReViral, a privately held, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing novel antiviral
therapeutics that target respiratory syncytial virus, for a total consideration of up to $536 million, including upfront payments of $436 million upon closing (including a base payment of $425
million plus working capital adjustments) and an additional $100 million contingent upon a future development milestone. It was subsequently determined the applicable milestone was not
achieved.
We accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since the lead asset, sisunatovir, represented substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired. At the acquisition date,
we recorded a $426 million charge representing an acquired IPR&D asset with no alternative use in Acquired in-process research and development expenses, which is presented as a cash
outflow from operating activities. Other assets acquired and liabilities assumed were not significant.
Arena––On March 11, 2022, we acquired Arena, a clinical stage company, for $100 per share in cash. The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $6.6 billion ($6.2 billion, net of
cash acquired). In addition, $138 million in payments to Arena employees for the fair value of previously unvested long-term incentive awards was recognized as post-closing compensation
expense and recorded in Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs (see Note 3).
Arena’s portfolio includes development-stage therapeutic candidates in gastroenterology, dermatology, and cardiology, including etrasimod, an oral, selective sphingosine 1-phosphate
(S1P) receptor modulator currently in development for a range of immuno-inflammatory diseases including UC, Crohn’s disease, atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic esophagitis, and alopecia
areata. In connection with this business combination, we provisionally recorded: (i) $5.5 billion in Identifiable intangible assets, consisting of $5.0 billion of IPR&D and $460 million of
indefinite-lived licensing agreements and other, (ii) $1.0 billion of Goodwill and (iii) $506 million of net deferred tax liabilities. The allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets
acquired and the liabilities assumed has not yet been finalized.
Trillium––On November 17, 2021, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock not already owned by Pfizer of Trillium, a clinical stage immuno-oncology company
developing therapies targeting cancer immune evasion pathways and specific cell targeting approaches, for $18.50 per share in cash, for total consideration of $2.0 billion, net of cash
acquired. As a result, Trillium became our wholly owned subsidiary. We previously held a 2% ownership investment in Trillium. Trillium’s lead program, TTI-622, is an investigational fusion
protein that is designed to block the inhibitory activity of CD47, a molecule that is overexpressed by a wide variety of tumors.
We accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since the lead asset, TTI-622, represented substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired, which exclude cash
acquired. At the acquisition date, we recorded a $2.1 billion charge representing an acquired IPR&D asset with no alternative future use in Acquired in-process research and development
expenses, of which the $2.0 billion net cash consideration is presented as a cash outflow from operating activities. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded $256 million of assets
acquired primarily consisting of cash and investments. Liabilities assumed were approximately $81 million.
Array––On July 30, 2019, we acquired Array, a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of targeted small molecule
medicines to treat cancer and other diseases of high unmet need, for $48 per share in cash. The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $11.2 billion ($10.9 billion, net of cash
acquired). In addition, $157 million in payments to Array employees for the fair value of previously unvested stock options was recognized as post-closing compensation expense and
recorded in Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs (see Note 3). We financed the majority of the transaction with debt and the balance with existing cash. Array’s
portfolio includes Braftovi (encorafenib) and Mektovi (binimetinib), a broad pipeline of targeted cancer medicines in different stages of R&D, as well as a portfolio of out-licensed medicines,
which may generate milestones and royalties over time.
The final allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed was completed in 2020. In connection with this business combination, we recorded: (i)
$6.3 billion in Identifiable intangible assets, consisting of $2.0 billion of developed technology rights with a useful life of 16 years, $2.8 billion of IPR&D and $1.5 billion of licensing
agreements and other ($1.2 billion for technology in development––indefinite-lived licensing agreements and $360 million for developed technology––finite-lived licensing agreements with a
useful life of 10 years), (ii) $6.1 billion of Goodwill, (iii) $1.1 billion of net deferred tax liabilities and (iv) $451 million of assumed long-term debt, which was paid in full in 2019.
In 2020, we recorded measurement period adjustments to the estimated fair values initially recorded in 2019, which resulted in a reduction in Identifiable intangible assets of approximately
$900 million with a corresponding change to Goodwill and net deferred tax liabilities. The measurement period adjustments were recorded to better reflect market participant assumptions
about facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date and did not have a material impact on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Pro forma information for the aforementioned acquisitions has not been presented because these acquisitions were not material to our consolidated financial statements.
B. Divestitures
Meridian––On December 31, 2021, we completed the sale of our Meridian subsidiary for approximately $51 million in cash and recognized a loss of approximately $167 million, net of tax, in
Discontinued operations––net of tax. In connection with the sale, Pfizer and the purchaser of Meridian entered into various agreements to provide a framework for our relationship after the
sale, including interim TSAs and an MSA. The TSAs primarily involve Pfizer providing services related to IT, among other activities, and are generally expected to be for terms of no more
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 60
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
than 12 to 18 months post sale. The MSA is for a term of three years post sale with a two year extension period. In 2022, the amounts recorded under the interim TSAs and MSA were not
material to our consolidated results of operations. No amounts were recorded under these arrangements in 2021.
Upjohn Separation and Combination with Mylan––On November 16, 2020, we completed the spin-off and the combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan (the Transactions) to form
Viatris. The Transactions were structured as an all-stock, Reverse Morris Trust transaction. Specifically, (i) we contributed the Upjohn Business to a wholly owned subsidiary, which was
renamed Viatris, so that the Upjohn Business was separated from the remainder of our business (the Separation), (ii) following the Separation, we distributed, on a pro rata basis, all of the
shares of Viatris common stock held by Pfizer to Pfizer stockholders as of the November 13, 2020 record date, such that each Pfizer stockholder as of the record date received
approximately 0.124079 shares of Viatris common stock per share of Pfizer common stock (the Distribution); and (iii) immediately after the Distribution, the Upjohn Business combined with
Mylan in a series of transactions in which Mylan shareholders received one share of Viatris common stock for each Mylan ordinary share held by such shareholder, subject to any applicable
withholding taxes (the Combination). Prior to the Distribution, Viatris made a cash payment to Pfizer equal to $12.0 billion as partial consideration for the contribution of the Upjohn Business
to Viatris. As of the closing of the Combination, Pfizer stockholders owned approximately 57% of the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock, and Mylan shareholders owned
approximately 43% of the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock, in each case on a fully diluted, as-converted and as-exercised basis. The Transactions are generally expected to be
tax free to Pfizer and Pfizer stockholders for U.S. tax purposes. Beginning November 16, 2020, Viatris operates both the Upjohn Business and Mylan as an independent publicly traded
company, which is traded under the symbol “VTRS” on the NASDAQ.
In connection with the Transactions, in June 2020, Upjohn Inc. and Upjohn Finance B.V. completed privately placed debt offerings of $7.45 billion and €3.60 billion aggregate principal
amounts, respectively, (approximately $11.4 billion) of senior unsecured notes and entered into other financing arrangements, including a $600 million delayed draw term loan agreement
and a revolving credit facility agreement for up to $4.0 billion. Proceeds from the debt offerings and other financing arrangements were used to fund the $12.0 billion cash distribution Viatris
made to Pfizer prior to the Distribution. We used the cash distribution proceeds to pay down commercial paper borrowings and redeem the $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount
outstanding of our 1.95% senior unsecured notes that were due in June 2021 and $342 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 5.80% senior unsecured notes that were due
in August 2023, before the maturity date. Interest expense for the $11.4 billion in debt securities incurred during 2020 is included in Discontinued operations––net of tax. Following the
Separation and Combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan, we are no longer the obligor or guarantor of any Upjohn debt or Upjohn financing arrangements.
As a result of the spin-off of the Upjohn Business, we distributed net assets of $1.6 billion as of November 16, 2020, which was reflected as a reduction to Retained earnings and reflects the
2021 MTM change in accounting principle. Of this amount, $412 million represents cash transferred to the Upjohn Business, with the remainder considered a non-cash activity in the
consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020. The spin-off also resulted in a net increase to Accumulated other comprehensive loss of $423 million for the
derecognition of net gains on foreign currency translation adjustments of $397 million and prior service net credits associated with benefit plans of $26 million, which were reclassified to
Retained earnings.
As a result of the separation of Upjohn, we incurred separation-related costs of $434 million in 2020, which are included in Discontinued operations––net of tax. These costs primarily relate
to professional fees for regulatory filings and separation activities within finance, tax, legal and information system functions as well as investment banking fees.
In connection with the Transactions, Pfizer and Viatris entered into various agreements to effect the Separation and Combination and to provide a framework for our relationship after the
Combination, including a separation and distribution agreement, interim operating models, including agency arrangements, MSAs, TSAs, a tax matters agreement, and an employee
matters agreement, among others. The interim agency operating model arrangements primarily include billings, collections and remittance of rebates that we are performing on a transitional
basis on behalf of Viatris. Under the MSAs, Pfizer or Viatris, as the case may be, manufactures, labels and packages products for the other party. The terms of the MSAs range in initial
duration from four to seven years post-Separation. The TSAs primarily involve Pfizer providing services to Viatris related to finance, IT and human resource infrastructure and are generally
expected to be for terms of no more than three years post-Separation. The amounts recorded under the above agreements were not material to our consolidated results of operations in
2022, 2021 and 2020.
Net amounts due to Viatris under the above agreements were $94 million as of December 31, 2022 and net amounts due from Viatris under the above arrangements were $53 million as of
December 31, 2021. The cash flows associated with the above agreements are included in Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations, except for a $277 million
payment to Viatris made in 2021 pursuant to terms of the separation agreement, which is reported in Other financing activities, net.

C. Equity-Method Investments
Haleon/Consumer Healthcare JV––On July 31, 2019, we completed a transaction in which we and GSK combined our respective consumer healthcare businesses into a new JV that
operated globally under the GSK Consumer Healthcare name. In exchange for the contribution of our consumer healthcare business to the JV, we received a 32% equity stake in the new
company and GSK owned the remaining 68%. On July 18, 2022, GSK completed a demerger of the Consumer Healthcare JV which became Haleon, an independent, publicly traded
company listed on the London Stock Exchange that holds the joint Consumer Healthcare business of GSK and Pfizer following the demerger. We continue to own 32% of the ordinary
shares of Haleon after the demerger, and we account for our interest in Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV as an equity-method investment.
The carrying value of our investment in Haleon as of December 31, 2022 and in the Consumer Healthcare JV as of December 31, 2021 is $10.8 billion and $16.3 billion, respectively, and is
reported in Equity-method investments. The fair value of our investment in Haleon as of December 31, 2022, based on quoted market prices of Haleon stock, was $11.7 billion. Haleon/the
Consumer Healthcare JV is a foreign investee whose reporting currency is the U.K. pound, and therefore we translate its financial statements into U.S. dollars and recognize the impact of
foreign currency translation adjustments in the carrying value of our investment and in other comprehensive income. The decrease in the value of our investment from December 31, 2021
to December 31, 2022 is primarily due to dividends totaling approximately $4.5 billion, of which cash flows of $4.0 billion are included in Net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities
and $584 million are included in Net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $1.4 billion in pre-tax foreign currency translation adjustments (see Note 6), partially offset by our share
of Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV’s earnings. We record our share of earnings from Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV on a quarterly basis on a one-quarter lag in Other
(income)/deductions––net. Our total share of Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV’s earnings generated in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first nine months of 2022, which we recorded in
our operating results in 2022, was $536 million. Our total share of the JV’s earnings generated in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first nine months of 2021, which we recorded in our
operating results in 2021, was $495 million. Our total share of the JV’s earnings generated in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first nine months of 2020, which we recorded in our
operating results in 2020, was $417 million. As part of the initial accounting for our investment in the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019, we determined that the difference between the initial
fair value of our investment less our underlying equity in the carrying value of the net assets of the JV resulted in an initial excess basis difference of $4.8 billion. We allocated the difference
primarily to inventory, definite-lived intangible assets, indefinite-lived intangible assets, related deferred tax liabilities, and equity-method goodwill. We recognize amortization of these basis
differences in Other (income)/deductions––net. Amortization of basis differences on inventory and related deferred tax liabilities was completely recognized by the second quarter of 2020.
Basis differences on definite-lived intangible assets and related deferred tax liabilities are being amortized over the lives of the underlying assets, which range from 8 to 20 years. In 2022,
our equity-method income included in Other (income)/ deductions––net also includes charges of $100 million, primarily for adjustments to our equity-method basis differences related to the
separation of Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV from GSK. The total amortization and adjustment of basis differences was not material to our results of operations in 2021 and 2020. See

In connection with GSK’s previously announced planned demerger of at least 80% of GSK’s 68% equity interest in the Consumer Healthcare JV, in March 2022 the Consumer Healthcare
JV completed its offering of a total aggregate principal amount of $8.75 billion in U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes of various maturities, €2.35 billion in euro-denominated senior notes
of various maturities and £700 million in U.K. pound-denominated senior notes of various maturities (collectively, the “notes”). The notes were guaranteed by GSK generally up to and
excluding the date of the demerger (the “Guarantee Assumption Date”). We agreed to indemnify GSK for 32% (representing our pro rata equity interest in the Consumer Healthcare JV) of
any amount payable by GSK pursuant to its guarantee of the notes. Our indemnity was provided solely for the benefit of GSK. Neither we nor any of our subsidiaries were an issuer or
guarantor of any of the notes.
Following its issuance of the notes in March 2022, which fell in our international second quarter of 2022, the Consumer Healthcare JV loaned to us and GSK the net proceeds received from
the notes on a pro rata equity ownership basis, for which we received a loan of £2.9 billion ($3.7 billion as of the end of our second quarter of 2022), at an interest rate of 1.365% per annum
payable semi-annually in arrears. In conjunction with the demerger, we received £3.5 billion ($4.2 billion) in dividends from the JV in July 2022, of which $4.0 billion related to a one-time
pre-separation dividend, which decreased the carrying value of our investment (as discussed above). Simultaneous with the receipt of the dividends, we repaid the £2.9 billion loan from the
JV. GSK similarly received pro rata dividends and simultaneously repaid its pro rata loan from the JV. In conjunction with these transactions, our indemnification of GSK’s guarantee
discussed above was terminated.
Investment in ViiV––In 2009, we and GSK created ViiV, which is focused on research, development and commercialization of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) medicines. We own
approximately 11.7% of ViiV, and prior to 2016 we accounted for our investment under the equity method due to the significant influence that we have over the operations of ViiV through our
board representation and minority veto rights. We suspended application of the equity method to our investment in ViiV in 2016 when the carrying value of our investment was reduced to
zero due to the recognition of cumulative equity-method losses and dividends, and therefore we no longer record our proportionate share of ViiV’s net income (loss) in our results of
operations. Since 2016, we have recognized dividends from ViiV as income in Other (income)/deductions––net when earned, including dividends of $314 million in 2022, $166 million in
2021 and $278 million in 2020 (see Note 4).

D. Licensing Arrangements
Agreement with Valneva––On April 30, 2020, we signed an agreement to co-develop and commercialize Valneva’s Lyme disease vaccine candidate, VLA15, which covers six serotypes that
are prevalent in North America and Europe. Valneva and Pfizer will work closely together throughout the development of VLA15. Valneva is eligible to receive a total of up to $308 million in
cash payments from us consisting of a $130 million upfront payment, which was paid and recorded in Acquired in-process research and development expenses in our second quarter of
2020, as well as $35 million in development milestones which were paid and recorded in Acquired in-process research and development expenses in 2021 and 2022, and $143 million in
early commercialization milestones which remain unpaid. Under the terms of the agreement, Valneva was to fund 30% of all development costs through completion of the development
program, and in return we were to pay Valneva tiered royalties. We will lead late-stage development and have sole control over commercialization.
In June 2022, we entered into an Equity Subscription Agreement, under which we invested €90.5 million ($95 million) in Valneva to further support our strategic Lyme arrangement. In
addition, we updated the terms of our existing agreement for VLA15. Valneva will now fund 40% of the remaining shared development costs, and we will pay Valneva tiered royalties ranging
from 14% to 22%, compared to royalties starting at 19% in the initial agreement. In addition, the royalties will be complemented by up to $100 million in milestones payable to Valneva based
on cumulative sales. Other early commercialization milestones are unchanged. As of December 31, 2022, we held a 6.9% equity stake of Valneva.
E. Collaborative Arrangements
We enter into collaborative arrangements with respect to in-line medicines, as well as medicines in development that require completion of research and regulatory approval. Collaborative
arrangements are contractual agreements with third parties that involve a joint operating activity, typically a research and/or commercialization effort, where both we and our partner are
active participants in the activity and are exposed to the significant risks and rewards of the activity. Our rights and obligations under our collaborative arrangements vary. For example, we
have agreements to co-promote pharmaceutical products discovered by us or other companies, and we have agreements where we partner to co-develop and/or participate together in
commercializing, marketing, promoting, manufacturing and/or distributing a drug product.
Collaboration with Biohaven––In November 2021, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement and related sublicense agreement with Biohaven and certain of its subsidiaries to
commercialize rimegepant and zavegepant for the treatment and prevention of migraines outside of the U.S., subject to regulatory approval. Under the terms of the agreement, Biohaven
would lead R&D globally and we would have the exclusive right to commercialization globally, outside of the U.S. Upon the closing of the transaction on January 4, 2022, we paid Biohaven
$500 million, including an upfront payment of $150 million and an equity investment of $350 million. We recognized $263 million for the upfront payment and premium paid on our equity
investment in Acquired in-process research and development expenses. In October 2022, we acquired all outstanding common shares of Biohaven not already owned by us for $148.50 per
share, in cash, for payments of approximately $11.5 billion. See Note 2A. This acquisition represented a settlement of the pre-existing relationship, and we determined that no gain or loss
was required to be recognized.
Collaborations with BioNTech––On December 30, 2021, we entered into a research, development and commercialization agreement to develop a potential first mRNA-based vaccine for the
prevention of shingles (herpes zoster virus) based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology and our antigen technology. Under the terms of the agreement, we agreed to pay BioNTech
$225 million, including an upfront cash payment of $75 million and an equity investment of $150 million. BioNTech is eligible to receive future regulatory and sales milestone payments of up
to $200 million. In return, BioNTech agreed to pay us $25 million for our proprietary antigen technology. The net upfront payment to BioNTech was recorded to Acquired in-process research
and development expenses in our fourth quarter of 2021. We and BioNTech share development costs. We will have commercialization rights to the potential vaccine worldwide, excluding
Germany, Turkey and certain developing countries where BioNTech will have commercialization rights. We and BioNTech will share gross profits from commercialization of any product.
On April 9, 2020, we signed a global agreement with BioNTech to co-develop a mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine program aimed at preventing COVID-19 infection, which resulted in the
development of Comirnaty. In connection with the April 2020 agreement, we made an upfront cash payment of $72 million and an equity investment in the common stock of BioNTech of
$113 million. We recognized $98 million for the upfront payment and a premium paid on the equity investment in Acquired in-process research and development expenses in our second
quarter of 2020. BioNTech became eligible to receive potential milestone payments of up to $563 million for a total consideration of $748 million. Under the terms of this agreement, we and
BioNTech share gross profits and development costs equally after approval and successful commercialization of the vaccine, and we were responsible for all of the development costs until
commercialization of the vaccine. Thereafter, BioNTech was to repay us its 50 percent share of these development costs through reductions in gross profit sharing and milestone payments
to BioNTech over time. On January 29, 2021, we and BioNTech signed an amended version of the April 2020 agreement. Under the January 2021 agreement, BioNTech paid us their 50
percent share of prior development costs in a lump sum payment during the first quarter of 2021. Further R&D costs are being shared equally. We have commercialization rights to the
vaccine worldwide, excluding Germany and Turkey where BioNTech markets and distributes the vaccine under the agreement with us, and excluding China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan,
which are subject to a separate collaboration between BioNTech and Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd. We recognize

We made an additional investment of $50 million in common stock of BioNTech as part of an underwritten equity offering by BioNTech, which closed in July 2020. As of December 31, 2022,
we held an equity stake of 2.7% of BioNTech.
Collaboration with Beam––On December 24, 2021, we entered into a multi-year research collaboration with Beam to utilize Beam’s in vivo base editing programs, which use mRNA and lipid
nanoparticles, for three targets for rare genetic diseases of the liver, muscle and central nervous system. Under the terms of the agreement, Beam conducts all research activities through
development candidate selection for three undisclosed targets, which are not included in Beam’s existing programs, and we may opt in to obtain exclusive licenses to each development
candidate. Beam has a right to opt in, at the end of phase 1/2 studies, upon the payment by Beam of an option exercise fee, to a global co-development and co-commercialization
agreement with respect to one program licensed under the collaboration pursuant to which we and Beam would share net profits as well as development and commercialization costs in a
65%/35% ratio (Pfizer/Beam). Upon entering into the agreement, we recorded $300 million in Acquired in-process research and development expenses in the fourth quarter of 2021 for an
upfront payment due to Beam, and if we exercise our opt in to licenses for all three targets, Beam will be eligible for up to an additional $1.05 billion in development, regulatory and
commercial milestone payments for a potential total deal consideration of up to $1.35 billion. Beam is also eligible to receive royalties on global net sales for each licensed program.
Collaboration with Arvinas––On July 21, 2021, we entered into a global collaboration with Arvinas to develop and commercialize ARV-471, an investigational oral PROTAC (PROteolysis
TArgeting Chimera) estrogen receptor protein degrader. The estrogen receptor is a well-known disease driver in most breast cancers. In connection with the agreement, we made an upfront
cash payment of $650 million to Arvinas and we made a $350 million equity investment in the common stock of Arvinas. We recognized $706 million for the upfront payment and a premium
paid on our equity investment in Acquired in-process research and development expenses in our third quarter of 2021. Arvinas is also eligible to receive up to $400 million in approval
milestones and up to $1 billion in commercial milestones. The companies will equally share worldwide development costs, commercialization expenses and profits. As of December 31,
2022, we held a 6.5% equity stake of Arvinas.
Collaboration with Myovant––On December 26, 2020, we entered into a collaboration with Myovant to jointly develop and commercialize Orgovyx (relugolix) in advanced prostate cancer
and Myfembree (relugolix 40 mg, estradiol 1.0 mg, and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) in women’s health in the U.S. and Canada. We also received an exclusive option to commercialize
relugolix in oncology outside the U.S. and Canada, excluding certain Asian countries, which we declined to exercise. Under the terms of the agreement, the companies equally share profits
and allowable expenses in the U.S. for Orgovyx, and in the U.S. and Canada for Myfembree, with Myovant bearing our share of allowable expenses up to a maximum of $100 million in
2021 and up to a maximum of $50 million in 2022. Pfizer does not have rights outside of these markets. We record our share of gross profits as Alliance revenue. Myovant remains
responsible for regulatory interactions and drug supply and continues to lead clinical development for Myfembree. Myovant is entitled to receive up to $4.35 billion, including an upfront
payment of $650 million, which was made in December 2020, $200 million in potential regulatory milestones for FDA approvals for Myfembree in women’s health, all of which has been paid
to Myovant as of December 31, 2022 and recognized as Identifiable intangible assets—Developed technology rights, and tiered sales milestones of up to $3.5 billion in total for prostate
cancer and for the combined women’s health indications for which commercial sales have commenced. In connection with this transaction, in 2020 we recognized $499 million in Identifiable
intangible assets––Developed technology rights and $151 million in Acquired in-process research and development expenses representing the relative fair value of the portion of the upfront
payment allocated to the approved indication and unapproved indications of the product, respectively.
Collaboration with CStone––On September 29, 2020, we entered into a strategic collaboration with CStone to address oncological needs in China. The collaboration encompasses our $200
million upfront equity investment in CStone, the development and commercialization of CStone’s sugemalimab (CS1001, PD-L1 antibody) in mainland China, and a framework between the
companies to bring additional oncology assets to the Greater China market. The transaction closed on October 9, 2020. As of December 31, 2022, we held a 9.7% equity stake of CStone.

Note 3.  Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives
A. Transforming to a More Focused Company Program
With the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019 and the spin-off of our former Upjohn Business in the fourth quarter of 2020, Pfizer transformed into a more focused, global
leader in science-based innovative medicines and vaccines. We took efforts to ensure our cost base and support model aligned appropriately with our operating structure. While certain
direct costs transferred to the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019, and to the Upjohn Business in connection with the spin-off, there are indirect costs which did not transfer. This program is
primarily composed of the following initiatives:
•We took steps to restructure our corporate enabling functions to appropriately support our business, R&D and PGS platform functions. Actions included, among others, changes in
location of certain activities, expanded use and co-location of centers of excellence and shared services, and increased use of digital technologies. The associated actions and the
specific costs primarily included severance and benefit plan impacts, exit costs as well as associated implementation costs.
•In addition, we transformed our commercial go-to market model in the way we engage patients and physicians. We also made several organizational changes in the third quarter of 2022
to further transform our operations to better leverage our expertise in certain areas and in anticipation of potential future new product or indication launches (see Note 1A). Actions
included, among others, centralization of certain activities and enhanced use of digital technologies. The costs for this effort primarily included severance and associated implementation
costs.
•We also optimized our manufacturing network under this program and incurred one-time costs for cost-reduction initiatives related to our manufacturing operations. The costs for this
effort included, among other things, severance costs, implementation costs, product transfer costs, site exit costs, as well as accelerated depreciation.
•In the fourth quarter of 2022, we began taking steps to optimize our end-to-end R&D operations to reduce costs and cycle times as well as to further prioritize our internal R&D portfolio in
areas where our capabilities are differentiated while increasing external innovation efforts to leverage an expanding and productive biotech sector. Actions include leveraging automation
and digital capabilities, novel clinical development approaches and capabilities, and externalization of select assets and R&D units. We expect costs for this effort of $500 million to be
incurred primarily through 2023, with costs to primarily represent cash expenditures. The costs for this effort primarily include severance costs and associated implementation costs.
From the start of this program in the fourth quarter of 2019 through December 31, 2022, we incurred costs of $3.5 billion, of which $1.4 billion ($1.0 billion of restructuring charges) is
associated with Biopharma. We have incurred approximately 85% of total expected costs to date, and we expect the remaining costs to be substantially incurred through 2023.

Reflects intangible assets written down to fair value in 2022. Fair value was determined using the income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method, also known as the discounted cash flow
method. We started with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows for the asset and then applied an asset-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. Some of the more significant estimates
and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on the product; the
discount rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows.

Income from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes on income $ 34,729 $ 24,311 $ 7,036 
2022 v. 2021––The decrease in domestic income is primarily related to net losses on equity securities in 2022 versus net gains on equity securities in 2021, lower net periodic benefit credits and higher
restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs, partially offset by Paxlovid income and lower acquired IPR&D expenses. The increase in the international income is primarily related to Paxlovid and
Comirnaty income partially offset by lower net periodic benefit credits.
2021 v. 2020––The domestic income in 2021 versus domestic loss in 2020 was mainly related to Comirnaty income, lower asset impairment charges, net periodic benefit credits in 2021 versus net periodic benefit
costs in 2020 and higher net gains from equity securities, partially offset by higher R&D expenses. The increase in the international income was primarily related to Comirnaty income, net periodic benefit credits in
2021 versus net periodic benefit costs in 2020 and lower asset impairment charges.

The changes in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income impacting the effective tax rate year-over-year are summarized below:
2022 v. 2021
The higher effective tax rate in 2022 was mainly the result of:
•the non-recurrence of certain initiatives executed in 2021 associated with our investment in the Consumer Healthcare JV with GSK based on estimates and assumptions that we believe
to be reasonable,
partially offset by:
•tax benefits in 2022 related to global income tax resolutions in multiple tax jurisdictions spanning multiple tax years that included the closing of U.S. IRS audits covering five tax years.
2021 v. 2020
The higher effective tax rate in 2021 was mainly the result of:
•the change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings primarily related to Comirnaty; and
•lower tax benefits related to the impairment of intangible assets,
partially offset by:
•certain initiatives executed in the third quarter of 2021 associated with our investment in the Consumer Healthcare JV with GSK based on estimates and assumptions that we believe to
be reasonable.
In all years, federal, state and international net tax liabilities assumed or established as part of a business acquisition are not included in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income (see Note
2A).
We elected, with the filing of our 2018 U.S. Federal Consolidated Income Tax Return, to pay our initial estimated $15 billion repatriation tax liability on accumulated post-1986 foreign
earnings over eight years through 2026. The fourth annual installment of this liability was paid by its April 18, 2022 due date. The fifth annual installment is due April 18, 2023 and is reported
in current Income taxes payable as of December 31, 2022. The remaining liability is reported in noncurrent Other taxes payable. Our obligations may vary as a result of changes in our
uncertain tax positions and/or availability of attributes such as foreign tax and other credit carryforwards.
B. Tax Rate Reconciliation
The reconciliation of the U.S. statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate for Income from continuing operations follows:
 Year Ended December 31,
2022 2021 2020
U.S. statutory income tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %
Taxation of non-U.S. operations (5.0) (4.3) (9.9)
Tax settlements and resolution of certain tax positions (3.0) (0.4) (2.7)
Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction (1.9) (0.6) — 
Certain Consumer Healthcare JV initiatives — (6.0) — 
U.S. R&D tax credit (0.6) (0.5) (1.4)
Interest 0.2 0.4 1.1 
All other, net (1.1) (2.0) (2.8)
Effective tax rate for income from continuing operations 9.6 % 7.6 % 5.3 %
For taxation of non-U.S. operations, this rate impact reflects the income tax rates and relative earnings in the locations where we do business outside the U.S., together with the U.S. tax cost on our international
operations, changes in uncertain tax positions not included in the reconciling item called “Tax settlements and resolution of certain tax positions,” as well as changes in valuation allowances. Specifically: (i) the
jurisdictional location of earnings is a significant component of our effective tax rate each year, and the rate impact of this component is influenced by the specific location of non-U.S. earnings and the level of
such earnings as compared to our total earnings; (ii) the U.S. tax implications of our foreign operations is a significant component of our effective tax rate each year and generally offsets some of the reduction to
our effective tax rate each year resulting from the jurisdictional location of earnings; (iii) the impact of certain tax initiatives; and (iv) the impact of changes in uncertain tax positions not included in the reconciling
item called “Tax settlements and resolution of certain tax positions” is a component of our effective tax rate each year that can result in either an increase or decrease to our effective tax rate. The jurisdictional
mix of earnings, which includes the impact of the location of earnings as well as the U.S. tax cost on our international operations, can vary as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business
and as a result of the extent and location of other income and expense items, such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and gains and losses on strategic business decisions. See also Note 5A for the
components of pre-tax income and Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income, which is based on the location of the taxing authorities, and for information about settlements and other items impacting
Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income.
In all years, the reduction in our effective tax rate is a result of the jurisdictional location of earnings and is largely due to lower tax rates in certain jurisdictions, as well as manufacturing and other incentives for
our subsidiaries in Singapore and, to a lesser extent, in Puerto Rico. We benefit from Puerto Rican tax incentives pursuant to a grant that expires during 2053. Under such grant, we are partially exempt from
income, property and municipal taxes. In Singapore, we benefit from incentive tax rates effective through 2048 on income from manufacturing and other operations.
See Note 5A.
The higher rate benefit from the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction in 2022 is mainly the result of the TCJA requirement to capitalize R&D costs for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021.
Includes changes in interest related to our uncertain tax positions not included in the reconciling item called “Tax settlements and resolution of certain tax positions”.

*The deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with global intangible low-taxed income are included in the relevant categories. See Note 1Q.
The increase in net deferred tax liabilities in 2022 is primarily due to the acquisition of intangible assets related to GBT, Arena and Biohaven, partially offset by the amortization of intangible assets and certain
impairment charges.
The decrease in net deferred tax assets in 2022 is primarily due to changes in pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as well as the performance of plan assets reported in the period. See Note 11.
The increase in deferred tax assets in 2022 is related to the TCJA requirement to capitalize R&D costs for tax years beginning after December 31,2021.
The increase in deferred tax assets in 2022 is primarily due to the acquisition of net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards related to Arena, GBT and Biohaven. See Note 2A.
The amounts in 2022 and 2021 are reduced for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.2 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, where we have net operating loss carryforwards, similar tax losses, and/or tax credit
carryforwards that are available, under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction, to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position.
The decrease in net deferred tax liabilities in 2022 is primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments related to our equity-method investment in Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV. See
Note 2C.
In 2022, Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets ($4.8 billion), and Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ($1.0 billion). In 2021, Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax
assets ($1.6 billion), and Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ($0.3 billion).
We have carryforwards, primarily related to net operating and capital losses, general business credits, foreign tax credits and charitable contributions, which are available to reduce future
U.S. federal and/or state, as well as international, income taxes payable with either an indefinite life or expiring at various times from 2023 to 2042. Certain of our U.S. net operating losses
and general business credits are subject to limitations under IRC Section 382.
As of December 31, 2022, we have not made a U.S. tax provision on $60.0 billion of unremitted earnings of our international subsidiaries. As these earnings are intended to be indefinitely
reinvested overseas, the determination of a hypothetical unrecognized deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2022 is not practicable. The amount of indefinitely reinvested earnings is
based on estimates and assumptions and subject to management evaluation, and is subject to change in the normal course of business based on operational cash flow, completion of local
statutory financial statements and the finalization of tax returns and audits, among other things. Accordingly, we regularly update our earnings and profits analysis for such events.
D. Tax Contingencies
For a description of our accounting policies associated with accounting for income tax contingencies, see Note 1Q.
Uncertain Tax Positions
As tax law is complex and often subject to varied interpretations, it is uncertain whether some of our tax positions will be sustained upon audit. As of December 31, 2022, we had $2.9 billion
and as of December 31, 2021, we had $4.5 billion in net unrecognized tax benefits, excluding associated interest.
•Tax assets for uncertain tax positions primarily represent our estimate of the potential tax benefits in one tax jurisdiction that could result from the payment of income taxes in another tax
jurisdiction. These potential benefits generally result from cooperative efforts among taxing authorities, as required by tax treaties to minimize double taxation, commonly referred to as
the competent authority process. The recoverability of these assets, which we believe to be more likely than not, is dependent upon the actual payment of taxes in one tax jurisdiction
and, in some cases, the successful petition for recovery in another tax jurisdiction. As of December 31, 2022, we had $1.5 billion in assets associated with uncertain tax positions. These
amounts were included in Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets ($1.5 billion) and Other taxes payable ($45 million). As of December 31, 2021, we had $1.5
billion in assets associated with uncertain(a)

•Substantially all of these unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact our effective income tax rate.
The reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits follows:

billion), Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ($5 million) and Other taxes payable ($3.0 billion).
•Interest related to our unrecognized tax benefits is recorded in accordance with the laws of each jurisdiction and is recorded primarily in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income. In 2022,
we recorded a net decrease in interest of $17 million. In 2021 and 2020, we recorded net increases in interest of $108 million and $89 million respectively. Gross accrued interest totaled
$552 million as of December 31, 2022 (reflecting a decrease of $31 million as a result of cash payments) and gross accrued interest totaled $601 million as of December 31, 2021
(reflecting a decrease of $1 million as a result of cash payments). In 2022 and 2021, these amounts were substantially all included in Other taxes payable. Accrued penalties are not
significant. See also Note 5A.
Status of Tax Matters and Potential Impact on Accruals for Uncertain Tax Positions
The U.S. is one of our major tax jurisdictions, and we are regularly audited by the IRS. During the third quarter of 2022, Pfizer reached resolution of disputed issues at the IRS Independent
Office of Appeals, thereby settling all issues related to U.S. tax returns of Pfizer for the years 2011-2015. With respect to Pfizer, tax years 2016-2018 are under audit. Tax years 2019-2022
are open but not under audit. All other tax years are closed. In addition to the open audit years in the U.S., we have open audit years and certain related audits, appeals and investigations in
certain major international tax jurisdictions such as Canada (2017-2022), Europe (2012-2022, primarily in Ireland, the U.K., France, Italy, Spain and Germany), Asia Pacific (2012-2022,
primarily in China, Japan and Singapore) and Latin America (1998-2022, primarily in Brazil).
Any settlements or statutes of limitations expirations could result in a significant decrease in our uncertain tax positions. We estimate that it is reasonably possible that within the next 12
months, our gross unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest, could decrease by as much as $100 million, as a result of settlements with taxing authorities or the expiration of the
statutes of limitations. Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but our estimates of unrecognized tax benefits and
potential tax benefits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and variation from such estimates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or when the
statutes of limitations expire, as we treat these events as discrete items in the period of resolution. Finalizing audits with the relevant taxing authorities can include formal administrative and
legal proceedings, and, as a result, it is difficult to estimate the timing and range of possible changes related to our uncertain tax positions, and such changes could be significant.(a)

par all $1.065 billion principal amount outstanding of our senior unsecured notes due in 2047.
E. Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities
Foreign Exchange Risk––A significant portion of our revenues, earnings and net investments in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. Where foreign exchange
risk is not offset by other exposures, we manage our foreign exchange risk principally through the use of derivative financial instruments and foreign currency debt. These financial
instruments serve to mitigate the impact on net income as a result of remeasurement into another currency, or against the impact of translation into U.S. dollars of certain foreign exchange-
denominated transactions.
The derivative financial instruments primarily hedge or offset exposures in the euro, U.K. pound, Japanese yen, and Canadian dollar, and include a portion of our forecasted foreign
exchange-denominated intercompany inventory sales hedged up to two years. We may seek to protect against possible declines in the reported net investments of our foreign business
entities.(a)

Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 75
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
Changes in fair value are reported in earnings or in Other comprehensive income/(loss), depending on the nature and purpose of the financial instrument (hedge or offset relationship). For
certain foreign exchange contracts, we exclude an amount from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize the excluded amount through an amortization approach in earnings.
The hedge relationships are as follows:
•Generally, we recognize the gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts that are designated as fair value hedges in earnings upon the recognition of the change in fair value of the
hedged item. We also recognize the offsetting foreign exchange impact attributable to the hedged item in earnings.
•Generally, we record in Other comprehensive income/(loss) gains or losses on foreign exchange contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges and reclassify those amounts into
earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
•We record in Other comprehensive income/(loss) ––Foreign currency translation adjustments, net the foreign exchange gains and losses related to foreign exchange-denominated debt
and foreign exchange contracts designated as a hedge of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries and reclassify those amounts into earnings upon the sale or substantial liquidation of
our net investments.
•For foreign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments, we recognize the gains and losses immediately into earnings along with the earnings impact of the items they
generally offset. These contracts take the opposite currency position of that reflected on the balance sheet to counterbalance the effect of any currency movement.
Interest Rate Risk––Our interest-bearing investments and borrowings are subject to interest rate risk. Depending on market conditions, we may change the profile of our outstanding debt or
investments by entering into derivative financial instruments like interest rate swaps, either to hedge or offset the exposure to changes in the fair value of hedged items with fixed interest
rates, or to convert variable rate debt or investments to fixed rates. The derivative financial instruments primarily hedge U.S. dollar fixed-rate debt.
We recognize the change in fair value on interest rate contracts that are designated as fair value hedges in earnings, as well as the offsetting earnings impact of the hedged risk attributable
to the hedged item.

The amounts reclassified from OCI into COS were a net gain of $375 million in 2022 and a net loss of $89 million in 2021. The remaining amounts were reclassified from OCI into OID. Based on year-end foreign
exchange rates that are subject to change, we expect to reclassify a pre-tax loss of $107 million within the next 12 months into income. The maximum length of time over which we are hedging our exposure to the
variability in future foreign exchange cash flows is approximately 20 years and relates to foreign currency debt.
The amounts reclassified from OCI were reclassified into OID.
Short-term borrowings and long-term debt include foreign currency borrowings which are used as net investment hedges. The short-term borrowings’ carrying value as of December 31, 2021 was $1.1 billion. The
long-term debt carrying values as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were $795 million and $844 million, respectively.

F. Credit Risk
On an ongoing basis, we monitor and review the credit risk of our customers, financial institutions and exposures in our investment portfolio.
With respect to our trade accounts receivable, we monitor the creditworthiness of our customers to which we grant credit in the normal course of business. In general, there is no
requirement for collateral from customers. For additional information on our trade accounts receivable and(a) (a) (a)

allowance for credit losses, see Note 1G. A significant portion of our trade accounts receivable balances are due from wholesalers and governments. For additional information on our trade
accounts receivables with significant customers, see Note 17C.
With respect to our investments, we monitor concentrations of credit risk associated with government, government agency, and corporate issuers of securities. Investments are placed in
instruments that are investment grade and are primarily short in duration. Exposure limits are established to limit a concentration with any single credit counterparty. As of December 31,
2022, the largest investment exposures in our portfolio represent primarily sovereign debt instruments issued by the Netherlands, Canada, Germany, Japan, the U.K., the U.S., and France.
With respect to our derivative financial instrument agreements with financial institutions, we do not expect to incur a significant loss from failure of any counterparty. Derivative financial
instruments are executed under International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreements with credit-support annexes that contain zero threshold provisions requiring collateral
to be exchanged daily depending on levels of exposure. As a result, there are no significant concentrations of credit risk with any individual financial institution. As of December 31, 2022, the
aggregate fair value of these derivative financial instruments that are in a net payable position was $888 million, for which we have posted collateral of $901 million with a corresponding
amount reported in Short-term investments. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate fair value of our derivative financial instruments that are in a net receivable position was $435 million,
for which we have received collateral of $337 million with a corresponding amount reported in Short-term borrowings, including current portion of long-term debt.

The increase in the gross carrying amounts mainly reflect the impact of the acquisitions of Biohaven and GBT (see Note 2A).
The increase in the gross carrying amounts mainly reflect the impact of the acquisitions of Arena, GBT and Biohaven (see Note 2A), and for IPR&D, is partially offset by an impairment (see Note 4).
The increase is primarily due to acquisitions (see Note 2A), partially offset by amortization expense.
Developed Technology Rights––Developed technology rights represent the cost for developed technology acquired from third parties and can include the right to develop, use, market, sell
and/or offer for sale the product, compounds and intellectual property that we have acquired with respect to products, compounds and/or processes that have been completed. We possess
a well-diversified portfolio of hundreds of developed technology rights across therapeutic categories, representing our commercialized products. The significant components of developed
technology rights are the following: Nurtec ODT/Vydura, Xtandi, Prevnar family, Braftovi/Mektovi, Oxbryta, Premarin, Eucrisa, Orgovyx, Zavicefta, Bavencio and Merrem/Meronem. Also
included in this category are the post-approval milestone payments made under our alliance agreements for certain prescription pharmaceutical products.
Brands––Brands represent the cost for tradenames and know-how, as the products themselves do not receive patent protection. Indefinite-lived brands include Medrol and Depo-Medrol,
while finite-lived brands include Zavedos and Depo-Provera.
IPR&D––IPR&D assets represent R&D assets acquired through business combinations that have not yet received regulatory approval in a major market. The significant components of
IPR&D are etrasimod, GBT601, talazoparib, Braftovi/Mektovi and zavegepant. IPR&D assets are required to be classified as indefinite-lived assets until the successful completion or the
abandonment of the associated R&D effort. Accordingly, during the development period after the date of acquisition, these assets are not amortized until approval is obtained in a major
market, typically either the U.S. or the EU, or in a series of other countries, subject to certain specified conditions and management judgment. At that time, we will determine the useful life of
the asset, reclassify it out of IPR&D and begin amortization. If the associated R&D effort is abandoned, the related IPR&D assets will be written-off, and we will record an impairment charge.
IPR&D assets are high-risk assets, given the uncertain nature of R&D. Accordingly, IPR&D assets may become impaired and/or be written-off in the future.
Licensing Agreements––Licensing agreements for developed technology and for technology in development primarily relate to out-licensing arrangements acquired from third parties,
including the Array and Arena acquisition. These assets represent the cost for the license, where we acquired the right to future royalties and/or milestones upon development or
commercialization by the licensing partner. A significant component of the licensing arrangements are for out-licensing arrangements with a number of partners for oncology technology in
varying stages of development that have not yet received regulatory approval in a major market. Accordingly, during the development period after the date of acquisition, each of these
assets is classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets and will not be amortized until approval is obtained in a major market. At that time we will determine the useful life of the asset,
reclassify the respective licensing arrangement asset to finite-lived intangible asset and begin amortization. If the development effort is abandoned, the related licensing asset will be written-
off, and we will record an impairment charge.
Amortization––The weighted-average life for each of our total finite-lived intangible assets is approximately 9 years, and for the largest component, developed technology rights, is
approximately 8 years. Total amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets was $3.6 billion in 2022, $3.7 billion in 2021 and $3.4 billion in 2020.
The following provides the expected annual amortization expense:

As a result of the organizational changes to the commercial structure within the Biopharma operating segment effective in the third quarter of 2022 (see Note 1A), our goodwill was required to be reallocated
amongst impacted reporting units. The allocation of goodwill is a complex process that requires, among other things, that we determine the fair value of each reporting unit under our old and new organizational
structure and the portions being transferred. We completed this re-allocation during the fourth quarter 2022 and concluded that none of our goodwill was impaired. Our goodwill balance continues to be assigned
within the Biopharma reportable segment.
Additions relate to our acquisitions of GBT, Arena and Biohaven. See Note 2A.
Note 1 1. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans and Defined Contribution Plans
The majority of our employees worldwide are eligible for retirement benefits provided through defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we sponsor both
IRC-qualified and supplemental (non-qualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. A qualified plan meets the requirements of certain sections of the IRC, and, generally,
contributions to qualified plans are tax deductible. A qualified plan typically provides benefits to a broad group of employees with restrictions on discriminating in favor of highly compensated
employees with regard to coverage, benefits and contributions. A supplemental (non-qualified) plan provides additional benefits to certain employees. In addition, we provide medical
insurance benefits to certain retirees and their eligible dependents through our postretirement plans.

Interest cost 1.5 % 1.2 % 1.5 %

Weighted-average assumptions used to
determine benefit obligations at fiscal year-end:
Discount rate 5.4 % 2.9 % 2.6 % 3.8 % 1.6 % 1.5 % 5.5 % 2.9 % 2.5 %
Rate of compensation increase 3.0 % 2.8 % 2.9 %
The rate of compensation increase is not used to determine the net periodic benefit cost and benefit obligation for the U.S. pension plans as these plans are frozen.
All of the assumptions are reviewed at least annually. We revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of long-term trends as well as market conditions that may have an impact
on the cost of providing retirement benefits.
The weighted-average discount rate for our U.S. defined benefit plans is set with reference to the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality fixed income investments, rated AA/Aa
or better that reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. For our international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade
corporate bonds rated AA/Aa or better, including, when there is sufficient data, a yield curve approach. These rate determinations are made consistent with local requirements. Overall, the
yield curves used to measure the benefit obligations at year-end 2022 resulted in substantially higher discount rates as compared to the prior year.
The following provides the healthcare cost trend rate assumptions for our U.S. postretirement benefit plans:
As of December 31,
2022 2021
Healthcare cost trend rate assumed for next year 6.4 % 6.0 %

For the U.S. pension plans, the benefit obligation is both the PBO and ABO as these plans are frozen and future benefit accruals no longer increase with future compensation increases. For the international
pension plans, the benefit obligation is the PBO. The ABO for our international pension plans was $7.2 billion in 2022 and $11.2 billion in 2021. For the postretirement plans, the benefit obligation is the ABO.
For both 2022 and 2021, primarily includes actuarial gains resulting from increases in discount rates, offset by increases in inflation assumptions for the international plan.
For more information, see Note 2B.
As a result of a group annuity contract entered into between Pfizer and a third party insurance company in July 2022, the third party insurance company assumed future benefit obligations and responsibility for the
annuity payments of certain retirees in the Pfizer Consolidated Pension Plan. As of December 31, 2022, $586 million of benefit obligations and $588 million of plan assets are associated with this contract. We
expect to finalize the remaining regulatory approvals for this transaction in due course.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of our pension and postretirement plans’ assets:
•Cash and cash equivalents: Level 1 investments may include cash, cash equivalents and foreign currency valued using exchange rates. Level 2 investments may include short-term
investment funds which are commingled funds priced at a stable NAV by the administrator of the funds.
•Equity securities: Level 1 investments may include individual securities that are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which they are traded. Level 1
and Level 2 investments may include commingled funds that have a readily determinable fair value based on quoted prices on an exchange or a published NAV derived from the quoted
prices in active markets of the underlying securities. Level 3 investments may include individual securities that are unlisted, delisted, suspended, or illiquid and are typically valued using
their last available price.
•Fixed income securities: Level 1 investments may include individual securities that are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which they are traded.
Level 2 investments may include commingled funds that have a readily determinable fair value based on observable prices of the underlying securities. Level 2 investments may include
corporate bonds, government and government agency obligations and other fixed income securities valued using bid evaluation pricing models or quoted prices of securities with similar
characteristics. Level 3 investments may include securities that are valued using alternative pricing sources, such as investment managers or brokers, which use proprietary pricing
models that incorporate unobservable inputs.
•Other investments: Level 1 investments may include individual securities that are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which they are traded. Level 2
investments may include insurance contracts which invest in interest bearing cash, U.S. government securities and corporate debt instruments. Level 3 investments may include
securities or insurance contracts that are valued using alternative pricing sources, such as investment managers or brokers, which use proprietary pricing models that incorporate
unobservable inputs.
Equity securities, Fixed income securities and Other investments may each be combined into commingled funds. Most commingled funds are valued to reflect the interest in the fund based
on the reported year-end NAV. Partnership and Other investments are valued based on year-end reported NAV (or its equivalent), with adjustments as appropriate for lagged reporting of up
to three months.
Certain investments are authorized to include derivatives, such as equity or bond futures, swaps, options and currency futures or forwards for managing risks and exposures.
Global plan assets are managed with the objective of generating returns that will enable the plans to meet their future obligations, while seeking to manage net periodic benefit costs and
cash contributions over the long-term. We utilize long-term asset allocation ranges in the management of our plans’ invested assets. Our long-term return expectations are developed based
on a diversified, global investment strategy that takes into account historical experience, as well as the impact of portfolio diversification, active portfolio management, and our view of
current and future economic and financial market conditions. As market conditions and other factors change, we may adjust our targets accordingly and our asset allocations may vary from
the target allocations.
E. Cash Flows
It is our practice to fund amounts for our qualified pension plans that are at least sufficient to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable employee benefit laws and local tax
laws.
The following provides the expected future cash flow information related to our benefit plans:
  Pension Plans Postretirement Plans
(MILLIONS) U.S. International
Expected employer contributions:
2023 $ 111 $ 147 $ (53)
Expected benefit payments:
2023 $ 982 $ 364 $ 42 
2024 947 365 43 
2025 920 372 44 
2026 901 379 44 
2027 885 392 43 
2028–2032 4,218 2,069 192 
For the U.S. postretirement plan, the IRC 401(h) and voluntary employees’ beneficiary association reimbursements totaling $95 million are expected to exceed expected employer contributions.
The above table reflects the total U.S. and international plan benefits projected to be paid from the plans or from our general assets under the current actuarial assumptions used for the
calculation of the benefit obligation.
F. Defined Contribution Plans
We have defined contribution plans in the U.S. and other countries. For the majority of the U.S. defined contribution plans, employees may contribute a portion of their salaries and bonuses
to the plans, and we match, in cash, a portion of the employee contributions. We also offer a Retirement Savings Contribution (RSC) which is an annual non-contributory employer
contribution in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. We recorded charges related to the employer contributions to global defined contribution plans of $770 million in 2022, $732 million in 2021 and
$685 million in 2020.(a)

Note 12. Equity
A. Common Stock Purchases
We purchase our common stock through privately negotiated transactions or in the open market as circumstances and prices warrant. Purchased shares under a share-purchase plan,
which is authorized by our BOD, are available for general corporate purposes. In December 2018, the BOD authorized a $10 billion share repurchase program to be utilized over time and
share repurchases commenced thereunder in the first quarter of 2019.
In the first quarter of 2022, we purchased 39 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $2 billion under our publicly announced share purchase plan. Our remaining share-purchase
authorization was approximately $3.3 billion at December 31, 2022.
B. Preferred Stock and Employee Stock Ownership Plans
Prior to May 4, 2020, we had outstanding Series A convertible perpetual preferred stock (the Series A Preferred Stock) that was held by an ESOP trust (the Trust). All outstanding shares of
Series A Preferred Stock were converted, at the direction of the independent fiduciary under the Trust and in accordance with the certificate of designations for the Series A Preferred Stock,
into shares of our common stock on May 4, 2020. The Trust received an aggregate of 1,070,369 shares of our common stock upon conversion, with zero shares of Series A Preferred Stock
remaining outstanding as a result of the conversion. In December 2020, we filed a certificate of elimination to our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended and a restated certificate
of incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State, which eliminated the Series A Preferred Stock.
We have one ESOP that holds common stock of the Company (Common ESOP). As of December 31, 2022, all shares of common stock held by the Common ESOP have been allocated to
the Pfizer U.S. defined contribution plan participants. The compensation cost related to the Common ESOP was $19 million for each of 2022, 2021 and 2020.
Note 13. Share-Based Payments
Our compensation programs can include share-based payment awards with value that is determined by reference to the fair value of our shares and that provide for the grant of shares or
options to acquire shares or similar arrangements. Our share-based awards are designed based on competitive survey data or industry peer groups used for compensation purposes, and
are allocated between different long-term incentive awards, generally in the form of Total Shareholder Return Units (TSRUs), Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), Portfolio Performance Shares
(PPSs), Performance Share Awards (PSAs), Breakthrough Performance Awards (BPAs) and stock options, as determined by the Compensation Committee of our BOD.
The 2019 Stock Plan (2019 Plan) replaced and superseded the 2014 Plan. It provides for 400 million shares, in addition to shares remaining under the 2014 Plan, to be authorized for
grants. As of December 31, 2022, no shares remain under the 2014 Plan. The 2019 Plan provides that the number of stock options, TSRUs, RSUs, or performance-based awards that may
be granted to any one individual during any 36-month period is limited to 20 million shares, and that RSUs count as three shares, PPSs, PSAs and BPAs count as three shares times the
maximum potential payout, while TSRUs and stock options count as one share, toward the maximum shares available under the 2019 Plan. As of December 31, 2022, 270 million shares
were available for award, including 27 million shares that we assumed from the remaining shares available from the stock plans of GBT, Arena and Biohaven which can be issued to legacy
employees of the acquired companies and newly hired employees after the dates of the respective acquisitions. Although not required to do so, we have used authorized and unissued
shares and, to a lesser extent, treasury stock to satisfy our obligations under these programs.

Retirement-eligible holders, as defined in the grant terms, can convert their TSRUs, when vested, into Profit Units (PTUs) with a conversion ratio based on a calculation used to determine the shares at TSRU
settlement. The PTUs are entitled to earn Dividend Equivalent Units (DEUs), and the PTUs and DEUs will be settled in our common stock on the TSRUs’ original settlement date and will be subject to the terms
and conditions of the original grant including forfeiture provisions.
In 2017, Performance Total Shareholder Return Units (PTSRUs) were awarded to the Former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (1,444,395 PTSRUs) and 361,099 PTSRUs were awarded to the Group
President, Chief Business Officer (former role Group President Pfizer Innovative Health) at a grant price of $30.31 and at a GDFV of $5.54 per PTSRU. In addition to having the same characteristics and valuation
methodology of TSRUs, PTSRU grants require special service and performance conditions. These awards were settled in December 2022 in accordance with the grant provisions.

These common stock equivalents were outstanding for the periods presented, but were not included in the computation of diluted EPS for those periods because their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive
effect.
Allocated shares held by the Common ESOP, including reinvested dividends, are considered outstanding for EPS calculations and the eventual conversion of allocated preferred shares
held by the Preferred ESOP was assumed in the diluted EPS calculation until the conversion date, which occurred in May 2020. See Note 12.
Note 15. Leases
We lease real estate, fleet, and equipment for use in our operations. Our leases generally have lease terms of 1 to 30 years, some of which include options to terminate or extend leases for
up to 5 to 10 years or on a month-to-month basis. We include options that are reasonably certain to be exercised as part of the determination of lease terms. We may negotiate termination
clauses in anticipation of any changes in market conditions, but generally these termination options have not been exercised. Residual value guarantees are generally not included within
our operating leases with the exception of some fleet leases. In addition to base rent payments, the leases may require us to pay directly for taxes and other non-lease components, such as
insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses, which may be dependent on usage or vary month-to-month. Variable lease payments amounted to $536 million in 2022, $381 million
in 2021 and $380 million in 2020. We elected the practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from lease components in calculating the amounts of ROU assets and lease
liabilities for all underlying asset classes.
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the contract and we perform the lease classification test as of the lease commencement date. ROU assets represent our right to
use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are
recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our estimated
incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments.
For operating leases, the ROU assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets follows:
As of December 31,
(MILLIONS) Balance Sheet Classification 2022 2021

Note 16. Contingencies and Certain Commitments
We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, including tax and legal contingencies, guarantees and indemnifications.
The following outlines our legal contingencies, guarantees and indemnifications. For a discussion of our tax contingencies, see Note 5D.
A. Legal Proceedings
Our legal contingencies include, but are not limited to, the following:
•Patent litigation, which typically involves challenges to the coverage and/or validity of patents on various products, processes or dosage forms. An adverse outcome could result in loss of
patent protection for a product, a significant loss of revenues from a product or impairment of the value of associated assets. We are the plaintiff in the majority of these actions.
•Product liability and other product-related litigation related to current or former products, which can include personal injury, consumer, off-label promotion, securities, antitrust and breach
of contract claims, among others, and often involves highly complex issues relating to medical causation, label warnings and reliance on those warnings, scientific evidence and findings,
actual, provable injury and other matters.
•Commercial and other asserted or unasserted matters, which can include acquisition-, licensing-, intellectual property-, collaboration- or co-promotion-related and product-pricing claims
and environmental claims and proceedings, and can involve complexities that will vary from matter to matter.
•Government investigations, which often are related to the extensive regulation of pharmaceutical companies by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and in other
jurisdictions.
Certain of these contingencies could result in increased expenses and/or losses, including damages, royalty payments, fines and/or civil penalties, which could be substantial, and/or
criminal charges.
We believe that our claims and defenses in matters in which we are a defendant are substantial, but litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur. We do not believe
that any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the
outcome of matters, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are accrued or paid.
We have accrued for losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Substantially all of our contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the
likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. Consequently, we are unable to estimate the range of reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued. Our
assessments, which result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties, are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by(a)
(a)
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 90
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions.
Amounts recorded for legal and environmental contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and
assumptions. For proceedings under environmental laws to which a governmental authority is a party, we have adopted a disclosure threshold of $1 million in potential or actual
governmental monetary sanctions.
The principal pending matters to which we are a party are discussed below. In determining whether a pending matter is a principal matter, we consider both quantitative and qualitative
factors to assess materiality, such as, among others, the amount of damages and the nature of other relief sought, if specified; our view of the merits of the claims and of the strength of our
defenses; whether the action purports to be, or is, a class action and, if not certified, our view of the likelihood that a class will be certified by the court; the jurisdiction in which the
proceeding is pending; whether related actions have been transferred to multidistrict litigation; any experience that we or, to our knowledge, other companies have had in similar
proceedings; whether disclosure of the action would be important to a reader of our financial statements, including whether disclosure might change a reader’s judgment about our financial
statements in light of all of the information that is available to the reader; the potential impact of the proceeding on our reputation; and the extent of public interest in the matter. In addition,
with respect to patent matters in which we are the plaintiff, we consider, among other things, the financial significance of the product protected by the patent(s) at issue. Some of the matters
discussed below include those which management believes that the likelihood of possible loss in excess of amounts accrued is remote.
A1. Legal Proceedings––Patent Litigation
We are involved in suits relating to our patents (or those of our collaboration/licensing partners to which we have licenses or co-promotion rights), including but not limited to, those
discussed below. We face claims by generic drug manufacturers that patents covering our products (or those of our collaboration/licensing partners to which we have licenses or co-
promotion rights and to which we may or may not be a party), processes or dosage forms are invalid and/or do not cover the product of the generic drug manufacturer. Also, counterclaims,
as well as various independent actions, have been filed alleging that our assertions of, or attempts to enforce, patent rights with respect to certain products constitute unfair competition
and/or violations of antitrust laws. In addition to the challenges to the U.S. patents that are discussed below, patent rights to certain of our products or those of our collaboration/licensing
partners are being challenged in various other jurisdictions. Some of our collaboration or licensing partners face challenges to the validity of their patent rights in non-U.S. jurisdictions. For
example, in April 2022, the U.K. High Court issued a judgment finding invalid a BMS patent related to Eliquis due to expire in 2026. In November 2022, BMS received permission to appeal
the High Court’s decision. Additional challenges are pending in other jurisdictions. Also, in July 2022, CureVac AG (CureVac) brought a patent infringement action against BioNTech and
certain of its subsidiaries in the German Regional Court alleging that Comirnaty infringes certain German utility model patents and certain expired and unexpired European patents.
Additional challenges involving Comirnaty patents may be filed against us and/or BioNTech in other jurisdictions in the future. Adverse decisions in these matters could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations. We are also party to patent damages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers, payers, governments or other
parties are seeking damages from us for allegedly causing delay of generic entry.
We also are often involved in other proceedings, such as inter partes review, post-grant review, re-examination or opposition proceedings, before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the
European Patent Office, or other foreign counterparts relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others. Also, if one of our patents (or one of our
collaboration/licensing partners patents) is found to be invalid by such proceedings, generic or competitive products could be introduced into the market resulting in the erosion of sales of
our existing products. For example, several of the patents in our pneumococcal vaccine portfolio have been challenged in inter partes review and post-grant review proceedings in the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office, as well as outside the U.S. The invalidation of any of the patents in our pneumococcal portfolio could potentially allow additional competitor vaccines, if
approved, to enter the marketplace earlier than anticipated. In the event that any of the patents are found valid and infringed, a competitor’s vaccine, if approved, might be prohibited from
entering the market or a competitor might be required to pay us a royalty.
We are also subject to patent litigation pursuant to which one or more third parties seek damages and/or injunctive relief to compensate for alleged infringement of its patents by our
commercial or other activities. If one of our marketed products (or a product of our collaboration/licensing partners) is found to infringe valid patent rights of a third party, such third party may
be awarded significant damages or royalty payments, or we may be prevented from further sales of that product. Such damages may be enhanced as much as three-fold if we or one of our
subsidiaries is found to have willfully infringed valid patent rights of a third party.
Actions In Which We Are The Plaintiff
Xeljanz (tofacitinib)
Beginning in 2017, we brought patent-infringement actions against several generic manufacturers that filed separate abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) with the FDA seeking
approval to market their generic versions of tofacitinib tablets in one or both of 5 mg and 10 mg dosage strengths, and in both immediate and extended release forms. To date, we have
settled actions with several manufacturers on terms not material to us. The remaining action continues in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware as described below.
In October 2021, we brought a separate patent-infringement action against Sinotherapeutics Inc. (Sinotherapeutics) asserting the infringement and validity of our patent covering extended
release formulations of tofacitinib that was challenged by Sinotherapeutics in its ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of tofacitinib 11 mg extended release tablets. In
November 2022, we filed an additional patent-infringement action against Sinotherapeutics relating to its challenge of our extended release formulation and method of treatment patents in
its ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of tofacitinib 22 mg extended release tablets.
In November 2022, we brought a separate patent-infringement action against Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. (collectively, Sun) asserting
the infringement and validity of our compound patent covering the active ingredient that was challenged by Sun in its ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of tofacitinib
extended release (11 mg, 22 mg) tablets. In January 2023, we settled our action against Sun on terms not material to us.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
Inlyta (axitinib)
In 2019, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Glenmark) notified us that it had filed an ANDA with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of Inlyta. Glenmark asserts the invalidity
and non-infringement of the crystalline form patent for Inlyta that expires in 2030. In 2019, we filed suit against Glenmark in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting the
validity and infringement of the crystalline form patent for Inlyta. In November 2022, we settled our action against Glenmark on terms not material to us.
Ibrance (palbociclib)
Beginning in January 2021, several generic companies notified us that they had filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of Ibrance tablets. The generic
companies are challenging some or all of the following patents: (i) the composition of matter patent expiring in 2027; (ii) the composition of matter patent expiring in 2023; (iii) the method of
use patent expiring in 2023; (iv) the crystalline form patent expiring in 2034; and (v) a tablet formulation patent expiring in 2036. We brought patent infringement actions against each of the
generic filers in various U.S. federal courts, asserting the validity and infringement of the patents challenged by the generic companies. We have settled with one of these generic
companies on terms not material to us, and we dismissed the patent infringement actions relating to the crystalline form of patent, the composition of matter patent expiring in 2023, the
method of use patent, and the tablet formulation patent against the generic companies that had challenged these patents. The composition of matter patent expiring in 2027 remains in suit.
Eucrisa
Beginning in September 2021, several generic companies notified us that they had filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of Eucrisa. The companies assert
the invalidity and non-infringement of a composition of matter patent expiring in 2026, two method of use patents expiring in 2027, and one other method of use patent expiring in 2030. In
September 2021, we brought patent infringement actions against the generic filers in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting the validity and infringement of the patents
challenged by the generic companies.
Braftovi (encorafenib)
In August 2022, a generic company notified us that it had filed an ANDA with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of Braftovi. The company asserted the invalidity and non-
infringement of, among others, a method of use patent expiring in 2033. In September 2022, we brought a patent infringement action against the generic company in the U.S. District Court
for the District of Delaware, asserting the validity and infringement of the method of use patent expiring in 2033. In January 2023, the case was dismissed.
Mektovi (binimetinib)
Beginning in August 2022, several generic companies notified us that they had filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of Mektovi. The companies assert the
invalidity and non-infringement of two method of use patents expiring in 2030, a method of use patent expiring in 2031, two method of use patents expiring in 2033, and a product by
process patent expiring in 2033. Beginning in September 2022, we brought patent infringement actions against the generic filers in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware,
asserting the validity and infringement of all six patents.
Actions in Which We are the Defendant
Comirnaty
In March 2022, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alnylam) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Pfizer and Pharmacia & Upjohn Co. LLC, our wholly
owned subsidiary, alleging that Comirnaty infringes U.S. Patent No. 11,246,933, which was issued in February 2022, and seeking unspecified monetary damages. In July 2022, Alnylam filed
a second complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Pfizer, Pharmacia & Upjohn Co. LLC, BioNTech and BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH, alleging that
Comirnaty infringes U.S. Patent No. 11,382,979, which was issued in July 2022, and seeking unspecified monetary damages.
In August 2022, ModernaTX, Inc. (ModernaTX) and Moderna US, Inc. (Moderna) sued Pfizer, BioNTech, BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH and BioNTech US Inc. in the U.S. District Court for
the District of Massachusetts, alleging that Comirnaty infringes three U.S. patents. In its complaint, Moderna stated that it is seeking damages for alleged infringement occurring after March
7, 2022.
In August 2022, ModernaTX filed a patent infringement action in Germany against Pfizer and certain subsidiary companies, as well as BioNTech and certain subsidiary companies, alleging
that Comirnaty infringes two European patents. In September 2022, ModernaTX filed patent infringement actions in the U.K and in the Netherlands against Pfizer and certain subsidiary
companies, as well as BioNTech and certain subsidiary companies, on the same two patents. In its complaints, ModernaTX stated that it is seeking damages for alleged infringement
occurring after March 7, 2022. In the U.K., Pfizer and BioNTech have brought an action against ModernaTX seeking to revoke these European patents, which was consolidated with the
September 2022 action filed by ModernaTX.
Paxlovid
In June 2022, Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Pfizer alleging that the active ingredient in Paxlovid,
nirmatrelvir, infringes U.S. Patent No. 11,358,953, which was issued in June 2022, and seeking unspecified monetary damages.
Matters Involving Pfizer and its Collaboration/Licensing Partners
Comirnaty
In July 2022, Pfizer, BioNTech and BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH filed a declaratory judgment complaint against CureVac in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts
seeking a judgment of non-infringement for the following three patents relating to Comirnaty: U.S. Patent Nos. 11,135,312, 11,149,278, and 11,241,493. Outside of the U.S., in the U.K.,
Pfizer and BioNTech have sued CureVac seeking a judgment of invalidity of several patents and CureVac has made certain infringement counterclaims.
Xtandi (enzalutamide)
In July 2022, Medivation and Medivation Prostate Therapeutics, Inc.; Astellas Pharma Inc., Astellas US LLC and Astellas Pharma US, Inc.; and The Regents of the University of California
filed a patent-infringement suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. and Zydus Lifesciences Ltd.; and in December 2022, the
same entities filed a patent-infringement suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Sun in connection with those companies’ respective ANDAs seeking approval to

generic versions of enzalutamide. The generic manufacturers are challenging the composition of matter patent, which expires in 2027, covering enzalutamide and pharmaceutical
compositions thereof, for treating prostate cancer.
A2. Legal Proceedings––Product Litigation
We are defendants in numerous cases, including but not limited to those discussed below, related to our pharmaceutical and other products. Plaintiffs in these cases seek damages and
other relief on various grounds for alleged personal injury and economic loss.
Asbestos
Between 1967 and 1982, Warner-Lambert owned American Optical Corporation (American Optical), which manufactured and sold respiratory protective devices and asbestos safety
clothing. In connection with the sale of American Optical in 1982, Warner-Lambert agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain liabilities, including certain asbestos-related and other
claims. Warner-Lambert was acquired by Pfizer in 2000 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer. Warner-Lambert is actively engaged in the defense of, and will continue to explore
various means of resolving, these claims.
Numerous lawsuits against American Optical, Pfizer and certain of its previously owned subsidiaries are pending in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged personal
injury from exposure to products allegedly containing asbestos and other allegedly hazardous materials sold by Pfizer and certain of its previously owned subsidiaries.
There also are a small number of lawsuits pending in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged exposure to asbestos in facilities owned or formerly owned by Pfizer or
its subsidiaries.
Effexor
Beginning in 2011, actions, including purported class actions, were filed in various federal courts against Wyeth and, in certain of the actions, affiliates of Wyeth and certain other defendants
relating to Effexor XR, which is the extended-release formulation of Effexor. The plaintiffs in each of the class actions seek to represent a class consisting of all persons in the U.S. and its
territories who directly purchased, indirectly purchased or reimbursed patients for the purchase of Effexor XR or generic Effexor XR from any of the defendants from June 14, 2008 until the
time the defendants’ allegedly unlawful conduct ceased. The plaintiffs in all of the actions allege delay in the launch of generic Effexor XR in the U.S. and its territories, in violation of federal
antitrust laws and, in certain of the actions, the antitrust, consumer protection and various other laws of certain states, as the result of Wyeth fraudulently obtaining and improperly listing
certain patents for Effexor XR in the Orange Book, enforcing certain patents for Effexor XR and entering into a litigation settlement agreement with a generic drug manufacturer with respect
to Effexor XR. Each of the plaintiffs seeks treble damages (for itself in the individual actions or on behalf of the putative class in the purported class actions) for alleged price overcharges for
Effexor XR or generic Effexor XR in the U.S. and its territories since June 14, 2008. All of these actions have been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.
In 2014, the District Court dismissed the direct purchaser plaintiffs’ claims based on the litigation settlement agreement, but declined to dismiss the other direct purchaser plaintiff claims. In
2015, the District Court entered partial final judgments as to all settlement agreement claims, including those asserted by direct purchasers and end-payer plaintiffs, which plaintiffs appealed
to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the District Court’s decisions and remanded the claims to the District Court.
Lipitor
Beginning in 2011, purported class actions relating to Lipitor were filed in various federal courts against, among others, Pfizer, certain Pfizer affiliates, and, in most of the actions, Ranbaxy
Laboratories Ltd. (Ranbaxy) and certain Ranbaxy affiliates. The plaintiffs in these various actions seek to represent nationwide, multi-state or statewide classes consisting of persons or
entities who directly purchased, indirectly purchased or reimbursed patients for the purchase of Lipitor (or, in certain of the actions, generic Lipitor) from any of the defendants from March
2010 until the cessation of the defendants’ allegedly unlawful conduct (the Class Period). The plaintiffs allege delay in the launch of generic Lipitor, in violation of federal antitrust laws and/or
state antitrust, consumer protection and various other laws, resulting from (i) the 2008 agreement pursuant to which Pfizer and Ranbaxy settled certain patent litigation involving Lipitor and
Pfizer granted Ranbaxy a license to sell a generic version of Lipitor in various markets beginning on varying dates, and (ii) in certain of the actions, the procurement and/or enforcement of
certain patents for Lipitor. Each of the actions seeks, among other things, treble damages on behalf of the putative class for alleged price overcharges for Lipitor (or, in certain of the actions,
generic Lipitor) during the Class Period. In addition, individual actions have been filed against Pfizer, Ranbaxy and certain of their affiliates, among others, that assert claims and seek relief
for the plaintiffs that are substantially similar to the claims asserted and the relief sought in the purported class actions described above. These various actions have been consolidated for
pre-trial proceedings in a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.
In September 2013 and 2014, the District Court dismissed with prejudice the claims of the direct purchasers. In October and November 2014, the District Court dismissed with prejudice the
claims of all other MDL plaintiffs. All plaintiffs appealed the District Court’s orders dismissing their claims with prejudice to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In addition, the
direct purchaser class plaintiffs appealed the order denying their motion to amend the judgment and for leave to amend their complaint to the Court of Appeals. In 2017, the Court of Appeals
reversed the District Court’s decisions and remanded the claims to the District Court.
Also, in 2013, the State of West Virginia filed an action in West Virginia state court against Pfizer and Ranbaxy, among others, that asserts claims and seeks relief on behalf of the State of
West Virginia and residents of that state that are substantially similar to the claims asserted and the relief sought in the purported class actions described above.
EpiPen (Direct Purchaser)
In February 2020, a lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas against Pfizer, its current and former affiliates King and Meridian, and various Mylan entities, on
behalf of a purported U.S. nationwide class of direct purchaser plaintiffs who purchased EpiPen devices directly from the defendants. Plaintiffs in this action generally allege that Pfizer and
Mylan conspired to delay market entry of generic EpiPen through the settlement of patent litigation regarding EpiPen, and thereby delayed market entry of generic EpiPen in violation of
federal antitrust law. Plaintiffs seek treble damages for alleged overcharges for EpiPen since 2011. In July 2021, the District Court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the direct purchaser
complaint, without prejudice. In September 2021, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. In August 2022, the District Court granted Pfizer’s motion to dismiss the complaint, and plaintiffs
have appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.

Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
Nexium 24HR and Protonix
A number of individual and multi-plaintiff lawsuits have been filed against Pfizer, certain of its subsidiaries and/or other pharmaceutical manufacturers in various federal and state courts
alleging that the plaintiffs developed kidney-related injuries purportedly as a result of the ingestion of certain proton pump inhibitors. The cases against Pfizer involve Protonix and/or Nexium
24HR and seek compensatory and punitive damages and, in some cases, treble damages, restitution or disgorgement. In 2017, the federal actions were ordered transferred for coordinated
pre-trial proceedings to a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. As part of the combination of our and GSK’s consumer healthcare businesses to form Haleon, Haleon
assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pfizer for, liabilities arising out of such litigation to the extent related to Nexium 24HR.
Docetaxel
•Personal Injury Actions
A number of lawsuits have been filed against Hospira and Pfizer in various federal and state courts alleging that plaintiffs who were treated with Docetaxel developed permanent hair loss.
The significant majority of the cases also name other defendants, including the manufacturer of the branded product, Taxotere. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages.
Additional lawsuits have been filed in which plaintiffs allege they developed blocked tear ducts following their treatment with Docetaxel.
In 2016, the federal cases were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In 2022, the eye injury cases were
transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.
•Mississippi Attorney General Government Action
In 2018, the Attorney General of Mississippi filed a complaint in Mississippi state court against the manufacturer of the branded product and eight other manufacturers including Pfizer and
Hospira, alleging, with respect to Pfizer and Hospira, a failure to warn about a risk of permanent hair loss in violation of the Mississippi Consumer Protection Act. The action seeks civil
penalties and injunctive relief.
Zantac
A number of lawsuits have been filed against Pfizer in various federal and state courts alleging that plaintiffs developed various types of cancer, or face an increased risk of developing
cancer, purportedly as a result of the ingestion of Zantac. The significant majority of these cases also name other defendants that have historically manufactured and/or sold Zantac. Pfizer
has not sold Zantac since 2006, and only sold an OTC version of the product. In 2006, Pfizer sold the consumer business that included its Zantac OTC rights to Johnson & Johnson and
transferred the assets and liabilities related to Zantac OTC to Johnson & Johnson in connection with the sale. Plaintiffs in these cases seek compensatory and punitive damages.
In February 2020, the federal actions were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (the Federal MDL Court).
Plaintiffs in the MDL have filed against Pfizer and many other defendants a master personal injury complaint, asserting a consolidated consumer class action alleging, among other things,
claims under consumer protection statutes of all 50 states, and a medical monitoring complaint seeking to certify medical monitoring classes under the laws of 13 states. In addition, (i)
Pfizer has received service of Canadian class action complaints naming Pfizer and other defendants, and seeking compensatory and punitive damages for personal injury and economic
loss, allegedly arising from the defendants’ sale of Zantac in Canada; and (ii) the State of New Mexico and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore separately filed civil actions against
Pfizer and many other defendants in state courts, alleging various state statutory and common law claims in connection with the defendants’ alleged sale of Zantac in those jurisdictions. In
April 2021, a Judicial Council Coordinated Proceeding was created in the Superior Court of California in Alameda County to coordinate personal injury actions against Pfizer and other
defendants filed in California state court. Coordinated proceedings have also been created in other state courts. In December 2022, the Federal MDL Court granted defendants’ Daubert
motions to exclude plaintiffs’ expert testimony and motion for summary judgment on general causation, and dismissed the litigation.
Chantix
Beginning in August 2021, a number of putative class actions have been filed against Pfizer in various U.S. federal courts following Pfizer’s voluntary recall of Chantix due to the presence of
a nitrosamine, N-nitroso-varenicline. Plaintiffs assert that they suffered economic harm purportedly as a result of purchasing Chantix or generic varenicline medicines sold by Pfizer. Plaintiffs
seek to represent nationwide and state-specific classes and seek various remedies, including damages and medical monitoring. In December 2022, the federal actions were transferred for
coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Similar putative class actions have been filed in Canada and Israel, where the
product brand is Champix.
A3. Legal Proceedings––Commercial and Other Matters
Monsanto-Related Matters
In 1997, Monsanto Company (Former Monsanto) contributed certain chemical manufacturing operations and facilities to a newly formed corporation, Solutia Inc. (Solutia), and spun off the
shares of Solutia. In 2000, Former Monsanto merged with Pharmacia & Upjohn Company to form Pharmacia. Pharmacia then transferred its agricultural operations to a newly created
subsidiary, named Monsanto Company (New Monsanto), which it spun off in a two-stage process that was completed in 2002. Pharmacia was acquired by Pfizer in 2003 and is a wholly
owned subsidiary of Pfizer.
In connection with its spin-off that was completed in 2002, New Monsanto assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, any liabilities related to Pharmacia’s former agricultural
business. New Monsanto has defended and/or is defending Pharmacia in connection with various claims and litigation arising out of, or related to, the agricultural business, and has been
indemnifying Pharmacia when liability has been imposed or settlement has been reached regarding such claims and litigation.
In connection with its spin-off in 1997, Solutia assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, liabilities related to Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses. As the result of its
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, Solutia’s indemnification obligations relating to Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses are primarily limited to sites that
Solutia has owned or operated. In addition, in connection with its spin-off that was completed in 2002, New Monsanto assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, any liabilities
primarily related to Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses, including, but not limited to, any such liabilities that Solutia assumed. Solutia’s and New Monsanto’s
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 94

Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
assumption of, and agreement to indemnify Pharmacia for, these liabilities apply to pending actions and any future actions related to Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses in which
Pharmacia is named as a defendant, including, without limitation, actions asserting environmental claims, including alleged exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls. Solutia and/or New
Monsanto are defending Pharmacia in connection with various claims and litigation arising out of, or related to, Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses, and have been indemnifying
Pharmacia when liability has been imposed or settlement has been reached regarding such claims and litigation.
Environmental Matters
In 2009, as part of our acquisition of Wyeth, we assumed responsibility for environmental remediation at the Wyeth Holdings LLC (formerly known as, Wyeth Holdings Corporation and
American Cyanamid Company) discontinued industrial chemical facility in Bound Brook, New Jersey. Since that time, we have executed or have become a party to a number of
administrative settlement agreements, orders on consent, and/or judicial consent decrees, with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and/or New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection to perform remedial design, removal and remedial actions, and related environmental remediation activities at the Bound Brook facility. We have accrued for the currently
estimated costs of these activities.
We are a party to a number of other proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and other state, local
or foreign laws in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past and/or future remediation.
Contracts with Iraqi Ministry of Health
In 2017, a number of U.S. service members, civilians, and their families brought a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against a number of pharmaceutical and
medical devices companies, including Pfizer and certain of its subsidiaries, alleging that the defendants violated the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act. The complaint alleges that the defendants
provided funding for terrorist organizations through their sales practices pursuant to pharmaceutical and medical device contracts with the Iraqi Ministry of Health, and seeks monetary relief.
In July 2020, the District Court granted defendants’ motions to dismiss and dismissed all of plaintiffs’ claims. In January 2022, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court’s decision. In
February 2023, the defendants filed for en banc review of the Court of Appeals’ decision. In February 2023, the Court of Appeals denied defendants’ en banc petitions.
Allergan Complaint for Indemnity
In 2019, Pfizer was named as a defendant in a complaint, along with King, filed by Allergan Finance LLC (Allergan) in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, asserting claims for
indemnity related to Kadian, which was owned for a short period by King in 2008, prior to Pfizer's acquisition of King in 2010. This suit was voluntarily discontinued without prejudice in
January 2021.
Viatris Securities Litigation
In October 2021, a putative class action was filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania on behalf of former Mylan N.V. shareholders who received Viatris
common stock in exchange for Mylan shares in connection with the spin-off of the Upjohn Business and its combination with Mylan (the Transactions). Viatris, Pfizer, and certain of each
company’s current and former officers, directors and employees are named as defendants. An amended complaint was filed in January 2023, and alleges that the defendants violated
certain provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 in connection with certain disclosures made in or omitted from the registration statement and related prospectus issued in connection with the
Transactions, as well as related communications. Plaintiff seeks damages, costs and expenses and other equitable and injunctive relief.
A4. Legal Proceedings––Government Investigations
We are subject to extensive regulation by government agencies in the U.S., other developed markets and multiple emerging markets in which we operate. Criminal charges, substantial
fines and/or civil penalties, limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, corporate integrity or deferred prosecution agreements, as well as reputational harm and
increased public interest in the matter could result from government investigations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we do business. These matters often involve government
requests for information on a voluntary basis or through subpoenas after which the government may seek additional information through follow-up requests or additional subpoenas. In
addition, in a qui tam lawsuit in which the government declines to intervene, the relator may still pursue a suit for the recovery of civil damages and penalties on behalf of the government.
Among the investigations by government agencies are the matters discussed below.
Greenstone Investigations
•U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division Investigation
Since July 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division has been investigating our former Greenstone generics business. We believe this is related to an ongoing broader
antitrust investigation of the generic pharmaceutical industry. We have produced records relating to this investigation.
•State Attorneys General and Multi-District Generics Antitrust Litigation
In April 2018, Greenstone received requests for information from the Antitrust Department of the Connecticut Office of the Attorney General. In May 2019, Attorneys General of more than 40
states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico filed a complaint against a number of pharmaceutical companies, including Greenstone and Pfizer. The matter has been consolidated
with a MDL in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. As to Greenstone and Pfizer, the complaint alleges anticompetitive conduct in violation of federal and state antitrust laws and state
consumer protection laws. In June 2020, the State Attorneys General filed a new complaint against a large number of companies, including Greenstone and Pfizer, making similar
allegations, but concerning a new set of drugs. This complaint was transferred to the MDL in July 2020. The MDL also includes civil complaints filed by private plaintiffs and state counties
against Pfizer, Greenstone and a significant number of other defendants asserting allegations that generally overlap with those asserted by the State Attorneys General.
Subpoena & Civil Investigative Demand relating to Tris Pharma/Quillivant XR
In October 2018, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) seeking records relating to our relationship with another drug
manufacturer and its production and manufacturing of drugs including, but not limited to, Quillivant XR. We responded to that subpoena in full and have had no communication with the
SDNY in connection with the subpoena since June 2019.
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 95
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
Additionally, in September 2020, we received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the Texas Attorney General’s office seeking records of a similar nature to those requested by the
SDNY. We are producing records in response to this request.
Government Inquiries relating to Meridian Medical Technologies
In February 2019, we received a CID from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the SDNY. The CID seeks records and information related to alleged quality issues involving the manufacture of
auto-injectors at the Meridian site. In August 2019, we received a HIPAA subpoena issued by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Missouri, in coordination with the
Department of Justice’s Consumer Protection Branch, seeking similar records and information. We are producing records in response to these and subsequent requests.
U.S. Department of Justice/SEC Inquiry relating to Russian Operations
In June 2019, we received an informal request from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) Unit seeking documents relating to our operations in Russia. In
September 2019, we received a similar request from the SEC’s FCPA Unit. We have produced records pursuant to these requests.
Docetaxel––Mississippi Attorney General Government Investigation
See Legal Proceedings––Product Litigation––Docetaxel––Mississippi Attorney General Government Investigation above for information regarding a government investigation related to
Docetaxel marketing practices.
U.S. Department of Justice Inquiries relating to India Operations
In March 2020, we received an informal request from the U.S. Department of Justice's Consumer Protection Branch seeking documents relating to our manufacturing operations in India,
including at our former facility located at Irrungattukottai in India. In April 2020, we received a similar request from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the SDNY regarding a civil investigation
concerning operations at our facilities in India. We are producing records pursuant to these requests.
U.S. Department of Justice/SEC Inquiry relating to China Operations
In June 2020, we received an informal request from the U.S. Department of Justice's FCPA Unit seeking documents relating to our operations in China. In August 2020, we received a
similar request from the SEC’s FCPA Unit. We have produced records pursuant to these requests.
Zantac––State of New Mexico and Mayor and City Council of Baltimore Civil Actions
See Legal Proceedings––Product Litigation––Zantac above for information regarding civil actions separately filed by the State of New Mexico and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore
alleging various state statutory and common law claims in connection with the defendants’ alleged sale of Zantac in those jurisdictions.
Government Inquiries relating to Biohaven
In June 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice's Commercial Litigation Branch and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of New York issued a CID relating to Biohaven. The CID
seeks records and information related to, among other things, engagements with health care professionals and co-pay coupons cards. Biohaven is a wholly-owned subsidiary that we
acquired in October 2022. We are producing records in response to these requests.
B. Guarantees and Indemnifications
In the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses and other transactions, we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may
arise in connection with the transaction or that are related to events and activities prior to or following a transaction. If the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the
terms of the indemnification, we may be required to reimburse the loss. These indemnifications are generally subject to various restrictions and limitations. Historically, we have not paid
significant amounts under these provisions and, as of December 31, 2022, the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is not material to Pfizer. See Note 2C for a
description of the March 2022 indemnity provided by Pfizer to GSK in connection with the issuance of notes by the Consumer Healthcare JV. In conjunction with the completion of GSK’s
demerger transactions in July 2022, GSK’s guarantee and our related indemnification of GSK’s guarantee were terminated.
In addition, in connection with our entry into certain agreements and other transactions, our counterparties may be obligated to indemnify us. For example, in November 2020, we and Mylan
completed the transaction to spin-off our Upjohn Business and combine it with Mylan to form Viatris. As part of the transaction and as previously disclosed, each of Viatris and Pfizer has
agreed to assume, and to indemnify the other for, liabilities arising out of certain matters. Also, our global agreement with BioNTech to co-develop a mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine
program aimed at preventing COVID-19 infection, includes certain indemnity provisions pursuant to which each of BioNTech and Pfizer has agreed to indemnify the other for certain
liabilities that may arise in connection with certain third-party claims relating to Comirnaty.
We have also guaranteed the long-term debt of certain companies that we acquired and that now are subsidiaries of Pfizer. See Note 7D.
C. Certain Commitments
As of December 31, 2022, we had commitments totaling $4.4 billion that are legally binding and enforceable. These commitments include payments relating to potential milestone payments
deemed reasonably likely to occur, and purchase obligations for goods and services.
See Note 5A for information on the TCJA repatriation tax liability.
D. Contingent Consideration for Acquisitions
We may be required to make payments to sellers for certain prior business combinations that are contingent upon future events or outcomes. See Note 1D. The estimated fair value of
contingent consideration as of December 31, 2022 is $645 million, of which $42 million is recorded in Other current liabilities and $603 million in Other noncurrent liabilities, and as of
December 31, 2021 was $697 million, of which $135 million was recorded in Other current liabilities and $563 million in Other noncurrent liabilities. The decrease in the contingent
consideration balance
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 96
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
from December 31, 2021 is primarily due to payments made upon the achievement of certain sales-based milestones partially offset by fair value adjustments.
E. Insurance
Our insurance coverage reflects market conditions (including cost and availability) existing at the time it is written, and our decision to obtain insurance coverage or to self-insure varies
accordingly. Depending upon the cost and availability of insurance and the nature of the risk involved, the amount of self-insurance may be significant. The cost and availability of coverage
have resulted in self-insuring certain exposures, including product liability. If we incur substantial liabilities that are not covered by insurance or substantially exceed insurance coverage and
that are in excess of existing accruals, there could be a material adverse effect on our cash flows or results of operations in the period in which the amounts are paid and/or accrued.
Note 17.  Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue Information
A. Segment Information
We regularly review our operating segments and the approach used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. We manage our commercial operations through two
operating segments, Biopharma and PC1, which are each led by a single manager. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. Each operating segment has responsibility for its commercial
activities. Regional commercial organizations market, distribute and sell our products and are supported by global platform functions that are responsible for the research, development,
manufacturing and supply of our products and global corporate enabling functions. Biopharma receives its R&D services from WRDM and GPD. These services include IPR&D projects for
new investigational products and additional indications for in-line products. Each operating segment has a geographic footprint across developed and emerging markets. Our chief operating
decision maker uses the revenues and earnings of the operating segments, among other factors, for performance evaluation and resource allocation.
After the organizational changes in the third quarter of 2022 (see Note 1A), the new commercial structure within Biopharma is designed to better support and optimize performance across
three broad customer groups:
•Primary Care consists of the former Internal Medicine and Vaccines product portfolios, products for COVID-19 prevention and treatment, and potential future mRNA and antiviral products.
•Specialty Care consists of the former Inflammation & Immunology, Rare Disease and Hospital (excluding Paxlovid) product portfolios.
•Oncology consists of the former Oncology product portfolio.
Other Business Activities––Includes the operating results of PC1 as well as certain pre-tax costs not allocated to our operating segment results, such as costs associated with:
•WRDM––the R&D and Medical expenses managed by our WRDM organization, which is generally responsible for research projects for our Biopharma portfolio until proof-of-concept is
achieved and then for transitioning those projects to the GPD organization for possible clinical and commercial development. R&D spending may include upfront and milestone payments
for intellectual property rights. The WRDM organization also has responsibility for certain science-based and other platform-services organizations, which provide end-to-end technical
expertise and other services to the various R&D projects, as well as the Worldwide Medical and Safety group, which ensures that Pfizer provides all stakeholders––including patients,
healthcare providers, pharmacists, payers and health authorities––with complete and up-to-date information on the risks and benefits associated with Pfizer products so that they can
make appropriate decisions on how and when to use Pfizer’s medicines.
•GPD––the costs associated with our GPD organization, which is generally responsible for clinical trials from WRDM in the Biopharma portfolio, including both early- and late-stage
portfolio spend. GPD also provides technical support and other services to Pfizer R&D projects. GPD is responsible for facilitating all regulatory submissions and interactions with
regulatory agencies.
•Corporate and other unallocated––the costs associated with (i) corporate enabling functions (such as digital, global real estate operations, legal, finance, human resources, worldwide
public affairs, compliance and worldwide procurement, among others) and other corporate costs, including, but not limited to, all strategy, business development, portfolio management
and valuation capabilities and certain compensation, as well as interest income and expense, and gains and losses on investments; (ii) overhead costs primarily associated with our
manufacturing operations (which include manufacturing variances associated with production) that are not directly assessed to an operating segment, as business unit (segment)
management does not manage these costs; and (iii) our share of earnings from Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV.
Reconciling Items––The following items, transactions and events are not allocated to our operating segment results: (i) all amortization of intangible assets; (ii) acquisition-related items,
where we incur costs for executing the transaction, integrating the acquired operations and restructuring the combined company; and (iii) certain significant items, representing substantive
and/or unusual, and in some cases recurring, items that are evaluated on an individual basis by management and that, either as a result of their nature or size, would not be expected to
occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. Such certain significant items can include, but are not limited to, pension and postretirement actuarial remeasurement gains and
losses, non-acquisition-related restructuring costs, net gains and losses on investments in equity securities, as well as costs incurred for legal settlements, asset impairments and disposals
of assets or businesses, including, as applicable, any associated transition activities. Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, acquisition-related items may now include purchase accounting
impacts that previously were included as part of a reconciling item entitled “Purchase accounting adjustments” that we no longer separately present, such as the incremental charge to cost
of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of acquired fixed assets, amortization related to the
increase in fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value changes for contingent consideration.
Segment Assets––We manage our assets on a total company basis, not by operating segment, as our operating assets are shared or commingled. Therefore, our chief operating decision
maker does not regularly review any asset information by operating segment and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by operating segment. Total assets were $197 billion as of
December 31, 2022 and $181 billion as of December 31, 2021.

Erbitux is a registered trademark of ImClone LLC.
Remaining Performance Obligations––Contracted revenue expected to be recognized from remaining performance obligations for firm orders in long-term contracts to supply Comirnaty to
our customers totaled approximately $15 billion as of December 31, 2022, which includes amounts received in advance and deferred, as well as amounts that will be invoiced as we deliver
these products to our customers in future periods. Of this amount, current contract terms provide for expected delivery of product with contracted revenue in 2023 and 2024, the timing and
terms of which may be renegotiated. Remaining performance obligations are based on foreign exchange rates as of the end of our fiscal fourth quarter of 2022 and exclude arrangements
with an original expected contract duration of less than one year.
Deferred Revenues––Our deferred revenues primarily relate to advance payments received or receivable from various government or government sponsored customers in international
markets for supply of Comirnaty. The deferred revenues related to Comirnaty total $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2022, with $2.4 billion and $77 million recorded in current liabilities and
noncurrent liabilities, respectively. The deferred revenues related to Comirnaty totaled $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2021, with $3.0 billion and $249 million recorded in current liabilities
and noncurrent liabilities, respectively. The decrease in Comirnaty deferred revenues during 2022 was primarily the result of amounts recognized in Revenues as we delivered the product
to our customers and the impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by additional advance payments received as we entered into new or amended contracts. During 2022, we recognized
revenue of $3.1 billion that was included in the balance of Comirnaty deferred revenues as of December 31, 2021. The Comirnaty deferred revenues as of December 31, 2022 will be
recognized in Revenues proportionately as we transfer control of the product to our customers and satisfy our performance obligation under the contracts, with the amounts included in
current liabilities expected to be recognized in Revenues within the next 12 months, and the amounts included in noncurrent liabilities expected to be recognized in Revenues in 2024.
Deferred revenues associated with contracts for other products were not significant as of December 31, 2022 or 2021.V600E/K

Changes in Internal Controls
During our most recent fiscal quarter, there has not been any change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Pfizer Inc. 2022 Form 10-K 101
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
Pfizer Inc.:
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control—
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company
as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 23, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
consolidated financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management’ s Report
We prepared and are responsible for the financial statements that appear in this Form 10-K. These financial statements are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America and, therefore, include amounts based on informed judgments and estimates. We also accept responsibility for the preparation of other financial information
that is included in this document.
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The Company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management
assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment and those criteria, management
believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.
The Company’s independent auditors have issued their auditors’ report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. That report appears above in this Form 10-K.

EXHIBIT 4.24
DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT’S SECURITIES REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
As of February 23, 2023, Pfizer Inc. has common stock and its 1.000% Notes due 2027 (the notes) registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The
following descriptions of our common stock and the notes are summaries and do not purport to be complete. The description of our common stock is subject to and qualified in its entirety by
reference to our restated certificate of incorporation (the Certificate of Incorporation), and our bylaws, as amended (the Bylaws), and the description of the notes is subject to and qualified in
its entirety by reference to the base indenture (as defined below) and the ninth supplemental indenture (as defined below), each of which are incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the
Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.24 is a part. We encourage you to read our Certificate of Incorporation, our Bylaws, the applicable provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the DGCL), the base indenture and the ninth supplemental indenture for additional information. References in this section to “Pfizer,” “we,” “us” and “our” are to Pfizer Inc.,
unless otherwise stated or the context so requires.
DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK
Common Stock
Under the Certificate of Incorporation, we are authorized to issue up to 12 billion shares of common stock, par value $0.05 per share. The common stock is not redeemable, does not have
any conversion rights and is not subject to call. Holders of shares of common stock have no preemptive rights to maintain their percentage of ownership in future offerings or sales of our
stock. Holders of shares of common stock have one vote per share in all elections of Directors and on all other matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. The holders of common
stock are entitled to receive dividends, if any, as and when may be declared from time to time by our Board of Directors, out of funds legally available therefor. Upon liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of our affairs, the holders of common stock will be entitled to participate equally and ratably, in proportion to the number of shares held, in our net assets available for
distribution to holders of common stock. The shares of common stock currently outstanding are fully paid and nonassessable. The common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange
under the trading symbol “PFE.”
Preferred Stock
Under the Certificate of Incorporation, we are authorized to issue up to 27 million shares of preferred stock, without par value. The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, and
the Board of Directors of Pfizer is expressly authorized (i) to fix the descriptions, powers, preferences, rights, qualifications, limitations, and restrictions with respect to any series of preferred
stock and (ii) to specify the number of shares of any series of preferred stock.
Anti-takeover Effects of the Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws and Delaware Law
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. Various provisions contained in the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws could delay or discourage some transactions involving an actual or
potential change in control of us or a change in our management and may limit the ability of our stockholders to remove current management or approve transactions that our stockholders
may deem to be in their best interests. Among other things, these provisions:
    
• limit the right of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders to holders of at least 10% of the total number of shares of stock entitled to vote on the matter to be brought
before the proposed special meeting;
• authorize our Board of Directors to establish one or more series of preferred stock without stockholder approval;
• authorize the Board to issue dividends in the form of stock purchase or similar rights, including rights that would have the effect of making an attempt to acquire us more costly;
• grant to the Board of Directors, and not to the stockholders, the sole power to set the number of Directors;
• require that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be effected
by any consent in writing; and
• subject to the rights of the holders of any one or more series of preferred stock then outstanding, allow our Directors, and not our stockholders, to fill vacancies on our Board of
Directors, including vacancies resulting from the removal of one or more Directors or an increase in the number of Directors constituting the whole Board of Directors.
Delaware Law. We are a Delaware corporation and consequently are also subject to certain anti-takeover provisions of the DGCL. Subject to certain exceptions, Section 203 of the DGCL
prevents a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a “business combination” with any “interested stockholder” for three years following the date that the person became an
interested stockholder, unless (a) the interested stockholder attained such status with the approval of the corporation’s board of directors, (b) upon consummation of the transaction that
resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder
owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, exclusive of shares owned by directors who are also officers and by certain
employee stock plans or (c) at or subsequent to such time, the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized by the affirmative vote at a stockholders’ meeting,
and not by written consent, of at least 66-2/3% of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder. A “business combination” includes, among other things, a
merger or consolidation involving the corporation and the “interested stockholder” and the sale of more than 10% of the corporation’s assets. In general, an “interested stockholder” is any
entity or person beneficially owning 15% or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock, and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or person.
Section 203 makes it more difficult for an interested stockholder to effect various business combinations with a corporation for a three-year period. This statute could prohibit or delay
mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts not approved in advance by our Board of Directors, and, as a result, could discourage attempts to acquire us, which could depress
the market price of our common stock.
DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES
Reference should be made to the indenture dated as of January 30, 2001, between Pfizer and The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of New York), as successor to
JPMorgan Chase Bank (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank), as trustee, which we refer to as the “base indenture,” as supplemented by the ninth supplemental indenture dated
as of March 6, 2017, among Pfizer Inc., The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, and The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch, as paying agent, which we refer to as the “ninth
supplemental indenture.” When we refer to the “indenture,” we mean the base indenture, as supplemented by the ninth supplemental indenture. The following description is a summary of
selected portions of the base indenture and the ninth supplemental indenture. It does not restate the base indenture or the ninth supplemental indenture, and those documents, not this
description, define the rights of a holder of the notes.
Principal, Maturity and Interest
The notes were limited to €750,000,000 aggregate principal amount. The notes will mature on March 6, 2027. We issued the notes in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of
€1,000 in excess thereof.
Interest on the notes accrues at the annual rate of 1.000%. Interest on the notes is payable on March 6 of each year. Interest on the notes is computed on the basis of the actual number of
days in the period for which interest is being calculated and the actual number of days from and including the last date on which interest was paid on the notes to, but excluding, the next
scheduled interest payment date. This payment convention is referred to as ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA) (as defined in the rulebook of the International Capital Market Association).
We make each interest payment to the holders of record of the notes at the close of business on the 15th calendar day (whether or not a business day) preceding the relevant interest
payment date.
The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch, acts as our paying agent with respect to the notes. Upon notice to the trustee, we may change any paying agent. Payments of principal,
interest and premium, if any, will be made by us through the paying agent to Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. (the “Euroclear Operator”), as operator of the Euroclear System (“Euroclear”) and/or
Clearstream Banking, Société Anonyme, Luxembourg (“Clearstream”) as described under “—Book-Entry.”
Issuance in Euros
Principal, premium, if any, and interest payments and additional amounts, if any, in respect of the notes are payable in euros.
If the euro is unavailable to us due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control or the euro is no longer used by the then member states of the
European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions within the international banking community, then all
payments in respect of the notes will be made in U.S. dollars until the euro is again available to us or so used. In such circumstances, the amount payable on any date in euros will be
converted to U.S. dollars on the basis of the most recently available market exchange rate for euros, as determined by us in our sole discretion. Any payment in respect of the notes so
made in U.S. dollars does not constitute an event of default under the indenture or the notes. Neither the trustee nor the paying agent is responsible for obtaining exchange rates, effecting
conversions or otherwise handling redenominations.
Payment of Additional Amounts
All payments in respect of the notes are made by or on behalf of us without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental
charges of whatever nature, imposed or levied by the United States or any taxing authority thereof or therein, unless such withholding or deduction is required by law. If such withholding or
deduction is required by law, we pay to a beneficial owner who is not a United States person such additional amounts on the notes as are necessary in order that the net payment of the
principal of, and premium or redemption price, if any, and interest on, such notes to such beneficial owner, after such withholding or deduction (including any withholding or deduction on
such additional amounts), will not be less than the amount provided in such notes to be then due and payable; provided, however, that the foregoing obligation to pay additional amounts will
not apply:
a) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for the beneficial owner, or a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of
the beneficial owner if the beneficial owner is an estate, trust,
- 2 -
partnership or corporation, or a person holding a power over an estate or trust administered by a fiduciary holder, being considered as (i) having a current or former connection
with the United States (other than a connection arising solely as a result of the ownership of such notes, the receipt of any payment or the enforcement of any rights thereunder),
including being or having been a citizen or resident of the United States, or being or having been engaged in a trade or business in the United States or having or having had a
permanent establishment in the United States; (ii) being a controlled foreign corporation related to Pfizer directly, indirectly or constructively through stock ownership for U.S.
federal income tax purposes; (iii) being an owner of a 10% or greater interest in voting stock of Pfizer within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) or any successor provision; or (iv) being a bank receiving payments on an extension of credit made pursuant to a loan agreement entered into
in the ordinary course of its trade or business;
b) to any holder that is not the sole beneficial owner of such notes, or a portion of such notes, or that is a fiduciary, partnership or limited liability company, but only to the extent that
a beneficiary or settlor with respect to the fiduciary, a beneficial owner or a member of the partnership or limited liability company would not have been entitled to the payment of
an additional amount had the beneficiary, settlor, beneficial owner or member received directly from Pfizer its beneficial or distributive share of the payment;
c) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by reason of the holder’s or beneficial owner’s past or present status as a passive foreign investment company, a
controlled foreign corporation, a foreign tax exempt organization or a personal holding company with respect to the United States or as a corporation that accumulates earnings to
avoid U.S. federal income tax;
d) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for the failure of the holder or beneficial owner of the applicable notes to comply with
any applicable certification, identification or information reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the United States of the holder or
beneficial owner of such notes, if compliance is timely requested by Pfizer and required by statute, by regulation of the United States or any taxing authority therein or by an
applicable income tax treaty to which the United States is a party as a precondition to exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge;
e) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed otherwise than by withholding or deducting from the payment;
f) to any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, wealth, capital gains or personal property tax or similar tax, assessment or other governmental charge;
g) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge required to be withheld by any paying agent from any payment of principal of or interest on any such note, if such payment
can be made without such withholding by at least one other paying agent in a Member State of the European Union;
h) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely by reason of a change in law, regulation, or administrative or judicial interpretation that
becomes effective more than 15 days after the payment becomes due or is duly provided for, whichever occurs later;
i) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for the presentation by the holder of any note, where presentation is required, for
payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever occurs
later, except to the extent that the holder or beneficial owner thereof would have been entitled to additional amounts had the note been presented for payment on the last day of
such 30 day period;
j) to any withholding or deduction that is imposed on a payment pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and related Treasury regulations and pronouncements or any
successor provisions thereto (that are substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to comply with) and any regulations or official law, agreement or interpretations
thereof in any jurisdiction implementing an intergovernmental approach thereto; or
k) in the case of any combination of the above listed items.
Except as specifically provided under this heading “—Payment of Additional Amounts,” we are not required to make any payment for any tax, duty, assessment or governmental charge of
whatever nature imposed by any government or a political subdivision or taxing authority of or in any government or political subdivision.
As used under this heading “—Payment of Additional Amounts” and under the heading “—Optional Redemption of Notes; Redemption for Tax Reasons; No Sinking Fund,” the term “United
States” means the United States of America, any state thereof, and the District of Columbia, and the term “United States person” means (i) any individual who is a citizen or resident of the
United
- 3 -
States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (ii) a corporation, partnership or other entity created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of
Columbia (other than a partnership that is not treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes), (iii) any estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income
taxation regardless of its source, or (iv) any trust if a U.S. court can exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more United States persons can control all
substantial trust decisions, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a United States person.
Ranking
The notes are unsecured general obligations of Pfizer and rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of Pfizer from time to time outstanding.
Listing
The notes are listed on the NYSE. We have no obligation to maintain such listing, and we may delist the notes at any time.
Covenants
The indenture contains a provision that restricts our ability to consolidate with or merge into any other person or convey or transfer our properties and assets as an entirety or substantially
as an entirety to any other person. The indenture does not restrict our ability to convey or transfer our properties and assets other than as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to any
other person. See “Article VIII - Consolidation, Merger, Conveyance or Transfer” in the base indenture. The indenture contains no other restrictive covenants, including those that would
afford holders of the notes protection in the event of a highly-leveraged transaction involving Pfizer or any of its affiliates or other events involving us that may adversely affect our
creditworthiness or the value of the notes. The indenture also does not contain any covenants relating to total indebtedness, interest coverage, stock repurchases, recapitalizations,
dividends and distributions to shareholders, current ratios or acquisitions and divestitures. The notes do not have the benefit of covenants that relate to subsidiary guarantees, liens and sale
leaseback transactions that apply to other of our existing unsecured and unsubordinated notes.
Pfizer may, without the consent of the holders of notes of any series, issue additional notes having the same ranking and the same interest rate, maturity and other terms as the notes of any
series (except for the issue date and the public offering price). Any additional notes having such similar terms, together with the notes of the applicable series, will constitute a single series
of debt securities under the indenture. No additional notes of any series may be issued if an event of default has occurred with respect to the notes of that series. Pfizer will not issue any
additional notes intended to form a single series with the notes of any series, unless such further notes will be fungible with all notes of the same series for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.
Optional Redemption of Notes; Redemption for Tax Reasons; No Sinking Fund
At our option, we may redeem the notes (together, the redemption notes), in whole, at any time, or in part, from time to time, prior to December 6, 2026 (three months prior to the maturity
date). The redemption price will be equal to the greater of the following amounts:
• 100% of the principal amount of the redemption notes being redeemed on the redemption date; and
• the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the redemption notes being redeemed on that redemption date (not including the
amount, if any, of accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date) discounted to the redemption date on an annual basis at a rate equal to the sum of the
Comparable Government Bond Rate plus 15 basis points;
plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the redemption notes being redeemed to, but excluding, the redemption date.
At any time on or after December 6, 2026 (three months prior to the maturity date), we may redeem the redemption notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the redemption notes to be redeemed, plus in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the redemption notes being redeemed to, but excluding, the redemption date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on the applicable redemption notes that are due and payable on interest payment dates falling on or prior to a redemption date will be
payable on the interest payment date to the registered holders as of the close of business on the relevant record date according to the applicable redemption notes and the indenture. The
redemption prices for the redemption notes will be calculated on the basis of a 365-day year or a 366-day year, as applicable, and the actual number of days elapsed.
We will mail notice of any redemption at least 10 days, but not more than 60 days, before the redemption date to each registered holder of the redemption notes to be redeemed. Once
notice of redemption is mailed, the redemption notes called for redemption will become due and payable on the redemption date at the applicable redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid
interest applicable to such redemption notes to, but excluding, the redemption date.
“Comparable Government Bond” means, in relation to any Comparable Government Bond Rate calculation, at the discretion of an Independent Investment Banker, a German government
bond whose maturity is closest to the maturity of the redemption notes to be
- 4 -
redeemed, or if such independent investment bank in its discretion determines that such similar bond is not in issue, such other German government bond as such Independent Investment
Banker may, with the advice of three brokers of, and/or market makers in, German government bonds selected by us, determine to be appropriate for determining the Comparable
Government Bond Rate.
“Comparable Government Bond Rate” means the price, expressed as a percentage (rounded to three decimal places, with 0.0005 being rounded upwards), at which the gross redemption
yield on the fixed rate notes to be redeemed, if they were to be purchased at such price on the third business day prior to the date fixed for redemption, would be equal to the gross
redemption yield on such business day of the Comparable Government Bond on the basis of the middle market price of the Comparable Government Bond prevailing at 11:00 a.m. (London
time) on such business day as determined by an Independent Investment Banker.
“Independent Investment Banker” means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by us to act as the “Independent Investment Banker.”
“Reference Treasury Dealer” means each of Barclays Bank PLC, BNP Paribas, Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities plc (or their respective affiliates that are Primary Treasury
Dealers), and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a broker or dealer of, and/or market maker in, German government bonds (a
“Primary Treasury Dealer”), we will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer.
On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the redemption notes or any portion of the redemption notes called for redemption (unless we default in the payment of the
redemption price and accrued and unpaid interest). On or before the redemption date, we will deposit with a paying agent (or the trustee) money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and
accrued and unpaid interest on the redemption notes to be redeemed on that date. If fewer than all of the redemption notes are to be redeemed, the redemption notes to be redeemed shall
be selected by Euroclear and/or Clearstream, in the case of redemption notes represented by a global security, or by the trustee by a method the trustee deems to be fair and appropriate, in
the case of redemption notes that are not represented by a global security.
The notes are not entitled to the benefit of a sinking fund.
Redemption for Tax Reasons
If, as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated under the laws) of the United States (or any taxing authority thereof or therein), or any
change in, or amendments to, an official position regarding the application or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, which change or amendment is announced or becomes
effective on or after February 28, 2017, we become or, based upon a written opinion of independent tax counsel of recognized standing selected by us, will become obligated to pay
additional amounts as described herein under the heading “—Payment of Additional Amounts” with respect to any series of the notes, then we may at our option, having given not less than
10 nor more than 60 days prior notice to holders, redeem, in whole, but not in part, the applicable series of notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount, together with
accrued and unpaid interest (including any additional amounts) on such notes to, but excluding, the redemption date.
Book-Entry
Global Clearance and Settlement
The notes were issued in the form of one or more global notes in fully registered form, without coupons, and are deposited with, or on behalf of, a common depositary, and registered in the
name of the nominee of the common depositary, for, and in respect of interests held through, Euroclear and Clearstream. Except as described herein, certificates will not be issued in
exchange for beneficial interests in the global notes representing the notes.
Except as set forth below, the global notes representing the notes may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective nominees.
Beneficial interests in the global notes representing the notes are represented, and transfers of such beneficial interests are effected, through accounts of financial institutions acting on
behalf of beneficial owners as direct or indirect participants in Euroclear or Clearstream. Those beneficial interests are in denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in
excess thereof. Investors may hold the notes directly through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in such systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in
such systems.
For so long as any series of the notes is represented by a global note deposited with, and registered in the name of a nominee for, a common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
each person (other than Euroclear or Clearstream) who is for the time being shown in the records of Euroclear or of Clearstream as the holder of a particular nominal amount of the notes (in
which regard any certificate or other document issued by Euroclear or Clearstream as to the nominal amount of the notes standing to the account of any person shall be conclusive and
binding for all purposes save in the case of manifest error) shall upon their receipt of a certificate or other document be treated by Pfizer and the trustee as the holder of such nominal
amount of the notes and the registered holder of the global note representing such notes shall be deemed not to be the holder for all purposes other than with respect to the payment of
principal or interest on such nominal amount of the notes, for which purpose the registered holder of the relevant global note shall be treated by Pfizer and the trustee as the holder of such
nominal amount of notes in accordance with and subject to the
- 5 -
terms of the global note representing the notes, and the expressions “noteholder” and “holder of notes” and related expressions shall be construed accordingly.
The information in this section concerning Euroclear and Clearstream Banking and their book-entry systems and procedures has been obtained from sources that we believe to be reliable.
We are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of this information.
We have been advised by Clearstream and Euroclear, respectively, as follows:
Clearstream has advised that:
    
• It is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and licensed as a bank and professional depositary. Clearstream holds securities for its participating organizations and facilitates
the clearance and settlement of securities transactions among its participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its participants, thereby eliminating the need
for physical movement of certificates.
• Clearstream provides to its participants, among other things, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of internationally traded securities and securities
lending and borrowing. Clearstream interfaces with domestic markets in several countries.
• Clearstream has established an electronic bridge with the Euroclear Operator to facilitate the settlement of trades between the nominees of Clearstream and Euroclear.
• As a registered bank in Luxembourg, Clearstream is subject to regulation by the Luxembourg Commission for the Supervision of the Financial Sector.
• Clearstream customers are recognized financial institutions around the world, including underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations
and certain other organizations and may include the underwriters. Indirect access to Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies
that clear through, or maintain a custodial relationship with, a Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.
Distributions with respect to the notes held beneficially through Clearstream will be credited to cash accounts of Clearstream participants in accordance with its rules and procedures.
Euroclear has advised that:
• It was created in 1968 to hold securities for its participants and to clear and settle transactions between Euroclear participants through simultaneous electronic book-entry delivery
against payment, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates and any risk from lack of simultaneous transfers of securities and cash.
• Euroclear includes various other services, including securities lending and borrowing and interfaces with domestic markets in several countries.
• Euroclear is operated by the Euroclear Operator. All operations are conducted by the Euroclear Operator, and all Euroclear securities clearance accounts and Euroclear cash
accounts are accounts with the Euroclear Operator.
• Securities clearance accounts and cash accounts with the Euroclear Operator are governed by the Terms and Conditions Governing Use of Euroclear and the related operating
procedures of Euroclear, and applicable Belgian law (collectively, the “Terms and Conditions”). The Terms and Conditions govern transfers of securities and cash within Euroclear,
withdrawals of securities and cash from Euroclear, and receipts of payments with respect to securities in Euroclear. All securities in Euroclear are held on a fungible basis without
attribution of specific certificates to specific securities clearance accounts. The Euroclear Operator acts under the Terms and Conditions only on behalf of Euroclear participants,
and has no records of or relationship with persons holding through Euroclear participants.
• Euroclear participants include banks (including central banks), securities brokers and dealers and other professional financial intermediaries and may include the underwriters.
Indirect access to Euroclear is also available to other firms that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear participant, either directly or indirectly.
Distributions with respect to the notes held beneficially through Euroclear will be credited to the cash accounts of Euroclear participants in accordance with the Terms and Conditions.
- 6 -
Euroclear and Clearstream Arrangements
So long as Euroclear or Clearstream or their nominee or their common depositary is the registered holder of the global notes representing the notes, Euroclear, Clearstream or such
nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the notes represented by such global notes for all purposes under the indenture and the notes. Payments of
principal, interest and additional amounts, if any, in respect of the global notes representing the notes are made to Euroclear, Clearstream, such nominee or such common depositary, as the
case may be, as registered holder thereof. Neither Pfizer nor the trustee, or any affiliate of any of the above or any person by whom any of the above is controlled (as such term is defined in
the Securities Act) has any responsibility or liability for any records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the global notes representing the notes or
for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
Distributions of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the global notes representing the notes are credited in euros to the extent received by Euroclear or Clearstream from
the paying agent to the cash accounts of Euroclear or Clearstream customers in accordance with the relevant system’s rules and procedures.
Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants, the ability of a person having an interest in the global notes
representing the notes to pledge such interest to persons or entities which do not participate in the relevant clearing system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be
affected by the lack of a physical certificate in respect of such interest.
Secondary Market Trading
Because the purchaser determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any notes where both the purchaser’s and seller’s accounts are located to ensure
that settlement can be made on the desired value date.
We understand that secondary market trading between Clearstream and/or Euroclear participants occurs in the ordinary way following the applicable rules and operating procedures of
Clearstream and Euroclear. Secondary market trading is settled using procedures applicable to conventional eurobonds in global registered form.
The holder of the notes should be aware that investors are only able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other communications involving the notes through Clearstream and
Euroclear on days when those systems are open for business. Those systems may not be open for business on days when banks, brokers and other institutions are open for business in the
United States.
In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be problems with completing transactions involving Clearstream and Euroclear on the same business day as in the United States.
U.S. investors who wish to transfer their interests in the notes, or to make or receive a payment or delivery of the notes, on a particular day, may find that the transactions are not performed
until the next business day in Luxembourg or Brussels, depending on whether Clearstream or Euroclear is used.
Clearstream or Euroclear credits payments to the cash accounts of Clearstream customers or Euroclear participants, as applicable, in accordance with the relevant system’s rules and
procedures, to the extent received by its depositary. Clearstream or the Euroclear Operator, as the case may be, takes any other action permitted to be taken by a holder under the
indenture on behalf of a Clearstream customer or Euroclear participant only in accordance with its relevant rules and procedures.
Clearstream and Euroclear have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of the notes among participants of Clearstream and Euroclear. However, they are under
no obligation to perform or continue to perform those procedures, and they may discontinue those procedures at any time.
Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes
Subject to certain conditions, the notes represented by the global notes are exchangeable for certificated notes in definitive form of like tenor in minimum denominations of €100,000
principal amount and multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof if:
• the common depositary notifies us that it is no longer willing or able to act as a depositary for such global notes or ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange
Act and we fail to appoint a successor common depositary within 90 days;
• an event of default has occurred and is continuing and the common depositary requests the issuance of certificated notes; or
• we determine not to have the notes represented by a global note.
In all cases, certificated notes delivered in exchange for any global note or beneficial interest therein will be registered in the names, and issued in any approved denominations, requested
by or on behalf of the common depositary (in accordance with its customary procedures).
- 7 -
Payments (including principal, premium and interest) and transfers with respect to the notes in certificated form may be executed at the office or agency maintained for such purpose in
London (initially the corporate trust office of the paying agent) or, at our option, by check mailed to the holders thereof at the respective addresses set forth in the register of holders of the
notes (maintained by the registrar), provided that all payments (including principal, premium and interest) on the notes in certificated form, for which the holders thereof have given wire
transfer instructions, are required to be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the holders thereof. No service charge is made for any registration
of transfer, but payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge payable in connection with such registration may be required.
Modification of Indenture
Under the indenture, the rights of the holders of the notes may be modified through a supplemental indenture if the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
notes of all series affected by the modification (voting as one class) consent to it. No modification of the maturity date or principal or interest payment terms, no modification of the currency
for payment, no impairment of the right to sue for the enforcement of payment at the maturity of the debt security, no modification of any conversion rights, no modification reducing the
percentage required for any such supplemental indenture or the percentage required for the waiver of certain defaults, and no modification of the foregoing provisions or any other
provisions relating to the waiver of past defaults or the waiver of certain covenants, is effective against any holder without its consent.
Events of Default
Each of the following will constitute an Event of Default under the indenture with respect to the notes of the applicable series:
• we fail to make the principal or any premium payment on any note when due;
• we fail to make any sinking fund payment for 60 days after payment was due by the terms of any note;
• we fail to pay interest on any note for 60 days after payment was due;
• we fail to perform any other covenant in the indenture and this failure continues for 90 days after we receive written notice of it; or
• we, or a court, take certain actions relating to the bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of our company.
A default under our other indebtedness will not be a default under the indenture for the notes, and a default under one series of the notes will not necessarily be a default under another
series. The trustee may withhold notice to the holders of notes of the applicable series of any default (except for defaults that involve our failure to pay principal or interest) if it considers
such withholding of notice to be in the best interests of the holders.
If an Event of Default with respect to outstanding notes of any series occurs and is continuing, then the trustee or the holders of at least 33% in principal amount of outstanding notes of that
series may declare, in a written notice, the principal amount (or, if any of the notes of that series are original issue discount securities, such portion of the principal amount of such notes)
plus accrued and unpaid interest on all notes of that series to be immediately due and payable. At any time after a declaration of acceleration with respect to notes of any series has been
made, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes may rescind and annul the acceleration if:
• the holders act before the trustee has obtained a judgment or decree for payment of the money due;
• we have paid or deposited with the trustee a sum sufficient to pay overdue interest and overdue principal other than the accelerated interest and principal; and
• we have cured or the holders have waived all Events of Default, other than the non-payment of accelerated principal and interest with respect to notes of that series, as provided
in the indenture.
If a default in the performance or breach of the indenture shall have occurred and be continuing, the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes of all
series affected thereby, by notice to the trustee, may waive any past Event of Default or its consequences under the indenture. However, an Event of Default cannot be waived with respect
to any series of notes in the following two circumstances:     
• a failure to pay the principal of, and premium, if any, or interest on any security or in the payment of any sinking fund installment; or
• a covenant or provision that cannot be modified or amended without the consent of each holder of outstanding notes of that series.
Other than its duties in case of a default, the trustee is not obligated to exercise any of its rights or powers under the indenture at the request, order or direction of any holders, unless the
holders offer the trustee reasonable indemnity. Holders of a majority in principal
- 8 -
amount outstanding of any series of notes may, subject to certain limitations, direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding or any remedy available to the trustee, or
exercising any power conferred upon the trustee, for such applicable series of notes.
We are required to deliver an annual officers’ certificate to the trustee, stating whether we are in default in the performance and observance of any of the terms, provisions and conditions of
the indenture, and, if we are in default, specifying all such defaults and the nature and status thereof.
Defeasance
When we use the term defeasance, we mean discharge from some or all of our obligations under the indenture. Subject to certain additional conditions, if we irrevocably deposit with the
trustee sufficient cash or government securities to pay the principal, interest, any premium and any other sums due to the stated maturity date or a redemption date of the notes of a
particular series, then at our option:
• we will be discharged from our obligations with respect to the notes of such series; or
• we will no longer be under any obligation to comply with certain restrictive covenants under the indenture, and certain events of default will no longer apply to us.
To exercise our defeasance option, we must deliver to the trustee an officer’s certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent related to the defeasance have
been complied with.

Amendment No. 10 to the
Pfizer Supplemental Savings Plan (the “PSSP”)

* * *
(New material underlined; Deletions crossed out)
1.Section 2.17 is amended to add the following language to the end thereof to read as follows:
    2.17    In Service Transfer to PSSP. The term “In Service Transfer to PSSP” shall mean (i) the one-time election and transfer into the Plan of the balance of a Member’s Pfizer Inc.
Nonfunded Supplemental Retirement Plan NonGrandfathered benefit by an active employee who had either obtained his or her Early Retirement Date under the Pfizer Consolidated
Pension Plan or obtained the age of 65. Such one-time election was required to be made between October 1, 2015 and November 9, 2015, and became effective on January 1, 2016 (the
“Initial In Service Transfer to PSSP”); or (ii) the one-time election and transfer into the Plan of the balance of a Member’s Pfizer Inc. Nonfunded Supplemental Retirement Plan
NonGrandfathered benefit by an active employee who had obtained eligibility for a full unreduced benefit (with some exceptions) under the Pfizer Consolidated Pension Plan, as approved
by the Company at the June 23, 2022 Board meeting. Eligibility for such one-time election was determined on July 1, 2022 (the “Active In Service Transfer to PSSP”). The Initial In Service
Transfer to PSSP is initially invested in the Designated Default Fund under the Plan, and thereafter as directed by the Member, and initially as directed by the Member for any trailing In
Service Transfer to PSSP due to the timing difference between the accrual and payment of bonuses. The Active In Service Transfer to PSSP is initially invested in the Market Rate Fund,
and thereafter as directed by the Member. All In Service Transfers to PSSP will be distributed in a lump sum in the January coincident with or following the Member’s Separation from
Service, except in the event of death or a Redeferral in accordance with Section 6.8.
2.New Section 2.20 is added to read as follows and the remaining Sections are renumbered accordingly:
2.20    Market Rate Fund. The term Market Rate Fund means an investment fund under the Plan earning 120% of the long-term applicable federal rate.
3.Section 2.32 of the PSSP is amended to read as follows:
2.32    Retirement. The term “Retirement” means a termination of employment with an Employer after the Eligible Employee has attained either (i) age 65, (ii) age 62 with at least 5
Years of Service, or (iii) age 55 with at least 10 Years of Service (where “Years of “Service” is as determined in accordance with the Qualified Plan), or an Eligible Employee who was
eligible under the Pfizer Voluntary Early Retirement Program or involuntarily terminated under the Special Separation Program under a Company-sponsored severance plan, and who
would attain either (i) age 65, (ii) age 62 with at least 5 Years of Service, or (iii) age 55 with at least 10 Years of Service, if credited with:
(a)    An additional five years of age;
(b)    An additional five Years of Service; or
(c)    A combination (in months) of years of age and Years of Service, which combination does not exceed 60 months.
4.Section 5.4 of Article V is amended to read as follows:
5.4    Investments. All Excess Regular Earnings Deferrals and Retirement Savings Contributions will be credited with an amount equal to the amount which would have been
earned had such amounts been actually invested in one or more of the “Funds” (other than the Pfizer Match Fund available for investment under the Qualified Plan) or the Market
Rate Fund, as the Member may be defaulted into or elect from time to time, in one percent (1%) increments. To the extent no investment election is provided when any amounts
are credited to the Plan or otherwise, then each of such amounts shall be deemed to be invested in the Designated Default Fund under the Plan. The Initial In Service Transfer to
PSSP shall be deemed to be invested in the Designated Default Fund under the Plan; the Active In Service Transfer to PSSP shall be deemed to be invested in the Market Rate
Fund. The portion of the Member’s Account attributable to the true-up to the
Initial In Service Transfer to PSSP, Employer Accruals, Active Death Benefit SERP Transfers and Transfers to PSSP shall be deemed to be invested in accordance with the
Member’s investment elections. Rules similar to those which govern the Qualified Plan shall apply for purposes of determining the value of the deemed investments (but based on
this Plan’s valuation dates) and the timing, frequency and permissibility of investment transfers. No provision of this Plan shall require the Company or any other Employer to
actually invest any amount in any “Fund” or in any other investment vehicle. The Plan is an unfunded plan that is not subject to the funding requirements of ERISA, meaning that
there are no actual investments held in a trust. The Accounts represent unsecured obligations of the Company, and no funds are set aside from the Company’s general assets to
cover such Accounts. The Plan is subject to the full faith and credit of the Company, and Members would be general creditors in the event of the Company’s insolvency. Except as
otherwise provided in this Section, distributions and withdrawals from the Plan are valued as of the last business day of the calendar quarter preceding the calendar quarter of the
distribution. Withdrawals on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency are valued as of the last business day of the month preceding the day that the withdrawal request is
received. Payments that would otherwise be made but are delayed on account of a Member being a Key Employee are valued on the distribution date.
5.The first paragraph of Section 6.8 is amended to read as follows:
6.1 Redeferrals. Notwithstanding any elected Payment Option or deemed elected Payment Option made (or deemed made), except with respect to Special Accruals for
which the Member was not provided with a redeferral option under the Written Agreement, a Member may make one or more subsequent elections to change the form of a distribution for a
deferred amount (and such elections can be with respect to each separate account), provided that such an election shall be effective only if the following conditions are satisfied:

All powers of the Committee or its delegate shall be executed in their sole and absolute discretion, in the best interest of the Company, not as a fiduciary, and in keeping with the
objectives of the Plan and need not be uniform as to similarly situated individuals. The decisions of the Committee or its delegate with respect to the administration of the Plan, including

it shall deem appropriate.
SECTION 4. ELIGIBILITY

discretion. An Employee may only participate in one annual cash incentive plan sponsored by the Company or any Affiliate with respect to a Performance Period. As such, any
Employee who is a participant in a sales incentive program or another cash incentive plan with respect to a Performance Period is not eligible to participate in the Plan.
(b)Any Employee who is performing services in the United States or Puerto Rico and is eligible to receive an award for a Performance Period who is issued a Compliance Written
Warning during such Performance Period, may not receive an Award in excess of the lesser of (i) Ninety percent (90%) of his or her Target Incentive Award, or (ii) Ninety
percent (90%) of his or her award prior to consideration of the Participant’s performance as set forth in Section 5(a)(4). Any Employee who is performing services in the U.S. or

lesser of (i) Seventy-Five percent (75%) of his or her Target Incentive Award, or (ii) Seventy-Five percent (75%) of his or her award prior to consideration of the Participant’s
performance as set forth in Section 5(a)(4).
SECTION 5. AWARDS
(a) Under the Plan, the Committee may grant Awards to Participants from time to time with respect to a Performance Period based upon the achievement of performance objectives
over the Performance Period. Award payments are earned based upon the following:
1)The initial targeted Incentive Pool is equal to the sum of the Target Incentive Awards for all Participants for the Performance Period.
2)The final funding of the Incentive Pool is determined by the Committee, in its discretion, based on the Company’s performance against pre-set annual goals for the
following financial and performance measures: (i) revenue, (ii) adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS), (iii) cash flow from operations, (iv) pipeline achievements,
(v) environmental, sustainability and governance (ESG) achievements, and (vi) any other factors adopted by the Committee.
3)Once the final funding is determined, Incentive Pool dollars are allocated to the business unit, division or function in which a Participant worked during the
Performance as determined by the CEO.
4)A Participant’s actual Award is determined based on his or her Target Incentive Award as calculated under Section 5(A) and (B) below, as adjusted by the business
unit, division and country performance funding factors stated above for the Performance Period as applicable, and further adjusted by the individual’s performance
against their applicable objectives, as assessed by the Participant’s manager and management
- 3 -
in accordance with procedures, guidelines and/or metrics established by the Committee, or its designee, from time to time.
5)A Participant’s Target Incentive Award is calculated as set forth below:
(A) Where a Participant’s Target Incentive Award is based on the Incentive Target Percentage, the Target Incentive Award is calculated as:
i.Group 1 Countries: the sum of the product of a Participant’s Eligible Earnings for the portion of the Performance Period that the Participant is eligible to
participate in the Plan, multiplied by the Incentive Target Percentage for the Participant’s salary grade in the respective period of eligibility.
ii.Group 2 Countries: the product of a Participant’s Eligible Earnings as of the immediately preceding December 31st, multiplied by the Incentive Target
Percentage in effect on December 31st for the Participant’s salary grade, pro-rated for the number of months during the Performance Period in which he or
she is eligible to participate in the Plan.
iii.For Participants in the ELTI Program: the sum of the product of the Participant’s Eligible Earnings for the portion of the Performance Period in which he or
she is eligible to participate in the Plan (adjusted for changes in grades, Incentive Target Percentages or eligibility, as applicable), multiplied by the
Incentive Target Percentage for the Participant’s salary grade in the respective period of eligibility. However, if the Participant’s salary grade has not been
reduced since January 1, 2022 and his/her Target Incentive Award for the 2021 performance year is higher than the calculated amount under this Section
5 for the current Performance Period, then the 2021 Target Incentive Award shall be the Participant’s Incentive Target Amount for such year. This provision
shall apply until such time as the Target Incentive Award for such future Performance Period exceeds the 2021 Target Incentive Award.
(B) Where a Participant’s Target Incentive Award is based on the Incentive Target Amount, the Target Incentive Award is calculated as 1/365th /366th of the
annual fixed Incentive Target Amount for each day within a month the Participant is eligible to participate in the Plan.
(b) A Participant’s final Award shall be capped at 250% of the Target Incentive Award which is the maximum Incentive Award Opportunity.
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Award may also be subject to such other terms and conditions as the Committee shall deem advisable or appropriate from time to time,
consistent with the provisions of the Plan as herein set forth, including but not limited to, the pro-ration or adjustment of Target Incentive Awards, Incentive Target Percentages and/or
Incentive Award Opportunities, and Incentive Target Amounts, based upon a Participant’s date of hire, re-hire, change in position and/or salary grade (including a change in position or
other similar change that causes the Participant to no longer be eligible for the Plan), change in local base salary, or transfer to a different business unit or division during a Performance
Period. In addition, any Awards granted to Participants may contain such other provisions as may be necessary to meet the requirements of the Code and/or related regulations issued
thereunder in order to satisfy or comply with relevant law.
SECTION 6. PAYMENT OF AWARDS
Unless otherwise required by local law or local payroll schedules for Participants located outside of the United States, Awards will be paid in a lump sum on or prior to the 15th day of the
third month of the year immediately following the year in which the close of the Performance Period occurs in accordance with the applicable short-term deferral exception provisions of
Section 409A, or, in accordance with procedures established by the Committee and the applicable provisions of Section 409A, on a deferred basis pursuant to Section 9 hereof, if
applicable. However, any payment may be delayed or deferred upon the reasonable anticipation that the making of the payment would violate Federal securities laws or other applicable
law such as Section 409A, provided that the payment is made at the earliest date that the Committee reasonably anticipates it can be made without such violation. In the case of any
Involuntary Termination, payment may be delayed until the receipt of any release required by the Company or by an applicable severance plan.
SECTION 7. SPECIAL PAYMENT EVENTS
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6 of the Plan, the following payment terms shall apply to Awards in the following events:
(a) Voluntary Termination - If a Participant voluntarily terminates his or her employment (other than due to Retirement) prior to the end of the Performance Period, he or she is
ineligible for an Award or any payment with respect to an Award for such Performance Period. If a Participant voluntarily terminates his or her employment after the end of the
Performance Period, he or she is eligible for an Award or any payment with respect to an Award for such Performance Period under the applicable provisions of this Plan at the
Committee’s discretion.
(b) Involuntary Termination - If a Participant’s employment is terminated as the result of an Involuntary Termination, prior to the end of the Performance Period, his or her Target
Incentive Award will be pro-rated based on actual days of eligibility, his or her Eligible Earnings and his or her Incentive Target Percentage or Incentive Target Award during the
Performance Period. The proration factor is the number of days in the Performance Period up to the termination date divided by 365/366 days. Such Award will be paid as soon as
administratively practicable after the Participant’s termination (subject to the return of any release, as applicable), but not later than March 15th of the year following termination.
- 4 -
Effective for Involuntary Terminations after December 31, 2022, that are prior to the end of the Performance Period, such Participant’s Target Incentive Award will be prorated based on
actual days of eligibility (excluding (except in the event of a WARN termination) any non-working Notice Period as defined in the applicable severance plan; for avoidance of doubt, any
non-working days after December 31, 2022 will not be included.
If a Participant is involuntarily terminated after the end of the Performance Period, he or she is eligible for an Award or any payment with respect to an Award for such Performance
Period under the applicable provisions of this Plan. If a Participant’s employment is terminated as the result of an Involuntary Termination and such Participant is also eligible for
Retirement, such Award will be paid on a pro-rated basis in accordance with Section 7(c) subject to Company’s discretion.
Terminations for Cause or Performance-Related Terminations - If a Participant’s employment is terminated for Cause or constitutes a Performance-Related Termination prior to the end of
the Performance Period, he or she is ineligible for an Award in respect of the year of termination, unless otherwise required by local law. If a Participant is terminated for Cause or
Performance-Related Termination after the end of the Performance Period, he or she may be eligible for an Award or any payment with respect to an Award for such Performance Period
under the applicable provisions of this Plan subject to Company’s discretion.
(c) Retirement - If a Participant retires during the Performance Period, he or she may be eligible, in the Company’s discretion, for a prorated Target Incentive Award using the
calculation in Section 7(b) above. In exceptional circumstances only, the Company can determine, in its sole discretion, to pay a different amount based on the latest forecasted
performance and/or expected funding for the performance period with consideration of individual, business unit, division and/or function performance, including in the event that the latest
forecasted funding level is below target, in which case the Company may pay an amount lower than target. Such Award will be paid as soon as administratively practicable after the
retirement but not later than March 15th of the year following termination and in accordance with the applicable funding of the Participant’s business unit or division. If a Participant retires
after the end of the Performance Period, he or she is eligible for an Award or any payment with respect to an Award for such Performance Period under the applicable provisions of this
Plan for an active Participant.
(d) Short-Term Disability or Leave of Absence - If a Participant is on short-term disability (STD) or an approved paid leave of absence under the Family & Medical Leave Act (or
other similar law) during a Performance Period and has at least 90 days of Eligible Earnings within the Performance Period, he or she is eligible for a Target Incentive Award for such
Performance Period. Such Award will be pro-rated to exclude the time the Participant is considered on STD or paid leave, as determined by the Committee or its designee, and will be
based on the actual days of eligibility for the Plan. A Participant shall be considered eligible for the Plan during the first 90 days of STD or paid leave. If eligible, such pro-rated Target
Incentive Award will be the lesser of the Participant’s (i) pro-rated Target Incentive Award or (ii) pro-rated Target Incentive Award based on the performance of the Company, the
Participant’s business unit, division or function and the Participant’s individual performance, within the Company’s discretion. Such Award will be paid as soon as practicable after the
performance criteria have been met but not later than March 15th of the year following termination. If a Participant is on an approved Military leave of absence under the Company’s
Military Leave Policy and is eligible for differential pay, the calculation of the differential pay shall include the payment of an Award as if such Participant were actively employed.
(e) Death - If a Participant dies during a Performance Period, in the Committee’s discretion, the pro-rated Target Incentive Award will be paid to the Participant’s estate as soon as
administratively possible following the Participant’s death, and in any event no later than December 31st of the first year following the year of the Participant’s death.
SECTION 8. AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION
The Company reserves the right in its sole and absolute discretion to amend or terminate the Plan, at any time, including after the end of the Performance Period and prior to payment of
the Award, with or without notice, by action of the Executive Leadership Team or the Committee, as applicable. This right includes, but is not limited to, eligibility for an Award,
determination of Incentive Pool funding, the modification of incentive measures, performance targets and/or performance results. This right also includes the modification of the terms of
the Plan, as may be necessary or desirable, to comply with applicable laws and local customs of countries in which the Company operates or has employees. The Company’s obligation
to pay compensation as herein provided is subject to any applicable orders, rules or regulations of any government agency or office having authority to regulate the payment of wages,
salaries and other forms of compensation.
The Committee may delegate to another committee or person, as it may appoint, the authority to take any action consistent with the terms of the Plan, either before or after an Award has
been granted, which such other committee or person deems necessary or advisable to comply with any government laws or regulatory requirements of a foreign country, including but
not limited to, modifying or amending the terms and conditions governing any Awards, or establishing any local country plans as sub-plans to this Plan. In addition, under all
circumstances, the Committee or its delegate which for this purpose includes the Executive Vice President, Chief People Experience Officer and the Senior Vice President, Total
Rewards, may make non-substantive administrative changes to the Plan as to conform with or take advantage of governmental requirements, statutes or regulations.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee or its designee may amend the terms of any Award heretofore granted, prospectively or retroactively, in order to cure any potential defects
under Section 409A, in a manner deemed appropriate by the Committee in its sole discretion and absolute discretion, without the consent of the Participant.
SECTION 9. DEFERRAL OF AWARDS UNDER THE COMPANY’S DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN
Except as otherwise provided in this Plan, the Committee may provide upon the granting of an Award hereunder, that it is eligible to be deferred under, and pursuant to the terms and
conditions of, the Pfizer Inc Deferred Compensation Plan, as such plan may be amended from time to time. Any such deferral shall be in accordance with the terms of such plan and in
compliance with the applicable provisions of Section 409A.
- 5 -
SECTION 10. TAX CONSIDERATIONS
(a) For Participants in the United States, Award payments under the Plan will be treated as taxable income for the year in which the Participant receives the payment. The Company
and its Affiliates shall be authorized to withhold appropriate amounts from such payments to satisfy all federal, state and local tax withholding requirements and any other authorized
deductions due in respect of an Award payment hereunder and to take such other action as may be deemed necessary in the opinion of the Company or Affiliate to satisfy all obligations
for the payment of such taxes.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the terms of the Plan are intended to, and shall be interpreted and applied so as to, comply in all respects with Section 409A. The
Committee may amend the terms of any Award heretofore granted, prospectively or retroactively, in order to cure any potential defects under Section 409A, in a manner deemed
appropriate by the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion, without the consent of the Participant. Nothing in this Section 10 shall be construed as an admission that any of the
compensation and/or benefits payable under this Plan constitutes “deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A. Furthermore, the Company does not represent, covenant or
guarantee that any particular Award made under the Plan will be exempt from Section 409A and/or will avoid unfavorable tax consequences to the Participant (e.g., Section 409A
penalties).
(b)For Participants located outside of the United States, local country rules on taxation and withholding treatment will apply.
SECTION 11. RECOUPMENT
In the event of a significant restatement of the Company’s consolidated financial statements (other than a restatement resulting from a change in accounting principles), the Committee
will review Awards made under the Plan for performance for the fiscal periods affected by the restatement. If the Committee determines that an Award would have been lower (or would
not have been made) if it had been based on the restated results, the Committee may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, seek recoupment of all or any portion of such Award as it
deems appropriate, in its sole and absolute discretion, after a review of all relevant facts and circumstances. Any recoupment may be in addition to any other remedies that may be
available to the Company under applicable law. Nothing contained in this paragraph will limit the Company’s ability to seek recoupment, in appropriate circumstances and as permitted or
required by applicable law (including Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), of any amounts from any Employee, whether or not the Employee is a senior
executive. If a Participant owes any outstanding debt, including but not limited to loans, vacation and salary and expense advances, to the Company or any Affiliates, any Award payable
to the Participant under this Plan, to the extent such amount is exempt from Section 409A, shall be reduced by the full amount of such debt, as permitted by law.
SECTION 12. GENERAL PROVISIONS
(a) Awards under this Plan are considered variable compensation and as such are not guaranteed.
(b) No Employee shall have the right to be selected to receive an Award under this Plan or, having been so selected, to be selected to receive a future Award. Neither the Award nor
any benefits arising out of this Plan shall constitute part of a Participant’s employment or service contract with the Company or any Affiliate and, accordingly, this Plan and the benefits
hereunder may be terminated at any time in the sole and exclusive discretion of the Company without giving rise to liability on the part of the Company or any Affiliate for severance
payments.
(c) No Employee shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Employees or Participants under the Plan.
(d) Nothing in the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan shall be deemed to constitute an employment or service contract or confer or be deemed to confer on any Employee or
Participant any right to continue in the employ or service of, or to continue any other relationship with, the Company or any Affiliate or limit in any way the right of the Company or any
Affiliate to terminate an Employee’s employment or Participant’s service at any time, with or without Cause.
(e) Except as otherwise required by the terms of the Plan, recipients of Awards under the Plan shall not be required to make any payment or provide consideration other than the
rendering of services.
(f) If any provision of the Plan is or becomes or is deemed invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed
applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws or if it cannot be construed or deemed amended without, in the
determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of the Plan, it shall be stricken and the remainder of the Plan shall remain in full force and effect.
(g) Awards may be granted and paid to Participants who are foreign nationals or employed outside the United States, or both, on such terms and conditions different from those
applicable to Awards to Participants employed in the United States as may, in the judgment of the Committee, be necessary or desirable in order to recognize differences in local law or
tax policy. The Committee also may impose conditions on the payment of Awards in order to minimize the Company’s obligation with respect to tax equalization for Employees on
assignments outside their home country.
(h) If approved by the Committee in its sole discretion, an Employee’s absence or leave because of military or governmental service, disability or other reason shall not be
considered an interruption of employment for any purpose under the Plan; provided, however, that to the extent an Award under this Plan is subject to Section 409A, such absence or
leave shall be considered a Separation from Service to the extent provided by Section 409A.
SECTION 13. GOVERNING LAW
The provisions of the Plan shall be construed, regulated and administered according to the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law, except to
the extent superseded by any controlling Federal statute.

(Further Amended Effective March 1, 2014)
(Further Amended Effective April 24, 2014)
(Further Amended Effective October 1, 2014)
(Further Amended Effective December 9, 2022)
1.    Deferral Election for Cash Compensation. Under this Pfizer Inc. Nonfunded Deferred Compensation and Unit Award Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the “Plan”) each
director who is not an employee of Pfizer Inc. (the “Company”) or any of its subsidiaries may elect on or before the last day of any calendar year to have payment of all or a specified part of
all fees payable to him or her for services as a director during the following calendar year and thereafter deferred until he or she Separates from Service (as defined in Paragraph 8) with the
Company. Any such election shall be made by written notice directed to the Secretary of the Company. A director’s election to defer fees shall continue until the director Separates from
Service unless he or she earlier terminates such election with respect to future fees by timely written notice delivered to the Secretary of the Company. Any such notice shall become
effective on the first day of the calendar year immediately following written notice directed to the Secretary of the Company. Amounts credited to the account of a director prior to the
effective date of such notice shall not be affected thereby and shall be paid to him or her in accordance with paragraph 5 (or paragraph 6 in the event of his or her death) below.
2.    Investment of Deferred Cash Compensation. All deferred cash fees (“Deferred Cash Compensation”) shall be held in the general funds of the Company and shall be credited
to the director’s account, and, at the director’s election, the account shall be credited either with a) interest at a rate equal to 120% of the Long-Term Applicable Federal Rate, compounded
monthly, b) a number of units, calculated to the nearest thousandth of a unit, produced by dividing the amount of fees deferred by the closing market price of the Company’s common stock
as reported on the Consolidated Tape of the New York Stock Exchange on the last business day of the fiscal quarter in which the fees are earned, or c) gains and losses corresponding to
additional investment alternatives as may be selected by the Pfizer Savings Plan Committee or appropriate Pfizer staff from time to time. A director may elect to switch the investment form
of deferral of previously deferred Deferred Cash Compensation by giving notice as directed by the administrator of the Plan from time to time; provided, however, that a switch into, or out of,
the unit account or any other account denominated in Pfizer shares shall be permitted only if the director has not elected to switch out of, or into, the unit account or other account
denominated in Pfizer stock within this Plan, the Pfizer Company Stock Fund within the Pfizer Savings Plan or the unit account within the Pfizer Inc. Nonfunded Deferred Compensation and
Supplemental Savings Plan during the prior six months. The Awarded Units, as described in paragraph 3, shall not be affected by any such election other than as set forth in paragraph 3(C)
below.
3.    Awards of Units.
(A) An award of units (which may include fractional units), in such amount or having such value as may be determined by the Board of Directors on the recommendation of
its Governance & Sustainability Committee, shall be made to each director effective on the date he or she is elected for the first time, and thereafter each year that he or she
continues as a director effective as of the date of the annual meeting of shareholders. All such units shall be referred to as the “Awarded Units.” In the event of any change in the
number or kind of outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, including a stock split or splits, or a stock dividend, an appropriate adjustment shall be made in the
number of Awarded Units.
(B) Unless and until the director shall have satisfied the then current equity ownership guidelines as set forth in the the Company’s Corporate Governance Principles, the
director’s account shall be credited with the number of Units so awarded and such Units shall remain credited until distribution as described in paragraph 5 below (or paragraph 6
in the case of the director’s death) or as set forth in paragraph 3(C) below. Each director who has satisfied the equity ownership guidelines as of the end of any calendar year may
elect on or before the last day of such calendar year to have all or a specified part of all Awarded Units payable to him or her during the following calendar year (a) deferred until
he or she Separates from Service with the Company, or (b) paid to him or her in shares of Company common stock as soon as practicable following the date of such award. Any
such election shall be made by written notice directed to the Secretary of the Company. Subject to the director’s satisfaction of the then current equity ownership guidelines, a
director’s election to defer Awarded Units shall continue until the director Separates from Service unless he or she earlier terminates such election with respect to future Awarded
Units by timely written notice directed to the Secretary of the Company. Any such notice shall become effective on the first day of the calendar year immediately following written
notice. Awarded Units credited to the account of a director prior to the effective date of such notice shall not be affected thereby and shall be paid to him or her in accordance with
paragraph 5 (or paragraph 6 in the event of his or her death) below.
(C)    As of and following the date that is six (6) months following the director’s Separation from Service and until full distribution as described in paragraph 5 below (or paragraph 6
in the case of the director’s death), a director may elect by giving notice as directed by the administrator of the Plan from time to time, to switch the investment form of previously
deferred Awarded Units to be invested in any of the additional investment alternatives as may be selected by the Pfizer Savings Plan Committee or appropriate Pfizer staff from
time to time.
(D) Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, the following provisions shall apply if any director notifies the Company that he or she is subject to any policy or provision
imposed by his or her employer that limits or restricts the amount and/or type of compensation that may be received by such director from the Company (any such policy or
provision being referred to as a “Limitation”):
(i) If the Limitation restricts the amount of compensation that may be received by the director, the dollar value of the Awarded Units (based on the closing price of
the Company’s common stock on the date
of the annual meeting of shareholders) shall be reduced to comply with the Limitation; provided, however, that the director may elect, before the first day of
any calendar year, in a manner that complies with section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and regulations thereunder
(“Section 409A”), to comply with the Limitation as to amount by reducing the cash compensation payable to such director for such year rather than reducing
the dollar value of the Awarded Units to be credited to the director’s account.
(ii) If the Limitation prohibits the director from receiving any compensation in the form of Awarded Units, the award specified in paragraph 3(A) (reduced as
provided in subparagraph (i) above to comply with the Limitation as to amount), shall not be made. Instead, the dollar value of such Awarded Units (based on
the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the annual meeting of shareholders) shall be credited to the director’s account.
    
(iii) Any dollar amounts credited to the director’s account in accordance with subparagraph (ii) above shall be credited with interest at a rate equal to 120% of the
Long-Term Applicable Federal Rate, compounded monthly.
(iv) If, as permitted by the proviso to subparagraph (i) above, the director elects to reduce his or her cash compensation, such reduced cash compensation will be
payable on a quarterly basis.
(v) A director subject to the Limitation described in subparagraph (ii) above may not elect to switch the form of investment of any amounts deferred pursuant to
subparagraph (ii) above, and no dividends shall be declared with respect thereto, and any election under Section 4(C) is inapplicable to any such amounts.
(vi) The dollar value, if any, in excess of the amounts that the director is permitted to receive pursuant to the Limitation may be contributed to one or more
charities selected by the Governance & Sustainability Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors, on the terms approved by such Committee, acting in
its sole discretion; provided, that such Committee may consider the director’s recommendation as to the recipient or recipients of such contribution.
4.    Dividends.
(A)    Whenever a dividend is declared, the number of units in the director’s account (both with respect to Deferred Cash Compensation invested in the unit account and
Awarded Units, and including any increase in units due to deferred dividends pursuant to this Paragraph 4(A)) shall be increased by the result of the following calculations: 1) the
number of units in the director’s account multiplied by any cash dividend declared by the Company on a share of its common stock, divided by the closing market price of such
common stock on the related dividend record date; and/or 2) the number of units in the director’s account multiplied by any stock dividend declared by the Company on a share of
its common stock. In the event of any change in the number or kind of outstanding shares of common stock of the Company including a stock split or splits, other than a stock
dividend as provided above, an appropriate adjustment shall be made in the number of units credited to the director’s account.
(B)    Solely as to the Awarded Units granted, earned and vested prior to January 1, 2005 (within the meaning of Section 409A), a director may elect to receive directly in
cash without deferral the value of any cash dividend, declared by the Company on a share of its common stock, in lieu of having his or her account credited as specified above in
Paragraph 4(A). Any such election shall be made, and may also be terminated, by written notice directed to the Secretary of the Company prior to the calendar year of the
payment of the dividend.
(C)    Solely as to the Awarded Units granted, earned or vested after December 31, 2004 (within the meaning of Section 409A), a director may elect to receive directly in
cash without deferral the value of any cash dividend, declared by the Company on a share of its common stock, in lieu of having his or her account credited as specified above in
Paragraph 4(A), if such election is made within 30 days of the director’s first becoming eligible to participate in this Plan or another account balance plan required to be
aggregated with this Plan under Section 409A, provided that such election shall apply only with respect to dividends declared subsequent to the date of receipt of the election by
the Company. Otherwise such dividends on any such Awarded Units will be deferred to the director’s unit account as described above in Paragraph 4(A). Such election is
permanent and may not be changed thereafter. For individuals who were, are, or will be eligible directors at any time between December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2008, and
with respect to the cash dividends received on Awarded Units granted, earned or vested after December 31, 2004 (within the meaning of Section 409A) and granted, earned, and
vested prior to December 31, 2008, such directors shall make their elections as to the receipt of such cash dividends prior to the year of payment of the applicable dividend and
such elections shall not apply to the dividends payable on any Awarded Units previously granted in a year prior to such election. The last such election shall apply to all future
cash dividends made subsequent to December 31, 2008 with respect to Awarded Units granted, earned or vested after December 31, 2004 (within the meaning of Section 409A).
Such election is permanent and may not be changed thereafter.
5.    Distributions.
(A)    Deferred Cash Compensation and Awarded Units deferred prior to January 1, 2005. With respect to Deferred Cash Compensation and Awarded Units granted,
earned and vested prior to January 1, 2005 (within the meaning of Section 409A), and including related earnings thereon, at least one year before he or she ceases to be a
director of the Company, a director may elect, or may modify an election that he or she had previously made, to receive payment (payable in either cash or shares of common
stock at the election of the director) of his or her combined Deferred Cash Compensation and Awarded Units accounts in a lump sum or in annual installments from two to fifteen,
and he or she may elect to have such lump sum payment or first annual installment made either (1) on the last business day of the month following his or her termination as a
director, or (2) in January of the year following his or her termination as a director. In the absence of an election, such payment will begin with the first month of the year following
the director’s termination and will be made in five annual installments.
- 2 -
(B)    Deferred Cash Compensation and Awarded Units deferred after December 31, 2004. With respect to Deferred Cash Compensation and Awarded Units granted, earned or
vested after December 31, 2004 (within the meaning of Section 409A), and including related earnings thereon (the “Post-2004 Deferrals”), within 30 days of first becoming eligible
to participate in this Plan or another account balance plan required to be aggregated with this Plan under Section 409A, a director must elect the timing and form of his or her
distribution (payable in either cash or shares of common stock at the election of the director) of his or her deferred compensation account (containing both Deferred Cash
Compensation and Awarded Units and related earnings thereon); except that for individuals who were, are, or will be eligible directors prior to or as of December 31, 2008, such
directors shall make their elections as to the form and timing of distribution on or before December 31, 2008 in accordance with the transition rule contained in IRS Notice 2007-
86. Such elections are permanent and may not be changed thereafter; provided that on and after December 9, 2022, and for each subsequent plan year thereafter, a director may
designate on or before the last day of such calendar year, a separate election as to the timing and form of his or her distribution with respect to Deferred Cash Compensation and
Awarded Units granted in the calendar year following any such election (each, a plan year deferral). Each such election made prior to December 31 shall become effective on the
following January 1 and is irrevocable for the plan year to which it applies. For example, an election made by a director prior to December 31, 2022 with respect to the timing and
form of his or her distribution with respect to such director’s 2023 Deferred Cash Compensation and Awarded Units shall thereafter be irrevocable with respect to those deferred
amounts and such election shall not affect any other portion of the director’s deferred compensation account The director must elect as to:
(i) Timing:
i.to receive the lump sum distribution or first annual installment on the last business day of the month following his or her Separation from Service; or
ii.to receive the lump sum distribution or first annual installment in the first month of the year following the director’s Separation from Service; and
(ii) Form:
i.to receive the distribution in a lump sum; or
ii.to receive the distribution in installments from two to fifteen.
(iii) In the absence of an election, such payments will begin with the first month of the year following the director’s Separation from Service and will be made in
five annual installments.
(C)    (i)    With respect to all units in the director’s account (containing both Deferred Cash Compensation and Awarded Units and related earnings thereon), the amount
payable to the director in each instance shall be determined by multiplying the number of units by the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the day
prior to the date for payment or the last business day prior to that date, if the day prior to the date for payment is not a business day.
(ii)    Where the director receives the balance of his or her account in annual installments, each installment shall be a fraction of the value of the balance of the
deferred compensation credited to the director’s account either by way of interest or units calculated under Paragraph 2 hereof, as the case may be, on the date of such
payment, the numerator of which is one (1) and the denominator of which is the total number of installments remaining to be paid at that time.
(D)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to Deferred Cash Compensation and Awarded Units granted, earned or vested after December 31, 2004 (within the
meaning of Section 409A), and including related earnings thereon, distributions may not be made to a Key Employee (as defined in Paragraph 8) upon a Separation from Service
before the date which is six months after the date of the Key Employee’s Separation from Service (or, if earlier, the date of death of the Key Employee). Any payments that would
otherwise be made during this period of delay shall be accumulated and paid on the first day of the seventh month following the director’s Separation from Service (or, if earlier,
the first day of the month after the director’s death).
(E)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to Deferred Cash Compensation and Awarded Units granted, earned or vested after December 31, 2004 (within the
meaning of Section 409A), and granted, earned and vested as of December 31, 2008, including related earnings thereon (the “2009 Distribution Amounts”), such 2009 Distribution
Amounts shall be paid in a lump sum to the director on July 1, 2009, provided the director files an election to do so with the Company by December 31, 2008. Such elections are
permanent and may not be changed after December 31, 2008, and will have no subsequent effect after July 1, 2009.
6.    Death.
(A)    A director may designate one or more beneficiaries (which may be an entity other than a natural person) to receive any payments to be made upon the director’s
death. At any time, and from time to time, the identity of such beneficiary designation may be changed or canceled by the director without the consent of any beneficiary. Any such
beneficiary designation, change or cancellation must be by written notice filed with the Secretary of the Company and shall not be effective until received by the Secretary. If a
director designates more than one beneficiary, any payments to such beneficiaries shall be made in equal shares unless the director has designated otherwise. If no beneficiary
has been named by the director, or the designated beneficiaries have predeceased him or her, the director’s beneficiary shall be the executor or administrator of the director’s
estate.
(B)    With respect to Deferred Cash Compensation and Awarded Units granted, earned and vested prior to January 1, 2005 (within the meaning of Section 409A), and
including related earnings thereon, if a director should die before full payment of all amounts credited to his or her account, such amounts shall be paid to his or her designated
beneficiary or beneficiaries or to his or her estate in a single sum payment to be made as soon as practicable after his or her death.
- 3 -
(C)    With respect to Deferred Cash Compensation and Awarded Units granted, earned or vested after December 31, 2004 (within the meaning of Section 409A), and
including related earnings thereon, within 30 days of first becoming eligible to participate in this Plan or another account balance plan required to be aggregated with this Plan
under Section 409A, a director may elect for his or her designated beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive the account in a lump sum payment or installments from two to fifteen,
provided the elections (including the election hereunder) are made in accordance with paragraph 5(B). For individuals who were, are, or will be eligible directors prior to or as of
December 31, 2008, such directors shall make their election as to the form of distribution for their beneficiary or beneficiaries on or before December 31, 2008 in accordance with
the transition rule contained in IRS Notice 2007-86. Such elections are permanent and may not be changed thereafter.
7.    The right of a director to any Deferred Cash Compensation or Awarded Units credited to his or her account and including related earnings thereon shall not be subject to
assignment by him or her. If a director does assign his or her right to any Deferred Cash Compensation or Awarded Units credited to his or her account, the Company may disregard such
assignment and discharge its obligation hereunder by making payment as though no such assignment had been made.
8.    The Plan is intended to comply with Section 409A, and accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, the Plan shall be interpreted and administered to be in compliance
therewith. For purposes of this Plan:
(A)    “Key Employee” means an individual who is treated as a “specified employee” as of his Separation from Service under Code section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i), i.e., a key
employee (as defined in Code section 416(i) without regard to paragraph (5) thereof) of the Company or its affiliates if the Company’s stock is publicly traded on an established
securities market or otherwise. Key Employees shall be determined in accordance with Code section 409A using a January 1 identification date. A listing of Key Employees as of
an identification date shall be effective for the 12-month period following the identification date; and
(B)    “Separation from Service” or “Separate(s) from Service” means a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A.
9.    Re-Deferrals. Notwithstanding any election under Paragraph 5(B), a director may make one or more subsequent elections to change the timing or the form of the distribution
of his or her deferred compensation account with respect to Post-2004 Deferrals, provided that such an election shall be effective only if the following conditions are satisfied:
(A) The subsequent election may not take effect until at least twelve (12) months after the date on which the election is made;
(B) The subsequent election must be made at least twelve (12) months before the date on which the distribution (or, with respect to installments, the first
scheduled installment) is scheduled to be made; and
(C) The distribution may not be made earlier than at least five (5) years after the date the distribution (or, with respect to installments, the first scheduled
installment) would have otherwise been made.
