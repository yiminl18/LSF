ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
The Company
With
 a history dating back to 1886, American Water is the largest and most geographically diverse, publicly-traded water and wastewater utility company in the United States, as measured byboth
 operating revenues and population served. A holding company originally incorporated in Delaware in 1936, the Company employs approximately 6,400 professionals who provide drinking water,wastewater
 and other related services to over 14 million people in 24 states. The Company conducts the majority of its business through regulated utilities that provide water and wastewater services,collectively presented as the “Regulated Businesses.” The Company also operates
 market-based businesses that provide complementary services. Individually, these businesses do not meet the criteria ofa
 reportable segment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), and are collectively presented as the “Market-Based Businesses,” which is consistentwith how management assesses the 
results of these businesses.On December 9, 2021 (the “Closing Date”
), the Company sold all of the equity interests of the HOS subsidiaries. See Item 1—Business—Market-Based Businesses—Sale of Homeowner ServicesGroup below and Note 6—Acquisitions and Divestitu
res in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.On
 January 1, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its New York subsidiary, see Item 1—Business—Regulated Businesses—Sale of New York American Water Company, Inc. below andNote
 6—Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The assets and related liabilities of the New York subsidiary were classified as heldfor sale on the Consolidated Bal
ance Sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.Throughout
 this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” and “American Water” mean American Water WorksCompany, Inc. and its subsidiaries, 
taken together as a whole. References to “parent company” mean American Water Works Company, Inc., without its subsidiaries.Regulated Businesses
The
 Company’s primary business involves the ownership of utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential, commercial, industrial, public authority, fire service and sale forresale customers.
 The Company’s utilities operate in approximately 1,700 communities in 14 states in the United States, with 3.4 million active customers in its water and wastewater networks. Servicesprovided
 by the Company’s utilities are subject to regulation by multiple state utility commissions or other entities engaged in utility regulation, collectively referred to as public utility commissions(“PUCs”).
 Federal, state and local governments also regulate environmental,  health and safety, and water quality and water accountability  matters. The Company reports the results of the servicesprovided
 by its utilities in the Regulated Businesses segment. Operating revenues for the Regulated Businesses were $3,384 million for 2021, $3,255 million for 2020 and $3,094 million for 2019,accounting for 86%, 86% and 86%, r
espectively, of the Company’s total operating revenues for the same periods.4

The
 Company’s Regulated Businesses have a large and geographically diverse customer base. A customer is defined as a person, business, municipality or any other entity that purchases theCompany’s
 water or wastewater services as of the last business day of a reporting period. One single customer may purchase the Company’s services for use by multiple individuals or businesses.Examples of these custome
rs are homes, apartment complexes, businesses and governmental entities.The
 vast majority of the Company’s regulated water customers are metered, which allows the Company to measure and bill for its customers’ water usage, typically on a monthly basis. TheCompany
 employs a variety of methods of customer meter reading to monitor consumption. These methods range from meters with mechanical registers where consumption is manually recorded bymeter
 readers,  to meters  with electronic  registers capable  of transmitting  consumption data to proximity  devices or via radio frequency  to mobile or fixed network data collectors.  The Company’swastewater customers ar
e billed either a flat rate or based upon their water consumption.Residential customers make up a
 substantial portion of the Company’s customer base in all of the states in which it operates. The Company also serves (i) commercial customers, such as food andbeverage
 providers, commercial property developers and proprietors, and energy suppliers, (ii) fire service customers, where the Company supplies water through its distribution systems to public firehydrants
 for firefighting purposes and to private fire customers for use in fire suppression systems in office buildings and other facilities, (iii) industrial customers, such as large-scale manufacturers,mining
 and production operations, (iv) public authorities, such as government buildings and other public sector facilities, including schools and universities, and (v) other utilities and community waterand wastewater systems in the 
form of bulk contracts for the supply of water or the treatment of wastewater for their own customers.5

Customer
 growth in the Company’s Regulated Businesses is primarily from (i) adding new customers to its customer base through acquisitions of water and/or wastewater utility systems, (ii)population growth in its authori
zed service areas, and (iii) sale of water to other water utilities and community water systems.6

Table of ContentsCapital Investment
The
 Company plans to invest between $28 billion and $32 billion over the next 10 years for capital improvements, including acquisitions, to its Regulated Businesses’ water and wastewaterinfrastructure,
 largely for pipe replacement and upgrading aging water and wastewater treatment facilities. The Company has proactively improved its pipe renewal rate from a 250-year replacementcycle
 in 2009 to an expected 110-year replacement cycle by 2026, which it anticipates will enable the Company to replace nearly 2,200 miles of mains and collection pipes between 2022 and 2026. Inaddition, from
 2022 to 2026, the Company’s capital investment in treatment plants, storage tanks and other key, above-ground facilities is expected to increase, further addressing infrastructure renewal,resiliency, water
 quality, operational efficiency, technology and innovation, and emerging regulatory compliance needs. Additionally, the Company continues to invest significantly in resiliency projectsto
 address the impacts of climate and weather variability by hardening its assets. The benefit of investing in resiliency projects was seen firsthand in the aftermath of Tropical Depression Ida, when theCompany’s
 New Jersey subsidiary reported that all its operating areas successfully withstood widespread flooding and drinking water quality was not impacted in any of its service areas. Specifically,the
 New Jersey subsidiary’s Raritan-Millstone Water Treatment Plant, which was fortified with a $37 million flood protection project in 2018, withstood a record flood and continued to provide potablewater supply for approximat
ely 1 million people in parts of seven counties in central New Jersey.Regulation and Rate Making
The
 operations of the Company’s Regulated Businesses are generally subject to regulation by PUCs in the states in which they operate, with the primary responsibility of the PUCs being thepromotion
 of the overall public interest by balancing the interest of customers and utility investors. Specific authority might differ from state to state, but in most states, PUCs review and approve ratescharged
 to customers, accounting treatments, long-term financing programs and cost of capital, operation and maintenance (“O&M”) expenses, capital expenditures, taxes, affiliated transactions andrelationships, reorganizations, mergers and acquisitions,
 and dispositions, along with imposing certain penalties or granting certain incentives. Regulatory policies vary from state to state and can changeover time. These polici
es will affect the timing, as well as the extent, of recovery of expenses and the realized return on invested capital.Periodic
 changes  in  customer  rates  generally  occur  through  the  filing  of  a  rate  case  by  the  utility  with  the  PUC.  The  timing  of  rate  case  filings  is  typically  determined  by  either  periodicrequirements
 in the regulatory jurisdiction or by the utility’s need to increase its revenue requirement to recover capital investment costs, changes in operating revenues, operating costs or other marketconditions.
 The Company attempts to minimize “regulatory lag,” which is the time between the occurrence of an event that triggers a change in the utility’s revenue requirement and the recognition inrates of that change.
The
 Company’s Regulated Businesses support regulatory practices at the PUCs and state legislatures that mitigate the adverse impact of regulatory lag. Presented in the table below are examplesof approved regulatory pra

Future test year
A “test year” is a period used for setting rates, and a future test year describes the first 12 months that new rates are proposed to be effective. The use of a future test year allows current or projected revenues, expenses and capital investments to be collected on a more ti
mely basis.CA, HI, IA, IL, IN, KY, PA,TN, VA
Hybrid test year
A  historical test year sets rates using data from a 12-month period that ends prior to a general rate case filing. A hybrid test year allows an update tohistorical data for “known and measurable” changes that occur subsequent to the historical test year.
MD, MO, NJ, WVUtility plant recovery mechanisms
Allows  recovery  of  the  full  return  on  utility  plant  costs  during  the  construction  period,  instead  of  capitalizing  an  allowance  for  funds  used  duringconstruction
 (“AFUDC”).  In  addition,  some  states  allow  the  utility  to  seek  pre-approval  of  certain  capital  projects  and  associated  costs.  In  this  pre-approval process, the PUC may assess the prudency of such projects.
CA, IL, KY, PA, TN, VAExpense mechanisms
Allows  changes in certain operating expenses, which may fluctuate based on conditions beyond the utility’s control, to be recovered outside of a generalrate case proceeding or deferred until the next general rate case proceeding.

Table of ContentsThe
 Company pursues enhancements to these regulatory practices to facilitate efficient recovery of its costs and capital investments and to continue to provide safe, clean, reliable and affordableservices to
 its customers. The ability to seek regulatory treatment using the regulatory practices described above does not guarantee that the PUCs will accept the Company’s proposal in the context of aparticular
 rate case, and these regulatory practices may reduce, but not eliminate, regulatory lag associated with traditional rate making processes. It is also the Company’s strategy to expand the use ofthese mechanisms in ar
eas where they may not currently apply and enhance certain mechanisms where they already exist.Acquisitions and Strategic Growth
The
 U.S.  water  and  wastewater  industries  include  investor-owned  systems  as  well  as  municipal  systems  that  are  owned  and  operated  by  local  governments  or  governmental  subdivisions.According
 to  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (“EPA”),  as  of  2017,  approximately  84%  of  the  water  market  is  served  by  municipal  systems  and  approximately  98%  of  the  country’swastewater
 systems  are  government  owned.  The  EPA  also  estimates,  as  of  2017,  that  there  are  approximately  50,000  community  water  systems  and  approximately  15,000  community  wastewatersystems in the United States, with 
approximately 80% of the community water systems serving a population of 3,000 or less.A
 fundamental aspect of the Company’s growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions of water and/or wastewater systems in geographic proximity to areas where the Company operates its RegulatedBusinesses,
 see  Item  7—Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  for  additional  information.  The  proximity  of  acquisition  opportunities  to  theCompany’s
 regulated footprint allows it to integrate and manage the acquired systems and operations primarily using the Company’s existing management (although the Company typically retains themajority, if
 not all, of the employees of the acquired systems) and to achieve operational efficiencies and prioritize capital investment needs. The Company’s current customer mix of 93% water and 7%wastewater
 also presents strategic opportunities for wastewater growth and systems consolidation, allowing the Company to add wastewater customers where it already serves water customers. TheCompany
 intends to continue to expand its regulated footprint geographically by acquiring water and wastewater systems in its existing markets and, if appropriate, pursuing acquisition opportunities incertain
 domestic  markets  where  the  Company  does  not  currently  operate  its  Regulated  Businesses.  Before  entering  new  regulated  markets,  the  Company  will  evaluate  the  business  and  regulatoryclimates
 to ensure that it will have the opportunity to achieve an appropriate rate of return on its investment while maintaining its high standards for providing safe, reliable and affordable services to itscustomers, as well as a lin
e of sight to grow the Company’s base customers to attain efficiencies after entering the new domestic market.Increasingly
 stringent environmental, health and safety, and water quality and water accountability regulations, the amount of infrastructure in need of significant capital investment, financialchallenges and industry leg
islation are several elements, among others, that may drive more municipalities to consider selling their water and wastewater assets.Sale of New York American Water Company, Inc.
On
 January  1,  2022,  the  Company  completed  the  sale  of  its  New  York  subsidiary  to  Liberty  Utilities  (Eastern  Water  Holdings)  Corp.  (“Liberty”),  an  indirect,  wholly  owned  subsidiary  ofAlgonquin
 Power & Utilities Corp. Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated November 20, 2019, as amended, by and among the Company, the Company’s New York subsidiary andLiberty
 (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”), Liberty purchased from the Company all of the capital stock of the Company’s New York subsidiary for a purchase price of $608 million in cash. The salewas
 approved by the New York State Department of Public Service on December 16, 2021. The Company’s regulated New York operations had approximately 127,000 customers in the State of NewYork. See Note 6—Acquisitions and Divestitur
es in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Industry Legislation
On November 15, 2021
, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (the “IIJA”) was signed into law and provides for up to $55 billion to aid in improving the country’s ailing water infrastructure,including
 $23.4 billion for drinking water and wastewater, $15 billion for lead service line replacement (through the drinking water state revolving fund), and $10 billion for the treatment of per- andpolyfluoroalkyl
 substances (“PFAS”) and other contaminants of emerging concern. The bill also includes a low-income assistance program, which provides eligible low-income customers who receivetheir water from publi
c and private entities to be eligible to participate in the program. The Company is awaiting further guidance on the distribution of these funds.In
 December 2020, Congress passed, and the President signed into law, a $900 billion COVID-19 relief and $1.4 trillion U.S. government appropriations package for 2021, which included $638million for a low-incom
e water assistance program and $2.8 billion for capitalization grants under the Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds.8

Table of ContentsIn
 2017, New Jersey enacted the Water Quality Accountability Act (the “WQAA”), which sets operational standards for all water utilities in New Jersey, including municipal and investor-ownedutilities
 with more than 500 service connections. This law imposes requirements in areas such as asset management, water quality reporting, remediation of notices of violation, and hydrant and valvemaintenance.
 The WQAA requires the most senior water manager, or either the executive director for municipal utility authorities or the mayor or chief executive officer for municipally owned publicwater
 systems, to certify that the system meets the requirements under the WQAA. Enhanced WQAA legislation includes additional enforcement requirements for disclosure of results, requires the saleof systems for
 prolonged violations and imposes new cyber security requirements and asset management plans. The new amendments, which provide for both civil and criminal penalties for falsificationof documents, were signed by the Governo
r with an effective date of November 8, 2021.In 2018,
 Indiana passed a law  to set minimum operational expectations for all water and wastewater utilities in the state, including municipal and investor-owned utilities. The law requires waterand
 wastewater utilities to conduct rate analyses, develop capital asset management plans and conduct cybersecurity and water loss audits. It also requires water and wastewater utilities to participate inregional
 discussions and planning to assess opportunities for the more efficient use of water and wastewater utility assets and infrastructure. Water and wastewater utilities that fail to comply with therequirements
 of the law may be ineligible for grants and loans from the State Revolving Fund. Under the law, all new municipal and investor-owned utilities are required to be regulated by the IndianaUtility Regulatory Commission fo
r ten years from inception of operations.In
 2020, Missouri enacted the Water Safety and Security Act, which requires small and medium-sized water providers to create cybersecurity,  valve inspection and hydrant inspection programs.Upon
 request by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, the water providers must certify compliance with all regulations regarding water quality sampling, testing and reporting, hydrant andvalve testing and report
ing and cybersecurity plans and procedures.The
 Company’s regulated subsidiaries in California, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia have access toutility
 valuation  legislation  and  regulation  for  private  sector  investment  in  public  sector  water  and  wastewater  systems.  The  Company  supports  full  optionality  for  municipalities,  including  statelegislation
 that enables the consolidation of the largely fragmented water and wastewater industries through third-party fair market valuations of purchased property. Fair market value assessment ofwater
 and wastewater systems is an alternative to the traditional depreciated original cost method of valuation, which allows the Company to offer municipalities a purchase price for their system assetsthat
 is reflective of the assets’ fair market value, while providing the Company with increased opportunity to recover the purchase price over the life of the purchased system assets, subject to PUCapproval.
 In 2021, the Tennessee Public Utilities Commission implemented acquisition valuation rules that create a mechanism to value water and wastewater assets based upon replacement cost newless depreciation.
Consolidated
 tariffs use a unified rate structure for systems owned and operated by a single utility, which may or may not be physically interconnected. Consolidated tariff pricing moderates theimpact
 of periodic fluctuations in local costs and promotes a more universal water infrastructure investment in a state. As a result, consolidated tariffs can make it easier to incorporate new systems intoan
 existing utility, support economies of scale for even the smallest of systems and prioritize capital needs across the state. Overall, the Company believes that consolidated tariffs bring cost-effective,high-quality
 services to a larger number of customers. Eleven of the Company’s regulated jurisdictions currently have some form of consolidated tariff pricing, including California, Illinois, Indiana,Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, Pennsy
lvania, Virginia and West Virginia.Competition
The
 Company’s  Regulated  Businesses  generally  do  not  face  direct  competition  in  their  existing  markets  because  (i)  the  Company  operates  in  those  markets  pursuant  to  franchises,  charters,certificates
 of  public  convenience  and  necessity  or  similar  authorizations  (collectively,  “CPCNs”)  issued  by  state  PUCs  or  other  authorities,  and  (ii)  the  high  cost  of  constructing  a  new  water  andwastewater
 system in an existing market creates a significant barrier to market entry. However, the Company’s Regulated Businesses do face competition from governmental agencies, other investor-owned
 utilities, large industrial customers with the ability to provide their own water supply/treatment process and strategic buyers that are entering new markets and/or making strategic acquisitions.When
 pursuing  acquisitions,  the  Company’s  largest  investor-owned  competitors,  based  on  a  comparison  of  operating  revenues  and  population  served,  include  Essential  Utilities,  Inc.,  Suez  NorthAmerica,
 American States Water Company and California Water Service Group. From time to time, the Company also faces competition from infrastructure funds, multi-utility companies and others,such as Algonquin Power and Utilities Corp., Eversou
rce Energy and Corix.9

Table of ContentsCondemnation and Eminent Domain
All
 or portions of the Regulated Businesses’ utility assets could be acquired by state, municipal or other government entities through one or more of the following methods: (i) eminent domain(also known as condemnation); (ii) the right of p
urchase given or reserved by a municipality or political subdivision when the original CPCN was granted; and (iii) the right of purchase given or reservedunder
 the law of the state in which the utility subsidiary was incorporated or from which it received its CPCN. The acquisition consideration related to such a proceeding initiated by a local governmentmay be determined consis
tent with applicable eminent domain law, or may be negotiated or fixed by appraisers as prescribed by the law of the state or in the particular CPCN.As
 such, the Regulated Businesses are periodically subject to condemnation proceedings in the ordinary course of business. For example, a citizens group in Monterey, California successfullyadded
 “Measure  J”  to  the November  2018  election  ballot  asking  voters  to decide  whether  the Monterey  Peninsula  Water  Management  District  (the  “MPWMD”) should  conduct  a feasibility  studyconcerning
 the potential purchase of the Monterey water service system assets (the “Monterey system assets”) of the Company’s California subsidiary, and, if feasible, to proceed with a purchase ofthose
 assets  without  an  additional  public  vote.  This  service  territory  represents  approximately  40,000  customers.  In  November  2018,  Measure  J  was  certified  to  have  passed.  In  August  2019,  theMPWMD’s
 General Manager issued a report that recommends that the MPWMD board (1) develop criteria to determine which water systems should be considered for acquisition; (2) examine thefeasibility
 of acquiring the Monterey system assets and consider public ownership of smaller systems only if the MPWMD becomes the owner of a larger system; (3) evaluate whether the acquisition ofthe
 Monterey system assets by the MPWMD is in the public interest and sufficiently satisfies the criterion of “feasible” as provided in Measure J; (4) ensure there is significant potential for cost savingsbefore agreeing to com
mence an acquisition; and (5) develop more fully alternate operating plans before deciding whether to consider a Resolution of Necessity.In November
 2019, the MPWMD issued a preliminary valuation and cost of service analysis report, finding in part that (1) an estimate of the Monterey system assets’ total value plus adjustmentswould be
 approximately $513 million, (2) the cost of service modeling results indicate significant annual reductions in revenue requirements and projected monthly water bills, and (3) the acquisition ofthe
 Monterey system assets by the MPWMD would be economically feasible. On June 12, 2020, the MPWMD issued a draft environmental impact report for the potential acquisition of the Montereysystem
 assets and a related district  boundary adjustment that would be required  if the MPWMD were to acquire  and operate  certain  of the Monterey system assets located  outside the MPWMD’sboundaries.
 On September 15, 2020, the MPWMD gave notice of its intention to appraise the Monterey system assets and related property interests. On September 29, 2020, the Company’s Californiasubsidiary declined to make the Monterey system assets and related property interests available for
 inspection or to comply with any of the other requests contained in the MPWMD’s notice. On October7,
 2020, the MPWMD issued a final environmental impact report (“FEIR”), and on November 4, 2020, the MPWMD certified the FEIR, which purports to analyze the environmental impacts of theMPWMD’s
 project  to (1) acquire  the Monterey system assets through the power of eminent  domain, if necessary,  and (2) expand its geographic  boundaries to include all parts  of this system. OnNovember
 25, 2020, the Company’s California subsidiary filed a petition challenging this certification in court. A hearing on the matter was held on August 30, 2021, and on November 19, 2021, thecourt denied the petit
ion. See Item 3—Legal Proceedings—Challenge of Certification—Proposed Monterey System Final Environmental Impact Report.On
 February 26, 2021, the MPWMD filed an application with the Local Agency Formation Commission of Monterey County (“LAFCO”) seeking approval to become a retail water provider andannex
 approximately 58 parcels of land into the MPWMD’s boundaries. On June 28, 2021, LAFCO’s commissioners voted to require a third-party independent financial study as to the feasibility of anacquisition
 by the MPWMD of the Monterey system assets. On December 6, 2021, LAFCO’s commissioners denied the MPWMD’s application to become a retail water provider, determining that theMPWMD
 does not have the authority to proceed with a condemnation of the Monterey system assets. On January 5, 2022, LAFCO’s commissioners confirmed the denial. On January 31, 2022, theMPWMD filed an application fo
r reconsideration of LAFCO’s confirmation of denial. A hearing on the application has been set for February 28, 2022.Also, five municipalities in
 the Chicago, Illinois area (approximately 30,300 customers in total) formed a water agency and filed an eminent domain lawsuit against the Company in January 2013,seeking
 to condemn the water pipeline that serves those five municipalities. Before filing its eminent domain lawsuit, the water agency made an offer of $38 million for the pipeline. The parties havefiled with the court updat
ed valuation reports. A valuation trial was originally scheduled for October 2021 but has been continued to June 2022.10

Table of ContentsFurthermore,
 the  law  in  certain  jurisdictions  in  which  the  Regulated  Businesses  operate  provides  for  eminent  domain  rights  allowing  private  property  owners  to  file  a  lawsuit  to  seek  justcompensation
 against a public utility, if a public utility’s infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of damage to that property. In these actions, the plaintiff would not have to provethat
 the public utility acted negligently. In California, lawsuits have been filed in connection with large-scale natural events such as wildfires. Some of these lawsuits have included allegations thatinfrastructure of
 certain utilities triggered the natural event that resulted in damage to the property. In some cases, the PUC has allowed certain costs or losses incurred by the utility to be recovered fromcustomers in
 rates, but in other cases such recovery in rates has been disallowed. Also, the utility may have obtained insurance that could respond to some or all of such losses, although the utility wouldbe at risk for any losses not ul
timately subject to rate or insurance recovery or losses that exceed the limits of such insurance.Water Supply and Wastewater Services
The Company’s Regulated Businesses generally own the physical assets used to store, pump, treat and
 deliver water to its customers and collect, treat, transport and recycle wastewater. Typically,the
 Company does not own the water, which is held in public trust and is allocated to the Company through contracts, permits and allocation rights granted by federal and state or multi-state agencies orthrough
 the ownership of water rights pursuant to local law. The Company is dependent on defined sources of water supply and obtains its water supply from surface water sources such as reservoirs,lakes,
 rivers  and  streams;  from  groundwater  sources,  such  as  wells  and  aquifers;  and  water  purchased  from  third-party  water  suppliers.  The  level  of  water  treatment  the  Company  applies  variessignificantly
 depending upon the quality of the water source and customer stipulations. Surface water sources typically generally require significant treatment, while groundwater sources often requirechemical treatment only.

Table of ContentsThe
 Company’s ability to meet the existing and future water demands of its customers depends on an adequate water supply. Drought, governmental restrictions, overuse of sources of water, theprotection
 of threatened species or habitats, contamination or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water. The Company employs a variety of measures in an effort to obtainadequate sources of
 water supply, both in the short-term and over the long-term. The geographic diversity of the Company’s service areas may mitigate some of the economic effects on the water supplyassociated
 with weather extremes it might encounter in any particular service territory. For example, in any given summer, some areas may experience drier than average weather, which may reduce theamount of source water ava
ilable, while other areas the Company serves may experience wetter than average weather.The
 Company evaluates quality, quantity, growth needs and alternate sources of water supply as well as transmission and distribution capacity to provide water service to its customers. Watersupply
 is seasonal in nature and weather conditions can have a pronounced effect on supply. In order to ensure that the Company has adequate water supply, it uses long-term planning processes andmaintains contingency plans
 to minimize the potential impact on service caused by climate variability and a wide range of weather fluctuations. The Company reviews current climate science and globalmodels related
 to temperature, precipitation and sea level rise on an ongoing basis. Where actionable forecasts are available, the Company will use this information in its comprehensive planning studiesand
 asset management plans. These studies and plans, which are used by the Company to develop its asset management and system reliability strategies, assess the climate risk and resiliency of theCompany’s
 water and wastewater systems over short-, medium- and long-term time horizons, and include evaluations of the availability of water supplies and system capacity against a number ofdifferent factors, projections
 and estimates.In
 connection with supply planning for most surface or groundwater sources, the Company employs models to determine safe yields under different rainfall and drought conditions. Surface andground
 water levels are routinely monitored so that supply capacity deficits may, to the extent possible, be predicted and mitigated through demand management and additional supply development. InCalifornia, where the state has been experiencing a multi-year
 drought, the Company utilizes multiple water supply options including numerous ground water wells in multiple aquifers as well as variouslong-term
 purchase water agreements with regional water suppliers to optimize supplies while assuring resiliency during dry years. An example of the Company’s use of long-term planning to ensurethat
 it has adequate water supply is its involvement in the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project (the “Water Supply Project”) in California. The Water Supply Project includes the construction of adesalination
 plant, to be owned by the Company’s California subsidiary, and the construction of wells that would supply water to the desalination plant. In addition, the Water Supply Project alsoincludes
 the California subsidiary’s purchase of water from a groundwater replenishment project (the “GWR Project”) between Monterey One Water (formerly known as the Monterey Regional WaterPollution
 Control Agency) and the MPWMD. The Water Supply Project is intended, among other things, to fulfill obligations of the California subsidiary to eliminate unauthorized diversions from theCarmel River as required under orders of
 the California State Water Resources Control Board (the “SWRCB”). For more information, see Item 3—Legal Proceedings—Alternative Water Supply in Lieuof
 Carmel River Diversions and Note 17—Commitments and Contingencies—Contingencies—Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions, in the Notes to the Consolidated FinancialStatements.
Wastewater services involve the
 collection of wastewater from customers’ premises through sewer lines. The wastewater is then transported through a sewer network to a treatment facility, whereit
 is treated to meet required regulatory standards for wastewater before being returned to the environment. The solid waste by-product of the treatment process is disposed of or recycled in accordancewith applicable standards 
and regulations.Seasonality
Customer
 demand for the Company’s water service is affected by weather and tends to vary with temperature and amount and frequency of rainfall. Customer demand is generally greater duringthe warmer months, primarily due to increased water usa
ge for irrigation systems and other outdoor water use. As such, the Company typically expects its operating revenues to be the highest in the thirdquarter
 of each year. Weather that is hotter and/or drier than average generally increases operating revenues, whereas, weather that is cooler and/or wetter than average generally serves to suppresscustomer
 water demand and can reduce water operating revenues. Two of the Company’s jurisdictions, California and Illinois, have adopted revenue stability mechanisms which permit the Company tocollect
 state PUC-authorized revenue for a given period which is not tied to the volume of water sold during that period, thereby lessening the impact of weather variability. See Regulated Businesses—Regulation and Rate Making for add
itional information regarding revenue stability mechanisms.Market-Based Businesses
The
 Company’s Market-Based Businesses provide water and wastewater services to the U.S. government on military installations, as well as municipalities, and utility customers, and previouslyprovided home services primarily
 to residential and smaller commercial customers through its former HOS business, which was sold on December 9, 2021. These businesses are not subject to regulationby
 state PUCs and the services provided generally do not require significant capital investment. Operating revenues for the Company’s Market-Based Businesses were $563 million for 2021, $540million for 2020 and $539 mill
ion for 2019, accounting for 14%, 14% and 15%, respectively, of the Company’s total operating revenues for the same periods.12

Table of ContentsMSG enters into long-term contracts with the
 U.S. government to provide water and wastewater services on various military installations. MSG is the Company’s remaining primary market-basedbusiness.
The
 Company also has five contracts with municipal customers to operate and manage water and wastewater facilities and provide other related services through its Contract Services Group(“CSG”).
Military Services Group
MSG
 operates on 17 military installations under 50-year contracts with the U.S. government as part of its Utilities Privatization Program. The scope of these contracts generally includes theoperation and
 maintenance of the installation’s water and wastewater systems and a capital program focused on asset replacement and, in certain instances, systems expansion. The replacement of assetsassumed
 when a contract is awarded to MSG is completed either through a discrete set of projects executed in the first five years of the contract or through the long term recapitalization programperformed over
 the life of the contract. Traditionally, both of these programs are funded from the contract fee. At times, new assets are required to support the installation’s mission, and the constructionof
 these assets is funded by the U.S. government as separate modifications or amendments to the contract. The capital for these assets historically has not been funded through the Company’s debt orequity
 issuances;  rather,  the  Company  has  used  limited  working  capital  for  short-term  needs  under  these  contracts.  In  April  2018,  the  U.S.  Army  instituted  a  requirement  that  a  bidder  must  offerfinancing
 in its proposal for these new capital projects under existing contracts, but the U.S. Army’s implementation of this requirement on existing contracts has limited the need for such financing.However,
 recent U.S. Army and Navy Utilities Privatization solicitations have included requirements for the successful bidder to finance discrete initial capital projects over either a five- or ten-yearperiod after projec
t completion. Three of MSG’s current contracts require such capital project financing, which the Company is currently addressing through internal sources of liquidity.The
 contract  price  for  six  of  MSG’s  contracts  with  the  U.S.  government  is  subject  to  redetermination  two  years  after  commencement  of  operations,  and  every  three  years  thereafter.  Priceredetermination
 is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period, to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions. The remaining 11 contractswith
 the U.S. government are subject to annual price adjustments under a mechanism called “Economic Price Adjustment.” All 17 contracts could be terminated, in whole or in part, prior to the end ofthe
 50-year term for convenience of the U.S. government, or as a result of default or non-performance by the MSG subsidiary performing the contract. In either event, pursuant to termination provisionsapplicable
 to all of these contracts, MSG would be entitled to recover allowable costs that it may have incurred under the contract, plus the contract profit margin on incurred costs. MSG’s backlog ofrevenue associated with i
ts contracts with the U.S. government is approximately $6.2 billion, with an average remaining contract term of 41 years.Sale of Homeowner Services Group
The
 Company has provided various warranty protection programs and other home services primarily to residential and smaller commercial customers through its HOS operations. On the ClosingDate,
 the Company sold all of the equity interests in its HOS subsidiaries to an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of funds advised by Apax Partners LLP, a global private equity advisory firm (the“Buyer”),
 for total consideration of approximately $1.275 billion. See Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 6—Acquisitions andDivestitures in the Notes to Consolid
ated Financial Statements for additional information.Competition
MSG faces competition from 
a number of service providers, including American States Water Company, Suez North America, and Veolia Environnement S.A.13

Table of ContentsEnvironmental, Health and Safety, Water Quality and Other Regula
tionThe
 Company’s water and wastewater operations, including the services provided by both its Regulated Businesses and Market-Based Businesses, are subject to extensive federal, state and locallaws and regulations governin
g the protection of the environment, health and safety, the provision of water and wastewater services, particularly with respect to the quality of water the Company deliversto
 its customers, and the manner in which it collects, treats, discharges, recycles and disposes of wastewater. In the United States, these regulations are developed under federal legislation including theSafe
 Drinking Water Act, the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act, and under a variety of applicable state laws. Environmental, health and safety, and water qualityregulations are
 complex and may vary from state to state in those instances where a state has adopted a standard that is more stringent than the federal standard. For example, while the EPA has issued anon-enforceable Health Advisory for the combined level of two
 perfluorinated compounds (perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, or PFOS), the New Jersey Department ofEnvironmental
 Protection was the first state agency to establish a standard for perfluorononanoic acid, or PFNA, in 2018 and has since established maximum containment levels for PFOA and PFOS,with
 implementation occurring in January 2021. The Company is also subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the storage of hazardous materials, the management anddisposal
 of hazardous and solid wastes, discharges to air and water, the cleanup of contaminated sites, dam safety and other matters relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety.PUCs also set conditions and standards for 
the water and wastewater services the Company delivers.The
 Company maintains an environmental program that includes responsible business practices focused on compliance with environmental laws and regulations and the effective use of naturalresources,
 recognizing  that  drinking  water  standards  have  generally,  over  time,  increased  in  number  and  become  increasingly  more  stringent.  As  newer  or  stricter  standards  are  introduced,  theCompany’s capital
 and operating costs needed to comply with them will likely increase. The Company incurs substantial costs associated with compliance with the environmental, health and safety, andwater quality
 standards to which its operations are subject and the Company invests in technology solutions for enhanced detection and monitoring of water quality issues. The Company estimates that itwill
 make capital expenditures of approximately $850 million over the next five years, including $180 million in 2022, for environmental control facilities, which the Company defines for this purposeas
 any project (or portion thereof) that involves the preservation of air, water or land. The Company believes that its operations are materially in compliance with, and in many cases surpass, minimumstandards required by appli
cable environmental laws and regulations.The
 Company’s operations also involve the use, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. For example, the Company’s water and wastewater treatment facilities store and usechlorine
 and other chemicals that generate wastes that require proper handling and disposal under applicable environmental requirements. The Company also could incur remedial costs in connectionwith
 any contamination relating to its operations or facilities or its off-site disposal of wastes. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”),authorizes
 the EPA, and comparable state laws authorize state environmental authorities, to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedialactions
 at any site that is determined to present an actual or potential threat to human health or the environment because of an actual or threatened release of one or more hazardous substances. Partiesthat
 generated or transported hazardous substances to such sites, as well as current and former owners and operators of such sites, may be deemed liable, without regard to fault, under CERCLA orcomparable
 state laws. Although the Company is not aware of any material cleanup or decontamination obligations, the discovery of contamination or the imposition of such obligations in the futurecould result in additiona
l costs to the Company. The Company’s facilities and operations are also subject to requirements under the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act and inspections thereunder.Safe Drinking Water Act
The
 Safe Drinking Water Act and related regulations establish national quality standards for drinking water. The EPA has issued rules governing the levels of numerous, naturally occurring andmanufactured
 chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water, and continues to propose new rules. These rules also prescribe testing requirements for detectingregulated
 contaminants, the treatment systems that may be used for removing those contaminants, and other requirements. To date, the EPA has set standards for over 90 contaminants and water qualityindicators for drinking wat
er, and there is a process in place to make a regulatory determination on at least five additional compounds every five years.To
 help formulate the basis for future regulations, the EPA has the authority to require monitoring for additional, unregulated contaminants under the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule(the
 “Monitoring Rule”). The Company’s facilities have participated in the data gathering effort for the Monitoring Rule in previous rounds, which occurs every five years, including the fourth roundthat
 concluded at the end of 2020. There are millions of other chemical compounds that are not regulated, many of which lack a testing methodology, occurrence data, health effects information and/orcost-effective
 treatment options. The process of developing new drinking water standards is long and complex, but the Company actively participates with the EPA and other water industry groups bysharing research and wate
r quality operational knowledge. See Research and Development—Contaminants of Emerging Concern for additional information.14

Table of ContentsTo
 effect the removal or inactivation of microbial contaminants, the EPA has established various rules to improve the disinfection and filtration of drinking water and to reduce consumers’exposure to disinfectants 
and/or the by-products of their use in the disinfection process. Examples of these rules are the Long-Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (the “Long-Term 2 Rule”),the Stage 2 Disinfectants and Dis
infection Byproduct Rule, the Ground Water Rule, which is applicable to systems providing water from underground sources and the revised Total Coliform Rule, whichimplemented
 a “find and fix” process where exceeding bacterial trigger levels requires an assessment to correct any sanitary defects. The Company is within the EPA’s time frame for compliance withall
 of these standards, which includes sample collection, data analysis, and, in some instances engineering planning and implementation of treatment enhancements. Recent monitoring as required by theLong-Term
 2  Rule  has  indicated  that  up  to  30  of  the  Company’s  surface  water  systems  have  recently  completed  or  need  to  implement  additional  disinfection  protection  mechanisms  againstCryptosporidium.
 In many cases, this will involve installing ultraviolet light disinfection systems, and although several plants have already completed assessments and upgrades, an estimated $100million
 to $150 million of investment will still be required to upgrade the remaining facilities for Cryptosporidium disinfection. Further, the EPA is actively considering regulations for a number ofcontaminants,
 including  strontium,  hexavalent  chromium,  fluoride,  nitrosamines,  some  pharmaceuticals  and  certain  volatile  organic  compounds.  The  Company  does  not  anticipate  that  any  suchregulations, if enact
ed, will require implementation in 2022.The
 Company conducted over 10 million water quality and turbidity tests in 2021 at its laboratory facilities and plant operations, including continuous online instrumentations such as monitoringturbidity
 levels, disinfectant residuals and adjustments to chemical treatment based on changes in incoming water. The Company participates in the Partnership for Safe Water, the EPA’s voluntaryprogram
 to meet more stringent goals for reducing microbial contaminants. With 67 of the Company’s surface water treatment plants receiving the EPA program’s prestigious “Director” award, whichrecognizes
 utilities that (i) have completed a comprehensive self-assessment report, (ii) created an action plan for continuous improvement, and (iii) produced high-quality drinking water, the Companyaccounts
 for approximately one-third of the plants receiving such awards nationwide. In addition, 66 of the Company’s surface water treatment plants have received the “Five-Year Phase III” award, 62plants
 have  received  the  “Ten-Year  Phase  III”  award,  57  plants  have  received  the  “Fifteen-Year  Phase  III”  award,  and  39  plants  have  received  the  “Twenty-Year  Phase  III”  award;  these  awardsrecognize
 plants that have met the Director award status for five, 10, 15 and 20 years, respectively. Further, nine of the Company’s surface water plants have received the “Presidents” award, whichrecognizes treatment plants that
 achieve the Partnership’s rigorous individual filter effluent turbidity standards and have maintained this status for at least five years.Although
 it is difficult to project the ultimate costs of complying with the above or other pending or future requirements, the Company expects current cost requirements under the Safe DrinkingWater
 Act and other similar laws to be recoverable through the regulatory process and therefore compliance costs are not expected to have a material impact on its operations or financial condition. Inaddition,
 capital expenditures and operating costs to comply with environmental mandates have been traditionally recognized by PUCs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates. As a result, theCompany expects to recover th
e operating and capital costs resulting from these pending or future requirements.Lead and Copper Rule and Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act
In
 1991, the EPA published the Lead and Copper Rule (“LCR”) to control lead and copper in drinking water and, since that time, has issued minor revisions in 2000, 2004 and 2007, enhancingmonitoring,
 reporting and public education requirements. In 2011, Congress enacted the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act regarding the use and introduction into commerce of lead pipes,plumbing
 fittings for fixtures, solder and flux. While these advances have made an impact in reducing lead exposure in drinking water, legacy lead plumbing materials, primarily in building plumbing,still
 remain in many communities. The failure of certain water systems in the United States to comply with the requirements of the LCR has received recent media attention and scrutiny, and in certaincases, has
 led to a number of investigations and the imposition of significant penalties and sanctions against the operators of those systems and others. As part of its ongoing water main replacement andservice
 line renewal projects, the Company has started to replace lead service lines (“LSLs”) in accordance with current scientific guidance. Also, the Company utilizes appropriate corrosion controltechniques
 as necessary to comply with current water quality regulatory requirements. The EPA finalized revisions to the LCR (the “Revised LCR”) on January 15, 2021 that are designed to providemore effective
 protection of public health by reducing exposure to lead and copper in drinking water. The Company is executing an implementation strategy to comply with the new requirements, whichwere
 originally mandated by January 2024 but have been delayed until at least late 2024 pending EPA additional review. Capital expenditures and operating costs associated with the Revised LCR willbe determined once
 the EPA completes its additional review, but as previously noted, costs associated with compliance with federal water quality regulations have been traditionally recognized by PUCsas appropriate for inc
lusion in establishing rates.15

Table of ContentsThe
 Company currently estimates that less than 5% of the service lines within its regulated service territories contain lead on either the Company or customer portion of the service line. TheCompany
 is replacing LSLs as part of its ongoing water main replacement and service line renewal projects. The Company’s goal is to work with the communities it currently serves to replace asignificant majority
 of presently known LSLs in most of its service areas by the end of 2030, at an estimated cost ranging from $600 million to $1.2 billion. The Company believes this will be attainablefor
 most of its service areas where public policy is supportive of this goal. The IIJA was signed into law in November 2021 and provides for up to $15 billion for lead service line replacement throughdrinking water state revolving funds. T
he Company is awaiting further guidance on eligibility, the application process and the distribution of these funds. With regard to future acquisitions, the Companywill
 work with those communities as part of the acquisition process to set LSL removal goals appropriate for those systems. The prioritization of LSL removal is dependent on several factors, includingthe
 Company’s planned water main and service line renewal projects, adjacent projects by municipalities or other utilities, LCR compliance monitoring results, and cooperation with its customers withrespect
 to replacing the customer-owned portion of the LSL as necessary. In certain cases, these and other factors may result in a shorter or longer time frame for replacement. Because replacing theexternal
 LSL in its entirety is advised by several water industry organizations including the U.S. National Drinking Water Advisory Council, the Lead Service Line Replacement Collaborative, and theAmerican
 Water Works Association, the Company’s preferred approach is to replace the entire external LSL if lead is found on either the Company or customer portion of the service line; full LSLreplacement
 is also consistent with the Revised LCR. The Lead Service Line Replacement Collaborative is a diverse group of public health, water utility, environmental, labor, consumer and housingorganizations from ac
ross the country working together to encourage communities to accelerate the full replacement of LSLs through collaborative efforts at the local level.Clean Water Act
The
 Clean  Water  Act  regulates  discharges  from  drinking  water  and  wastewater  treatment  facilities  into  lakes,  rivers,  streams  and  groundwater.  In  addition  to  requirements  applicable  to  theCompany’s
 wastewater collection systems, its operations require discharge permits under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permit program established under the CleanWater
 Act, which must be renewed every five years. Pursuant to the NPDES permit program, the EPA and implementing states set maximum discharge limits for wastewater effluents and overflowsfrom
 wastewater collection systems. Discharges that exceed the limits specified under NPDES permits can lead to the imposition of fines and penalties, and persistent non-compliance could lead tosignificant fines
 and penalties and other compliance costs. In addition, the difficulty of obtaining and complying with NPDES permits, and renewing expiring permits, may impose time and cost burdenson the
 Company’s operations. From time to time, discharge violations occur at the Company’s facilities, some of which result in fines. The Company does not expect any such violations or fines to havea material impa
ct on its results of operations or financial condition.Research and Development
The Company’s Research and Development Program
The
 Company maintains an industry-leading research and development (“R&D”) program that is designed to enhance its services, support its compliance activities, improve service quality andoperational
 effectiveness, and provide environmental leadership. For more than three decades from its inception, American Water’s R&D program has evolved into an industry-leading effort and hasachieved numerous advancements in
 the science of drinking water, wastewater, and desalination. Through laboratory and industry resources and the team’s expertise, efforts are focused on contaminantsof
 emerging concern, including but not limited to COVID-19, PFAS, Legionella, cyanotoxin-forming algal blooms, a variety of pathogens (for example, Cryptosporidium, Giardia, enteric viruses, andvarious
 bacteria), microbial indicators and disinfection byproducts. The Company’s R&D personnel are located at the Company’s corporate headquarters and at two laboratory testing facilities in NewJersey and Illinois, the l
atter housing its quality control and testing laboratory, which supports the Company’s R&D activities through testing and analysis.The
 Company continues to leverage its expertise and collaborates with the EPA and state agencies to help establish effective environmental, health and safety, and water quality standards andregulations.
 This relationship includes the sharing of the Company’s research, such as its treatment and distribution system optimization research and its national water quality monitoring data. TheCompany’s engagement with the EPA provides 
it with early insight into emerging regulatory issues and initiatives, thereby allowing the Company to anticipate and to accommodate its future compliancerequirements.
 The Company also frequently engages with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, other state environmental agencies, and national and international water research foundations.The
 Company believes that continued R&D activities are critical for providing safe, reliable and affordable services, as well as maintaining its leadership position in the industry, which provides theCompany with a competitive adv
antage as it seeks business and operational growth.16

Table of ContentsContaminants of Emerging Concern
Contaminants
 of emerging concern include numerous chemicals such as PFAS, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pesticides, herbicides, endocrine disrupting compounds and industrialchemicals, as well as c
ertain naturally occurring microbes, such as bacteria, viruses and parasites, which have been detected in drinking water supplies, for which the risk to the public’s health is not fullyunderstood
 and/or has not been assessed. Technological advances have only recently made it possible to detect many of these contaminants at trace levels. The ability to detect contaminants, even attrace levels, has invi
ted discussion about these contaminants among regulators and government agencies, which in turn shapes the public’s perception of drinking water quality.The
 Chemicals Abstract Service Registry contains over 192 million registered chemicals, with an estimated 1,400 species of disease-causing microbes that can affect humans. The Company iscontinually investigating new substances and contaminants, employing a team of scientists, engineers and public health
 professionals to identify threats to its water supply, to act on emerging regulationsand
 new health advisories, and to evaluate the benefits of alternative or advanced treatment technologies. The Company utilizes water quality testing equipment and implements new and emergingtechnologies to help dete
ct potential water supply contamination issues. Examples of the Company’s efforts include:•
monitoring impacts of th e COVID-19 pandemic on environmental virus loads and removal efforts through wastewater systems;•
characterizing factors that contrib ute to the formation of potentially carcinogenic disinfection by-products to define best practices for their mitigation;•
using  its research findings to communicate information to its customers regarding potential actions to limit occurrences of Legionella in their buildings; in this regard, the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention statistics indicate that
 water-associated disease from Legionella is on the rise, with exposure typically associated with customer-owned plumbing systems inlarge buildings;
•
defining a framework to suppor t management or possible future regulation of opportunistic pathogens;•
developing expanded monitoring methods for PFAS compounds and piloting treatment techniques;•
leading a PFAS risk communication st rategy for the water sector;•
using innovative technologies to detect and manage algal blooms to help prevent taste and odor events and cyanotoxins before they get to the water treatment plant;•
monitoring of taste and odor issues that impact customer satisfaction using expanded analytical methods to detect compounds, and evaluating and recommending treatment practices;•
implementing water source assessment too ls, including sensors and data analytics, to evaluate and track chemical storage and aid in the identification of source water contamination events;•
developing methodology and advanc ed measurement techniques for contaminants of emerging concern to investigate transport, occurrence and treatment; and•
implementing activated carbon,  biofiltration and ion exchange treatment to seek to control contaminants of emerging concern.Service Company and Security

Overview
The
 Company’s  people  are  a  critical  part  of  its  business,  and  the  Company’s  investment  in  its  people  begins  with  recruitment  of  qualified  and  diverse  talent.  The  Company  believes  thatrepresenting the communities in which it serves pla
ys a key role in its ability to serve its customers and improves its talent. The Company promotes an inclusive culture where its employees are given theopportunity to develop to
 their fullest potential and understand that they directly contribute to the Company’s ability to operate, grow and serve its customers. The Company believes that investing in thesafety,
 health and well-being of its employees is a key component of its people and culture goals, and that these investments in its people allow employees to generate great ideas, provide qualitycustomer service and m
ake a difference in the lives of the Company’s customers.Employee Health and Safety
A longstanding value and strategy of the Company is safety. In this regard, the Company continues to focus on the safety of its employees and contractors so that they may return
 home from workin
 the  same,  or  better,  condition  than  when they  arrived.  The Company  strives  for  all  employees  to  feel  emotionally  safe,  live  a  healthy  lifestyle  and  be physically  safe  at work  and at  home. TheCompany
 assesses occupational health and safety to measure performance across the entire organization, with the ultimate goal of achieving zero incidents, injuries and fatalities for the Company’semployees and contractors.
To
 uphold  the  Company’s  commitment  to  safety,  the  Company’s  employees  completed  over  100,000  hours  of  employee  safety  training  during  2021.  Additionally,  through  frequent  labor-management
 meetings, the Company encourages open exchanges to explore new ways to further enhance safety on the job. All employees are empowered to demonstrate safety leadership by taking thetime they need
 to complete a task safely and to use “Stop Work Authority” — the power to stop working immediately whenever they believe a task is unsafe — to personally mitigate the hazard or issueor collaborate with man
agement to create a safe situation. The Company believes that this Stop Work Authority is so important that it is stated on the back of every employee’s identification badge.For 2021, the Company ha
d its lowest ORIR injury rate in its recorded history, achieving a 2% reduction compared to 2020, even though labor hours increased by 5%. Also, the number of injuriesfor purposes
 of the Company’s Days Away Restricted or Transferred (“DART”) rate decreased by 14% compared to 2020. For 2021, the Company’s ORIR was 0.97 (64 injuries) and its DART rate was0.54 (36 injuries), compared 
to an ORIR of 0.99 (63 injuries) and a DART rate of 0.63 in 2020.In
 2021, American Water teams led by promoting safety leading indicator activities, including pre-job safety briefings and near miss reporting, and by achieving internal Certified Safe Workerdesignations.
 Near miss reports, where employees report potential hazards or incidents in a safe and secure manner, increased by 27% in 2021 over 2020, and 99% of near miss incident correctiveactions
 were completed within 30 days, meeting the Company’s 2021 goal. The Company utilizes near miss reporting and timely corrective actions as key measurements of employee engagement andsafety performance.
Understanding
 that some employees may have delayed seeking preventative or other medical care due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a 2021 priority for the Company was to encourage employeesto
 increase their utilization of preventative exams. Through the Company’s marketing efforts and targeted incentives in its myWellness program, the Company sought to encourage employees to takepreventative health 
actions. The number of total preventative care exams completed by the Company’s employees increased by 15% during 2021 compared to 2020.20

American
 Water remains committed to the health, well-being and safety of its employees and families, as well as its customers and communities. The Company’s Emergency Crisis ResponseTeam
 (“ECRT”) continued to deploy a COVID-19 contact tracing program to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission at work. The ECRT consistently monitors current events and the latest publichealth
 guidance and adjusts workplace safety measures and the Company’s COVID-19 guidance accordingly. During the pandemic, American Water provided temporary medical and emotional healthbenefits,
 including paid time off and emergency leave. The Company also supported employees and their families during the uncertainty of the pandemic by providing additional resources, such asenhanced well-being support, workpl
ace flexibility, back-up dependent care, caretaker database discounts and academic support. American Water did not lay off any employees due to the pandemic.As
 an essential business that must continue to provide water and wastewater services during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company continued to focus on the care and safety of its employees,contractors, vendors and othe
rs who work at or visit the Company’s worksites. In 2021, as COVID-19 vaccines became more readily available, the Company began planning for the reintegration of thosewho
 had been working remotely back to its work facilities, and also began to implement safety protocols based on current COVID-19 health guidance for the return of employees to perform work incustomers’ homes. Furthermore, the
 Company has continued to support employee health and safety by providing safety training and resources, continuing to enforce safety protocols such as maintainingsocial
 distancing, requiring the use of face coverings at work, and encouraging good hygiene and frequent handwashing and cleaning of work areas. The Company continues to receive input from itsemployees
 via pulse surveys throughout the COVID-19 pandemic,  which has also helped  to shape the Company’s pandemic-related  responses and a flexible  return to hybrid work where possible.Throughout
 the  fall  of  2021,  managers  and  employees  who  had  been  working  remotely  during  the  pandemic  began  to  return  to  the  Company’s  offices  and  facilities  with  increasing  frequency,  inpreparation for a thr
ee-day in-person, two-day remote work week, where feasible.Inclusion, Diversity and Equity
In
 2021, the Company continued to evolve its inclusion and diversity strategic framework to include equity. The Company defines equity as fair treatment, access, opportunity and advancementfor
 all people, while also eliminating barriers that may prevent some groups from full participation. The Company promotes an environment where inclusion, diversity and equity are embedded in itsculture.
 At all levels, the Company strives to understand, respect, value and provide equal opportunity to each employee. The Company seeks to foster an environment where employees’ differences areembraced
 and celebrated. The Company holds as an essential concept the right of employees to proudly share their ideas and unique perspectives in an environment built on mutual respect, equity andinclusion. The Company
 is committed to diversity among its workforce, executive and senior management leadership teams, by reflecting the diversity of the communities in which the Company serves.The Company expects all of its 
leaders to lead with inclusion, diversity and equity.During
 2021, the Company published its first Inclusion & Diversity Report. The report shares the Company’s diversity strategies, practices, policies and programs from across the business andincludes
 more than 100 data points related to building a culture of inclusion. The following graphic highlights the Company’s principal employee inclusion, diversity and equity metrics for 2021 basedon its employee headcount as o
f January 1, 2022, and which are based on responses from employees who voluntarily self-reported this information to the Company.21

In keeping
 with the Company’s values, the Company does not tolerate discrimination, harassment or retaliation by or toward any employee, vendor, customer or other person in its workplace. Allemployees
 are required to complete anti-harassment, workplace respect and dignity, unconscious bias and inclusion and diversity training. In addition, annual Code of Ethics training is provided to allemployees, which includes educ
ation on using the Company’s anonymous hotline for reporting potential Code of Ethics violations.In
 2021,  the  Company  launched  four  employee  business  resource  groups  (“EBRGs”),  which  represent  diverse  employee  demographics  (Women,  African  American/Black,  LGBTQ+  andDisabilities)
 throughout the Company. EBRGs offer opportunities for employees to share ideas and best practices, and to create measurable and long-lasting positive impacts on the Company’s culture.The Company’s Inclusion and Diversity Adviso
ry Council oversees the formation, goals and actions of the EBRGs to support the Company’s inclusion diversity and equity priorities.To
 further its commitment to inclusion, diversity and equity, and in response to feedback from employees about work-life balance, in 2021, the Company announced a new Inclusion HolidaySwap benefit, to
 allow the opportunity for all employees to swap a Company holiday with another day of their choosing that more closely reflects their personal values, beliefs or culture. In addition, theCompany is evaluating the imp
lementation of workforce diversity goals in certain of its compensation programs.Total Rewards
Employees
 are considered the Company’s greatest assets and the Company views their overall well-being to be as important as their physical safety. American Water’s health and well-beingprograms
 aim for employees to go home in the same or better condition than when they came to work. Health and well-being programs are approached holistically by offering the following benefits,among
 others: medical, prescription, dental, vision, disability and life insurance coverage, as well as a health and wellness program and a menu of additional voluntary benefits. The Company’s TotalRewards

 per week receive full-time benefits. Approximately 90% of all benefit eligible employees are enrolled in the Company’s healthcare benefits. Full-time employees pay approximately 16% of thetotal
 cost of medical, dental and vision coverage. The Company offers its non-union employees who average 20 to 30 hours per week medical, dental and vision coverage at 50% of the total cost.Additional medical benefits include
 coverage for applied behavior analysis, autism treatment, transgender services and hearing aids, as well as a fertility assistance benefit to assist employees in buildinga
 family. The Company also offers additional employment benefits, including holiday, vacation and sick time, which are at levels generally greater than or equal to those offered by other companies inthe
 utility industry. For example, the Company offers its employees up to two weeks of paid leave in connection with the birth, adoption or foster placement of a child, or to take care of a sick familymember.
The
 Company  believes  that  good  emotional  and  mental  health  is  fundamental,  and  offers  a  behavioral  health  benefit  to  assist  employees  and  their  families  to  maintain  their  well-being.Additionally, the
 Company offers an employee assistance program (EAP) that provides all employees and their eligible dependents with access to a variety of support resources free of charge. The EAPprovides
 confidential  support  through  its  Work-Life  Specialists  to  help  individuals  who  are  experiencing  a  variety  of  challenges,  including  financial,  legal,  family  and  emotional  needs.  The  EAPprovides
 guidance,  resources  and  expert  referrals  based  on  an  individual’s  needs.  In  addition,  the  Company  provides  all  employees  and  their  families  with  access  to  an  interactive  online  wellnessprogram
 that  supports  and  encourages  a  healthy  lifestyle  both  at  work  and  at  home.  In  2021,  the  Company  enhanced  its  internal  myWellness  website  to  include  additional  tools  and  activities  foremployees, including custom
ized programs and action cards tailored to an individual’s self-identified health needs.Talent Development
The
 Company  provides  learning  opportunities  and  work  experiences  to  equip  its  employees  with  the  tools,  skills,  and  competencies  they  need  to  operate  safely  and  effectively  and  to  growprofessionally. To
 this end, the Company has established an Employee Experience and Talent Development team to help develop and deploy programs that are designed to attract, motivate, develop andretain
 talented employees, and foster a learning culture. The Company requires every employee, including its union-represented employees, to complete a minimum of 25 hours of training each year (anincrease
 in the 20-hour requirement for 2020). Approximately 98% of active full-time employees hired before October 1, 2021 met this requirement for 2021, with over 331,000 hours of total trainingcompleted
 during  the  year,  including  approximately  109,000  hours  of  safety  training.  In  addition  to  required  role-based  training,  managers  assist  employees  to  identify  professional  developmentopportunities to help them reach their full potential and grow their careers. A
dditionally, in 2021, approximately 58% of the Company’s internal employee transfers and promotions were diverse (definedas female, minority, disability, military,
 military spouse, and LGBTQ+ status, based on voluntary employee self-identification), which reflects the Company’s commitment to employee development andcareer growth as well as th
e Company’s focus on diversity, inclusion and equity, and a desire for its employees to reflect the communities in which it operates.Developing
 talent and ensuring a pipeline to executive leadership is a critical priority for the Company. During 2021, the Company engaged in succession planning activities for the Company’scritical
 positions and executive leaders. These succession plans aid in providing continued leadership for the growth and future of the Company’s business, while also seeking to promote diversity,retention
 and  development.  In  addition  to  succession  of  executive  leadership  roles,  in  2022,  the  Company  plans  to  focus  on  talent  reviews,  which  will  include  identification  of  critical  skill  andcompetency areas, a
 focus on diverse emerging talent, and a discussion of strengths, gaps, and development plans. Talent reviews will be conducted for a select group of employees, including employeeswho are being assessed for senior 
leadership or other critical roles.Employee Experience
The Company’s employee value propo
sition (“EVP”) focuses on employee experience as an influencer of an employee’s opinions and emotional response about the Company as an employer. TheCompany
 continually  seeks  to  shape  and  refine  its  employee  experience,  and  therefore  its  EVP,  by  offering  an  inclusive  employee  culture,  employee  development  opportunities  and  competitivecompensation
 and benefits. In developing its current EVP, the Company identified components that it believes are important to its employees and then solicited and received feedback from over 400Company
 employees on those components to understand better the aspects that they value from their employer. From this employee outreach, and as a part of its EVP, the Company developed weCare,which is comprised of the fol
lowing five components: deeper connections, personal growth, shared purpose, flexibility and well-being.Workforce Data
As
 of January 1, 2022, the Company had approximately 6,400 employees. For 2021, the Company’s employee turnover rate, which the Company defines as the ratio of the number of separatedemployees
 to the 12-month average headcount during 2021, was 13.1%, up from 7.4% in 2020. American Water seeks to reduce employee turnover by assessing its EVP and through its efforts to fosterthe Company’s employee exper
ience.23

Table of ContentsAs
 of January 1, 2022, approximately 47% of the Company’s workforce was represented by unions, which include 73 collective bargaining agreements with 14 different unions. Additionally, in2022,
 the  Company  has  begun  to  negotiate  two  new  collective  bargaining  agreements,  which  would  cover  approximately  180  employees.  During  2022,  21  of  the  Company’s  collective  bargainingagreements are
 set to expire in accordance with their terms and the Company expects to be able to negotiate these agreements during the year. The Company collaborates with union leadership on topicssuch as safety, customer, t
echnology and employee benefits in forums such as the Joint Healthcare Committee, National Labor Management Committee and the annual Labor Management Conference.Board Oversight
The
 Executive Development and Compensation Committee (“ED&CC”) of the Board of Directors establishes and reviews the Company’s overall compensation philosophy and oversees thecompensation
 and benefits plans and programs for its executive officers. The ED&CC oversees the process of planning for executive officer succession. It also provides oversight of the Company’sinclusion,
 diversity and equity programs and initiatives. Further, the ED&CC is responsible for reviewing and assessing, at least annually, the Company’s culture and related culture engagement, itsorganizational and le
adership development plans and programs, and its programs designed to identify, attract and retain high-potential employees.Information About Our Executive Officers

Table of ContentsITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS
We
 operate  in  a  market  and  regulatory  environment  that  involves  significant  risks,  many  of  which  are  beyond  our  control.  In  addition  to  the  other  information  included  or  incorporated  byreference
 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following material factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects. Any of the following risks, either alone or takentogether, could mater
ially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.Risks Related to Our Industry and Business Operations
Our
 Regulated Businesses are subject to extensive regulation by state PUCs and other regulatory agencies, which significantly affects our business, financial condition, results of operations andcash flows. Our Regulated Businesses also may be subject to fines, penal
ties and other sanctions for an inability to meet these regulatory requirements.Our Regulated Businesses provide water and
 wastewater services to our customers through subsidiaries that are subject to regulation by state PUCs. This regulation affects the rates we charge ourcustomers
 and  has  a  significant  impact  on  our  business  and  operations.  Generally,  the  state  PUCs  authorize  us  to  charge  rates  that  they  determine  are  sufficient  to  recover  our  prudently  incurredoperating
 expenses, including, but not limited to, operating and maintenance costs, depreciation, financing costs and taxes, and provide us with the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return oninvested capital.
Our
 ability to successfully implement our business plan and strategy depends on the rates authorized by the various state PUCs. We periodically file rate increase applications with state PUCs.The ensuing administrative process may be lengthy and costly. Our rate increase requests may or may not be approved, or may be
 partially approved, and any approval may not occur in a timely manner.Moreover, a PUC may not approve a rat
e request to an extent that is sufficient to:•
cover our expenses, including pur chased water and costs of chemicals, fuel and other commodities used in our operations;•
enable us to recover our inv estment; and•
provide us with an opportunity to ea rn an appropriate rate of return on our investment.Approval
 by the PUCs is also required in connection with other aspects of our Regulated Businesses, which are required to have numerous permits, approvals and certificates from the PUCs thatregulate their business
es and authorize acquisitions, dispositions, debt and/or equity financing, and, in certain cases, affiliated transactions. Some state PUCs are empowered to impose financial penalties,fines and
 other sanctions for non-compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Although we believe that each utility subsidiary has obtained or sought renewal of the material permits, approvals andcertificates ne
cessary for its existing operations, we are unable to predict the impact that future regulatory activities may have on our business.PUCs and other governme
ntal authorities have taken, and may continue to take, emergency or other actions in light of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic that may impact us, including prohibitingthe
 termination of service for non-payment and extending or delaying procedural schedules in our regulatory proceedings. We are unable to predict the range of impacts that the ongoing COVID-19pandemic
 and other related events may have on our ability to obtain these approvals as needed or requested by our Regulated Businesses in the ordinary course or at all, or the nature or impacts of anyfurther emergency or o
ther action that may be taken by the PUCs or other governmental authorities.In
 any of these cases, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected. Even if the rates approved are sufficient, we face the risk that wewill
 not achieve the rates of return on our invested capital to the extent permitted by state PUCs. This could occur if certain conditions exist, including, but not limited to, water usage is less than thelevel anticipated 
in establishing rates, customers increase their conservation efforts, or we experience unanticipated impacts of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, or if our investments or expenses proveto be higher than the leve
ls estimated in establishing rates.Our operations and the qualit
y of water we supply are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent environmental, water quality and health and safety laws and regulations, including with respectto
 contaminants of emerging concern, compliance with which could impact both our operating costs and capital expenditures, and violations of which could subject us to substantial liabilities andcosts, as well as damage to our reputation.
Our
 regulated water and wastewater operations and the operations of our Market-Based Businesses are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations. These requirementsinclude,
 among others, CERCLA, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the LCR, and other federal and state requirements. For example, state PUCs and environmental regulators setconditions and
 standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver. If we deliver water or wastewater services to our customers that do not comply with regulatory standards, or otherwise violateenvironmental
 laws, regulations or permits, or other health and safety and water quality regulations, we could incur substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions or costs, as well as damage to ourreputation. In the most se
rious cases, regulators could reduce requested rate increases or force us to discontinue operations and sell our26

 assets to another utility or to a municipality. Given the nature of our business which, in part, involves providing water service for human consumption, any potential non-compliance with, orviolation
 of, environmental, water quality and health and safety laws or regulations would likely pose a more significant risk to us than to a company not similarly involved in the water and wastewaterindustry.
In
 addition, CERCLA authorizes the EPA to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions with respect to actual or threatenedreleases
 of hazardous substances, and can impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault, on responsible parties for the costs thereof. We are also required to obtain various environmentalpermits from regulatory agencie
s for our operations.We
 incur substantial operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental, water quality and health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations and theirenforcement,
 have become more stringent over time, and new or stricter requirements could increase our costs. Although we may seek to recover ongoing compliance costs in our Regulated Businessesthrough
 customer rates, there can be no guarantee that the various state PUCs or similar regulatory bodies that govern our Regulated Businesses would approve rate increases that would enable us torecover such costs or that su
ch costs will not materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.We
 may also incur liabilities if, under environmental laws and regulations, we are required to investigate and clean up environmental contamination, including potential releases of hazardouschemicals,
 such as chlorine, which we use to treat water, or at off-site locations where we have disposed of residual waste or caused an adverse environmental impact. The discovery of previouslyunknown
 conditions, or the imposition of cleanup obligations in the future, could result in significant costs and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows andliquidity. Such remediat
ion costs may not be covered by insurance and may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future.Attention is being given to contaminants of emergin
g concern, including, without limitation, chemicals and other substances that currently do not have any regulatory standard in drinking water orhave
 been recently created or discovered (including by means of scientific achievements in the analysis and detection of trace amounts of substances). Examples of sources of contaminants include, butare
 not limited to, newly created chemical compounds (including, for example, manufactured nanomaterials); human and veterinary products; perfluorinated and polyfluorinated compounds; bacteria,microbes,
 viruses (including the coronavirus), amoebae and other pathogens; and residual by-products of disinfection. We rely upon governmental agencies to set appropriate regulatory standards toprotect
 the public from these and other contaminants, and our role is to provide service that meets these standards, if any. In some of our states, PUCs may disapprove of cost recovery, in whole or inpart,
 for implementation of treatment infrastructure for a contaminant in the absence of a regulatory standard. Furthermore, given the rapid pace at which these contaminants are being created and/ordiscovered,
 we may not be able to detect and/or mitigate all such substances in our drinking water system or supplies, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results ofoperations
 and reputation. In addition, we believe these contaminants may form the basis for additional or increased federal or state regulatory initiatives and requirements in the future, which couldsignificantly incre
ase the cost of our operations.Limitations on availability of w
ater supplies or restrictions on our use of water supplies as a result of government regulation or action may adversely affect our access to sources of water, our abilityto supply water to customers or the demand for our water serv
ices.Our ability
 to meet the existing and future demand of our customers depends on the availability of an adequate supply of water. As a general rule, sources of public water supply, including rivers,lakes, streams, groundwater 
aquifers and recycled water sources, are held in the public trust and are not generally owned by private interests. As a result, we typically do not own the source water that weuse
 in our operations, and the availability of our water supply is established through allocation rights (determined by legislation or court decisions) and passing-flow requirements set by governmentalentities or
 by entering into water purchase agreements. These requirements, which can change from time to time, and vary by state or region, may adversely impact our water supply. Supply issues, suchas
 drought, overuse of sources of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats, contamination or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water. If we are unable to secureavailable or alte
rnative sources of water, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.For example, in our Monterey Cou
nty, California operations, we are seeking to augment our sources of water supply, principally to comply with an October 2009 cease and desist order (the “2009Order”),
 as amended by a July 2016 order (the “2016 Order”), of the SWRCB that requires our California subsidiary to significantly decrease its diversions from the Carmel River in accordance with areduction
 schedule  that  terminated  on  December  31,  2021  (the  “2021  Deadline”).  See  Item  3—Legal  Proceedings—Alternative  Water  Supply  in  Lieu  of  Carmel  River  Diversions,  which  includesadditional
 information regarding this matter. We are also required to augment our Monterey County sources of water supply to comply with the requirements of the Endangered Species Act. Beginningin
 January 2022,  Cal Am currently expects that it will be able to comply with the diversion reduction requirement schedule contained in the 2016 Order, but continued compliance with the diversionreduction requiremen
ts for 2023 and future years27

Table of Contentswill depend
 on successful development of alternate water supply sources sufficient to meet customer demand. The 2009 Order and the 2016 Order remain in effect until Cal Am certifies to the SWRCB,and
 the SWRCB concurs, that Cal Am has obtained a permanent supply of water to substitute for past unauthorized Carmel River diversions. While  the Company cannot currently predict the likelihoodor
 result of any adverse outcome associated with these matters, further attempts to comply with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order may result in material additional costs or obligations, including finesand
 penalties against our California subsidiary in the event of noncompliance with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order, which could have a material adverse effect upon us and our business, results ofoperations and cash flows.
Service
 disruptions caused by severe weather conditions, climate variability patterns or natural or other disasters may disrupt our operations or reduce the demand for our water services, whichcould adversely affect our financia
l condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.Service
 interruptions due to severe weather, climate variability patterns and natural or other events are possible across all our businesses. These include, among other things, storms, freezingconditions,
 high wind conditions, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, landslides, drought, wildfires, coastal and intercoastal floods or high water conditions, including those in or near designated floodplains,
 pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic) and epidemics, severe electrical storms, sinkholes and solar flares. Weather and other natural events such as these may affect the condition oroperability of our
 facilities, limiting or preventing us from delivering water or wastewater services to our customers, or requiring us to make substantial capital expenditures to repair any damage. Tariffsin place or cost recove
ry proceedings with respect to our Regulated Businesses may not provide reimbursement to us, in whole or in part, for any of these impacts.Government
 restrictions on water use may also result in decreased use of water services, even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers, which may adversely affect our financialcondition, results of opera
tions and cash flows. Seasonal drought conditions that may impact our water services are possible across all of our service areas. Governmental restrictions imposed in responseto
 a drought may apply to all systems within a region independent of the supply adequacy of any individual system. Responses may range from voluntary to mandatory water use restrictions, rationingrestrictions,
 water  conservation  regulations,  and  requirements  to  minimize  water  system  leaks.  While  expenses  incurred  in  implementing  water  conservation  and  rationing  plans  may  generally  berecoverable
 provided the relevant PUC determines they were reasonable and prudent, we cannot assure that any such expenses incurred will, in fact, be fully recovered. Moreover, reductions in waterconsumption,
 including those resulting from installation of equipment or changed consumer behavior, may persist even after drought restrictions are repealed and the drought has ended, which couldadversely affect our bus
iness, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Climate 
variability  may cause increased volatility in weather and may impact water usage and related revenue or require additional expenditures, all of which may not be fully recoverable in ratesor otherwise.
The
 issue of climate variability is receiving increasing attention nationally and worldwide. There is consensus among climate scientists that there will be worsening of weather volatility in thefuture associated with climate
 variability. Many climate variability predictions present several potential challenges to water and wastewater utilities, including us, such as:•
increased frequency and du ration of droughts;•
increased precipit ation and flooding;•
increased frequency and s everity of storms and other weather events;•
challenges associated wit h changes in temperature or increases in ocean levels;•
potential degradation o f water quality;•
decreases in availab le water supply and changes in water usage patterns;•
increases in disruptions in s ervice;•
increased costs to repair damaged facilities; or•
increased  costs to reduce risks associated with the increasing frequency and severity of natural events, including to improve the resiliency and reliability of our water and wastewatertreatment and conveyance facilities
 and systems.Because
 of the uncertainty of weather volatility related to climate variability, we cannot predict its potential impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows andliquidity.
 Furthermore, laws and regulations have been enacted that seek to reduce or limit GHG emissions and require additional reporting and monitoring, and these regulations may become morepervasive
 or stringent in light of changing governmental agendas and priorities, although the exact nature and timing of these changes is uncertain. Although some or all potential expenditures and costsassociated with the
 impact of climate variability and related laws and regulations on our Regulated Businesses could be recovered through rates, infrastructure replacement surcharges or other regulatorymechanisms, there can b
e no assurance that state PUCs would authorize rate increases to enable us to recover such28

Table of Contentsexpenditures and costs, in whole or 
in part.The current
 regulatory rate setting process may result in a significant delay, also known as “regulatory lag,” from the time that we invest in infrastructure improvements, incur increased operatingexpenses
 as a result of inflation or other factors, incur increased cost of capital, including as a result of increasing short- and long-term rates, or experience declining water usage, to the time atwhich we can seek to address these events in rate case app
lications; our inability to mitigate or minimize regulatory lag could adversely affect our business.There
 is typically a delay, known as “regulatory lag,” between the time our Regulated Businesses make a capital investment or incur an operating expense increase and the time when those costsare
 reflected  in  rates.  In  addition,  billings  permitted  by  state  PUCs typically  are,  to  a  considerable  extent,  based  on  the  volume  of  water  usage  in  addition  to  a  minimum  base  rate.  Thus,  we  mayexperience regulato
ry lag between the time our revenues are affected by declining usage and the time we are able to adjust the rate per gallon of usage to address declining usage. Our inability to mitigateor reduce regulatory l
ag could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.We
 endeavor to mitigate or reduce regulatory lag by pursuing constructive regulatory practices. For example, two of our states have approved revenue stability mechanisms that adjust ratesperiodically to
 ensure that a utility’s revenue will be sufficient to cover its costs regardless of sales volume, including recognition of declining sales resulting from reduced consumption, while providingan
 incentive for customers to use water more efficiently. In addition, 10 of our state PUCs permit rates to be adjusted outside of the general rate case application process through surcharges that addresscertain
 capital investments, such as replacement of aging infrastructure. These surcharges are adjusted periodically based on factors such as project completion or future budgeted expenditures, andspecific
 surcharges are eliminated once the related capital investment is incorporated in new PUC approved rates. Furthermore, in setting rates, nine of our state PUCs allow us to use future test years,which extend beyond the date a rate request is filed to allo
w for current or projected revenues, expenses and investments to be reflected in rates on a more timely basis. Other examples of such regulatorypractices include
 expense mechanisms that allow us to increase rates for certain cost increases that are beyond our control, such as purchased water costs, property or other taxes, or power, conservation,chemical
 or other expenditures. These mechanisms enable us to adjust rates in less time after costs have been incurred than would be the case under a general rate case application process without themechanisms.
While
 these mechanisms have mitigated or reduced regulatory lag in several of our regulated states, we continue to seek approval of regulatory practices to mitigate or reduce regulatory lag inthose
 jurisdictions that have not approved them. Furthermore, PUCs may fail to adopt new surcharges and existing mechanisms may not continue in their current form, or at all, or we may be unable orbecome ineligible to 
continue to utilize certain of these mechanisms in the future. Although we intend to continue our efforts to seek state PUC approval of constructive regulatory practices to mitigate orreduce
 regulatory lag, our efforts may not be successful, or even if partially successful, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity may be materially and adverselyaffected.
Changes in laws and regulations can significantly and materially af
fect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.The impact of any future revisions or changes in
 interpretations of existing regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations applicable to our Regulated Businesses is uncertain. Changes inlaws
 or regulations, the imposition of additional laws and regulations, changes in enforcement practices of regulators, government policies or court decisions can materially affect our operations, resultsof
 operations and cash flows. Certain of the individuals  who serve as regulators  are elected  or political  appointees.  Therefore, elections  which result in a change of political  administration  or newappointments
 may also result in changes of the individuals who serve as regulators and changes in the policies of the regulatory agencies that they serve. New laws or regulations, new interpretations ofexisting laws or
 regulations, changes in agency policy, including those made in response to shifts in public opinion, or conditions imposed during the regulatory hearing process could have the followingconsequences, among others:
•
making it more diffi cult for us to increase our rates and, as a consequence, to recover our costs or earn our expected rates of return;•
changing the determina tion of the costs, or the amount of costs, that would be considered recoverable in rate cases and other regulatory proceedings;•
restricting our abil ity to terminate our services to customers who owe us money for services previously provided or limiting our bill collection efforts;•
requiring us to provide water o r wastewater services at reduced rates to certain customers;•
limiting or restri cting our ability to acquire water or wastewater systems, purchase or dispose of assets, or issue long-term debt or equity, or making it less cost-effective for us to do so;29

negatively impacting,  among other things: (i) tax rates or positions or the deductibility of expenses under federal or state tax laws, (ii) the availability or amount of, or our ability to complywith
 the terms and conditions of, tax credits or tax abatement benefit, (iii) the amount of taxes owed, (iv) the timing of tax effects on rates or (v) the ability to utilize our net operating losscarryforwards;
•
changing regulations that affect the benefits we expected to receive when we began offering services in a particular area;•
increasing  the associated costs of, or difficulty complying with, environmental, health, safety, consumer privacy, water quality, and water quality accountability laws and regulations towhich our operations are subje
ct;•
changing or placing addition al limitations on change in control requirements relating to any concentration of ownership of our common stock;•
making  it easier for governmental entities to convert our assets to public ownership via condemnation, eminent domain or other similar process, or for governmental agencies or privateplaintiffs to assess li
ability against us for damages under these or similar processes;•
placing  limitations, prohibitions or other requirements with respect to the sharing of information and participation in transactions by or between a regulated subsidiary and us or our otheraffiliates, includ
ing Service Company and any of our other subsidiaries;•
restricting or prohibiting  our extraction of water from rivers, streams, reservoirs or aquifers; and•
revoking or altering the terms of a CPCN issued to us by a state PUC or other governmental authority.Regulatory and environmental risks associated with the co
llection, treatment and disposal of wastewater may impose significant costs and liabilities.The
 wastewater collection, treatment and disposal operations of our subsidiaries are subject to substantial regulation and involve environmental risks. If collection, treatment or disposal systemsfail,
 overflow, or do not operate properly, untreated or inadequately treated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby properties or into nearby streams and rivers, causing damage topersons
 or property, injury to aquatic life and economic damages. This risk is most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding, which are the main causes of sewer overflow and systemfailure.
 Liabilities resulting from such damage could adversely and materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Certain of our wastewater systems havecommercial
 and industrial customers that are subject to specific limitations on the type, character and strength of the wastewater they are permitted to discharge into our systems. The failure by thesecommercial
 and industrial customers to comply with their respective discharge requirements could, in turn, negatively impact our operations, damage our facilities or cause us to exceed applicabledischarge limitat
ions and requirements. Liabilities resulting from such exceedance events could adversely and materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.A loss of one or more large industrial or commerc
ial customers could have a material adverse impact upon the results of operations of one or more of our Regulated Businesses.Adverse
 economic conditions, including the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors, may cause our customers, particularly industrial and large commercial customers, to curtail operations. Acurtailment
 of operations by such a customer typically results in reduced water usage by that customer. In more severe circumstances, the decline in usage could be permanent. Any decrease in demandresulting
 from difficult economic conditions affecting these customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Tariffs in place with respect to our Regulated Businessesmay not reimburse us, in whole or 
in part, for any of these impacts.Our Regulated Businesse
s require significant capital expenditures and may suffer if we fail to secure appropriate funding to make investments, experience increases in short- and long-term interestrates or if we experience delays 
in completing major capital expenditure projects.The
 water  and  wastewater  utility  business  is  capital  intensive.  We  invest  significant  amounts  of  capital  to  add,  replace  and  maintain  property,  plant  and  equipment,  and  to  improve  aginginfrastructure.
 In 2021, we invested $1.8 billion in net Company-funded capital improvements. The level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the integrity of our systems will continue into thefuture and, we believe, will increase. We expect to fund capital
 improvement projects using cash generated from operations (including, among other things, a portion of the net proceeds from the sales ofHOS
 and our New York subsidiary), borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper programs and issuances of long-term debt and equity. We may not be able to access ourrevolving
 credit facility or the commercial paper, long-term debt and equity capital markets, when necessary or desirable to fund capital improvements on favorable terms or at all. If we are not able toobtain
 sufficient financing, we may be unable to maintain our existing property, plant and equipment, fund our capital investment strategies, meet our growth targets and expand our rate base to enableus
 to earn satisfactory future returns on our investments. Even with adequate financial resources to make required capital expenditures, we face the additional risk that we will not complete our majorcapital projects on t
ime, as a result of supply chain interruptions, construction delays, permitting delays, labor shortages or other disruptions, environmental restrictions, legal and30

Table of Contentsregulatory challenges, o
r other obstacles. Each of these outcomes could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Aging infrastructure may lead to service d
isruptions, property damage and increased capital expenditures and O&M costs, all of which could negatively impact our financial results.We
 have  risks  associated  with  aging  infrastructure,  including  water  and  sewer  mains,  pumping  stations  and  water  and  wastewater  treatment  facilities.  Additionally,  we  may  have  limitedinformation regarding
 buried and newly acquired assets, which could challenge our ability to conduct efficient asset management and maintenance practices. Assets that have aged beyond their expecteduseful
 lives may experience a higher rate of failure. Failure of aging infrastructure could result in increased capital expenditures and O&M costs, and negatively impact our future O&M efficiency ratio.In
 addition, failure of aging infrastructure may result in property damage, and in safety, environmental and public health impacts. To the extent that any increased costs or expenditures are not fullyrecovered in rates, our 
results of operations, liquidity and cash flows could be negatively impacted.Seasonality could adversely affe
ct the volume of water sold and our revenues.The
 volume of water we sell during the warmer months, typically in the summer, is generally greater than during other months, due primarily to increased water usage for irrigation systems,swimming
 pools, cooling systems and other applications. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer months, the volume of water sold tends to vary with temperature, rainfall levelsand
 rainfall frequency. In the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal, or if there is more rainfall than normal, the amount of water we sell may decrease andadversely affect our 
revenues.Two
 of our jurisdictions, California and Illinois, have adopted revenue stability mechanisms that permit us to recover the revenues authorized in a general rate case, regardless of sales volume.Revenue
 stability  mechanisms  are  designed  to  recognize  declining  sales  resulting  from  reduced  consumption,  while  providing  an  incentive  for  customers  to  use  water  more  efficiently.  In  thosejurisdictions that have no
t adopted a revenue stability mechanism, our operating results could continue to be affected by seasonality.Contamination of
 water supplies or our water service provided to our customers could result in service limitations and interruptions and exposure to substances not typically found in potable watersupplies, and could subject us and our subsidiaries to reductions in usage and other responsive obl
igations, government enforcement actions, damage to our reputation and private litigation.The
 water supplies that flow into our treatment plants or are delivered through our distribution system, or the water service that is provided to our customers, may be subject to contamination,including, among
 other items, contamination from naturally-occurring compounds, chemicals in groundwater systems, pollution resulting from manufactured sources (such as perchlorate, perfluorinatedand polyfluorinated compounds, methyl tertiary
 butyl ether, 1,4-dioxane, lead and other materials, or chemical spills or other incidents that result in contaminants entering the water source), and possibleterrorist
 attacks  or  other  similar  incidents.  In  addition,  new  categories  of  contaminants  continue  to  emerge  in  the  water  industry.  If  one  of  our  water  supplies  or  the  water  service  provided  to  ourcustomers is contaminated,
 depending on the nature of the contamination, we may have to take responsive actions that could include, among other things (1) limiting use of the water supply under a “DoNot
 Use” protective order that enables continuation of basic sanitation and essential fire protection, or (2) interrupting the use of that water supply, in whole or in part, potentially impacting basicsanitation
 and  fire  protection  needs. If  service  is disrupted,  our financial  condition,  results  of operations,  cash  flows, liquidity  and reputation  may be adversely  affected.  In  addition,  we  may incursignificant
 costs in order to treat the contaminated source through the expansion of our current treatment facilities or the development of new sources of supply or new treatment methods. We may beunable
 to recover costs associated with treating or decontaminating water supplies through insurance, customer rates, tariffs or contract terms, and any recovery of these costs that we are able to obtainthrough
 regulatory proceedings or otherwise may not occur in a timely manner. Moreover, we could be subject to claims for damages arising from government enforcement actions or toxic tort or otherlawsuits arising
 out of an interruption of service or human exposure to hazardous substances in our drinking water and water supplies. See Item 3—Legal Proceedings for information on certain pendinglawsuits related to interru
ptions of water service.Since
 we are engaged in the business of providing water service to our customers, contamination of the water supply, or the water service provided to our customers, could result in substantialinjury
 or damage to our customers, employees or others and we could be exposed to substantial claims and litigation. Such claims could relate to, among other things, personal injury, loss of life,business
 interruption,  property  damage,  pollution,  and  environmental  damage  and  may  be  brought  by  our  customers  or  third  parties.  Litigation  and  regulatory  proceedings  are  subject  to  inherentuncertainties
 and unfavorable rulings can and do occur. We may not be protected from these claims or negative impacts of these claims in whole or in part by tariffs or other contract terms. Negativeimpacts
 to our reputation may occur even if we are not liable for any contamination or other environmental damage or the consequences arising out of human exposure to contamination or hazardoussubstances
 within  the  water  supply  or  distributed  finished  drinking  water.  In  addition,  insurance  coverage  may  not  cover  all  or  a  portion  of  these  losses,  and  are  subject  to  deductibles  and  otherlimitations. Pending or futu
re claims against us could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.31

Table of ContentsWe are subject to adverse publici
ty and reputational risks, which make us vulnerable to negative customer perception and could lead to increased regulatory oversight or sanctions.Our
 business and operations have a large direct and indirect customer base and, as a result, we are exposed to public criticism regarding, among other things, the reliability of water service,wastewater
 and related or ancillary services, the quality of water provided, and the amount, timeliness, accuracy and format of bills that are provided for such services. Adverse publicity and negativeconsumer
 sentiment arising out of these and other incidents may render legislatures and other governing bodies, state PUCs and other regulatory authorities, and government officials less likely to viewus
 in  a  favorable  light,  and  may  cause  us  to  be  susceptible  to  less  favorable  legislative,  regulatory  and  economic  outcomes,  as  well  as  increased  regulatory  or  other  oversight  and  more  stringentregulatory
 or economic requirements. Unfavorable regulatory and economic outcomes may include the enactment of more stringent laws and regulations governing our operations and less favorableeconomic
 terms in our agreements related to our Military  Services Group, as  well as fines, penalties or other sanctions or requirements. The imposition of any of the foregoing could have a materialnegative impact on us and our 
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The failure of, or the requirement to repair, upgrade or d
ismantle, any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.The
 properties of our Regulated Businesses segment include 76 dams, the majority of which are earthen dams. The failure of any of these dams could result in personal injury and propertydamage, including without limitation downstream property damage, for which we may be liable. The failure of a dam
 would also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to ourcustomers
 and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Any losses or liabilities incurred due to a failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies orbe recoverable in rates, an
d such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future.We
 also are required from time to time to decommission, repair or upgrade the dams that we own. The cost of such repairs or upgrades can be and has been material. The federal and stateagencies
 that regulate our operations may adopt rules and regulations requiring us to dismantle our dams, which also could entail material costs. Although in most cases the PUC has permitted recoveryof
 expenses and capital investment related to dam rehabilitation, we might not be able to recover costs of repairs, upgrades or dismantling through rates in the future. The inability to recover these costsor delayed recovery of th
e costs as a result of regulatory lag can affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.Any failure of our network of water and wastewater pipes, water mains and water reservo
irs could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and reputation.Our
 operating subsidiaries distribute water and collect wastewater through an extensive network of pipes, water mains and storage systems located across the United States. A failure of majorpipes,
 mains  or reservoirs could result in injuries, property and other damage for which we may be liable. The failure of major pipes, mains and reservoirs  may also result in the need to shut down somefacilities
 or parts of our network in order to conduct repairs. Such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water andwastewater delivery requ
irements prescribed by government regulators, including state PUCs with jurisdiction over our operations, and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cashflows,
 liquidity and reputation. Any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates, and such losses may make it difficult for us to secureinsurance at accept
able rates in the future. Moreover, to the extent such business interruptions or other losses are not covered by insurance, they may not be recovered through rate adjustments.An
 important part of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems, which involves risks, including competition for acquisition opportunities from other regulated utilities,governmental entities and other buyers, which may hinder or l
imit our ability to grow our business.An important element of ou
r growth strategy is the acquisition and optimization of water and wastewater systems in order to broaden our current, and move into new, service areas. We may not beable
 to acquire other systems or businesses if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities or reach mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates. Further, competition for acquisitionopportunities from other 
regulated utilities, governmental entities and other buyers may hinder our ability to expand our business.The negotiation and execut
ion of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired systems or businesses with our existing operations could require us to incur significant costs and causediversion of our managemen
t’s time and resources. Future acquisitions by us could result in, among other things:•
incurrence or assumption o f debt, contingent liabilities and environmental liabilities and obligations, including liabilities that were unknown or undisclosed at the time of acquisition;•
failure to recover acquisition premiums;32

Table of Contents•
unanticipated capit al expenditures;•
failure to maintain effective internal c ontrol over financial reporting;•
the need to successfully in tegrate the acquired systems’ operations and water quality, cybersecurity and infrastructure protection measures;•
recording goodwill and other in tangible assets at values that ultimately may be subject to impairment charges;•
fluctuations in quarte rly results;•
unanticipated acquisi tion-related expenses;•
failure to reali ze anticipated benefits and synergies, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements; and•
difficulties in int egrating or assimilating personnel, benefits, services and systems.Some
 or all of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business. The systems and businesses we acquire in the future may not achieve anticipated revenue, return on equity orprofitability,
 or other perceived synergies, and any difficulties we encounter in the integration process could interfere with our operations, reduce our net income and profitability or adversely affect ourinternal control over 
financial reporting.We
 compete with governmental entities, other regulated utilities, and strategic and financial buyers for acquisition opportunities. As consolidation activity increases in the water and wastewaterindustries and competit
ion for acquisitions continues to increase, the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase and limit our ability to expand through acquisitions.Our Regulated Businesse
s are subject to condemnation and other proceedings through eminent domain or other similar authorized process, which could materially and adversely affect their resultsof operations and financial condition.
Municipalities and othe
r government subdivisions have historically been involved in the provision of water and wastewater services in the United States, and organized efforts may arise from timeto
 time in one or more of the service areas in which our Regulated Businesses operate to convert our assets to public ownership and operation through exercise of the governmental power of eminentdomain,
 or another similar authorized process. A municipality, other government subdivision or a citizen group may seek to acquire our assets through eminent domain or such other process, eitherdirectly or indirectly as a re
sult of a citizen petition.For
 example, in November 2018, Monterey, California ballot Measure J, which was added by a citizens group, was certified as having been approved by a public vote, requiring the MPWMDto
 conduct a study and submit a written plan concerning the feasibility of a potential purchase of the Monterey system assets without an additional public vote. The public vote led to the issuance by theMPWMD
 in  November  2019  of  a  preliminary  report  finding,  among  other  things,  that  the  acquisition  of  the  Monterey  system  assets  by  the  MPWMD  would  be  economically  feasible.  Also,  fivemunicipalities
 in the Chicago, Illinois area formed a water agency that filed an eminent domain lawsuit against our Illinois subsidiary in January 2013, seeking to condemn a water pipeline that servesthose
 five municipalities. This lawsuit remains pending, and a valuation trial is scheduled for the second quarter of 2022. See Item 1—Business—Regulated Businesses—Condemnation and EminentDomain, which includes additiona
l information regarding these matters.Furthermore,
 the  law  in  certain  jurisdictions  in  which  our  Regulated  Businesses  operate  provides  for  eminent  domain  rights  allowing  private  property  owners  to  file  a  lawsuit  to  seek  justcompensation
 against a public utility, if the public utility’s infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of damage to that property. In these actions, the plaintiff would not have to provethat
 the public utility acted negligently. In California, lawsuits have been filed in connection with large-scale natural events such as wildfires. Some of these lawsuits have included allegations thatinfrastructure of
 certain utilities triggered the natural event that resulted in damage to the property. In some cases, the PUC has disallowed recovery in rates of losses incurred by these utilities as a resultof such lawsuits.
Contesting
 an exercise  of condemnation,  eminent  domain or other  similar  process, or responding  to a citizen  petition,  may result in costly legal proceedings  and may divert the attention  ofmanagement. Moreover, our efforts to resist the con
demnation, eminent domain or other process may not be successful, which may require us to sell the operations at issue in a condemnation proceedingor
 to pay a private property owner compensation for the property damage suffered. If a municipality or other government subdivision succeeds in acquiring the assets of one or more of our RegulatedBusinesses through eminent domain or other process, there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for the business, that we will not be able to keep the compensation, or that we will not
be
 able to divest the business without incurring significant charges. Any of these outcomes may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows andliquidity.

Table of ContentsWe may be subject to physical and cyb
er attacks.As
 operators of critical infrastructure, we may face a heightened risk of physical and cyber attacks from internal or external sources. Our water and wastewater systems may be vulnerable todisability
 or failures as a result of physical or cyber attacks, acts of war or terrorism, vandalism or other causes. Our operational and technology systems throughout our businesses may be vulnerable tounauthorized
 external or internal access, due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism, and other causes. Unauthorized access to confidential information located or stored on these systems couldnegatively
 and materially impact our customers, employees, suppliers and other third parties. Further, third parties, including vendors, suppliers and contractors, who perform certain services for us oradminister and
 maintain our sensitive information, could also be targets of cyber attacks and unauthorized access. While we have instituted safeguards to protect our operational and technology systems,those safeguards may not always b
e effective due to the evolving nature of cyber attacks and cyber vulnerabilities. We cannot guarantee that such protections will be completely successful in the event ofa cyber attack.
If, despite our
 security measures, a significant physical attack or cyber breach occurred, our operations could be disrupted, property damaged, and customer and other confidential information lostor
 stolen;  we  could  experience  substantial  loss  of  revenues,  response  costs  and  other  financial  loss;  we  could  suffer  a  loss  of  management  time,  attention  and  resources  from  our  regular  businessoperations;
 and we may be subject to increased regulation, litigation and damage to our reputation, any of which could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows.Experiencing a
 cyber security incident could also cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws and regulations or contracts that require us to securely maintain confidential data, causing us to incurcosts
 related to legal claims or proceedings and regulatory fines or penalties. These types of events, either impacting our facilities or the industry in general, could also cause us to incur additionalsecurity and insurance r
elated costs.In
 addition, in the ordinary course of business, we collect and retain sensitive information, including personally identifiable information, about our customers and employees. In many cases, weoutsource
 administration of certain functions to vendors that could be targets of cyber attacks. Any theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer, employee or proprietary data as a result of a cyber attackcould subject us to signific
ant litigation, liability and costs, as well as adversely impact our reputation with customers and regulators, among others.We
 have obtained cyber insurance to provide coverage for a portion of the losses and damages that may result from a security breach, but such insurance is subject to a number of exclusions andmay
 not cover the total loss or damage caused by a breach. The market for cybersecurity insurance is relatively new and coverage available for cybersecurity events may evolve as the industry matures.In
 the future, adequate insurance may not be available at rates that we believe are reasonable, and the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident may not be covered by insurance orrecoverable in rates.
Our
 business is subject to complex and evolving federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding consumer privacy and the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals, which couldresult in, among other things, private or governmental c
laims or litigation against us, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, reputational harm and increased cost of operations.Laws
 and regulations are changing and increasing rapidly with respect to data and consumer privacy, security and protection. We are becoming subject to an increasing number of complex andcontinually
 evolving  data  and  consumer  privacy,  security  and  protection  laws  and  regulations  administered  by  various  federal,  state  and  local  governments,  including,  for  example,  the  CaliforniaConsumer Privacy Act
 of 2018. Federal and state governments have also adopted or are proposing other limitations on, or requirements regarding, the collection, distribution, use, security and storage ofpersonally
 identifiable information. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards on the collection,use and dissemination of dat
a. Moreover, we expect that current laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the United States will continue toevolve
 and increase, and we cannot determine the impact that compliance with such future laws, regulations or standards will have on us or on our business. Any failure or perceived failure by us tocomply
 with current  or future federal,  state, or local  data or consumer privacy  or security  laws, regulations,  policies,  guidance, industry  standards, or legal  obligations,  or any incident  resulting  inunauthorized
 access to, or acquisition, release, or transfer of personally identifiable information or other data relating to our customers, employees and others, may result in private or governmentalenforcement actions, litigation
 or other claims against us, fines and penalties, or adverse perception or publicity about us and our businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputationand
 business and could result in us incurring substantial costs. These events could also require us to change our business practices, and the events or such changes may result in significant diversions ofresources,
 distract management and divert the focus and attention of our security and technical personnel from other critical activities. Any of the foregoing consequences could have a material adverseeffect on our business, finan
cial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.We may sustain losses that exceed or are ex
cluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are self-insured.We
 maintain insurance coverage as part of our overall legal and risk management strategy to minimize potential liabilities arising from our Regulated Businesses, as well as the operations of ourMarket-Based Businesses. Our insuranc
e programs have34

Table of Contentsvarying coverage limits, exclusions and maximums, and insurance companies may
 seek to deny claims we might make. Generally, our insurance policies cover property damage, worker’s compensation,employer’s
 liability, general liability, cybersecurity, terrorism risks and automobile liability. Each policy includes deductibles or self-insured retentions and policy limits for covered claims. As a result,we may sustain losses that exc
eed or that are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are self-insured.Although
 in the past we have been generally able to obtain insurance coverage related to our business, there can be no assurance that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in thefuture, or that such insuran
ce can be economically secured. For example, catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits, more limited coverage, increased premium costs or deductibles.We
 rely on technology to facilitate the management of our business as well as our customer and supplier relationships, and a failure or disruption of implemented technology could materially andadversely affect our business.
Technology
 is an integral part of our business and operations, and any failure or disruption of the technology or related systems we implement could significantly limit our ability to manage andoperate
 our business effectively and efficiently, which, in turn, could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and adversely affect our results of operations. We use technology systems to,among
 other things, bill customers, process orders, provide customer service, manage certain plant operations and construction projects, manage our financial records, track assets, remotely monitor ourplants
 and facilities, and manage human resources, supply chain, inventory, and accounts receivable collections. As a specific example, we depend on water meters to record and communicate theamount
 of water our customers use, and in recent years, we have experienced greater than expected performance failures with certain water meters used in the Regulated Businesses. When these occur,we
 work with meter manufacturers to determine and address the cause of such failures. While these and other failures that we have experienced have not to date had a material adverse effect on ouroperations,
 there can be no assurance that efforts to address performance failures or other issues we may experience with water meters will be successful and that these or future failures of water metersor other issues will not have a 
material adverse effect on us.Although
 we do not believe that the technology we have implemented or may in the future implement is at a materially greater risk of failure than that used by other similar organizations, ourtechnology
 and operations that use or rely on technology remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among other things: failure or interruption of the technology or its related systems; loss orfailure
 of power, internet, telecommunications or data network systems; and operator error or improper operation by, the negligent or improper supervision of, or the intentional acts of, employees,contractors and other th
ird parties. Any or all of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.An
 inability to successfully develop and implement new technologies poses substantial risks to our business and operational excellence strategies, which could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness and financial results.
A
 significant part of our long-term strategic focus on safety, operational excellence, O&M expense efficiency, water quality, asset and capital management and the customer experience includesimplementing
 new  technologies  for,  among  other  things:  customer  service  and  support;  environmental  compliance;  water  metering;  water  quality  and  source  monitoring;  cybersecurity;  businessdevelopment
 and growth; data analysis; employee development and training; and other initiatives. For example, we have made and plan to continue to make significant investments in developing,deploying
 and  maintaining  customer-facing  technologies,  applications  to  support  field  service  and  customer  service  operations,  water  source  sensor  and  evaluation  technologies,  data  analytics  andhyperautomation
 technologies and artificial intelligence technologies. Where appropriate, we also seek to align these new technologies with existing technology infrastructure and systems. There can beno
 assurance that we will be successful in designing, developing, deploying, integrating or maintaining these new technologies. Because these efforts can be long-term in nature, these new technologiesmay be more costly or ti
me-consuming than expected to design, develop, integrate and complete and may not ultimately deliver the expected or desired benefits upon completion. While we have and willcontinue to
 seek to recover costs and earn a return on capital expenditures with respect to the costs and expenses of development and deployment of these new technologies in our Regulated Businesses,there
 can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in every instance or at all, and our inability to do so may adversely affect our ability to achieve intended O&M expense efficiencies or other keyperformance results 
and, ultimately, could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our
 inability to efficiently upgrade and improve our operational and technology systems, or implement new systems, could result in higher than expected costs or otherwise adversely impact ourinternal controls environment, operations and profitabi
lity.Upgrades
 and  improvements  to  computer  systems  and  networks,  or  the  implementation  of  new  systems,  may  require  substantial  amounts  of  management’s  time  and  financial  resources  tocomplete,
 and may also result in system or network defects or operational errors due to multiple factors, including employees’ ability to effectively use the new or upgraded system. We continue toimplement
 technology to improve our business processes and customer interactions, and have installed new, and upgraded existing, technology systems. Any technical or other difficulties in upgradingand
 improving  existing  or  implementing  new  technology  systems  may  increase  costs  beyond  those  anticipated  and  have  an  adverse  or  disruptive  effect  on  our  operations  and  reporting  processes,including
 our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  We  may  also  experience  difficulties  integrating  current  systems  with  new  or  upgraded  systems,  which  may  impact  our  ability  to  serve  ourcustomers effectively or efficiently
. Although we make efforts to minimize any35

Table of Contentsadverse
 impact  on  our  controls,  business  and  operations,  we  cannot  assure  that  all  such  impacts  have  been  or  will  be  mitigated,  and  any  such  impacts  could  harm  our  business  (individually  orcollectively) and hav
e a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Disruptions
 in our supply chain related to goods, such as pipe, chemicals, fuel, electricity, equipment, water and other raw materials, and services, could adversely impact our operations and ourability to serve our customers, as wel
l as our financial results.Our ability
 to serve our customers and operate our business in compliance with regulatory requirements is dependent upon purchasing or securing necessary goods and services from our suppliersand
 vendors. These items include but are not limited to contracted services, chemicals, pipe, valves, hydrants, fittings, fuel, equipment (including personal protective equipment), water and electricity.Examples
 of supply chain disruptions include reduced quantities of goods available in the marketplace, delays in manufacturing or shipping goods, labor shortages at our suppliers or vendors, naturaldisasters
 and operational impacts to some of our suppliers or vendors. Disruptions in our supply chain related to goods and services have occurred and we anticipate will continue to occur into theforeseeable future.
 Supply chain disruptions may cause us to be unable to purchase or otherwise obtain needed goods or services at a reasonable price or at all, and may significantly increase the price ofgoods
 and services we may obtain from suppliers and vendors. This, in turn, may adversely impact our operations and our ability to serve our customers in compliance with regulatory requirements, aswell
 as our associated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we attempt to plan for and have contingencies in place to address supply chain disruptions, our mitigation effortsmay not be successful or may h
ave further negative impacts on us.Our
 business has inherently dangerous work sites. If we fail to maintain safe work sites, we may experience workforce or customer injuries or loss of life, and be exposed to financial losses,including penalties and other liabiliti
es.Safety
 is a core value and a strategy at American Water. Our safety performance and progress to our ultimate desired goal of zero injuries are critical to our ability to carry out our operationseffectively
 and  to  serve  our  customers,  and  thereby,  to  support  our  reputation.  We  maintain  health  and  safety  practices  to  protect  our  employees,  customers,  contractors,  vendors  and  the  public.Eliminating
 all hazards all of the time is extremely challenging, but through strict adherence to our health and safety practices, and empowering employees to be safety leaders who are expected to stopwork if deemed “unsafe,” we be
lieve we can achieve an injury-free workplace.At
 our business sites, including construction and maintenance sites, our employees, contractors and others are often in close proximity to large mechanical operating equipment, moving vehicles,pressurized
 water, electric and gas utility lines, below grade trenches and vaults, electrical and pneumatic hazards, fall from height hazards, suspended loads, hazardous chemicals and other regulatedmaterials. On many sites, we 
are responsible for safety and, accordingly, must implement important safety procedures and practices above governmental regulatory requirements. As an essential businessthat
 must continue to provide water and wastewater services during the COVID-19 pandemic, we are focused on the health and safety of our employees, contractors, vendors, customers and others whowork
 at or visit our worksites. If the procedures we implement are ineffective or are not followed by our employees or others, or we fail to implement procedures, our employees, contractors and othersmay
 experience illness, or minor, serious or fatal injuries. Unsafe work sites have the potential to increase employee turnover, expose us to litigation and raise our operating costs. Any of the foregoingcould result in financi
al losses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.In
 addition, our operations can involve the delivery, handling, storage, use and disposal of hazardous chemicals, which, if improperly delivered, handled, stored, used or disposed of, could resultin
 serious injury, death, environmental damage or property damage, and could subject us to penalties or other liabilities. We are also subject to various environmental, transportation and occupationalhealth
 and  safety  regulations.  Although  we  maintain  functional  employee  groups  whose  primary  purpose  is  to  implement  effective  environmental  health  and  safety  work  procedures  and  practicesthroughout our organization, in
cluding construction sites and operating facilities, the failure to comply with these regulations or procedures could subject us to liability.Work stoppages and other labor relations matters could adv
ersely affect our results of operations and the ability to serve our customers.As
 of December 31, 2021, approximately 47% of our workforce was represented by unions, and we had 73 collective bargaining agreements in place with 14 different unions representing ourunionized
 employees. These collective bargaining agreements, 21 of which will expire during 2022, are subject to periodic renewal and renegotiation. We may not be able to successfully renew orrenegotiate
 these labor contracts, or enter into new agreements, on terms that are acceptable to us. Any negotiations or dispute resolution processes undertaken in connection with our labor contractscould
 be  delayed  or  affected  by  labor  actions  or  work  stoppages.  Labor  actions,  work  stoppages  or  the  threat  of  work  stoppages,  and  our  failure  to  obtain  favorable  labor  contract  terms  duringrenegotiations, may disrup
t our operations, negatively impact the ability to serve our customers, and result in higher labor costs, which could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, results ofoperations, cash flows and liquid
ity.36

Table of ContentsWhile
 we have developed contingency plans to be implemented as necessary if a work stoppage or strike does occur, a strike or work stoppage may have a material adverse impact on our financialposition, results of operat
ions and cash flows.Financial, Economic and Market-Related Risks
Our
 indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business, and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy ourliquidity needs.
As
 of December 31, 2021, our aggregate long-term and short-term debt balance (including preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements) was $11.0 billion, and our working capital(defined as current ass
ets less current liabilities) was in a deficit position. Our indebtedness could have important consequences, including:•
limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital requirements or capital expenditures;•
exposing us to interest rat e risk with respect to the portion of our indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates;•
limiting our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or make payments in connection with our other obligations;•
impairing our access to the capital markets for debt and equity;•
requiring  that an increasing portion of our cash flows from operations be dedicated to the payment of the principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for futureoperations, dividends on our common s
tock or capital expenditures;•
limiting our ability to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and to react to changes in market or industry conditions; and•
placing us at a competi tive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that have less debt.In
 order to meet our capital expenditure needs, we may be required to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facility or issue a combination of new short-term and long-term debtsecurities
 and/or equity. We continue to assess our short- and long-term liquidity needs in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial and capital markets, especially with respect tothe
 market for corporate commercial paper, which experienced volatility and shortages of liquidity in March 2020. In response to these events, in March 2020, we entered into a $750 million 364-dayterm
 loan facility and immediately executed a $500 million draw thereunder to support our short-term liquidity by retaining that amount in cash. We repaid this term loan facility in full in March 2021.During
 2021, we utilized other existing sources of liquidity, such as our current cash balances, cash flows from operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility as necessary or desirable tomeet
 our short-term liquidity requirements. We believe that existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future. However, as the impacts of theCOVID-19
 pandemic  on  the  economy,  the  financial  and  capital  markets  and  our  operations  continue  to  evolve,  we  will  continue  to  assess  our  liquidity  needs.  In  the  event  of  a  sustained  marketdeterioration, we may ne
ed to obtain additional sources of liquidity, which would require us to evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate actions.Moreover, additional
 borrowings may be required to repay or refinance outstanding indebtedness. Other than debt with respect to the term loan facility, debt maturities and sinking fund paymentsin
 2022, 2023 and 2024 will be $57 million, $280 million and $474 million, respectively. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to access the debt or equity capital markets on favorableterms,
 if at all, to repay or refinance this debt. Moreover, as new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks we now face could intensify, limiting our ability to repay or refinance existingdebt on favorable terms.
We
 have in the past entered into, and in the future may enter into, financial derivative instruments, including without limitation, interest rate swaps, forward starting swaps and U.S. Treasury lockagreements.
 See Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. However, these efforts may not be effective to fully mitigate interest rate risk, and may expose us to other risksand uncertainties,
 including quarterly “mark to market” valuation risk associated with these instruments, that could negatively and materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cashflows.
Our
 ability  to  pay  our  expenses  and  satisfy  our  debt  service  obligations  depends  in  significant  part  on  our  future  performance,  which  will  be  affected  by  the  financial,  business,  economic,competitive,
 legislative  (including tax initiatives  and reforms, and other similar  legislation  or regulation),  regulatory  and other risk factors  described  in this section, many of which are beyond ourcontrol.
 If we do not have sufficient cash flows to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, reduce capital investments, sellassets,
 borrow additional funds or sell additional equity. In addition, if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or if we are unable to incur indebtedness sufficient to enableus to fund our liquidity needs, we may be
 unable to plan for or respond to changes in our business, which could cause our financial condition, operating results and prospects to be affected materially andadversely.
37

Table of ContentsOur
 inability  to  access  the  debt  or  equity  capital  or  financial  markets  or  other  events  could  affect  our  ability  to  meet  our  liquidity  needs  at  reasonable  cost  and  our  ability  to  meet  long-termcommitments, which could adversely a
ffect our financial condition and results of operations.In
 addition to cash from operations, during 2021, we generally relied primarily on a $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, a $2.10 billion commercial paper program, our $750 million 364-dayterm
 loan facility (which expired and was repaid in full in March 2021) and the capital markets, to satisfy our liquidity needs. The revolving credit facility currently expires in accordance with its termsin
 March 2025. Historically, we have regularly used our commercial paper program rather than the revolving credit facility as a principal source of short-term borrowing due to the generally moreattractive
 rates  we  generally  could  obtain  in  the  commercial  paper  market.  As  of  December  31,  2021,  there  were  no  outstanding  borrowings  under  the  revolving  credit  facility,  $584  million  ofcommercial
 paper outstanding and $76 million in outstanding letters of credit. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to access this commercial paper program or revolving creditfacility, when, as and if des
ired, or that the amount of capital available thereunder will be sufficient to meet all of our liquidity needs at a reasonable, or any, cost.Under
 the terms of the revolving credit facility, our consolidated debt cannot exceed 70% of our consolidated capitalization, as determined under the terms of the facility. If our equity were todecline or
 debt were to increase to a level that causes us to exceed this limit, lenders under the facility would be entitled to refuse any further extension of credit and to declare all of the outstanding debtthereunder
 immediately due and payable. To avoid such a default, a waiver or renegotiation of this covenant would be required, which would likely increase funding costs and could result in additionalcovenants
 that  would  restrict  our  operational  and  financing  flexibility.  Our  ability  to  comply  with  this  and  other  covenants  contained  in  the  revolving  credit  facility  and  our  other  consolidatedindebtedness
 is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including events beyond our control. For example, events that could cause a reduction in equity include, without limitation, a significant write-down of our
 goodwill. Even if we are able to comply with this or other covenants, the limitations on our operational and financial flexibility could harm our business by, among other things, limiting ourability
 to incur indebtedness or reduce equity in connection with financings or other corporate opportunities that we may believe would be in our best interests or the interests of our shareholders tocomplete.
Disruptions
 in the capital markets or changes in our credit ratings could also limit our ability to access capital on terms favorable to us or at all. While the lending banks that participate in therevolving
 credit facility have to date honored their commitments under those facilities, disruptions in the credit markets, changes in our credit ratings, or deterioration of the banking industry’s financialcondition could
 discourage or prevent lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments, extending the terms of such commitments, or agreeing to new commitments. In such a case, we may notbe
 able to access the commercial paper or debt or capital markets, or other sources of potential liquidity, in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all. Furthermore, our inability to maintain, renew orreplace
 commitments under our revolving credit facility could materially increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Short- or long-termdisruptions
 in the capital and credit markets as a result of economic, legislative, political or other uncertainty, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in U.S. tax and other laws,reduced
 financing alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our business. Any significant disruption in the capital, debt orcredit
 markets, or financial institution failures could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the market stabilizes or until alternative financing can be arranged. Such measures could includedelaying
 or deferring capital expenditures, reducing or suspending dividend payments, and reducing other discretionary expenditures. Finally, there is no assurance that we will be able to access theequity markets to obtain 
capital or financing when necessary or desirable and on terms that are reasonable or acceptable to us.Any
 of  the  foregoing  events  that  impede  our  access  to  the  debt  or  equity  capital  markets,  or  the  failure  of  any  of  our  lenders  to  meet  their  commitments  that  result  from  financial  marketdisruptions,
 could expose us to increased interest expense, require us to institute cash conservation measures or otherwise adversely and materially affect our business, financial condition, results ofoperations, cash flows and liquid
ity.Parent company may be unable to meet i
ts ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream dividends or repay funds.Parent
 company is a holding company and, as such, it has no substantive operations of its own. Substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by subsidiaries. Parent company’s ability tomeet
 its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the net income and cash flows of its subsidiaries and their ability to pay upstream dividends or repayindebtedness
 to parent company. Prior to paying dividends to parent company, our regulated subsidiaries must comply with applicable regulatory restrictions and financial obligations, including, forexample,
 debt service and preferred and preference stock dividends, as well as applicable corporate, tax and other laws and regulations and agreements, and our covenants and other agreements. Oursubsidiaries
 are  separate  legal  entities  and  have  no  obligation  to  pay  or  upstream  dividends  to  parent  company.  A  failure  or  inability  of  any  of  these  subsidiaries  to  pay  such  dividends  or  repayintercompany obligations 
could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and parent company’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock and meet its other obligations.38

Table of ContentsWe may not be able to fully util
ize our state net operating loss carryforwards.As of
 December 31, 2021, we had state NOL carryforwards of approximately $123 million, and management believes it is more likely than not that these NOL carryforwards will be recovered inthe
 future. Our state NOL carryforwards began to expire in 2021 and will continue to expire through 2041. We have, in the past, been unable to utilize certain of our state NOL carryforwards, and theestablishment
 or increase of a valuation allowance in the future would reduce our deferred income tax assets and our net income. Our actual results may differ from those estimated by management inmaking
 its assessment as to our ability to use the state NOL carryforwards. If we are unable to fully utilize our state NOL carryforwards to offset taxable income generated in the future, our financialposition, results of operat
ions and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.We
 have recorded a significant amount of goodwill, and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets, causing us to record impairments that may negatively affect our results ofoperations.
Our total
 assets include $1.1 billion of goodwill at December 31, 2021. The goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisition of American Water by an affiliate of our previous owner in 2003.Goodwill
 represents the excess of the purchase price the purchaser paid over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is recorded at fair value on the date of anacquisition
 and is reviewed annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. As required by the applicable accounting rules, we have takensignificant non-cash
 charges to operating results for goodwill impairments in the past. We may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factorsrelated
 to our performance or the performance of an acquired business. These market conditions could include a decline over a period of time of our stock price, a decline over a period of time invaluation
 multiples  of  comparable  water  utilities,  market  price  performance  of  our  common  stock  that  compares  unfavorably  to  our  peer  companies,  decreases  in  control  premiums,  or  othercircumstances.
 A decline in the results forecasted in our business plan due to events such as changes in rate case results, capital investment budgets or interest rates, could also result in an impairmentcharge.
 Recognition of impairments of goodwill would result in a charge to income in the period in which the impairment occurred, which may negatively affect our financial condition, results ofoperations
 and total capitalization. The effects of any such impairment could be material and could make it more difficult to maintain our credit ratings, secure financing on attractive terms, maintaincompliance with debt coven
ants and meet the expectations of our regulators.Market
 volatility and other conditions may impact the value of benefit plan assets and liabilities, as well as assumptions related to the benefit plans, which may require us to provide significantadditional funding.
The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy significa
nt future obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans. The value ofthese
 assets is subject to market fluctuations and volatility, which may cause investment returns to fall below our projected return rates. We are currently unable to predict the effect, if any, of theCOVID-19 pandemic
 or other events on the valuation of our pension assets and liabilities. A decline in the market value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets as of the measurement datecan
 increase the funding requirements under our pension and postretirement benefit plans. Additionally, our pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates.Interest
 rates have experienced volatility and are subject to potential further adjustments based on the actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve, and others. If interest rates are lower at the measurement date,our liabilities would
 increase, potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements. Further, changes in assumptions, such as increases in life expectancy assumptions and increasing trends inhealth
 care costs may also increase our funding requirements. Future increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable in rates, in whichcase
 our results of operations and financial position could be negatively affected. In addition, market factors can affect assumptions we use in determining funding requirements with respect to ourpension
 and postretirement plans. For example, a relatively modest change in our assumptions regarding discount rates can materially affect our calculation of funding requirements. To the extent thatthe discount rate used in our 
assumptions is reduced, our benefit obligations could be materially increased, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Additional Risks Related to Market-Based Businesses
Parent company
 provides performance guarantees with respect to certain of the obligations of our Market-Based Businesses, including financial guarantees or deposits, which may adversely affectparent company if the guarantees are successfull
y enforced.Under
 the terms of certain agreements under which our Market-Based Businesses, primarily MSG, provide water and wastewater services to municipalities and federal governmental entities,parent
 company provides guarantees of specified performance obligations, including financial guarantees or deposits. In the event these obligations are not performed, the entity holding the guaranteesmay
 seek to enforce the performance commitments against parent company or proceed against the deposit. In that event, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could beadversely
 affected. At December 31, 2021, we had remaining performance commitments as measured by remaining contract revenue totaling approximately $6.2 billion related to MSG’s contracts, andthis amount
 is likely to increase if the number of military bases served by MSG increases. The presence of these commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and make it more difficult forus to secure financing on at
tractive terms.39

Table of ContentsMSG’s operations are subject to various risks associated wi
th doing business with the U.S. government.MSG
 enters into contracts with the U.S. government for the operation and maintenance of water and wastewater systems, which contracts may be terminated, in whole or in part, prior to the endof the 50-year term fo
r convenience of the U.S. government or as a result of default or non-performance by the subsidiary performing the contract. In addition, the contract price for each of these militarycontracts
 is typically subject to either an annual economic price adjustment, or a redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter. Annual economic priceadjustment
 is an inflation index-based contract price increase mechanism. Price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes incontract
 obligations and anticipated market conditions. Any early contract termination or unfavorable annual economic price adjustment or price redetermination could adversely affect our financialcondition, results of opera
tions and cash flows.Moreover,
 entering  into  contracts  with  the  U.S.  government  subjects  us  to  a  number  of  operational  and  compliance  risks,  including  dependence  on  the  level  of  government  spending  andcompliance
 with and changes in governmental procurement and security regulations. We are subject to potential government investigations of our business practices and compliance with governmentprocurement
 and security regulations, which are complex, and compliance with these regulations can be expensive and burdensome. If we were charged with wrongdoing as a result of an investigation,we
 could be suspended or debarred from bidding on or receiving awards of new contracts with the U.S. government or our existing contracts could be terminated, which could have a material adverseeffect on our results of op
erations and cash flows.General Risk Factors
New accounting standards or changes to existing accounting standards could materiall
y impact how we report our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.Our
 Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other authoritative bodies or governmental entities mayissue
 new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards that may require us to change our accounting policies or critical accounting estimates. These changes are beyond ourcontrol,
 can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how we report our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. We could be required to apply a new or revised standardretroactively, which cou
ld also adversely affect our previously reported results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.Undetected errors in internal controls and information repor
ting could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and noncompliant disclosure.Our
 internal controls, accounting policies and practices and internal information systems are designed to enable us to capture and process transactions and information in a timely and accuratemanner
 in compliance with GAAP, taxation requirements, federal securities laws and regulations and other laws and regulations applicable to us. We have also implemented corporate governance,internal
 control and accounting policies and procedures in connection with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) and relevant SEC rules, as well as other applicable regulations.Such
 internal controls and policies have been and continue to be closely monitored by our management and Board of Directors to ensure continued compliance with these laws, rules and regulations.Management
 is also responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting and is required to assess annually the effectiveness of these controls. While we believe thesecontrols,
 policies, practices and systems are adequate to verify data integrity, unanticipated or unauthorized actions of employees or temporary lapses in internal controls due to shortfalls in oversight orresource
 constraints could lead to undetected errors that could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and non-compliant disclosure and reporting. The consequences of these events could have anegative
 impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The inability of management to certify as to the effectiveness of these controls due to the identification of one or morematerial weaknesses in the
se controls could also harm our reputation, increase financing costs or adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets.Our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain and utiliz
e qualified personnel.The
 success  of  our  business  is  dependent  upon  our  ability  to  hire,  retain  and  utilize  qualified  personnel,  including  engineers,  licensed  operators,  water  quality  and  other  operating  and  craftpersonnel,
 and management professionals who have the required experience and expertise. From time to time, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in thetimeframe
 demanded for our business needs. In certain geographic areas, for example, we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retainqualified personnel.
In
 addition, as key personnel approach retirement age, we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans. If we cannot attract and retain qualifiedpersonnel or effectiv
ely implement appropriate succession plans, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely impacted.40

rsionsCompliance with SWRCB Orders to Reduce Carmel River Diversions
Under
 the 2009 Order, California-American Water Company, the Company’s California subsidiary (“Cal Am”) is required, among other things, to decrease significantly its yearly diversions ofwater
 from the Carmel River according to a set reduction schedule. See Item 1—Business—Regulated Businesses—Water Supply and Wastewater Services and Item 1A—Risk Factors. The 2009 Orderresponded
 to claims that Cal Am had not sufficiently implemented actions to terminate its unpermitted diversions of water from the Carmel River as required by a 1995 order of the SWRCB. In July2016, at the request of Cal Am and sev
eral Monterey County government agencies, the SWRCB issued the 2016 Order approving the 2021 Deadline.41

Table of Contents The
 2009 Order includes a condition prohibiting Cal Am from diverting water from the Carmel River for new service connections or for any increased use of water at existing service addressesresulting
 from a change in zoning or use. In 2011, the California Public Utilities Commission (the “CPUC”) issued a decision directing modifications in Cal Am’s tariffs to recognize the moratoriummandated
 by the 2009 Order, and directing Cal Am to seek written guidance from the SWRCB with respect to any unresolved issues of interpretation or implementation of this condition. In 2012, theDeputy
 Director of the SWRCB sent a letter to Cal Am providing an interpretation as to the calculation of a baseline to determine increases in use of water at existing service addresses. In March 2018,the
 MPWMD adopted a resolution directing Cal Am to interpret the baseline in a manner that conflicts with the SWRCB’s written interpretation. In May 2018, Cal Am notified the MPWMD and theSWRCB
 that it intends to seek declaratory relief concerning the conflicting regulatory interpretations under the 2009 Order. In an attempt to resolve these conflicting interpretations prior to seekingjudicial
 intervention, Cal Am has met with the MPWMD and the SWRCB several times. The SWRCB agreed to circulate revisions to its 2012 interpretive letter, which would be subject to a publiccomment
 period. Any failure to follow the MPWMD’s resolution or the SWRCB’s written interpretation, despite these conflicting interpretations, could potentially result in fines, penalties and otheractions against Cal Am.
Cal
 Am continues to work constructively with all appropriate agencies to provide necessary information in connection with obtaining required approvals for the Water Supply Project. However,there can be no
 assurance that the Water Supply Project in its current configuration will be completed on a timely basis, if ever. Beginning in January 2022, Cal Am expects to be able to comply with thediversion
 reduction requirements contained in the 2016 Order, but continued compliance with the diversion reduction requirements for 2023 and future years will depend on successful development ofalternate water supply sources sufficient
 to meet customer demand. The 2009 Order and the 2016 Order remain in effect until Cal Am certifies to the SWRCB, and the SWRCB concurs, that Cal Am hasobtained a permanent
 supply of water to substitute for past unauthorized Carmel River diversions. While the Company cannot currently predict the likelihood or result of any adverse outcome associatedwith
 these matters, further attempts to comply with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order in the future may result in material additional costs and obligations to Cal Am, including fines and penaltiesagainst Cal Am in the event of non
compliance with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order.Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project
CPUC Final Approval of Water Supply Project
Cal
 Am’s ability to move forward on the Water Supply Project is and has been subject to extensive administrative review by the CPUC and other government agencies, obtaining necessarypermits, and intervention from other parties. In Se
ptember 2016, the CPUC unanimously approved a final decision to authorize Cal Am to enter into a water purchase agreement for the GWR Project andto construct a pipeline 
and pump station facilities and recover up to the incurred $50 million in associated costs plus AFUDC, subject to meeting certain criteria.In
 July 2019, Cal Am notified the MPWMD and Monterey One Water (collectively, the “Agencies”) that an event of default occurred under the water purchase agreement for the GWR Projectbecause the Agencies fai
led to deliver to Cal Am by July 1, 2019 advanced treated recycled water produced by the GWR Project. In its notification to the Agencies, Cal Am expressly reserved its right toterminate
 the water purchase agreement until the Performance Start Date, which was September 1, 2020. As of June 30, 2021, Cal Am determined that the Agencies met their performance obligationsunder the water purchase ag
reement with respect to the first fiscal year of the contract.In September
 2018, the CPUC unanimously approved another final decision finding that the Water Supply Project meets the CPUC’s requirements for a CPCN and an additional procedural phasewas not
 necessary to consider alternative projects. The CPUC’s 2018 decision concludes that the Water Supply Project is the best project to address estimated future water demands in Monterey, and, inaddition
 to the cost recovery  approved  in its 2016 decision,  adopts Cal Am’s cost estimates  for the Water  Supply Project,  which amounted  to an aggregate  of $279 million  plus AFUDC at a raterepresentative
 of Cal Am’s actual financing costs. The 2018 final decision specifies the procedures for recovery of all of Cal Am’s prudently incurred costs associated with the Water Supply Projectupon
 its completion, subject to the frameworks included in the final decision related to cost caps, O&M costs, financing, ratemaking and contingency matters. The reasonableness of the Water SupplyProject
 costs  will  be  reviewed  in  the  first  general  rate  case  filed  by  Cal  Am  after  it  becomes  operational.  Cal  Am  is  also  required  to  implement  mitigation  measures  to  avoid,  minimize  or  offsetsignificant
 environmental impacts from the construction and operation of the Water Supply Project and comply with a mitigation monitoring and reporting program, a reimbursement agreement forCPUC
 costs associated with that program, and reporting requirements on plant operations following placement of the Water Supply Project in service. Cal Am has incurred $186 million in aggregatecosts as of December 31, 2021 rel
ated to the Water Supply Project, which includes $47 million in AFUDC.42

Table of Contents In
 September 2021, Cal Am, Monterey One Water and the MPWMD reached an agreement on Cal Am’s purchase of additional water from the expansion to the GWR Project, which is notexpected
 to  produce  additional  water  until  2024  at  the  earliest.  The  amended  and  restated  water  purchase  agreement  for  the  GWR  Project  is  subject  to  review  and  approval  of  the  CPUC,  and  onNovember 29, 2021, Cal Am filed an appli
cation with the CPUC seeking review and approval of the amended and restated water purchase agreement. Cal Am is also requesting rate base treatment of theadditional
 capital investment for certain Cal Am facilities required to maximize the water supply from the expansion to the GWR Project and a related Aquifer Storage and Recovery Project, totalingapproximately
 $81  million.  This  amount  is  in  addition  to,  and  consistent  in  regulatory  treatment  with,  the  prior  $50  million  of  recovery  for  facilities  associated  with  the  original  water  purchaseagreement, which was approved by th
e CPUC in its 2016 final decision.While Cal Am believes that its expenditures to date ha
ve been prudent and necessary to comply with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order, as well as the CPUC’s 2016 and 2018 final decisions, CalAm cannot currently predict its
 ability to recover all of its costs and expenses associated with the Water Supply Project and there can be no assurance that Cal Am will be able to recover all of such costsand
 expenses  in  excess  of  the  $50  million  in  construction  costs  previously  approved  by  the  CPUC  in  its  2016  final  decision.  See  Note  17—Commitments  and  Contingencies  in  the  Notes  to  theConsolidated Financial State
ments for further discussion.Coastal Development Permit Application
In
 June 2018, Cal Am submitted a coastal development permit application to the City of Marina (the “City”) for those project components of the Water Supply Project located within the City’scoastal zone. Members
 of the City’s Planning Commission, as well as City councilpersons, have publicly expressed opposition to the Water Supply Project. In May 2019, the City issued a notice of finallocal
 action based upon the denial by the Planning Commission of Cal Am’s coastal development permit application. Thereafter, Cal Am appealed this decision to the Coastal Commission, as permittedunder
 the City’s code and the California Coastal Act. At the same time, Cal Am submitted an application to the Coastal Commission for a coastal development permit for those project componentslocated
 within  the  Coastal  Commission’s  original  jurisdiction.  In  October  2019,  staff  of  the  Coastal  Commission  issued  a  report  recommending  a  denial  of  Cal  Am’s  application  for  a  coastaldevelopment permit with respect to the Water Supply 
Project, largely based on a memorandum prepared by the general manager of the MPWMD that contradicted findings made by the CPUC in its finaldecision
 approving  the  Water  Supply  Project.  In  November  2019,  discussions  between  staffs  of  the  Coastal  Commission  and  the  CPUC  took  place  regarding  the  Coastal  Commission  staffrecommendation,
 at which time the CPUC raised questions about the Coastal Commission staff’s findings on water supply and demand, groundwater impacts and the viability of a project that theCoastal Commission staff bel
ieves may be a possible alternative to the Water Supply Project.In
 August 2020, the staff of the Coastal Commission released a report again recommending denial of Cal Am’s application for a coastal development permit. Although the report concluded thatthe Water Supply Project would have a negligible impact
 on groundwater resources, the report also concluded it would impact other coastal resources, such as environmentally sensitive habitat areas andwetlands, and that the
 Coastal Commission staff believes that a feasible alternative project exists that would avoid those impacts. The staff’s report also noted disproportionate impacts to communities ofconcern.
 In September 2020, Cal Am withdrew its original jurisdiction application to allow additional time to address the Coastal Commission staff’s environmental justice concerns. The withdrawal ofthe
 original jurisdiction application did not impact Cal Am’s appeal of the City’s denial, which remains pending before the Coastal Commission. Cal Am refiled the original jurisdiction application inNovember 2020. In December 2020, the Coast
al Commission sent to Cal Am a notice of incomplete application, identifying certain additional information needed to consider the application complete.In
 March 2021, Cal Am provided responses to the Coastal Commission’s notice of incomplete application. On June 18, 2021, the Coastal Commission responded, acknowledging the responsesand
 requesting certain additional information before the application could be considered complete. Cal Am responded with the requested additional information on January 11, 2022, and on February 8,2022, the Coastal Commission request
ed additional information. The original jurisdiction application remains pending.43

Table of Contents Desalination Plant Development Permit
The
 proposed desalination plant for the Water Supply Project is to be located in an unincorporated portion of Monterey County, California on a site owned by CEMEX, Inc. (“CEMEX”), andrequires
 a combined development permit from the County of Monterey prior to commencement of construction. On April 24, 2019, the County’s Planning Commission voted to approve the permit. InJuly 2019,
 the Board of Supervisors heard appeals filed by MCWD and a public advocacy group, at which time it denied the appeals and approved the permit. In August 2019, MCWD filed a petition inMonterey
 County Superior Court challenging Monterey County’s approval of Cal Am’s combined development permit application and seeking injunctive relief to enjoin Monterey County and Cal Amfrom
 commencing construction of the desalination plant. In October 2019, after a hearing, the court denied, without prejudice, MCWD’s motion for a preliminary injunction, but issued a stay of theCounty’s
 approval of the combined development permit, precluding commencement of physical construction of the desalination plant, but allowing Cal Am to continue to obtain permits needed for thedesalination
 plant’s  construction.  On  January  21,  2021,  the  court  issued  its  decision  granting  in  part  and  denying  in  part  MCWD’s  petition.  The  court  found  that  the  County  of  Monterey  did  notcompletely comply
 with all of the requirements necessary to approve the combined development permit and set aside its approval so that the County could come into compliance. The court denied all ofMCWD’s other claims. The court 
also lifted its stay on physical construction at the plant site.On
 May 25, 2021, Cal Am filed a notice of appeal as to the Monterey County Superior Court’s January  21, 2021 decision, seeking to challenge  the court’s  decision on Monterey County’sstatement
 of overriding considerations. Monterey County filed a notice of appeal as to the same issue on May 26, 2021. On June 22, 2021, MCWD filed cross-appeals on its claims that had been deniedby the court.
Proposed Zoning Changes at CEMEX Site for Slant Wells
In
 August 2018, the City circulated a public review draft of proposed amendments to its local coastal program and zoning ordinance, and placed the matter for consideration on the PlanningCommission’s
 agenda for its September 2018 meeting. The proposed amendments would change zoning at the CEMEX site to open space and restrict future uses, including with respect to Cal Am’splanned
 use of the site for the slant wells for the Water Supply Project. Any change to the City’s local coastal program must ultimately be approved by the Coastal Commission. Cal Am, CEMEX andthe
 Coastal Commission each submitted letters opposing the proposed amendments. At its November 2018 meeting, the Planning Commission adopted a resolution recommending that the Marina CityCouncil consider approving the a
mendments.In
 December 2018, the Marina City Council considered the proposed amendments. Cal Am, CEMEX and the Coastal Commission again submitted letters opposing the proposed changes, but theCity
 Council unanimously adopted a resolution amending its local coastal plan and a draft amendment to its zoning ordinance. Changes to the ordinance require a second reading before becoming final,which
 occurred at the City’s December 2018 meeting. The changes to the local coastal plan must be submitted to the Coastal Commission for approval and are not effective until such approval isobtained.
Test Slant Well Permitting
A preliminary
 step to building the Water Supply Project desalination plant is the construction and operation of a test slant well to confirm the suitability of the property on which intake wells willbe
 located to draw water from under Monterey Bay. In November 2014, the Coastal Commission approved coastal development permits for the test slant well, enabling Cal Am to construct and operatethe
 test slant well. Because Cal Am may use the test slant well as one of the slant wells for the Water Supply Project, Cal Am sought and obtained from the Coastal Commission permit amendments toallow
 the test slant well to remain in place and be maintained until February 23, 2023. A required lease obtained from the California State Lands Commission, as amended, will expire on December 16,2022. Effective February 28, 2018, tes
t slant well pumping ceased, except for minimal maintenance pumping activities, in accordance with Cal Am’s coastal development permits.44

Table of Contents Water Supply Project Land Acquisit
ion and Slant Well Site UseIn
 July 2017, the Coastal Commission adopted a consent agreement and cease and desist order requiring sand mining operations on the property owned by CEMEX on which intake wells for theWater Supply Project will be
 located, to cease by the end of 2020 and the property to be sold to either a non-profit or governmental entity. The consent agreement strictly limits future use of the propertybut preserves Cal Am’s existing pro
perty rights and allows uses consistent with existing easements and other rights of record. A permanent easement granted by CEMEX to Cal Am was recorded in June2018
 to  allow  Cal  Am  access  to  the  property  and  to  construct,  operate  and  maintain  the  Water  Supply  Project  intake  wells.  On  November  26,  2019,  the  City  notified  CEMEX  that,  based  on  thispermanent
 easement and Cal Am’s proposed use of the site for the intake wells, CEMEX has breached or will soon breach a prior 1996 annexation agreement (to which Cal Am was not a party). TheCity
 states that it intends to seek declaratory relief from CEMEX and Cal Am ordering that Cal Am’s extraction is limited to 500 acre-feet per year of groundwater, that Cal Am cannot export extractedwater
 out of the basin, and that the permanent easement granted by CEMEX to Cal Am is void. CEMEX has denied the City’s claims and requested indemnification from Cal Am under the terms of thepermanent
 easement.  Cal  Am  and  CEMEX  believe  that  there  is  no  valid  limitation  under  the  annexation  agreement  on  Cal  Am’s  right  to  pump  brackish  groundwater  and  seawater  at  the  site  fordesalination and use by Cal Am’s cus
tomers.In
 May 2020, the City filed a lawsuit in Monterey County Superior Court, naming Cal Am and CEMEX as defendants, and MCWRA and MCWD as real parties in interest. The lawsuit, asamended,
 alleges a claim for breach of contract against CEMEX and seeks declaratory relief to void the permanent easement and prohibiting extraction of water by Cal Am’s slant wells at the CEMEXsite
 in excess of 500 acre-feet per year and the export of such water outside the groundwater basin. In November 2020, Cal Am, CEMEX and MCWRA filed demurrers, which were overruled by thecourt at a hearing held on Feb
ruary 9, 2021.In
 August 2020, MCWD filed a cross-complaint in the May 8, 2020 lawsuit against Cal Am, CEMEX and MCWRA, alleging claims for specific performance of certain provisions of the 1996annexation
 agreement related to the property owned by CEMEX on which intake wells for the Water Supply Project will be located, as well as claims of water rights, nuisance and unreasonable wateruse,
 and seeking additional declaratory relief. Following various rulings on demurrers filed by Cal Am, CEMEX and MCWRA, on February 23, 2021, the court sustained, without leave to amend, thedemurrer to
 MCWD’s nuisance claim and overruled the remainder of the demurrers. On October 7, 2021, the court granted a motion filed by Cal Am related to MCWD’s cross-complaint, which motionrequested a referr
al of certain issues related to MCWD’s water rights and unreasonable use claims to the SWRCB for its expert advisory opinion.Challenges Related to Compliance with Cali
fornia’s Sustainable Groundwater Management ActUnder California’s Sustainable Gr
oundwater Management Act (“SGMA”) enacted in 2015, groundwater basins designated by the state as critically overdrafted must be managed by a groundwatersustainability agency
 (“GSA”) by 2020 in accordance with an approved groundwater sustainability plan (“GSP”) designed to achieve sustainability by 2040. Under the SGMA, GSAs have broad powersto
 achieve sustainability including, but not limited to, regulating groundwater extraction by imposing fees on groundwater extractions and controlling groundwater extractions by regulating, limiting orsuspending
 extractions from wells. The 400-acre CEMEX site overlies a small portion of the 180/400 Subbasin of the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin; the 84,000-acre 180/400 Subbasin has beendesignated by the state as 
critically overdrafted, mainly due to seawater intrusion into the subbasin.In
 late 2016, the Salinas Valley Basin Groundwater Sustainability Agency (the “SVBGSA”) was formed as a joint powers authority to become the GSA for the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basinand
 prepare a GSP. In April 2018, the City filed a notice to become the GSA for the CEMEX site, creating an overlap with the SVBGSA’s filing for the 180/400 Subbasin. In 2016, the SVBGSAcommenced
 preparation of a GSP covering the entire 180/400 subbasin, including the CEMEX site, but in August 2019 the City filed a notice that it intends to prepare its own GSP for the CEMEX sitewith
 the intent to severely limit or prohibit groundwater pumping at that site. The State Department of Water Resources (“SDWR”) has taken the position that until the overlap is resolved, it will notaccept the
 GSP from either agency, placing the subbasin at risk of being placed in a probationary status and subject to state management. In December 2019, the County of Monterey filed its own noticeto
 become the exclusive GSA at the CEMEX site in order to resolve the overlap, which is permitted under SGMA. SDWR accepted Monterey County’s filing on December 18, 2019, and now listsMonterey County as the exclusive GSA for th
e site.45

Table of Contents On
 December 30, 2019, the City filed a lawsuit in Monterey County Superior Court challenging Monterey County’s filing, and SDWR’s acceptance of the filing, as the exclusive GSA for theCEMEX
 site. The City has named Monterey County and its Board of Supervisors, its GSA, and SDWR and its director as defendants, and the SVBGSA and its Board of Directors as real parties. TheCity
 seeks to invalidate Monterey County’s filing, as well as injunctive relief to preserve the City’s status as a GSA for the site. To protect its interest in the matter, Cal Am filed an application tointervene
 in this lawsuit, which was granted. Monterey County filed cross-claims against the City and SDWR. After a hearing, on August 24, 2021, the court denied the claims brought by the City andgranted
 Monterey  County’s  cross-claims,  finding  that  the  City’s  GSA notice  was  untimely,  the  Monterey  County  GSA was  the  exclusive  GSA for  the  CEMEX site,  and  the  SVBGSA’s GSP wasproperly
 adopted for the entire 180/400 subbasin, including the CEMEX site. On November 15, 2021, the City appealed this decision, and on December 13, 2021, Monterey County appealed the court’sdecision as to the finding th
at the City’s action creating a GSA was not void.On
 September  14,  2020,  Cal  Am  filed  a  separate  but  related  complaint  in  Monterey  County  Superior  Court  challenging  the  validity  of  actions  taken  by  the  City  and  its  GSA in  adopting  agroundwater
 sustainability plan for the CEMEX site, and the validity of the provisions of such plan. Due to the overlap of issues in the City’s lawsuit with those in the validation action, the partiesstipulated to a stay of th
e validation action pending determination of the claims in the City’s action, which was approved by the court in December 2020.On
 February 16, 2021, the City filed a separate but related in  rem reverse  validation complaint challenging the adoption by Monterey County of a GSP for the CEMEX site. This complaintremains pending. Currently, both v
alidation actions remain stayed during the pendency of the City’s appeals.Challenge of Certification — Proposed Monter
ey System Acquisition Final Environmental Impact ReportIn
 November  2018,  voters  in  Monterey,  California  passed  “Measure  J,”  which  decided  that  the  MPWMD  should  conduct  a  feasibility  study  concerning  the  potential  purchase  of  Cal  Am’sMonterey
 system assets, and, if feasible, to proceed with a purchase of those assets without an additional public vote. This service territory represents approximately 40,000 customers. See Item 1—Business—Regulated
 Businesses—Condemnation and Eminent Domain for more information on this matter. In August 2019, the MPWMD’s General Manager issued a report that recommends that theMPWMD
 board, among other things, (1) evaluate whether the acquisition of the Monterey system assets by the MPWMD is in the public interest and sufficiently satisfies the criterion of “feasible” asprovided in
 Measure J, (2) ensure there is significant potential for cost savings before agreeing to commence an acquisition, and (3) develop more fully alternate operating plans before deciding whetherto consider a Resolution of Necess
ity.On
 October 7, 2020, the MPWMD issued a FEIR for the potential acquisition of the Monterey system assets, and on November 4, 2020, the MPWMD certified the FEIR, which purports toanalyze
 the environmental impacts of the MPWMD’s project to (1) acquire the Monterey system assets through the power of eminent domain, if necessary, and (2) expand its geographic boundaries toinclude
 all  parts  of  this  system.  On  November  25,  2020,  Cal  Am  filed  a  petition  for  writ  of  mandate  in  Monterey  County  Superior  Court  challenging  certification  of  the  FEIR,  alleging  that  theMPWMD’s
 analysis of environmental impacts was inadequate and that certification was improper. A hearing on the matter was held on August 30, 2021, and on November 19, 2021, the court deniedCal Am’s petition.

On the
 evening of June 23, 2015, a 36-inch pre-stressed concrete transmission water main, installed in the early 1970s, failed. The water main is part of the West Relay pumping station located inthe City of Dunbar, West Virginia 
and owned by West Virginia-American Water Company, the Company’s West Virginia subsidiary (“WVAWC”). The failure of the main caused water outages and lowpressure for
 up to approximately 25,000 WVAWC customers. In the early morning hours of June 25, 2015, crews completed a repair, but that same day, the repair developed a leak. On June 26, 2015, asecond
 repair was completed and service was restored that day to approximately 80% of the impacted customers, and to the remaining approximately 20% by the next morning. The second repairshowed signs of leaking but the 
water main was usable until June 29, 2015 to allow tanks to refill. The system was reconfigured to maintain service to all but approximately 3,000 customers while a finalrepair was being complet
ed safely on June 30, 2015. Water service was fully restored on July 1, 2015 to all customers affected by this event.46

 June 2, 2017, a complaint captioned Jeffries,  et al. v. West Virginia-American Water Company was  filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in Kanawha County on behalf of an alleged class ofresidents
 and business owners who lost water service or pressure as a result of the Dunbar main break. The complaint alleges breach of contract by WVAWC for failure to supply water, violation ofWest
 Virginia law regarding the sufficiency of WVAWC’s facilities and negligence by WVAWC in the design, maintenance and operation of the water system. The Jeffries  plaintiffs  seek unspecifiedalleged
 damages on behalf of the class for lost profits, annoyance and inconvenience, and loss of use, as well as punitive damages for willful, reckless and wanton behavior in not addressing the risk ofpipe failure and a la
rge outage.In
 February 2020, the Jeffries  plaintiffs  filed a motion seeking class certification on the issues of breach of contract and negligence, and to determine the applicability of punitive damages and amultiplier
 for those damages if imposed. In July 2020, the Circuit Court entered an order granting the Jeffries  plaintiffs’  motion for certification of a class regarding certain liability issues but denyingcertification
 of a class to determine a punitive damages multiplier. In August 2020, WVAWC filed a Petition for Writ of Prohibition in the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia seeking to vacateor
 remand the Circuit Court’s order certifying the issues class. On January 28, 2021, the Supreme Court of Appeals remanded the case back to the Circuit Court for further consideration in light of adecision
 issued in another case relating to the class certification issues raised on appeal. On July 16, 2021, oral argument was heard by the Circuit Court on the issue of addressing the Supreme Court ofAppeals’ remand. This matt

 Company and WVAWC believe that WVAWC has meritorious defenses to the claims raised in this class action complaint and WVAWC will continue to vigorously defend itself againstthese allegations.
Chattanooga, Tennessee Class Action Litigation
On
 September 12, 2019, Tennessee-American Water Company, the Company’s Tennessee subsidiary (“TAWC”), experienced a leak in a 36-inch water transmission main, which caused servicefluctuations
 or interruptions to TAWC customers and the issuance of a boil water notice. TAWC repaired the main by early morning on September 14, 2019, and restored full water service by theafternoon of September 15, 2019, with 
the boil water notice lifted for all customers on September 16, 2019.On
 September 17, 2019, a complaint captioned Bruce,  et al. v. American Water Works Company, Inc., et al. was  filed in the Circuit Court of Hamilton County, Tennessee against TAWC, theCompany and Service Company (colle
ctively, the “Tennessee-American Water Defendants”), on behalf of a proposed class of individuals or entities who lost water service or suffered monetary losses asa
 result of the Chattanooga incident (the “Tennessee Plaintiffs”). The complaint alleged breach of contract and negligence against the Tennessee-American Water Defendants, as well as an equitableremedy
 of piercing the corporate veil. In the complaint as originally filed, the Tennessee Plaintiffs were seeking an award of unspecified alleged damages for wage losses, business and economic losses,out-of-pocket
 expenses, loss of use and enjoyment of property and annoyance and inconvenience, as well as punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and pre- and post-judgment interest. In September 2020,the
 court dismissed all of the Tennessee Plaintiffs’ claims in their complaint, except for the breach of contract claims against TAWC, which remain pending. In October 2020, TAWC answered thecomplaint, and the part
ies have been engaging in discovery. The court has entered an agreed scheduling order, which sets a hearing in October 2022 to address the question of class certification.TAWC and the Company believe that TAWC has m

 connection with the sale of the HOS operations to the Buyer (including all of the Company’s equity interests in AWR), the Company, AWR and the Buyer entered into a Common Interest andCooperation
 Agreement (the “Cooperation Agreement”), dated as of the Closing Date, which facilitates a common defense for, and the sharing of information concerning, the EDNY investigation andany legal or
 regulatory inquiries or proceedings related to or resulting from it or the subject matter in the subpoena (collectively, the “Covered Matters”). The Company, on behalf of AWR, is required todefend
 any Covered Matter, using commercially reasonable efforts to resolve it on a reasonably expedient basis. Further, the Company is required to consult with the Buyer in specified circumstancesand
 obtain its prior written consent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before entering into any resolution of any Covered Matter that imposes non-monetaryprovisions
 or undertakings or any other terms for which there will be no indemnification under the Cooperation Agreement. In addition, for the period from the Closing Date to March 9, 2025, theCompany
 is required to indemnify the Buyer for any monetary losses or out-of-pocket damages (as described in the Cooperation Agreement) incurred by the Buyer or certain of the HOS subsidiaries tothe extent directly 
arising in connection with, or directly resulting from, any Covered Matter.47

American
 Water continues to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and has taken steps since the beginning of the pandemic to mitigate adverse impacts to the Company. The Company has threemain
 areas of focus as part of its response to COVID-19: the care and safety of its employees; the safety of its customers and the communities it serves; and the execution of its business continuity plan.American
 Water continues to work with its vendors to prevent disruptions in its supply chain, and, at this time, has not experienced, and does not anticipate, any material disruptions. The Company alsocontinues to monitor the i
mpacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the capital markets, including impacts that could increase its cost of capital.The
 Company has experienced financial impacts since the beginning of the pandemic resulting from lower revenues from the suspension of late fees and foregone reconnect fees in certain states,certain
 incremental O&M expenses, an increase in uncollectible accounts expense and additional debt costs. These impacts are collectively referred to as “financial impacts.” See Note 3—Impact of theCOVID-19 Pandemic in the
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may further impact American Water, including withoutlimitation, its liqu
idity, financial condition, and results of operations, will depend on future developments, which presently cannot be predicted.50

California’s Catastrophi c Event Memorandum Account allows the Company’s California subsidiary to track certainfinancial impacts 
related to the COVID-19 pandemic for future recovery requests. Iowa issued a base rate case order onJune 28, 2021, authorizing recovery 
in rates of the COVID-19 financial impacts deferred within its annual non-recurringexpense rider. Illinois h
as authorized cost recovery of the COVID-19 financial impacts through a special purpose rider overa 24-month period, which was imple
mented effective October 1, 2020. Additionally, Illinois approved a bad debt ridertariff on December 16, 2020, a
llowing collection of actual bad debt expense over last authorized beginning April 2021through February 2023. Illinois approv
ed a stipulation in March 2021 to allow the rider to be extended through the end of2023. Missouri issued a base rate 
case order on April 7, 2021, authorizing recovery in rates of the COVID-19 financialimpacts deferred th
rough March 31, 2021 over a three-year period.CA, IA, IL, MOThe
 Company’s Pennsylvania subsidiary filed for a request with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (the “PaPUC”) to defer as a regulatory asset all identified COVID-19 financialimpacts. On
 September 15, 2021, the PaPUC issued an order approving the Company’s request to defer, with carrying costs, incremental uncollectible expense and other incremental costs net of savingsattributed
 to the COVID-19 pandemic. The PaPUC order denied the request to include lost revenues attributed to the waiver of late fees and reconnect fees and expenses associated with additionalinterest
 costs. Additionally, the PaPUC order approved the request to allow for the continuation of the deferral of financial impacts, rejecting proposals from the intervening parties to define an end dateto
 the deferral in 2021. As a result of the order discussed above, the Company recorded a net $7 million reduction to its regulatory assets and corresponding impacts to revenue, interest expense anduncollectible expense du
ring the third quarter of 2021. The Company continues to evaluate options within its next base rate case to address these denied items and the resulting financial impact.On
 July 28, 2021, the Company’s Tennessee subsidiary filed a stipulation and settlement agreement with the Consumer Advocate Unit in the Financial Division of the Office of the TennesseeAttorney
 General, which reflected agreement on the deferral of COVID-19-related financial impacts through April 30, 2021. On August 9, 2021, the Tennessee Public Utility Commission denied thestipulation
 and  settlement  agreement  and  moved  to  address  the  Company’s  Tennessee  subsidiary’s  petition  to  defer  the  COVID-19  financial  impacts  in  a  future  hearing.  On  August  26,  2021,  theCompany’s Tennessee subsidiary fi
led a motion to withdraw its pending petition, preserving its right to seek recovery of the COVID-19 financial impacts in a future proceeding.In December 2020, the Kentucky Public Se
rvice Commission issued an order denying a request to defer to a regulatory asset the financial impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic.Consistent
 with these regulatory orders, the Company has recorded $36 million in regulatory assets and $6 million of regulatory liabilities for the financial impacts related to the COVID-19pandemic on the Consolidated Bal
ance Sheets as of December 31, 2021.As
 of February 16, 2022, one state, New Jersey, continues moratoria until March 15, 2022, on the suspension of service disconnections due to non-payment. The moratoria on disconnects haveexpired in 12 states. The Company con
tinues to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and will continue to comply with the current ordered moratoria and any future moratoria implemented.In
 2019, the Company completed and submitted its project completion certification to the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (“NJEDA”) in connection with its capital investment inits
 corporate headquarters in Camden, New Jersey. The NJEDA determined that the Company is qualified to receive $164 million in tax credits over a ten-year period. The Company is required to meetvarious
 annual requirements in order to monetize one-tenth of the tax credits annually and is subject to a claw-back period if the Company does not meet certain NJEDA requirements of the tax creditprogram in years 11 through 15
. The Company has made the necessary annual filings for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 and expects to make the 2021 filing by April 30, 2022. As a result,the
 Company  had  receivables  of  $49  million  and  $115  million  in  other  current  assets  and  other  long-term  assets,  respectively,  on  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets  as  of  December  31,  2021.  Thesubmitted filings are und
er review by the NJEDA and it is expected that the Company will receive final NJEDA approval and monetize the credits in the first half of 2022.51

 March  2020,  in  connection  with  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  NJEDA,  pursuant  to  Executive  Order  103  -  State  of  Emergency  and  a  Public  Health  Emergency,  temporarily  waived  therequirement
 that a full-time employee must spend at least 80% of his or her time at the qualified business facility (“QBF”) to meet the definition of eligible position or full-time job. The waiver willcontinue
 for as long as New Jersey’s Executive Order 281 is valid. On July 2, 2021, New Jersey’s Governor approved a bill that revised provisions of the Economic Recovery Act of 2020 and othereconomic
 development programs, including amending the definition of an eligible position and full-time job in the Grow New Jersey Program and replacing the 80% requirement of time spent at theQBF.
 The bill states that an eligible position is one that is filled by a full-time employee who has their primary office at the QBF and spends at least 60% of their time at the QBF. The bill specificallystates that it supersed
es the existing regulations and existing incentive agreements that require an eligible employee spend at least 80% of their time at the QBF.Sale of Homeowner Services Group
On
 the Closing Date, the Company sold all of the equity interests in subsidiaries that comprised HOS to the Buyer for total consideration of approximately $1.275 billion, resulting in a pre-taxgain on sale of $748 million. The consideration is comprised of $480 million in cash, a seller promissory note issued by the Buyer in the principal amount of $720 million, and a
 contingent cash paymentof
 $75 million payable upon satisfaction of certain conditions on or before December 31, 2023. The structure of the transaction enables the initial cash proceeds to be redeployed into the RegulatedBusinesses to fund
 near-term incremental capital investments, while interest on the seller note provides a stream of earnings during its term. Upon maturity, the proceeds from the repayment of the sellernote are expected to be us
ed to fund capital investment in the Regulated Businesses. This sale narrowed the focus of the Company’s Market-Based Businesses primarily to MSG.The
 seller note has a five-year term, is payable in cash, and bears interest at a rate of 7.00% per year during the term. The repayment obligations of the Buyer under the seller note have beensecured by a first
 priority security interest in certain property of the Buyer and the former HOS subsidiaries, including their cash and securities accounts, as well as a pledge of the equity interests in eachof those
 subsidiaries, subject to certain limitations and exceptions. The seller note requires compliance with affirmative and negative covenants (subject to certain conditions, limitations and exceptions),including a covenant lim
iting the incurrence by the Buyer and certain affiliates of additional indebtedness in excess of certain thresholds, but does not include any financial maintenance covenants.Beginning
 December 9, 2024, the Company has a put right pursuant to which it may require the seller note to be repaid in full at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, except that upon theoccurrence
 of a disruption event in the broadly syndicated term loan “B” debt financing market, repayment by the Buyer pursuant to the Company’s exercise of the put right will be delayed until themarket disruption event 
ends.The
 seller note may not be prepaid at the Buyer’s election except in certain limited circumstances before the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date. If the Buyer seeks to repay the seller note inbreach
 of this non-call provision, an event of default will occur under the seller note and the Company may, among other actions, demand repayment in full together with a premium ranging from105.5% to 107.5% of the outstanding prin
cipal amount of the loan and a customary “make-whole” payment.The
 Company and the Buyer also entered into a revenue share agreement, pursuant to which the Company is to receive 10% of the revenue generated from customers who are billed for homewarranty
 services through an applicable Company subsidiary (an “on-bill” arrangement), and 15% of the revenue generated from any future on-bill arrangements entered into after the closing. Unlessearlier termin
ated, this agreement has a term of up to 15 years, which may be renewed for up to two five-year periods.Financing Activities
On May 10, 2021, 
American Water  Capital Corp. (“AWCC”) completed a  $1.1 billion debt offering, which included the sale of $550 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.30% senior notesdue
 2031 and $550 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.25% senior notes due 2051. Net proceeds of this offering were used to lend funds to parent company and its regulated subsidiaries, toprepay
 $327 million in aggregate principal amount of AWCC’s outstanding senior notes, to repay AWCC’s commercial paper obligations and for general corporate purposes. See Note 12—Long-TermDebt in the Notes to Consolidated Financ
ial Statements for additional information.As
 a result of AWCC’s prepayment  of the various senior notes, a make-whole  premium  of $15 million  was paid to the holders thereof  on June 14, 2021. Substantially  all of the early debtextinguishment costs were a
llocable to the Company’s utility subsidiaries and recorded as regulatory assets, as the Company believes they are probable of recovery in future rates.52

For
 the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, diluted earnings per share (GAAP) were $6.95, $3.91 and $3.43, respectively. In 2021, as compared to 2020, diluted earnings per shareincreased
 $3.04.  This  increase  was  primarily  driven  by  a  pre-tax  gain  on  sale  of  $748  million  relating  to  the  sale  of  HOS  and  continued  growth  in  the  Regulated  Businesses  from  infrastructureinvestment, acquisitions and
 organic growth. These increases were offset by the $45 million pre-tax contribution to the AWCF authorized by the Company in 2021, and the impacts from weather in both2021
 and 2020, which had an estimated net decrease of $13 million in revenues in 2021, or $0.05 per share. The consolidated net income impact of the gain on sale of HOS and the AWCF contributionis
 $491 million, or $2.70 per share, inclusive of a $13 million net income benefit included in the Other segment, from the revaluation of state net operating losses that can now be utilized as a result ofthe sale.
Growth Through Capital Investment in Infrastructure and Regulated Acquisitions
The
 Company expects to continue to grow its businesses, with the majority of its growth to be achieved in the Regulated Businesses through (i) continued capital investment in the Company’sinfrastructure
 to provide safe, clean, reliable and affordable water and wastewater services to its customers, and (ii) regulated acquisitions to expand the Company’s services to new customers. In 2021,the Company invested $1.9 billion, pr

Operational Excellence
The
 Company’s adjusted regulated O&M efficiency ratio, which is used as a measure of the operating performance of the Regulated Businesses, was 34.1% for the year ended December 31,2021,
 compared to 34.3% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The improvement in this ratio reflects the continued focus on operating costs, as well as an increase in operating revenues for theRegulated Businesses after cons
idering the adjustment for the amortization of the excess accumulated deferred income taxes (“EADIT”) shown in the table below.The
 Company’s adjusted regulated O&M efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure and is defined by the Company as its operation and maintenance expenses from the Regulated Businesses,divided by the operating rev
enues from the Regulated Businesses, where both operation and maintenance expenses and operating revenues were adjusted to eliminate purchased water expense. Operatingrevenues
 were further adjusted to exclude reductions for the amortization of the EADIT. Also  excluded from operation and maintenance expenses is the allocable portion of non-O&M support servicescosts,
 mainly  depreciation  and  general  taxes,  which  is  reflected  in  the  Regulated  Businesses  segment  as  operation  and  maintenance  expenses,  but  for  consolidated  financial  reporting  purposes,  iscategorized
 within other line items in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Additionally, the  Company excluded the impact of certain Freedom Industries chemical spill settlementactivities
 recognized in 2019 from operation and maintenance expenses. The items discussed above were excluded from the O&M efficiency ratio calculation as they are not reflective of management’sability to increase 
the efficiency of the Regulated Businesses.The
 Company evaluates its operating performance using this ratio, and believes it is useful to investors because it directly measures improvement in the operating performance and efficiency ofthe
 Regulated Businesses. This information is derived from the Company’s consolidated financial information but is not presented in its financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Thisinformation
 supplements  and  should be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  Company’s GAAP disclosures,  and  should  be  considered  as  an addition  to,  and  not  a  substitute  for, any  GAAP measure.  TheCompany’s
 adjusted regulated O&M efficiency ratio (i) is not an accounting measure that is based on GAAP; (ii) is not based on a standard, objective industry definition or method of calculation; (iii)may not be comparable to o
ther companies’ operating measures; and (iv) should not be used in place of the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.55

 November 18, 2021, the CPUC unanimously approved a final decision in the test year 2021 general rate case filed by the Company’s California subsidiary, which is retroactive to January 1,2021.
 The Company’s California subsidiary received authorization for additional annualized water and wastewater revenues of $22 million, excluding agreed to reductions for EADIT as a result of theTax
 Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “TCJA”). The EADIT reduction in revenues is $4 million and is offset by a like reduction in income tax expense. On January 18, 2022, the Company’s Californiasubsidiary
 filed for approval of $13 million in 2022 escalation increases, excluding $4 million of reductions related to the TCJA. This filing, which is retroactive to January 1, 2022, is subject to CPUCapproval with a 45-day review pe
riod.On
 June 28, 2021, an order was issued authorizing an increase of $1 million in the general rate case filed by the Company’s Iowa subsidiary in 2020. The Company’s Iowa subsidiary filed tariffsconsistent with the order on Sept
ember 23, 2021. Effective October 11, 2021, the Iowa Utilities Board approved the tariffs and implemented the new rates.On April 7, 2021,
 the Company’s Missouri subsidiary was authorized additional annualized revenues of $22 million, effective May 28, 2021, excluding agreed to reductions for EADIT as a resultof
 the TCJA. The EADIT reduction in revenues is $25 million and is offset by a like reduction in income tax expense. The protected EADIT balance of $72 million is being returned to customers usingthe
 average rate assumption method (“ARAM”), and the unprotected EADIT balance of $74 million is being returned to customers over 10 years. The $25 million EADIT reduction includes both theprotected and unprotected
 catch-up period EADIT of $13 million. The catch-up period of January 1, 2018 through May 31, 2021 covers the period from when the lower federal corporate income tax ratewent into effect until n
ew base rates went into effect and will be amortized over 2.5 years.On
 March 2, 2021, an administrative law judge (“ALJ”) in the Office of Administrative Law of New Jersey filed an initial decision with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (the “NJBPU”)that
 recommended denial of a petition filed by the Company’s New Jersey subsidiary, which sought approval of acquisition adjustments in rate base of $29 million associated with the acquisitions ofShorelands
 Water Company, Inc. in 2017 and the Borough of Haddonfield’s water and wastewater systems in 2015. On July 29, 2021, the NJBPU issued an order adopting the ALJ’s initial decisionwithout
 modification. The Company’s New Jersey subsidiary filed a Notice of Appeal with the New Jersey Appellate Division on September 10, 2021. A scheduling order was issued on October 18,2021
 establishing a briefing schedule through March 2022. There is no financial impact to the Company as a result of the NJBPU’s order, since the acquisition adjustments are currently recorded asgoodwill on the Consolidated Balance She

 February 25, 2021, the Company’s Pennsylvania subsidiary was authorized additional annualized revenues of $90 million, effective January 28, 2021, excluding agreed to reductions forEADIT
 as a result of the TCJA, over two steps. The EADIT reduction in revenues is $19 million. The overall increase, net of TCJA reductions, is $71 million in revenues combined over two steps. Thefirst
 step was effective January 28, 2021 in the amount of $70 million ($51 million including TCJA reductions) and the second step will be effective January 1, 2022 in the amount of $20 million. Theprotected
 EADIT balance of $200 million is being returned to customers using the ARAM, and the unprotected EADIT balance of $116 million is being returned to customers over 20 years. The $19million
 annually includes both the protected and unprotected EADIT amortizations and a portion of catch-up period EADIT. A bill credit of $11 million annually for two years returns to customers theremainder of the
 EADIT catch-up period amortization. The catch-up period of January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 covers the period from when the lower federal corporate income tax rate wentinto effect until new bas

he Company filed their wastewater case under the alternative rate filing process for smaller utilities which calculates an operating ratio of 88% rather than a return on equity.On November 15, 2021, the
 Company’s Virginia subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $15 million in additional annualized revenues excluding proposed reductions for EADIT as a resultof TCJA.

On
 April 30, 2021, the Company’s West Virginia subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $32 million in annualized incremental revenues excluding proposed reductions for EADIT as aresult
 of TCJA and infrastructure surcharges. The proposed EADIT reduction in revenues is $1 million and the exclusion for infrastructure surcharges is $10 million. Intervenor testimony was receivedon

Federal Tax Legislation
On November
 15, 2021, the IIJA was signed into law and was designed to provide significant investment in the nation’s infrastructure. The Company has analyzed the bill to assess legislative taximpacts,
 and  determined  that  the  most  significant  aspect  impacting  the  Company  is  the  provision  for  special  rules  for  regulated  water  and  wastewater  utilities  as  it  relates  to  the  tax  treatment  ofcontributions
 in aid of construction (“CIAC”). The bill reinstates the pre-TCJA tax treatment of CIAC, which allows regulated water and wastewater utilities to generally exclude the receipt of CIACfrom
 taxable income. This provision is effective for contributions made after December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company has reflected the exemption retroactively toJanuary 1, 2021.

Table of ContentsOn
 December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law, which, among other things, enacted significant and complex changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”),including
 a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as of January 1, 2018. The enactment of the TCJA required a re-measurement of the Company’s deferred income taxes.The
 portion of this re-measurement related to the Regulated Businesses was substantially offset by a regulatory liability as EADIT will be used to benefit the Company’s regulated customers in futurerates.
 Twelve of the Company’s regulated subsidiaries are amortizing EADIT and crediting customers. The Company expects the timing of the amortization of EADIT credits for the one remainingregulated subsidiary
 to be addressed in a pending rate case or other proceedings. When crediting EADIT to the customer, the Company records both a reduction to revenue and a reduction to income taxexpense, having no materia
l impact on net income.Federal Net Operating Loss
The
 Company had no federal NOL carryover balance remaining as of December 31, 2021 due to the HOS sale, after which time the Company became a cash taxpayer for federal income taxpurposes.
Legislative Updates
During 2021, the Company’s regulatory ju
risdictions enacted the following legislation that has been approved and is effective as of February 16, 2022:•
California  passed electronic payment legislation, Assembly Bill 1058, which permanently changes state law to allow investor-owned water and wastewater utilities to accept electronicpayments, including credi
t and debit cards, without charging processing fees to customers.•
California  passed CPUC consolidation timeline legislation, Assembly Bill 1250, which requires the CPUC to make timely decisions on applications to acquire systems. Consolidations of$5 million or less are to b
e processed within 180 days and those more than $5 million are required to be processed within 12 months.•
The  Kentucky General Assembly adopted House Bill 465 relating to the acquisition of water and wastewater utilities. The legislation affirms a method in valuing water and wastewatersystems above net book value and es
tablishes a timeline of 60 days for Public Service Commission approval of an acquisition.•
Indiana House Enrolled Act 1287 cre ates a mechanism that reduces the required upfront cost to new customers for a water or wastewater utility to extend service to underserved areas.•
Indiana  House Enrolled Act 349 establishes a tax rider for water and wastewater utilities based upon a change in state or federal income tax law. The legislation also requires the IndianaFinance Authority to priorit
ize loans that secure long-term benefits over shorter term projects.•
New Jersey passed Lead  Service Line Replacement Bill, Senate Bill 3398/Assembly Bill 5343, which provides for the replacement of lead service lines within 10 years of the effective dateof the bill and authoriz
es cost recovery of customer-owned lead service lines as an O&M expense plus interest through a semi-annual surcharge.•
Missouri  passed the Water and Sewer Infrastructure Act, Senate Bill 44/House Bill 397, to establish a new statewide surcharge mechanism program which covers replacement of agingwater
 distribution and sewer collection infrastructure. This legislation broadens the eligible projects covered by the current Infrastructure System Replacement Surcharge mechanism andexpands its applicabili
ty to projects across the state.•
New Jersey  passed Senate Bill 647/House Bill 4825 which strengthens the WQAA by requiring the Department of Environmental Protection to adopt regulations to implement the WQAA,enhancing asset managem
ent plans and reporting, upgrading cyber security standards and adding criminal penalties for falsifying reports.•
Illinois  passed House Bill 414, Low Income Water & Sewer Financial Assistance Program, which authorizes the state’s Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity to institute awater
 and sewer assistance program for customers of privately and publicly owned systems. The program is modeled off the existing energy supplemental state Low Income Home EnergyAssistance Program.
In
 September 2020, the CPUC released a decision under its Low-Income Rate Payer Assistance program rulemaking that will require the Company’s California subsidiary to file a proposal toalter
 its water revenue adjustment mechanism in its next general rate case filing in 2022, which would become effective in January 2024. On October 5, 2020, the Company’s California subsidiary filedan
 application for rehearing of the decision and following the CPUC’s denial of its rehearing application in September 2021, the Company’s California subsidiary filed a petition for writ of review withthe California Supreme Court on Oc

 2021, as compared to 2020, operating revenues increased $129 million primarily due to $208 million increase from authorized rate increases, including infrastructure surcharges, principally tofund
 infrastructure investment in various states, and a $26 million increase from water and wastewater acquisitions, as well as organic growth in existing systems. These increases were offset by anestimated net decrease of $13 million from weather in both 202
1 and 2020, a $5 million decrease from lower water services demand and ongoing customer usage reductions from conservation, and a $79million
 decrease in revenues due to the amortization of EADIT, which is generally offset with a reduction in income tax expense. Additionally, there was an $8 million decrease in revenue due to thedenial
 of authorization to defer certain COVID-19 financial impacts based on the PaPUC order received by the Company’s Pennsylvania subsidiary. See Note 3—Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic inthe Notes to Consolidated Financia

Table of ContentsGain or (Loss) on Sale of Businesses
During
 the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  the  Company  recognized  a  pre-tax  gain  on  sale  of  $748  million  relating  to  the  sale  of  HOS.  See  Note  6—Acquisitions  and  Divestitures  in  the  Notes  toConsolidated Financial State
ments for additional information.Provision for Income Taxes
In
 2021, as compared to 2020, provision for income taxes increased $219 million primarily due to the sale of HOS. See Note 6—Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to ConsolidatedFinancial Statements for a
dditional information.Liquidity and Capital Resources
The
 Company  uses  its  capital  resources,  including  cash,  primarily  to  (i)  fund  operating  and  capital  requirements,  (ii)  pay  interest  and  meet  debt  maturities,  (iii)  pay  dividends,  (iv)  fundacquisitions,
 (v) fund pension and postretirement benefit obligations, and (vi) to pay federal income taxes, which the Company began to pay as a result of fully utilizing its NOL carryforward in 2021.The
 Company  invests  a  significant  amount  of  cash  on  regulated  capital  projects  where  it  expects  to  earn  a  long-term  return  on  investment.  Additionally,  the  Company  operates  in  rate  regulatedenvironments in which the amoun
t of new investment recovery may be limited, and where such recovery generally takes place over an extended period of time, and certain capital recovery is also subjectto
 regulatory lag. See Item 1—Business—Regulated Businesses—Regulation  and Rate Making for  additional information. The Company expects to fund future maturities of long-term debt through acombination
 of external debt and, to the extent available, cash flows from operations. Since the Company expects its capital investments over the next few years to be greater than its cash flows fromoperating activities, the Company currently
 plans to fund the excess of its capital investments over its cash flows from operating activities for the next five years through a combination of long-term debtand
 equity in addition to the proceeds from the sales of HOS and the Company’s New York subsidiary. If necessary, the Company may delay certain capital investments or other funding requirements,or pursue financing from other sources to preser
ve liquidity. In this event, the Company believes it can rely upon cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and fund its minimum required capitalinvestments for an extend
ed period of time.The
 Company  regularly  evaluates  and  monitors  its  cash requirements  for  capital  investments,  acquisitions,  operations,  commitments,  debt  maturities,  interest  and dividends.  The  Company’sbusiness
 is capital intensive, with a majority of this capital funded by cash flows from operations. When necessary, the Company also obtains funds from external sources, primarily in the debt marketsand
 through short-term commercial paper borrowings. In order to meet short-term liquidity needs, AWCC issues commercial paper that is supported by its revolving credit facility. The Company mayalso
 access the equity capital markets to support its capital funding requirements, as needed. The Company’s access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on its credit ratings and currentbusiness
 conditions,  including  that  of  the  utility  and  water  utility  industry  in  general,  as  well  as  conditions  in  the  debt  or  equity  capital  markets,  and  the  national  and  international  economic  andgeopolitical
 arenas. Disruptions in the credit markets may discourage lenders from extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments. Market disruptions may also limit theCompany’s ability to issue debt 
and equity securities in the capital markets.If
 these  unfavorable  business,  market,  financial  and  other  conditions  deteriorate  to  the  extent  that  the  Company  is  no  longer  able  to  access  the  commercial  paper  and/or  capital  markets  onreasonable
 terms, AWCC has access to an unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in March 2025 with aggregate bank commitments of $2.25 billion. The facility is used principally to fulfill theCompany’s
 short-term liquidity needs by supporting AWCC’s $2.10 billion commercial paper program and to provide a sublimit of up to $150 million for letters of credit. Subject to satisfying certainconditions,
 the credit agreement permits AWCC to increase the maximum commitment under the facility by up to $500 million. As of December 31, 2021, AWCC had no outstanding borrowings and$76 million of outsta
nding letters of credit under its revolving credit facility, with $1.59 billion available to fulfill its short-term liquidity needs and to issue letters of credit.To
 ensure adequate liquidity given the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on debt and capital markets, on March 20, 2020, AWCC entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement, by and amongparent
 company, AWCC and the lenders party thereto (the “Term Loan Facility”). The net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes of AWCC and American Water and to provide additionalliquidity. The Term Loan Faci
lity commitments terminated at maturity on March 19, 2021, and the Term Loan Facility was repaid in full.The Company believes that its ability to access the debt and equit
y capital markets, the revolving credit facility and cash flows from operations will generate sufficient cash to fund the Company’sshort-term requirements.
 The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity and the ability to manage its expenditures, should there be a disruption of the capital and credit markets. However, there can beno
 assurance that the lenders will be able to meet existing commitments to AWCC under the revolving credit facility, or that AWCC will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in thefuture on acceptable 
terms or at all. See Credit Facilities and Short-Term Debt below for additional information.66

Table of ContentsCash Flows from Operating Activities
Cash
 flows from operating activities primarily result from the sale of water and wastewater services and, due to the seasonality of demand, are generally greater during the warmer months. TheCompany’s future cash flows
 from operating activities will be affected by, among other things: customers’ ability to pay for service in a timely manner, economic utility regulation, inflation, compliancewith
 environmental, health and safety standards, production costs, maintenance costs, customer growth, declining customer usage of water, employee-related costs, including pension funding, weatherand seasonality, taxes, and ove
rall economic conditions.Operating
 cash flows can be negatively affected by changes in the Company’s rate regulated environments, changes in the Market-Based Businesses, changes in the economy, interest rates, thetiming
 of tax payments, and the Company’s customers’ ability to pay for service in a timely manner, among other items. The Company can provide no assurance that its customers’ historical paymentpattern
 will continue in the future. The Company’s current liabilities may exceed current assets mainly from debt maturities due within one year and the use of short-term debt as a funding source,primarily
 to meet scheduled maturities of long-term debt, fund acquisitions and construction projects, as well as cash needs, which can fluctuate significantly due to the seasonality of the business andother factors. The Company addr
esses cash timing differences primarily through its short-term liquidity funding mechanisms.Presented in the table be

Changes in working capital include changes to receivables and unbilled revenues, accounts payable and accrued l iabilities, and other current assets and liabilities, net, less the settlement of cash flow hedges.In 2021, cash flows
 provided by operating activities increased $15 million, primarily due to an increase in net income, changes in working capital, primarily from an increase in accrued taxes, andan increase
 in depreciation and amortization due to additional utility plant placed in service from capital infrastructure investments. Partially offsetting these increases was the gain on sale of businesses,due to the gain on the sale of HOS.
The
 Company expects to make pension contributions to the plan trusts of $37 million in 2022. In addition, the Company estimates that contributions will amount to $35 million, $33 million, $30million and $27 million in 2023, 2024, 2
025 and 2026, respectively. Actual amounts contributed could change materially from these estimates as a result of changes in assumptions and actual investmentreturns, among other fac

 2021, cash flows used in investing activities decreased $525 million primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of HOS and timing of payments for capital expenditures. The Companycontinues
 to invest across all infrastructure categories, mainly replacement and renewal of transmission and distribution and services, meter and fire hydrants infrastructure in the Company’s RegulatedBusinesses, as discussed below.
The
 Company’s infrastructure investment plan consists of both infrastructure renewal programs, where the Company replaces infrastructure, as needed, and major capital investment projects,where the Company constructs new wate
r and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities to meet new customer growth and water quality regulations. The Company’s projected capital expenditures andother investments are sub
ject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors.Presented in the table be

 2021, the Company’s capital expenditures decreased $58 million primarily due to a decrease in treatment and pumping and general structure and equipment infrastructure investment partiallyoffset by increases in t
ransmission and distribution and services, meter and fire hydrants infrastructure investment.The Company also
 grows its business primarily through acquisitions of water and wastewater systems. These acquisitions are generally located in geographic proximity to the Company’s existingRegulated
 Businesses and support continued geographical diversification and growth of its operations. Generally, acquisitions are funded initially with short-term debt, and later refinanced with long-term financing. During 2021,
 the Company paid $112 million for the acquisition of 23 water and wastewater systems, representing in the aggregate approximately 20,000 customers and paid $23 millionin deposits for future acqu
isitions.As
 previously noted, over the next five years the Company expects to invest between $13 billion to $14 billion, with $11.5 billion to $12 billion for infrastructure improvements in the RegulatedBusinesses,
 and the Company expects to invest between $28 billion to $32 billion over the next 10 years. In 2022, the Company expects to invest $2.5 billion, consisting of $2 billion for infrastructureimprovements and $500 mill
ion for acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses.68

In
 2021, cash flows provided by financing activities decreased $1,465 million, primarily due to the repayment in full at maturity of the $500 million Term Loan Facility during the first quarter of2021,
 an increase in net repayments of commercial paper borrowings, higher dividends paid in 2021 and an increase in repayments of long-term debt due to the prepayment of $327 million in aggregateprincipal amount of AWCC’s outstand
ing senior notes during the second quarter of 2021.The Company’s financing activities are
 primarily focused on funding regulated infrastructure expenditures, regulated acquisitions and payment of dividends. These activities included the issuanceof
 long-term and short-term debt, primarily through AWCC. Based on the needs of the Regulated Businesses and the Company, AWCC may borrow funds or issue its debt in the capital markets andthen,
 through intercompany loans, provide those borrowings to the Regulated Businesses and parent company. The Regulated Businesses and parent company are obligated to pay their portion of therespective
 principal and interest to AWCC, in the amount necessary to enable AWCC to meet its debt service obligations. Parent company’s borrowings are not a source of capital for the RegulatedBusinesses,
 therefore, parent company is not able to recover the interest charges on its debt through regulated water and wastewater rates. As of December 31, 2021, AWCC has made long-term fixedrate
 loans and commercial paper loans to the Regulated Businesses amounting to $6.7 billion. Additionally, as of December 31, 2021, AWCC has made long-term fixed rate loans and commercial paperloans to parent company amoun
ting to $3.1 billion.On
 May  10,  2021,  AWCC  completed  a  $1.1  billion  debt  offering,  which  included  the  sale  of  $550  million  aggregate  principal  amount  of  its  2.30%  Senior  Notes  due  2031  and  $550million
 aggregate principal amount of its 3.25% Senior Notes due 2051. At the closing of the offering, AWCC received, after deduction of underwriting discounts and before deduction of offeringexpenses, net
 proceeds of $1,086 million. AWCC used the net proceeds of this offering: (i) to lend funds to parent company and its regulated subsidiaries; (ii) to prepay $251 million aggregate principalamount of AWCC’s outstanding 5.77% Series D Senior Not
es due December 21, 2021 (the “Series D Notes”) and $76 million aggregate principal amount of AWCC’s outstanding 6.55% Series H SeniorNotes
 due May 15, 2023 (the “Series H Notes,” and together with the Series D Notes, the “Series Notes”); (iii) to repay AWCC’s commercial paper obligations; and (iv) for general corporate purposes.After
 the prepayments described above, none of the Series D Notes, and approximately $14 million aggregate principal amount of the Series H Notes, remain outstanding. As a result of AWCC’sprepayment
 of the Series Notes, a make-whole premium of $15 million was paid to the holders thereof on June 14, 2021. Substantially all of the early debt extinguishment costs were allocable to theCompany’s utility subsidiari
es and recorded as regulatory assets, as the Company believes they are probable of recovery in future rates.One
 of the principal market risks to which the Company is exposed is changes in interest rates. In order to manage the exposure, the Company follows risk management policies and procedures,including
 the use of derivative contracts such as swaps. The Company also reduces exposure to interest rates by managing commercial paper and debt maturities. The Company does not enter intoderivative
 contracts  (through  AWCC)  for  speculative  purposes  and  does  not  use  leveraged  instruments.  The  derivative  contracts  entered  into  are  for  periods  consistent  with  the  related  underlyingexposures.
 The Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. The Company minimizes the counterparty credit risk on thesetransactions by dealing only wi
th leading, creditworthy financial institutions, having long-term credit ratings of “A” or better.69

Issuer and Guarantor of Senior Notes
The
 outstanding senior notes issued by AWCC, the wholly owned finance subsidiary of parent company, have been issued under two indentures, each by and between AWCC and Wells FargoBank, National Association, as trust
ee, providing for the rights and obligations of the parties thereto and the holders of the notes issued thereunder. The senior notes also have been issued with the benefitof
 a support agreement, as amended, between parent company and AWCC, which serves as the functional equivalent of a full and unconditional guarantee by parent company of AWCC’s paymentobligations
 under the senior notes. No other subsidiary of parent company provides guarantees for any of the outstanding senior notes. If AWCC is unable to make timely payment of any interest,principal
 or premium, if any, on such senior notes, parent company will provide to AWCC, at its request or the request of any holder of such senior notes, funds to make such payment in full. If AWCCfails or
 refuses to take timely action to enforce certain rights under the support agreement or if AWCC defaults in the timely payment of any amounts owed to any holder of such senior notes, when due,the support agreement prov
ides that the holder may proceed directly against parent company to enforce such rights or to obtain payment of the defaulted amounts owed to that holder.70

Table of ContentsAs
 a wholly owned finance subsidiary of parent company, AWCC has no significant assets other than obligations of parent company and certain of its subsidiaries in its Regulated Businessessegment
 to repay certain intercompany loans made to them by AWCC. AWCC’s ability to make payments of amounts owed to holders of the senior notes will be dependent upon AWCC’s receipt ofsufficient
 payments of amounts owed pursuant to the terms of such intercompany loans and from its ability to issue indebtedness or otherwise obtain loans in the future, the proceeds of which would beused to fund the repayment of 
the senior notes.Because
 parent company is a holding company and substantially all of its operations are conducted through its subsidiaries other than AWCC, parent company’s ability to fulfill its obligationsunder
 the  support  agreement  will  be  dependent  upon  its  receipt  of  sufficient  cash  dividends  or  distributions  from  its  operating  subsidiaries.  See  Note  10—Shareholders’  Equity—Dividends  andDistributions,
 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of the limitations on parent company and its subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions. Furthermore, parentcompany’s
 operating subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and, other than AWCC, have no obligation to make any payments on the senior notes or to make available or provide any fundsfor such
 payment, other than through their repayment obligations under intercompany loans, if any, with AWCC. Based on the foregoing, parent company’s obligations under the support agreement willbe
 effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, lease commitments and moneys borrowed or other indebtedness incurred or issued by parent company’ssubsidiaries other than AWCC.
Credit Facilities and Short-Term Debt
Interest
 rates on advances under the Company’s revolving credit facility are based on a credit spread to the LIBOR rate (or applicable market replacement rate) or base rate in accordance withMoody
 Investors Service’s and Standard & Poor’s Financial Services’ then applicable credit rating on AWCC’s senior unsecured, non-credit enhanced debt. The facility is used principally to supportAWCC’s commercial paper program and to provide up to $150 million in letters
 of credit. Indebtedness under the facility and AWCC’s commercial paper are considered “debt” for purposes of a supportagreement between par
ent company and AWCC, which serves as a functional equivalent of a full and unconditional guarantee by parent company of AWCC’s payment obligations thereunder.Presented

 changes in the capital structure mix between periods were mainly attributable to the impacts of the HOS sale, repayment of the Term Loan Facility at maturity on March 19, 2021, and theCompany’s long-term debt off
ering that was completed on May 10, 2021.Debt Covenants
The
 Company’s debt agreements contain financial and non-financial covenants. To the extent that the Company is not in compliance with these covenants, an event of default may occur underone
 or more debt agreements and the Company, or its subsidiaries, may be restricted in its ability to pay dividends, issue new debt or access the revolving credit facility. The long-term debt indenturescontain a
 number of covenants that, among other things, prohibit or restrict the Company from issuing debt secured by the Company’s assets, subject to certain exceptions. Failure to comply with any ofthese covenants could
 accelerate repayment obligations.Covenants
 in  certain  long-term  notes  and  the  revolving  credit  facility  require  the  Company  to  maintain  a  ratio  of  consolidated  debt  to  consolidated  capitalization  (as  defined  in  the  relevantdocuments) of not more than 0.70 
to 1.00. On December 31, 2021, the Company’s ratio was 0.60 to 1.00 and therefore the Company was in compliance with the covenants.Security Ratings

Table of ContentsA
 security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency, and each rating should beevaluated
 independently  of  any  other  rating.  Security  ratings  are  highly  dependent  upon  the  ability  to  generate  cash  flows  in  an  amount  sufficient  to  service  debt  and  meet  investment  plans.  TheCompany can
 provide no assurances that its ability to generate cash flows is sufficient to maintain its existing ratings. None of the Company’s borrowings are subject to default or prepayment as a resultof the downgrading of these secur
ity ratings, although such a downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under its credit facility.As
 part of its normal course of business, the Company routinely enters into contracts for the purchase and sale of water, energy, chemicals and other services. These contracts either containexpress
 provisions or otherwise permit the Company and its counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so. In accordance with thecontracts and
 applicable contract law, if the Company is downgraded by a credit rating agency, especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade, it is possible that a counterparty wouldattempt
 to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance, which could include a demand that the Company must provide collateral to secure itsobligations. The Company does not expec
t to post any collateral which will have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Access to the capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and respective financi
ng costs in those markets, may be directly affected by the Company’s securities ratings. The Companyprimarily accesses the
 debt capital markets, including the commercial paper market, through AWCC. However, the Company has also issued debt through its regulated subsidiaries, primarily in the formof mortgage bonds and tax exemp
t securities or borrowings under state revolving funds, to lower the overall cost of debt.Dividends and Regulatory Restrictions
For
 discussion  of  the  Company’s  dividends,  dividend  restrictions  and  dividend  policy,  see  Note  10—Shareholders’  Equity  in  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  additionalinformation.
Insurance Coverage
The
 Company carries various property, casualty, cyber and financial insurance policies with limits, deductibles and exclusions that it believes are consistent with industry standards. However,insurance
 coverage may not be adequate or available to cover unanticipated  losses or claims. Additionally, annual policy renewals can be impacted by claims experience which in turn can impactcoverage terms and
 conditions on a going-forward basis. The Company is self-insured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. Such lossescould have a materia
l adverse effect on the Company’s short-term and long-term financial condition and its results of operations and cash flows.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The
 preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  GAAP requires  that  management  apply  accounting  policies  and  make  estimates,  assumptions  and  judgments  that  could  affect  theCompany’s
 financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Actual results could differ from these estimates, assumptions and judgments. Management believes that the areas described belowrequire
 significant  judgment  in  the  application  of  accounting  policy  or  in  making  estimates  and  assumptions  in  matters  that  are  inherently  uncertain  and  that  may  change  in  subsequent  periods.Accordingly,
 changes in the estimates, assumptions and judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations andcash
 flows, as reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Management has reviewed the critical accounting polices described below with the Company’s Audit, Finance and RiskCommittee,
 including the estimates, assumptions and judgments used in their application. Additional discussion regarding these critical accounting policies and their application can be found in Note 2—Significant Accounting Polici
es in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Regulation and Regulatory Accounting
The
 Company’s regulated utilities are subject to regulation by PUCs and, as such, the Company follows the authoritative accounting principles required for rate regulated utilities, which requiresthe Company to reflect t
he effects of rate regulation in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Use of this authoritative guidance is applicable to utility operations that meet the following criteria: (i) third-party regulation of ra
tes; (ii) cost-based rates; and (iii) a reasonable assumption that rates will be set to recover the estimated costs of providing service, plus a return on net investment, or rate base. As ofDecember 31, 2021, the Company concluded 
that the operations of its utilities met the criteria.73

Table of ContentsApplication
 of  this  authoritative  guidance  has  a  further  effect  on  the  Company’s  financial  statements  as  it  pertains  to  allowable  costs  used  in  the  ratemaking  process.  The  Company  makessignificant
 assumptions  and  estimates  to  quantify  amounts  recorded  as  regulatory  assets  and  liabilities.  Such  judgments  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  assets  and  liabilities  related  to  regulatedacquisitions, pension and postretirement benefits, depreciation rates and taxes. Due to timing and
 other differences in the collection of revenues, these authoritative accounting principles allow a cost thatwould
 otherwise be charged as an expense by a non-regulated entity, to be deferred as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates. Conversely, the principlesrequire
 the creation of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future, or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable tocustomers.
For
 each regulatory jurisdiction where the Company conducts business, the Company assesses, at the end of each reporting period, whether the regulatory assets continue to meet the criteria forprobable
 future  recovery  and  regulatory  liabilities  continue  to  meet  the  criteria  for  probable  future  settlement.  This  assessment  includes  consideration  of  factors  such  as  changes  in  regulatoryenvironments,
 recent rate orders (including recent rate orders on recovery of a specific or similar incurred cost to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction) and the status of any pending orpotential
 legislation.  If  subsequent  events  indicate  that  the  regulatory  assets  or  liabilities  no  longer  meet  the  criteria  for  probable  future  recovery  or  probable  future  settlement,  the  Company’sConsolidated
 Statements of Operations and financial position could be materially affected. In addition, if the Company concludes in a future period that a separable portion of the business no longermeets
 the criteria, the Company is required to eliminate the financial statement effects of regulation for that part of the business, which would include the elimination of any or all regulatory assets andliabilities
 that had been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Failure to meet the criteria of this authoritative guidance could materially impact the Company’s Consolidated FinancialStatements.
As
 of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company’s regulatory asset balance was $1.1 billion and its regulatory liability balance was $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. See Note 4—Regulatory Matters in the Not
es to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Company’s significant regulatory assets and liabilities.Accounting for Income Taxes
Significant
 management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken, as well as deferred tax assets andliabilities, valua
tion allowances and the utilization of NOL carryforwards.In
 accordance with applicable authoritative guidance, the Company accounts for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach, including a more-likely-than-not
 recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not more-likely-than-not
 that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit is recorded. Uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a taxreturn
 are considered to have met the recognition threshold. Management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position, assuming the positionwill
 be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and, if so, theappropriate amount of unr
ecognized tax benefit to be recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements.The
 Company evaluates the probability of realizing deferred tax assets quarterly by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and its intent and ability to implement tax planning strategies, ifnecessary,
 to realize deferred tax assets. The Company also assesses its ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected inthe financial stat
ements. The Company records valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when it concludes that it is more-likely-than-not such benefit will not be realized in future periods.Under
 GAAP, specifically Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes (“ASC  740”), the tax effects of changes in tax laws must be recognized in the period in which the law isenacted.
 ASC 740 also requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when temporary differences are to be realized or settled. Thus, at the date ofenactment
 of the TCJA, the Company’s deferred taxes were re-measured based upon the new tax rate. For the Company’s regulated entities, the change in deferred taxes are recorded as either an offsetto
 a  regulatory  asset  or  a  regulatory  liability  and  may  be  subject  to  refund  to  customers.  For  the  Company’s  unregulated  operations,  the  change  in  deferred  taxes  are  recorded  as  a  non-cash  re-measurement adjustm
ent to earnings.74

Table of ContentsActual income taxes could v
ary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, the Company’s forecasted financial condition and resultsof operations, failure
 to successfully implement tax planning strategies and recovery of taxes through the regulatory process for the Regulated Businesses, as well as results of audits and examinations offiled
 tax returns by taxing authorities. The resulting tax balances as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance; however,the ultimate outcom
e of tax matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the Consolidated Financial Statements and such adjustments could be material. See Note 15—Income Taxes inthe Notes to Consolidated Financia
l Statements for additional information regarding income taxes.Accounting for Pension and Postretirement Benefits
The
 Company maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of its regulated utility and shared service operations. See Note 16—Employee Benefits in theNotes to Consolidated Financial Sta
tements for additional information regarding the description of and accounting for the defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans.The
 Company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the Company to its actuaries,including
 the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Material changes in the Company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes inthese assumptions as well as f
luctuations in plan assets. The assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due tochanges
 in  capital  markets  and  the  overall  economy.  These  differences  will  impact  the  amount  of  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefit  expense  that  the  Company  recognizes.  The  primaryassumptions are:
•
Discount Rate—The disco unt rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which are based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future. The objective in selectingthe
 discount rate is to measure the single amount that, if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments, would provide the necessary future cash flows topay the accumulated ben
efits when due.•
Expected  Return on Plan Assets (“EROA”)—Management projects the future return on plan assets considering prior performance, but primarily based upon the plans’ mix of assets andexpectations for the long
-term returns on those asset classes. These projected returns reduce the net benefit costs the Company records currently.•
Rate of Compensation Increas e—Management projects employees’ pay increases, which are used to project employees’ pension benefits at retirement.•
Health Care Cost Trend Rate—Manage ment projects the expected increases in the cost of health care.•
Mortality—  Management adopted the Society of Actuaries Pri-2012 mortality base table, the most recent table developed from private pension plan experience, which provides rates ofmortality in 2012 and adopted 
the new MP-2021 mortality improvement scale to gradually adjust future mortality rates downward due to increased longevity in each year after 2012.The
 discount rate assumption, which is determined for the pension and postretirement benefit plans independently, is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in applicable high-quality,
 long-term corporate bond indices. The Company uses an approach that approximates the process of settlement of obligations tailored to the plans’ expected cash flows by matching the plans’cash flows to
 the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds. For each plan, the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would yield the same present valueas
 using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments. The discount rate for determining pension benefit obligations was 2.94%, 2.74% and 3.44% at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019,respectively. The discount 
rate for determining other postretirement benefit obligations was 2.90%, 2.56% and 3.36% at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.In
 selecting an EROA, the Company considered tax implications, past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans. The long-term EROA assumption usedin
 calculating pension cost was 6.50% for 2021, 6.50% for 2020, and 6.20% for 2019. The weighted average EROA assumption used in calculating other postretirement benefit costs was 3.67% for2021, 3.68% for 2020 and 3.56% for 2019.

ing Plan ChangesOn
 August  31,  2018,  the  Postretirement  Medical  Benefit  Plan  was  remeasured  as  a  result  of  an  announced  plan  amendment  which  changed  benefits  for  certain  union  and  non-union  planparticipants.
 The plan change resulted in a $175 million reduction in future benefits payable to plan participants, and, in combination with other experience reflected as of the remeasurement date,resulted
 in a $227 million reduction to the net accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining amortization period of the impact of the plan amendment is 6.9years. As a result of the remeasurement and change in fu
nded status, the Company decreased the investment risk in the plan and reduced its exposure to changes in interest rates by matching the assets ofthe
 plan to the projected cash flows for future benefit payments of the liability. Plan assets in excess of those securities designed to match the long-term liabilities are invested in shorter duration fixedincome securities and 
equities.Presented in the table be

Includes the American Water Postretirement Medical Benefits Bargaining Plan, the American Wa ter Postretirement Medical Benefits Non-Bargaining Plan, and the American Water Life Insurance Trust.The
 investments of the pension and postretirement welfare plan trusts include debt and equity securities held either directly or through mutual funds, commingled funds and limited partnerships.The trustee for the Company’s d
efined benefit pension and postretirement welfare plans uses an independent valuation firm to calculate the fair value of plan assets.In
 selecting a rate of compensation increase, the Company considers past experience in light of movements in inflation rates. The Company’s rate of compensation increase was 3.51% for 2021,3.51% for 2020 and 2.97% for 2019.
In
 selecting health care cost trend rates, the Company considers past performance and forecasts of increases in health care costs. As of January 1, 2021 ,  the Company’s health care cost trend rateassumption
 used to calculate the periodic cost was 6.25% in 2021 gradually declining to 5.00% in 2026 and thereafter. As of December 31, 2021, the Company projects that medical inflation will be6.00% in 2022 gradually declining 
to 5.00% in 2026 and thereafter.The
 Company will use a discount rate and EROA of 2.94% and 6.50%, respectively, for estimating its 2022 pension costs. Additionally, the Company will use a discount rate and expectedblended
 return based on weighted assets of 2.90% and 3.60%, respectively, for estimating its 2022 other postretirement benefit costs. A decrease in the discount rate or the EROA would increase theCompany’s
 pension expense. The Company’s 2021 pension and postretirement benefit credit was $41 million and the 2020 pension and postretirement benefit credit was $14 million. The Companyexpects
 to make pension contributions to the plan trusts of $37 million in 2022, and $35 million, $33 million, $30 million and $27 million in 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. Actual amountscontributed
 could change significantly from these estimates. The assumptions are reviewed annually and at any interim re-measurement of the plan obligations. The impact of assumption changes isreflected in the r
ecorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts as they occur, or over a period of time if allowed under applicable accounting standards.76

Table of ContentsRevenue Recognition
Revenue
 from the Company’s Regulated Businesses is generated primarily from water and wastewater services delivered to customers. These contracts contain a single performance obligation,the
 delivery of water or wastewater services, as the promise to transfer the individual good or service is not separately identifiable from other promises within the contracts and, therefore, is not distinct.Revenues are recognized over
 time, as services are provided. There are generally no significant financing components or variable consideration. Revenues include amounts billed to customers on a cyclebasis,
 and unbilled amounts calculated based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill, to the end of the accounting period. The amounts that theCompany has a right to invoice a
re determined by each customer’s actual usage, an indicator that the invoice amount corresponds directly to the value transferred to the customer.Increases
 or decreases in the volumes delivered to customers and rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilledrevenue.
 In addition, changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for each meter reading date would also have an effect on the unbilled revenuecalculation. Unbilled r
evenue for the Company’s regulated utilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $162 million and $150 million, respectively.The Company also
 recognizes revenue when it is probable that future recovery of previously incurred costs or future refunds that are to be credited to customers will occur through the ratemakingprocess.
Revenue
 from the Company’s former HOS business was generated through various protection programs in which the Company provided fixed fee services to domestic homeowners and smallercommercial custom
ers for interior and exterior water and sewer lines, interior electric and gas lines, heating and cooling systems, water heaters, power surge protection and other related services. Most ofthe
 contracts had a one-year term and each service was a separate performance obligation, satisfied over time, as the customers simultaneously received and consumed the benefits provided from theservice. Customers
 were obligated to pay for the protection programs ratably over 12 months or via a one-time, annual fee, with revenues recognized ratably over time for those services. Advances fromcustomers were deferr
ed until the performance obligation was satisfied.The
 Company also has long-term, fixed fee contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems for the U.S. government on various military installations and facilities owned bymunicipal
 customers. Billing and revenue recognition for the fixed fee revenues occurs ratably over the term of the contract, as customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided bythe
 Company. Additionally, these contracts allow the Company to make capital improvements to underlying infrastructure, which are initiated through separate modifications or amendments to theoriginal contract,
 whereby stand-alone, fixed pricing is separately stated for each improvement. The Company has determined that these capital improvements are separate performance obligations, withrevenue
 recognized over time based on performance completed at the end of each reporting period. Losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the losses first become probable andestimable. Revenues
 recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded as unbilled revenues, with billings in excess of revenues recorded as other current liabilitiesuntil
 the recognition criteria are met. Changes in contract performance and related estimated contract profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in whichrevisions are determ
ined. Unbilled revenue for the Market-Based Businesses as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $86 million and $56 million, respectively.Accounting for Contingencies
The
 Company records loss contingencies when management determines that the outcome of future events is probable of occurring and when the amount of the loss or a range of losses can bereasonably
 estimated. The determination of a loss contingency is based on management’s judgment and estimates about the likely outcome of the matter, which may include an analysis of differentscenarios.
 Liabilities are recorded or adjusted when events or circumstances cause these judgments or estimates to change. In assessing whether a loss is reasonably possible, management considersmany
 factors, which include, but are not limited to: the nature of the litigation, claim or assessment, review of applicable law, opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisors, and the experiencegained
 from similar cases or situations. The Company provides disclosures for material contingencies when management deems there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may beincurred. The Company provides est
imates of reasonably possible losses when such estimates may be reasonably determined, either as a single amount or within a reasonable range.Actual
 amounts realized upon settlement or other resolution of loss contingencies may be different than amounts recorded and disclosed and could have a significant impact on the liabilities,revenue
 and expenses recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 17—Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional informationregarding contingencies.

cies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recent accounting standards.ITEM 7A.    QUANT
ITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThe Company is exposed to market risk associated with changes in commodity prices, equity prices and interest rates. The Company is exposed to risks from changes in interest rates as
 a result ofits
 issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper. The Company manages its interest rate exposure by limiting its variable rate exposure and by monitoring the effects of market changesin
 interest rates. The Company also has the ability to enter into financial derivative instruments, which could include instruments such as, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, forward starting swapsand U.S. Treasury lock agreements 
to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure. As of December 31, 2021, a hypothetical increase of interest rates by 1% associated with the Company’s short-termborrowings would result in a $8 mill
ion increase in short-term interest expense.The
 Company’s risks associated with price increases for chemicals, electricity and other commodities are reduced through contractual arrangements and the expected ability to recover priceincreases through rates, in
 the next general rate case proceeding or other regulatory mechanism, as authorized by each regulatory jurisdiction. Non-performance by these commodity suppliers could havea material advers
e impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows.The market price
 of the Company’s common stock may experience fluctuations, which may be unrelated to its operating performance. In particular, the Company’s stock price may be affected bygeneral
 market movements as well as developments specifically related to the water and wastewater industry. These could include, among other things, interest rate movements, quarterly variations orchanges
 in financial estimates by securities analysts and governmental or regulatory actions. This volatility may make it difficult for the Company to access the capital markets in the future throughadditional
 offerings of its common stock or other equity securities, regardless of its financial performance, and such difficulty may preclude the Company from being able to take advantage of certainbusiness opportunities or mee
t business obligations.The
 Company  is  exposed  to  credit  risk  through  its  water,  wastewater  and  other  water-related  services  provided  by  the  Regulated  Businesses  and  Market-Based  Businesses.  The  Company’sRegulated
 Businesses serve residential, commercial, industrial and other customers, while the Market-Based Businesses engage in business activities with developers, government entities and othercustomers.
 The Company’s primary credit risk is exposure to customer default on contractual obligations and the associated loss that may be incurred due to the non-payment of customer accountsreceivable
 balances. The Company’s credit risk is managed through established credit and collection policies which are in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and involve monitoring ofcustomer
 exposure and the use of credit risk mitigation measures such as letters of credit or prepayment arrangements. The Company’s credit portfolio is diversified with no significant customer orindustry
 concentrations. In addition, the Regulated Businesses are generally able to recover all prudently incurred costs including uncollectible customer accounts receivable expenses and collectioncosts through rates.
The
 Company’s retirement trust assets are exposed to the market prices of debt and equity securities. Changes to the retirement trust asset values can impact the Company’s pension and otherbenefits
 expense, funded status and future minimum funding requirements. Changes in interest rates can impact retirement liabilities. The Company aims to reduce risk through asset diversification andby investing in long duration fix
ed-income securities that have a duration similar to that of its pension liabilities, seeking to hedge some of the interest rate sensitivity of its liabilities. That way, if interestrates fall
 and liabilities increase, the Company expects that the fixed-income assets in its retirement trust will also increase in value. The Company also expects its risk to be reduced through its ability torecover pension and other ben
efit costs through rates.The
 Company is also exposed to a potential national economic recession or deterioration in local economic conditions in the markets in which it operates. The credit quality of the Company’scustomer
 accounts receivable is dependent on the economy and the ability of its customers to manage through unfavorable economic cycles and other market changes. In addition, there can be noassurances
 that regulators  will grant sufficient  rate authorizations.  Therefore,  the Company’s ability  to fully recover  operating  expense, recover  its investment  and provide an appropriate  return oninvested capital mad
e in the Regulated Businesses may be adversely impacted.78

Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareho
lders ofAmerican Water Works Comp
any, Inc.Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the ac
companying consolidated balance sheets of American Water Works Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the relatedconsolidated
 statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, including the relatednotes
 (collectively  referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial  reporting  as of December  31, 2021, based on criteriaestablished in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework  (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).In
 our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and theresults of its
 operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.Also
 in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal  Control -Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the COSO.Basis for Opinions
The
 Company's  management  is  responsible  for  these  consolidated  financial  statements,  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  and  for  its  assessment  of  theeffectiveness
 of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  Management's  Report  on  Internal  Control  over  Financial  Reporting  appearing  under  Item  9A.  Our  responsibility  is  to  expressopinions
 on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with thePublic
 Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and theapplicable rules and r
egulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We
 conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  PCAOB.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audits  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  theconsolidated
 financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our
 audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error orfraud,
 and  performing  procedures  that  respond  to  those  risks.  Such  procedures  included  examining,  on  a  test  basis,  evidence  regarding  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  consolidated financialstatements.
 Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financialstatements.
 Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, andtesting
 and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in thecircumstances. We be
lieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Repor
tingA
 company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  a  process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financialstatements for external
 purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertainto
 the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions arerecorded as necessary to
 permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only inaccordance
 with  authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of  the  company;  and  (iii)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use,  ordisposition of the c
ompany’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because
 of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods aresubject to the risk that 
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.80

Table of ContentsCritical Audit Matters
The
 critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated tothe audit
 committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.The
 communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matterbelow, providing a separate opin
ion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Accounting for the Effects o
f Rate RegulationAs described in
 Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated regulatory assets and liabilities balances were $1,067 million and $1,608 million, respectively,as
 of December 31, 2021. The Company’s regulated utilities are subject to regulation by multiple state utility commissions and the Company follows authoritative accounting principles required for rateregulated utilities, which
 requires the effects of rate regulation to be reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. As disclosed by management, for each regulatory jurisdiction where theCompany
 conducts business, the Company assesses, at the end of each reporting period, whether the regulatory assets continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery and regulatory liabilitiescontinue
 to meet the criteria for probable future settlement. This assessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in regulatory environments, recent rate orders (including  recent rate orderson recovery of a specific
 or similar incurred cost to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction) and the status of any pending or pot ential legislation.The
 principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to accounting for the effects of rate regulation is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment bymanagement in accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities relative to 
whether regulatory assets continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery and regulatory liabilities continue to meet thecriteria
 for probable future settlement as a result of changes in regulatory environments, recent rate orders, and the status of any pending or potential legislation. This in turn led to a high degree ofauditor judgment, subject
ivity, and effort in performing audit procedures and evaluating audit evidence obtained relating to management’s judgments.Addressing
 the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These proceduresincluded
 testing the effectiveness  of controls relating to the Company’s regulatory  accounting process, including controls over management’s  assessment and consideration  of factors related  to theprobability
 of  future  recovery  or  settlement.  These  procedures  also included,  among  others,  evaluating  the  reasonableness  of  management’s  judgments  regarding  the  probability  of  recovery  andsettlement
 based on the Company’s correspondence with regulators, status of regulatory proceedings, past practices, and other relevant information; evaluating the related accounting and disclosureimplications; and eva
luating regulatory assets and liabilities balances based on provisions and formulas outlined in rate orders and other correspondence with the Company’s regulators./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

Table of ContentsAmerican Water Works Company, Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unless otherwise noted, in mil
lions, except per share data)Note 1: Organization and Operation
American
 Water Works Company, Inc. (the “Company” or “American Water”) is a holding company for regulated and market-based subsidiaries that provide water and wastewater servicesthroughout
 the  United  States.  References  to  “parent  company”  mean  American  Water  Works  Company,  Inc.,  without  its  subsidiaries.  The  Company’s  primary  business  involves  the  ownership  ofregulated
 utilities that provide water and wastewater services in 14 states in the United States, collectively referred to as the “Regulated Businesses.” The Company also operates other businesses thatprovide
 water and wastewater services within non-reportable operating segments, collectively referred to as the “Market-Based Businesses.” The Company’s primary Market-Based Businesses includethe
 Military  Services  Group  (“MSG”),  which  enters  into  long-term  contracts  with  the  U.S.  government  to  provide  water  and  wastewater  services  on  various  military  installations;  and  the  formerHomeowner Services Group (“HOS”), which provided va
rious warranty protection programs and other home services to residential customers.Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies
Regulation
The
 Company’s  regulated  utilities  are  subject  to  regulation  by  multiple  state  utility  commissions  or  other  entities  engaged  in  utility  regulation,  collectively  referred  to  as  Public  UtilityCommissions
 (“PUCs”).  As  such,  the  Company  follows  authoritative  accounting  principles  required  for  rate  regulated  utilities,  which  requires  the  effects  of  rate  regulation  to  be  reflected  in  theCompany’s
 Consolidated Financial Statements. PUCs generally authorize revenue at levels intended to recover the estimated costs of providing service, plus a return on net investments, or rate base.Regulators
 may also approve accounting treatments, long-term financing programs and cost of capital, operation and maintenance (“O&M”) expenses, capital expenditures, taxes, affiliated transactionsand
 relationships, reorganizations, mergers, acquisitions and dispositions, along with imposing certain penalties or granting certain incentives. Due to timing and other differences in the collection of aregulated
 utility’s revenues, these authoritative accounting principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by a non-regulated entity, to be deferred as a regulatory asset if it isprobable
 that such cost is recoverable through future rates. Conversely, these principles also require the creation of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to beincurred in the future, o
r amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable to customers. See Note 4—Regulatory Matters for additional information.Use of Estimates
The
 preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires that management make estimates, assumptions andjudgments that could aff
ect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Actual results could differ from these estimates, assumptions and judgments. The Company considersits
 critical accounting estimates to include (i) the application of regulatory accounting principles and the related determination and estimation of regulatory assets and liabilities, (ii) revenue recognitionand
 the estimates used in the calculation of unbilled revenue, (iii) accounting for income taxes, (iv) benefit plan assumptions and (v) the estimates and judgments used in determining loss contingencies.The
 Company’s critical accounting estimates that are particularly sensitive to change in the near term are amounts reported for regulatory assets and liabilities, income taxes, benefit plan assumptionsand contingency-relat
ed obligations.Principles of Consolidation
The
 accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of American Water and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained after the elimination ofintercompany balances 
and transactions.Property, Plant and Equipment
Property,
 plant and equipment consists primarily of utility plant utilized by the Company’s regulated utilities. Additions to utility plant and replacement of retirement units of utility plant arecapitalized
 and  include  costs  such  as  materials,  direct  labor,  payroll  taxes  and  benefits,  indirect  items  such  as  engineering  and  supervision,  transportation  and  an  allowance  for  funds  used  duringconstruction (“AFUDC”). Costs for repair, 
maintenance and minor replacements are charged to O&M expense as incurred.The cost of utility plant is depreciated using the straight-line average remaining life, grou
p method. The Company’s regulated utilities record depreciation in conformity with amounts approved byPUCs, after regulatory review of 
the information the Company submits to support its estimates of the assets’ remaining useful lives.88

Table of ContentsNonutility
 property  consists  primarily  of  buildings  and  equipment  utilized  by  the  Company’s  Market-Based  Businesses  and  for  internal  operations.  This  property  is  stated  at  cost,  net  ofaccumulated deprec
iation, which is calculated using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets.When
 units  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  are  replaced,  retired  or  abandoned,  the  carrying  value  is  credited  against  the  asset  and  charged  to  accumulated  depreciation.  To  the  extent  theCompany
 recovers cost of removal or other retirement costs through rates after the retirement costs are incurred, a regulatory asset is recorded. In some cases, the Company recovers retirement coststhrough
 rates during the life of the associated asset and before the costs are incurred. These amounts result in a regulatory liability being reported based on the amounts previously recovered throughcustomer rates, until 
the costs to retire those assets are incurred.The
 costs incurred to acquire and internally develop computer software for internal use are capitalized as a unit of property. The carrying value of these costs amounted to $374 million and $360million as of December 31, 2021 
and 2020, respectively.Cash and Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Funds
Substantially all cash is 
invested in interest-bearing accounts. All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased are considered to be cash equivalents.Restricted funds consist pri
marily of proceeds from financings for the construction and capital improvement of facilities, and deposits for future services under O&M projects. Proceeds are held inescrow
 or interest-bearing  accounts until the designated expenditures are incurred. Restricted funds are classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either current or long-term based upon theintended use of the funds.
Accounts Receivable and Unbilled Revenues
Accounts
 receivable include regulated utility customer accounts receivable, which represent amounts billed to water and wastewater customers generally on a monthly basis. Credit is extendedbased
 on the guidelines of the applicable PUCs and collateral is generally not required. Also included are market-based trade accounts receivable and nonutility customer receivables of the regulatedsubsidiaries. Unbilled revenu
es are accrued when service has been provided but has not been billed to customers and when costs exceed billings on market-based construction contracts.Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts
Allowances
 for uncollectible accounts are maintained for estimated probable losses resulting from the Company’s inability to collect receivables from customers. Accounts that are outstandinglonger than
 the payment terms are considered past due. A number of factors are considered in determining the allowance for uncollectible accounts, including the length of time receivables are past due,previous
 loss history, current economic and societal conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of receivables from customers. The Company generally writes offaccounts
 when they become uncollectible or are over a certain number of days outstanding. An increase in the allowance for uncollectible accounts for the periods ending December 31, 2021 and 2020reflects the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, incl
uding an increase in uncollectible accounts expense and a reduction in amounts written off due to shutoff moratoria in place across the Company’ssubsidiaries. See Note 8—Allowance fo
r Uncollectible Accounts for additional information.Materials and Supplies
Materials and supplies a
re stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the average cost method.Seller Promissory Note
The
 Company’s  seller  promissory  note  is  accounted  for  under  ASC  310,  Receivables,  and  is  classified  as  held  for  investment  and  accounted  for  at  amortized  cost  at  the  present  value  ofconsideration
 received for the sale of its HOS business. Interest income from the seller promissory note is accrued based on the principal amount outstanding and earned over the contractual life of theloan.
Leases
The
 Company  has  operating  and  finance  leases  involving  real  property,  including  facilities,  utility  assets,  vehicles,  and  equipment.  The  Company  determines  if  an  arrangement  is  a  lease  atinception.
 Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, accrued liabilities and operating lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are includedin
 property, plant and equipment, accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has made an accounting policy election not to include operatingleases with a lease te
rm of twelve months or less.89

Table of ContentsROU
 assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and the lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and leaseliabilities
 are generally recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of discounted lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicitrate,
 the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of discounted lease payments. The implicit rate isused
 when readily determinable. ROU assets also include any upfront lease payments and excludes lease incentives. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the leasewhen it is reasonably cert
ain that the option will be exercised. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.The
 Company has lease agreements with lease components (e.g., fixed payments including rent, real estate taxes and insurance costs) and non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenancecosts),
 which are generally accounted for separately; however, the Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for certain leases. Certain lease agreementsinclude
 variable  rental  payments  adjusted  periodically  for  inflation.  Additionally,  the  Company  applies  a  portfolio  approach  to  effectively  account  for  the  ROU  assets  and  lease  liabilities.  TheCompany’s lease agreement
s do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of
 the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of a business. Goodwill is not amortized andmust
 be  allocated  at  the  reporting  unit  level,  which  is  defined  as  an  operating  segment  or  one  level  below,  and  tested  for  impairment  at  least  annually,  or  more  frequently  if  an  event  occurs  orcircumstances change 
that would more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.The
 Company’s goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisition of American Water by an affiliate of the Company’s previous owner in 2003 and has been allocated to reporting units basedon
 the fair values at the date of the acquisitions. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, the reporting units in the Regulated Businesses segment are aggregated into a single reporting unit. Thegoodwill of the Market-Based Business
es is comprised of the MSG reporting unit.The
 Company’s annual impairment testing is performed as of November 30 of each year, in conjunction with the completion of the Company’s annual business plan. The Company assessesqualitative factors
 to determine whether quantitative testing is necessary. If it is determined, based upon qualitative factors, that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not, greaterthan its carrying value,
 no further testing is required. If the Company bypasses the qualitative assessment or performs the qualitative assessment and determines that the estimated fair value of a reportingunit
 is more likely than not, less than its carrying value, a quantitative, fair value-based assessment is performed. This quantitative testing compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to itsrespective net car
rying value, including goodwill, on the measurement date. An impairment loss will be recognized in the amount equal to the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value compared to itsestimated fair va
lue, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.Application of
 goodwill impairment testing requires management judgment, including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value of reporting units. Management estimatesfair
 value using a discounted cash flow analysis. Significant assumptions used in these fair value estimations include, but are not limited to, forecasts of future operating results, discount and growthrates.
The Company believes the assumpt
ions and other considerations used to value goodwill to be appropriate, however, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and considerations used in itsanalysis, the resulting ch
ange could have a material adverse impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 9—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for additional information.Intangible Assets
Intangible
 assets consisted primarily of finite-lived customer relationships associated with the acquisition of Pivotal Home Solutions in June 2018. Finite-lived intangible assets were initiallymeasured at their es
timated fair values and were amortized over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets were consumed or otherwise used.See Note 9—Goodwill and Other Intangible Asse
ts for additional information. All of the Company’s finite-lived intangible assets were sold as part of the HOS sale transaction.90

Table of ContentsImpairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived
 assets include property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets and long-term investments. The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when circumstancesindicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. When such indicators arise, the
 Company estimates the fair value of the long-lived asset from future cash flows expected to result fromits
 use and, if applicable, the eventual disposition of the asset, comparing the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the asset. An impairment loss will be recognized in the amount equal to theexcess of the long-lived ass
et’s carrying value compared to its estimated fair value.The
 long-lived assets of the Company’s regulated utilities are grouped on a separate entity basis for impairment testing, as they are integrated state-wide operations that do not have the option tocurtail service and g
enerally have uniform tariffs. A regulatory asset is charged to earnings if and when future recovery in rates of that asset is no longer probable.The
 Company believes the assumptions and other considerations used to value long-lived assets to be appropriate, however, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and considerationsused in its estimates, th
e resulting change could have a material adverse impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.Advances for Construction and Contributions in Aid of Construction
Regulated
 utility  subsidiaries  may  receive  advances  for  construction  and  contributions  in  aid  of  construction  from  customers,  home  builders  and  real  estate  developers  to  fund  constructionnecessary to extend servi
ce to new areas.Advances are
 refundable for limited periods of time as new customers begin to receive service or other contractual obligations are fulfilled. Included in other current liabilities as of December 31,2021 and 2020 on the Consolidated Balance Shee
ts are estimated refunds of $23 million and $23 million, respectively. Those amounts represent expected refunds during the next 12-month period.Advances
 that  are  no longer  refundable  are  reclassified  to contributions.  Contributions  are  permanent  collections  of plant  assets  or  cash for a particular  construction  project.  For ratemakingpurposes, the amount of such contr
ibutions generally serves as a rate base reduction since the contributions represent non-investor supplied funds.Generally,
 the Company depreciates utility plant funded by contributions and amortizes its contributions balance as a reduction to depreciation expense, producing a result which is functionallyequivalent
 to  reducing  the  original  cost  of  the  utility  plant  for  the  contributions.  In  accordance  with  applicable  regulatory  guidelines,  some  of  the  Company’s  utility  subsidiaries  do  not  amortizecontributions,
 and any contribution received remains on the balance sheet indefinitely. Amortization of contributions in aid of construction was $36 million, $32 million and $29 million for the yearsended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respec
tively.Revenue Recognition
Under
 Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue  From Contracts With Customers, and  all related amendments (collectively, “ASC 606”), a performance obligation is a promisewithin
 a contract to transfer a distinct good or service, or a series of distinct goods and services, to a customer. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied and the customerobtains
 control of promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for goods or services.Under ASC
 606, a contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that the Company determines are within the scopeof
 ASC  606,  the  Company  performs  the  following  five  steps:  (i)  identifies  the  contracts  with  a  customer;  (ii)  identifies  the  performance  obligations  within  the  contract,  including  whether  anyperformance
 obligations are distinct and capable of being distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) determines the transaction price; (iv) allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations inthe contract; and (v) 
recognizes revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies each performance obligation.The
 Company’s  revenues  from  contracts  with  customers  are  discussed  below.  Customer  payments  for  contracts  are  generally  due  within  30  days  of  billing  and  none  of  the  contracts  withcustomers
 have payment terms that exceed one year; therefore, the Company elected to apply the significant financing component practical expedient and no amount of consideration has been allocatedas a financing component.
91

Table of ContentsRegulated Businesses Revenue
Revenue
 from the Company’s Regulated Businesses is generated primarily from water and wastewater services delivered to customers. These contracts contain a single performance obligation,the
 delivery of water and/or wastewater services, as the promise to transfer the individual good or service is not separately identifiable from other promises within the contracts and, therefore, is notdistinct.
 Revenues are recognized over time, as services are provided. There are generally no significant financing components or variable consideration. Revenues include amounts billed to customerson
 a cycle basis and unbilled amounts calculated based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill, to the end of the accounting period. The amountsthat
 the Company has a right to invoice are determined by each customer’s actual usage, an indicator that the invoice amount corresponds directly to the value transferred to the customer. The Companyalso recognizes revenue when 
it is probable that future recovery of previously incurred costs or future refunds that are to be credited to customers will occur through the ratemaking process.Market-Based Businesses Revenue
The Company has long-term,
 fixed fee contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems for the U.S. government on various military installations and facilities owned by municipalcustomers.
 Billing  and  revenue  recognition  for  the  fixed  fee  revenues  occurs  ratably  over  the  term  of  the  contract,  as  customers  simultaneously  receive  and  consume  the  benefits  provided  by  theCompany.
 Additionally, these contracts allow the Company to make capital improvements to underlying infrastructure, which are initiated through separate modifications or amendments to the originalcontract, whereby
 stand-alone, fixed pricing is separately stated for each improvement. The Company has determined that these capital improvements are separate performance obligations, with revenuerecognized
 over time based on performance completed at the end of each reporting period. Losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the losses first become probable and estimable.Revenues
 recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded as unbilled revenues, with billings in excess of revenues recorded as other current liabilities until therecognition criteria
 are met. Changes in contract performance and related estimated contract profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which revisionsare determined. See Note 5—Rev
enue Recognition for additional information.Through
 various warranty protection programs and other home services, the Company previously provided fixed fee services to residential customers for interior and exterior water and sewerlines,
 interior electric and gas lines, heating and cooling systems, water heaters and other home appliances, as well as power surge protection and other related services through its former HOS business.Most of the contracts had a on
e-year term and each service was a separate performance obligation, satisfied over time, as the customers simultaneously received and consumed the benefits provided fromthe
 service. Customers were obligated to pay for the protection programs ratably over 12 months or via a one-time, annual fee, with revenues recognized ratably over time for those services. Advancesfrom customers were deferred
 until the performance obligation was satisfied.Income Taxes
The
 Company and its subsidiaries participate in a consolidated federal income tax return for U.S. tax purposes. Members of the consolidated group are charged with the amount of federal incometax expense determined as
 if they filed separate returns.Certain
 income and expense items are accounted for in different time periods for financial reporting than for income tax reporting purposes. The Company provides deferred income taxes on thedifference
 between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts at which they are carried in the financial statements. These deferred income taxes are based on the enacted tax rates expected tobe
 in effect when these temporary differences are projected to reverse. In addition, the regulated utility subsidiaries recognize regulatory assets and liabilities for the effect on revenues expected to berealized as the tax effects of tem
porary differences, previously flowed through to customers, reverse.Investment tax credits have
 been deferred by the regulated utility subsidiaries and are being amortized to income over the average estimated service lives of the related assets.The
 Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions as a component of income tax expense and accounts for sales tax collected from customers and remitted to taxingauthorities on a net basis. Se
e Note 15—Income Taxes for additional information.92

Table of ContentsAllowance for Funds Used During Construction
AFUDC
 is a non-cash credit to income with a corresponding charge to utility plant that represents the cost of borrowed funds or a return on equity funds devoted to plant under construction. Theregulated
 utility subsidiaries record AFUDC to the extent permitted by the PUCs. The portion of AFUDC attributable to borrowed funds is shown as a reduction of interest, net on the ConsolidatedStatements
 of Operations. Any portion of AFUDC attributable to equity funds would be included in other, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Presented in the table below is AFUDC forthe years ended December 31:
 
2021 2020 2019 Allowance for other funds used during

truction10 13 13 Environmental Costs
The
 Company’s water and wastewater operations and the operations of its Market-Based Businesses are subject to U.S. federal, state, local and foreign requirements relating to environmentalprotection,
 and as such, the Company periodically becomes subject to environmental claims in the normal course of business. Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations or provide afuture
 benefit are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Remediation costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are accrued, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable thatthese
 costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated. A conservation agreement entered into by a subsidiary of the Company with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in 2010and amended in 2017 required th
e subsidiary to, among other provisions, implement certain measures to protect the steelhead trout and its habitat in the Carmel River watershed in the State of California.The
 subsidiary agreed to pay $1 million annually commencing in 2010 with the final payment made in 2021. No remediation costs were accrued as of December 31, 2021 and $1 million was accrued asof December 31, 2020.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The
 Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates. These derivative contracts are entered into for periods consistentwith
 the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and does not useleveraged instruments.
All
 derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Company may designate the derivative as a hedge of the fair value of arecognized asset or liability
 (fair-value hedge) or a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash-flow hedge).Changes in
 the fair value of a fair-value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the underlying hedged item, are recorded in current-period earnings. The gains and losses on the effective portion ofcash-flow
 hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the variability  of cash flows. Any ineffective  portion of designated cash-flow hedges is recognized incurrent-period earnings.
Cash
 flows from derivative contracts are included in net cash provided by operating activities  on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. See Note 12—Long-Term Debt for additionalinformation.

Description Date of Adoption Application Effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements Facilitation of the Effects of
Reference Rate Reform on
Financial Reporting
Provided optional guidance for a limited time to ease the potential accountingburden associated with the transition from London Interbank Offered Rate
(“LIBOR”). The guidance contains optional expedients and exceptions for
contract modifications, hedging relationships, and other transactions that
reference LIBOR or other reference rates expected to be discontinued. The
expedients elected must be applied for all eligible con
tracts or transactions, withthe exception of hedging relationships, which can be applied on an individual
basis.

The standard did not have a material impact on theConsolidated Financial Statements.
Simplifying the Accounting
for Income Taxes
The guidance removes exceptions related to the incremental approach forintraperiod tax allocation, the requirement to recognize a deferred tax liabili
ty forchanges in ownership of a foreign subsidiary or equity method investment, and
the general methodology for calculating income taxes in an interi
m period whenthe year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss. The guidance adds
requirements to reflect changes to tax laws or rates in the annual effective tax rate
computation in the interim period in which the changes were enacted, to
recognize franchise or other similar taxes that are partially based on income as an
income-based tax and any incremental amounts as non-income-based tax, and to
evaluate when a step up in the tax basis of goodwill should be considered part of
the business combination in which the book goodwill was originally recognized
and when it should be considered a separate transaction.

Simplification of financial reporting associated with accounting for convertibleinstruments and contracts in an entity’s own equity. The standard reduced the
number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible
preferred stock. This will result in fewer embedded conversion features being
separately recognized from the host contract. Earnings per share (“EPS”)
calculations have been simplified for certain instruments.

American
 Water continues to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and has experienced financial impacts since the start of the pandemic resulting from lower revenues from the suspension of latefees
 and foregone reconnect fees in certain states, certain incremental O&M expenses, an increase in uncollectible accounts expense and additional debt costs. These impacts are collectively referred toas “financial impacts.”
As
 of February 16, 2022, American Water has commission orders authorizing deferred accounting or cost recovery for COVID-19 financial impacts in 11 of 13 jurisdictions. Other regulatoryactions to date are pr
esented in the table below:Commission Actions

Orders issued with cost recovery
California’s Catastrophi c Event Memorandum Account allows the Company’s California subsidiary to track certainfinancial impacts 
related to the COVID-19 pandemic for future recovery requests. Iowa issued a base rate case order onJune 28, 2021, authorizing recovery 
in rates of the COVID-19 financial impacts deferred within its annual non-recurringexpense rider. Illinois h
as authorized cost recovery of the COVID-19 financial impacts through a special purpose rider overa 24-month period, which was imple
mented effective October 1, 2020. Additionally, Illinois approved a bad debt ridertariff on December 16, 2020, a
llowing collection of actual bad debt expense over last authorized beginning April 2021through February 2023. Illinois approv
ed a stipulation in March 2021 to allow the rider to be extended through the end of2023. Missouri issued a base rate 
case order on April 7, 2021, authorizing recovery in rates of the COVID-19 financialimpacts deferred th
rough March 31, 2021 over a three -year period. CA, IA, IL, MOThe
 Company’s Pennsylvania subsidiary filed for a request with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (the “PaPUC”) to defer as a regulatory asset all identified COVID-19 financialimpacts. On
 September 15, 2021, the PaPUC issued an order approving the Company’s request to defer, with carrying costs, incremental uncollectible expense and other incremental costs net of savingsattributed
 to the COVID-19 pandemic. The PaPUC order denied the request to include lost revenues attributed to the waiver of late fees and reconnect fees and expenses associated with additionalinterest
 costs. Additionally, the PaPUC order approved the request to allow for the continuation of the deferral of financial impacts, rejecting proposals from the intervening parties to define an end dateto
 the deferral in 2021. As a result of the order discussed above, the Company recorded a net $7 million reduction to its regulatory assets and corresponding impacts to revenue, interest expense anduncollectible expense du
ring the third quarter of 2021. The Company continues to evaluate options within its next base rate case to address these denied items and the resulting financial impact.On
 July 28, 2021, the Company’s Tennessee subsidiary filed a stipulation and settlement agreement with the Consumer Advocate Unit in the Financial Division of the Office of the TennesseeAttorney
 General, which reflected agreement on the deferral of COVID-19-related financial impacts through April 30, 2021. On August 9, 2021, the Tennessee Public Utility Commission denied thestipulation
 and  settlement  agreement  and  moved  to  address  the  Company’s  Tennessee  subsidiary’s  petition  to  defer  the  COVID-19  financial  impacts  in  a  future  hearing.  On  August  26,  2021,  theCompany’s Tennessee subsidiary fi
led a motion to withdraw its pending petition, preserving its right to seek recovery of the COVID-19 financial impacts in a future proceeding.In December 2020, the Kentucky Public Se
rvice Commission issued an order denying a request to defer to a regulatory asset the financial impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic.Consistent
 with these regulatory orders, the Company has recorded $36 million in regulatory assets and $6 million of regulatory liabilities for the financial impacts related to the COVID-19pandemic on the Consolidated Bal
ance Sheets as of December 31, 2021.As
 of February 16, 2022, one state, New Jersey, continues moratoria until March 15, 2022, on the suspension of service disconnections due to non-payment. The moratoria on disconnects haveexpired in 12 states.

 which is retroactive to January 1, 2021. The Company’s California subsidiary received authorization for additional annualized water and wastewater revenues of $22 million, excludingagreed
 to reductions for EADIT as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “TCJA”). The EADIT reduction in revenues is $4 million and is offset by a like reduction in income tax expense.On
 January 18, 2022, the Company’s California subsidiary filed for approval of $13 million in 2022 escalation increases, excluding $4 million of reductions related to the TCJA. This filing, which isretroactive to Janua

 average rate assumption method (“ARAM”), and the unprotected EADIT balance of $74 million is being returned to customers over 10 years. The $25 million EADIT reduction includes both theprotected and unprotected
 catch-up period EADIT of $13 million. The catch-up period of January 1, 2018 through May 31, 2021 covers the period from when the lower federal corporate income tax ratewent into effect until n
ew base rates went into effect and will be amortized over 2.5 years.On
 March 2, 2021, an administrative law judge (“ALJ”) in the Office of Administrative Law of New Jersey filed an initial decision with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (the “NJBPU”)that
 recommended denial of a petition filed by the Company’s New Jersey subsidiary, which sought approval of acquisition adjustments in rate base of $29 million associated with the acquisitions ofShorelands
 Water Company, Inc. in 2017 and the Borough of Haddonfield’s water and wastewater systems in 2015. On July 29, 2021, the NJBPU issued an order adopting the ALJ’s initial decisionwithout
 modification. The Company’s New Jersey subsidiary filed a Notice of Appeal with the New Jersey Appellate Division on September 10, 2021. A scheduling order was issued on October 18,2021
 establishing a briefing schedule through March 2022. There is no financial impact to the Company as a result of the NJBPU’s order, since the acquisition adjustments are currently recorded asgoodwill on the Consolidated Balance She

Table of ContentsIncome taxes
 recovered through rates relate to deferred taxes that will likely be refunded to the Company’s customers. On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law, which, among otherthings,
 enacted significant and complex changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), including a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as ofJanuary
 1,  2018.  The  enactment  of  the  TCJA  required  a  re-measurement  of  the  Company’s  deferred  income  taxes.  The  portion  of  this  re-measurement  related  to  the  Regulated  Businesses  wassubstantially offset
 by a regulatory liability as EADIT will be used to benefit its regulated customers in future rates. Twelve of the Company’s regulated subsidiaries are amortizing EADIT and creditingcustomers. The Company expects th
e timing of the amortization of EADIT credits for the one remaining regulated subsidiary to be addressed in a pending or future rate case or other proceedings.Removal costs recovered th
rough rates are estimated costs to retire assets at the end of their expected useful lives that are recovered through customer rates over the lives of the associated assets.On
 August 31, 2018, the Postretirement Medical Benefit Plan was remeasured to reflect an announced plan amendment which changed benefits for certain union and non-union plan participants.As a result of the remeasu
rement, the Company recorded a $227 million reduction to the net accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, with a corresponding regulatory liability.Other
 regulatory  liabilities  include  the  financial  impacts  relating  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  TCJA  reserve  on  revenue,  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefit  balancing  accounts,  legalsettlement proceeds, deferred 
gains and various regulatory balancing accounts.The

Contract assets and contract liabilities are
 the result of timing differences between revenue recognition, billings and cash collections. In the Company’s Market-Based Businesses, certain contractsare
 billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of contractual milestones. Contract assets are recorded when billingoccurs
 subsequent  to  revenue  recognition  and  are  reclassified  to  accounts  receivable  when  billed  and  the  right  to  consideration  becomes  unconditional.  Contract  liabilities  are  recorded  when  theCompany
 receives  advances  from  customers  prior  to  satisfying  contractual  performance  obligations,  particularly  for  construction  contracts,  and  are  recognized  as  revenue  when  the  associatedperformance obligat
ions are satisfied.Contract
 assets of $71 million, $39 million and $13 million are included in unbilled revenues on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Therewere
 $71 million of contract assets added during 2021, and $39 million of contract assets were transferred to accounts receivable during 2021. There were $60 million of contract assets added during2020, and $34 million of contrac
t assets were transferred to accounts receivable during 2020.Contract
 liabilities of $19 million, $35 million and $27 million are included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.There
 were $152 million of contract liabilities added during 2021, and $168 million of contract liabilities were recognized as revenue during 2021. There were $120 million of contract liabilities addedduring 2020, and $112 million of contr
act liabilities were recognized as revenue during 2020.103

Table of ContentsRemaining Performance Obligations
Remaining
 performance obligations (“RPOs”) represent revenues the Company expects to recognize in the future from contracts that are in progress. The Company enters into agreements for theprovision
 of services to water and wastewater facilities for the U.S. military, municipalities and other customers. As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s O&M and capital improvement contracts inthe Market-Based Businesse
s have RPOs. Contracts with the U.S. government for work on various military installations expire between 2051 and 2071 and have RPOs of $6.2 billion as of December 31,2021,
 as measured by estimated remaining contract revenue. Such contracts are subject to customary termination provisions held by the U.S. government, prior to the agreed-upon contract expiration.Contracts with
 municipalities and commercial customers expire between 2022 and 2038 and have RPOs of $584 million as of December 31, 2021, as measured by estimated remaining contract revenue.Some
 of  the  Company’s  long-term  contracts  to  operate  and  maintain  the  federal  government’s,  a  municipality’s  or  other  party’s  water  or  wastewater  treatment  and  delivery  facilities  includeresponsibility

On December 9, 2021 (the
 “Closing Date”), the Company sold all of the equity interests in subsidiaries that comprised HOS to a wholly owned subsidiary of funds advised by Apax Partners LLP,a
 global private equity advisory firm (the “Buyer”), for total consideration of approximately $1.275 billion, resulting in pre-tax gain on sale of $748 million. The consideration is comprised of $480million
 in cash, a seller promissory note issued by the Buyer in the principal amount of $720 million, and a contingent cash payment of $75 million payable upon satisfaction of certain conditions on orbefore December 31, 2023. 
See Note 19—Fair Value of Financial Information for additional information relating to the seller promissory note and contingent cash payment.The
 seller note has a five-year term, is payable in cash, and bears interest at a rate of 7.00% per year during the term. The repayment obligations of the Buyer under the seller note have beensecured by a first
 priority security interest in certain property of the Buyer and the former HOS subsidiaries, including their cash and securities accounts, as well as a pledge of the equity interests in eachof those
 subsidiaries, subject to certain limitations and exceptions. The seller note requires compliance with affirmative and negative covenants (subject to certain conditions, limitations and exceptions),including a covenant lim
iting the incurrence by the Buyer and certain affiliates of additional indebtedness in excess of certain thresholds, but does not include any financial maintenance covenants.Beginning
 December 9, 2024, the Company has a put right pursuant to which it may require the seller note to be repaid in full at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, except that upon theoccurrence
 of a disruption event in the broadly syndicated term loan “B” debt financing market, repayment by the Buyer pursuant to the Company’s exercise of the put right will be delayed until themarket disruption event 
ends.The
 seller note may not be prepaid at the Buyer’s election except in certain limited circumstances before the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date. If the Buyer seeks to repay the seller note inbreach
 of this non-call provision, an event of default will occur under the seller note and the Company may, among other actions, demand repayment in full together with a premium ranging from105.5% to 107.5% of the outstanding prin
cipal amount of the loan and a customary “make-whole” payment.The
 Company and the Buyer also entered into a revenue share agreement, pursuant to which the Company is to receive 10% of the revenue generated from customers who are billed for homewarranty
 services through an applicable Company subsidiary (an “on-bill” arrangement), and 15% of the revenue generated from any future on-bill arrangements entered into after the closing. Unlessearlier termin
ated, this agreement has a term of up to 15 years, which may be renewed for up to two five-year periods.The pro forma impact of

 2019, the Company completed and submitted its project completion certification to the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (“NJEDA”) in connection with its capital investment inits
 corporate headquarters in Camden, New Jersey. The NJEDA determined that the Company is qualified to receive $164 million in tax credits over a ten-year period. The Company is required to meetvarious
 annual requirements in order to monetize one-tenth of the tax credits annually and is subject to a claw-back period if the Company does not meet certain NJEDA requirements of the tax creditprogram
 in years 11 through 15. The Company has made the necessary annual filings for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 and expects to file the 2021 filing by April 30, 2022. As a result,the
 Company  had  receivables  of  $49  million  and  $115  million  in  other  current  assets  and  other  long-term  assets,  respectively,  on  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets  as  of  December  31,  2021.  Thesubmitted filings are und
er review by the NJEDA and it is expected that the Company will receive final NJEDA approval and monetize the credits in the first half of 2022.In
 March  2020,  in  connection  with  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  NJEDA,  pursuant  to  Executive  Order  103  -  State  of  Emergency  and  a  Public  Health  Emergency,  temporarily  waived  therequirement
 that a full-time employee must spend at least 80% of his or her time at the qualified business facility (“QBF”) to meet the definition of eligible position or full-time job. The waiver willcontinue
 for as long as New Jersey’s Executive Order 281 is valid. On July 2, 2021, New Jersey’s Governor approved a bill that revised provisions of the Economic Recovery Act of 2020 and othereconomic
 development programs, including amending the definition of an eligible position and full-time job in the Grow New Jersey Program and replacing the 80% requirement of time spent at theQBF.
 The bill states that an eligible position is one that is filled by a full-time employee who has their primary office at the QBF and spends at least 60% of their time at the QBF. The bill specificallystates that it supersed
es the existing regulations and existing incentive agreements that require an eligible employee spend at least 80% of their time at the QBF.106

Table of ContentsDividends and Distributions
The Company’s Board of Directors authorizes the payment of dividends. The Company’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock is subject
 to having access to sufficient sources of liquidity,net income
 and cash flows of the Company’s subsidiaries, the receipt of dividends and direct and indirect distributions from, and repayments of indebtedness of, the Company’s subsidiaries, compliancewith Delaware corporate and o
ther laws, compliance with the contractual provisions of debt and other agreements and other factors.The
 Company’s dividend rate on its common stock is determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and takes into consideration, among other factors, current and possible futuredevelopments
 that may affect the Company’s income and cash flows. When dividends on common stock are declared, they are typically paid in March, June, September and December. Historically,dividends have
 been paid quarterly to holders of record less than 30 days prior to the distribution date. Since the dividends on the Company’s common stock are not cumulative, only declared dividendsare paid.
During
 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company paid $428 million, $389 million and $353 million in cash dividends, respectively. Presented in the table below is the per share cash dividends paid forthe years ended December 31:

 December 9, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.6025 per share payable on March 1, 2022, to shareholders of record as of February 8,2022.
Under
 applicable law, the Company’s subsidiaries may pay dividends on their capital stock or other equity only from retained, undistributed or current earnings. A significant loss recorded at asubsidiary
 may  limit  the  amount  of  the  dividend  that  the  subsidiary  can  pay.  The  ability  of  the  Company’s  subsidiaries  to  pay  upstream  dividends,  make  other  upstream  distributions  or  repayindebtedness
 to parent company or American Water Capital Corp. (“AWCC”), the Company’s wholly owned financing subsidiary, as applicable, is subject to compliance with applicable corporate, taxand
 other  laws,  regulatory  restrictions  and financial  and  other  contractual  obligations,  including,  for  example,  (i)  regulatory  capital,  surplus  or net worth requirements,  (ii)  outstanding  debt serviceobligations,
 (iii) requirements to make preferred and preference stock dividend payments, and (iv) other contractual agreements, covenants or obligations made or entered into by the Company and itssubsidiaries.
Regulatory Restrictions on Indebtedness
The
 issuance of long-term debt or equity securities by the Company or long-term debt by AWCC does not require authorization of any state PUC if no guarantee or pledge of the regulatedsubsidiaries
 is utilized. Based on the needs of the Regulated Businesses and parent company, AWCC may borrow funds or issue its debt in the capital markets and then, through intercompany loans,provide
 these borrowings to the Regulated Businesses or parent company. PUC authorization  is generally  required  for the regulated  subsidiaries to incur long-term  debt. The Company’s regulatedsubsidiaries normally
 obtain these required PUC authorizations on a periodic basis to cover their anticipated financing needs for a period of time, or, as necessary, in connection with a specific financingor refinancing of debt.
Note 11: Stock Based Compensation
The
 Company has granted stock options, stock units and dividend equivalents to non-employee directors, officers and other key employees of the Company pursuant to the terms of its 2007Omnibus
 Equity Compensation Plan (the “2007 Plan”). Stock units under the 2007 Plan generally vest based on (i) continued employment with the Company (“RSUs”), or (ii) continued employmentwith
 the Company where distribution of the shares is subject to the satisfaction in whole or in part of stated performance-based goals (“PSUs”). The 2007 Plan has been replaced by the 2017 OmnibusPlan,
 as defined below, and no additional awards may be granted under the 2007 Plan. However, shares may still be issued under the 2007 Plan pursuant to the terms of awards previously issued underthat plan prior to May 12, 2017.
109

Table of ContentsIn
 May 2017, the Company’s shareholders approved the American Water Works Company, Inc. 2017 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the “2017 Omnibus Plan”). The Company has grantedstock
 units, including RSUs and PSUs, stock awards and dividend equivalents to non-employee directors, officers and employees under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. A total of 7.2 million shares of commonstock
 may be issued under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. As of December 31, 2021, 6.5 million shares were available for grant under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. The 2017 Omnibus Plan provides that grants ofawards may be
 in any of the following forms: incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock units, stock awards, other stock-based awards and dividend equivalents.Dividend equivalents may be gr
anted only on stock units or other stock-based awards. The 2017 Omnibus Plan expires in 2027.The
 cost of services received from employees in exchange for the issuance of stock options and restricted stock awards is measured based on the grant date fair value of the awards issued. Thevalue
 of stock options and stock unit awards at the date of the grant is amortized through expense over the requisite service period. All awards granted in 2021, 2020 and 2019 are classified as equity.The Company recognizes compensa
tion expense for stock awards over the vesting period of the award. The Company stratified its grant populations and used historic employee turnover rates to estimateemployee
 forfeitures. The estimated rate is compared to the actual forfeitures at the end of the reporting period and adjusted as necessary. There have been no significant adjustments to the forfeiturerates
 during 2021, 2020 and 2019. There were no grants of stock options to employees after 2016, and the remaining stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2021 were not material. Presented inthe table below is the stock

 to limitations on deductibility imposed by the Federal income tax code, the Company receives a tax deduction based on the intrinsic value of the award at the exercise date for stockoptions and the distribution da
te for stock units. For each award, throughout the requisite service period, the Company records the tax impacts related to compensation costs as deferred income tax assets.The tax deductions in excess of the deferred benefits recorded thr
oughout the requisite service period are recorded to the Consolidated Statements of Operations and are presented in the financing sectionof the Consolidated Statemen
ts of Cash Flows.Stock Units
During
 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company granted RSUs to certain employees under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. RSUs generally vest based on continued employment with the Company overperiods ranging from 
one  to three years.During
 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company granted stock units to non-employee  directors  under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. The stock units were vested in full on the date of grant; however,distribution
 of the shares will be made within 30 days of the earlier of (i) 15 months after the date of the last annual meeting of shareholders, subject to any deferral election by the director, or (ii) theparticipant’s separ
ation from service. Because these stock units vested on the grant date, the total grant date fair value was recorded in operation and maintenance expense on the grant date.The
 RSUs are valued at the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant and the majority vest ratably over a three-year service period. These RSUs are amortizedthrough expense over the requis
ite service period using the straight-line method.110

Table of ContentsEmployee Stock Purchase Plan
The
 Company maintains a nonqualified employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) that expires in 2027 through which employee participants (other than the Company’s executive officers) mayuse
 payroll deductions to acquire Company common stock at a purchase price of 85% of the fair market value of the common stock at the end of a three-month purchase period. A total of 2.0 millionshares may be issued under the ESPP, and as of December 31, 2021, there were 1.6 million shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP. The ESPP is considered compensatory. During
the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 
and 2019, the Company issued 80 thousand, 86 thousand and 88 thousand shares, respectively, under the ESPP.Note 12: Long-Term Debt

 May  10,  2021,  AWCC  completed  a  $1.1  billion  debt  offering  which  included  the  sale  of  $550  million  aggregate  principal  amount  of  its  2.30%  senior  notes  due  2031  and  $550million
 aggregate principal amount of its 3.25% senior notes due 2051. At the closing of the offering, AWCC received, after deduction of underwriting discounts and before deduction of offeringexpenses, net
 proceeds of $1,086 million. AWCC used the net proceeds of this offering: (i) to lend funds to parent company and its regulated subsidiaries; (ii) to prepay $251 million aggregate principalamount of AWCC’s outstanding 5.77% Series D Senior Not
es due December 21, 2021 (the “Series D Notes”) and $76 million aggregate principal amount of AWCC’s outstanding 6.55% Series H SeniorNotes
 due May 15, 2023 (the “Series H Notes,” and together with the Series D Notes, the “Series Notes”); (iii) to repay AWCC’s commercial paper obligations; and (iv) for general corporate purposes.After
 the prepayments described above, none of the Series D Notes, and approximately $14 million aggregate principal amount of the Series H Notes, remain outstanding. As a result of AWCC’sprepayment
 of the Series Notes, a make-whole premium of $15 million was paid to the holders thereof on June 14, 2021. Substantially all of the early debt extinguishment costs were allocable to theCompany’s utility subsidiari
es and recorded as regulatory assets, as the Company believes they are probable of recovery in future rates.One
 of the principal market risks to which the Company is exposed is changes in interest rates. In order to manage the exposure, the Company follows risk management policies and procedures,including
 the use of derivative contracts such as swaps. The Company also reduces exposure to interest rates by managing commercial paper and debt maturities. The Company does not enter intoderivative contracts
 for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments. The derivative contracts entered into are for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures. The Companyis
 exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations and minimizes this risk by dealing only with leading, creditworthy financial institutionshaving long-term credi
t ratings of “A” or better.113

Table of ContentsOn
 May 6, 2021, the  Company entered into two 10-year treasury lock agreements, with notional  amounts of $125 million and $150 million, to  reduce interest rate exposure on debt, which wassubsequently
 issued on May 10, 2021. These treasury lock agreements had an average fixed rate of 1.58%. The Company designated these treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges, with their fairvalue
 recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss. On  May 10, 2021, the Company terminated these two  treasury lock agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $275 million,realizing
 a  net  gain  of  less  than  $1  million,  to  be  amortized  through  interest,  net  over  a  10-year  period,  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  $1.1  billion  new  debt  issued  on  May  10,  2021.  Noineffectiveness was re
cognized on hedging instruments for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.Note 13: Short-Term Debt
Liquidity
 needs for capital investment, working capital and other financial commitments are generally funded through cash flows from operations, public and private debt offerings, commercialpaper
 markets and, if and to the extent necessary, borrowings under the AWCC revolving credit facility. Additionally, proceeds from the aforementioned sales of HOS and the Company’s New Yorksubsidiary
 will be used primarily for capital investment in the Regulated Businesses. The revolving credit facility provides $2.25 billion in aggregate total commitments from a diversified group offinancial
 institutions. The termination date of the credit agreement with respect to AWCC’s revolving credit facility is March 21, 2025. The facility is used principally to support AWCC’s commercialpaper
 program, to provide additional liquidity support and to provide a sub-limit of up to $150 million for letters of credit. Letters of credit are non-debt instruments maintained to provide credit supportfor
 certain transactions as requested by third parties. Subject  to satisfying certain conditions, the credit agreement also permits AWCC to increase the maximum commitment under the facility by up toan
 aggregate of $500 million. As  of December 31, 2021, AWCC had no outstanding borrowings and $76 million of outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility, with $1.59 billionavailable
 to  fulfill  the  Company’s short-term  liquidity  needs and  to issue  letters  of  credit.  The Company  regularly  evaluates  the capital  markets  and closely  monitors  the  financial  condition  of thefinancial
 institutions with contractual commitments in its revolving credit facility. Interest rates on advances under the facility are based on a credit spread to the LIBOR rate (or applicable marketreplacement
 rate) or base rate in accordance with Moody Investors Service’s and Standard & Poor’s Financial Services’ then applicable credit rating on AWCC’s senior unsecured, non-credit enhanceddebt.
On
 March 20, 2020, AWCC entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement, by and among parent company, AWCC and the lenders party thereto (the “Term Loan Facility”). As of December 31,2020, $500 million of principal was ou
tstanding under the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility commitments terminated at maturity on March 19, 2021, and the Term Loan Facility was repaid infull. Borrowings under the Term Loan Fa
cility bore interest at a variable annual rate based on LIBOR, plus a margin of 0.80%.Short-term debt consists of commercial paper and credit facility borrowin
gs totaling $584 million and $786 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The weighted average interestrate on AWCC’s outstanding sh
ort-term borrowings was approximately 0.25%, for the year ended December 31, 2021. The weighted average interest rate on AWCC’s outstanding short-term borrowingswas
 1.16%, for the year ended December  31, 2020, including $500 million  of outstanding principal  on the Term Loan Facility  as of December  31, 2020. As of December  31, 2021 there were nocommercial paper or credit facility b
orrowings outstanding with maturities greater than three months.114

The
 Company recognized no federal net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards as of December 31, 2021 and $366 million as of December 31, 2020. The Company fully utilized its federal NOLcarryforwards in 2021 due to the s
ale of HOS, and therefore, no valuation allowance is required.As of
 December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had state NOLs of $123 million and $357 million, respectively, a portion of which are offset by a valuation allowance as the Company does notbelieve these NOLs are more 
likely than not to be realized. The state NOL carryforwards expire in 2021 through 2041.The
 Company files income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal,state
 or local or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years on or before 2012. The Company has state income tax examinations in progress and does not expect material adjustmentsto result.

$ 10 Note 16: Employee Benefits
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits
The Company maintains noncontribu
tory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of its regulated utility and shared services operations. Benefits under the plans are based on theemployee’s
 years of service and compensation. The pension plans have been closed for all new employees. The pension plans were closed for most employees hired on or after January 1, 2006. Unionemployees
 hired on or after January 1, 2001, except for specific eligible groups specified in the plan, had their accrued benefit frozen and will be able to receive this benefit as a lump sum upontermination or ret
irement. Union employees hired on or after January 1, 2001 and non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2006 are provided with a 5.25% of base pay defined contribution plan.The
 Company does not participate in a multi-employer plan. The Company also has unfunded noncontributory supplemental nonqualified pension plans that provide additional retirement benefits tocertain employees.
The
 Company’s pension funding practice is to contribute at least the greater of the minimum amount required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or the normal cost.Further, the Company will consider additional cash contributions and/or available prefunding balances if needed to avoid “at
 risk” status and benefit restrictions under the Pension Protection Act of 2006(“PPA”).
 The Company may also consider increased contributions, based on other financial requirements and the plans’ funded position. Pension expense in excess of the amount contributed to thepension
 plans  is  deferred  by  certain  regulated  subsidiaries  pending  future  recovery  in  rates  charged  for  utility  services  as  contributions  are  made  to  the  plans.  See  Note  4—Regulatory  Matters  foradditional
 information. Pension plan assets are invested in a number of actively managed, commingled funds, and limited partnerships including equities, fixed income securities, guaranteed annuitycontracts with insurance 
companies, real estate funds and real estate investment trusts (“REITs”).The
 Company maintains other postretirement benefit plans providing varying levels of medical and life insurance to eligible retirees. The retiree welfare plans are closed for union employeeshired
 on or after January 1, 2006. The plans had previously closed for non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2002. The Company’s policy is to fund other postretirement benefit costs up tothe
 amount recoverable through rates. Assets of the plans are invested in a number of actively managed funds in the form of separate accounts, commingled funds and limited partnerships, includingequities and fixed incom
e securities.The
 investment policy guideline of the pension plan is focused on diversification, improving returns and reducing the volatility of the funded status over a long-term horizon. The investmentpolicy
 guidelines of the postretirement plans focus on the appropriate strategy given the funded status of the plans. None of the Company’s securities are included in pension or other postretirementbenefit plan assets.
The Company uses fair value for all classes of as
sets in the calculation of market-related value of plan assets. As of 2018, the fair values and asset allocations of the pension plan assets include theAmerican Water Pension Plan, 
the New York Water Service Corporation Pension Plan, and the Shorelands Water Company, Inc. Pension Plan.As
 a result of the sale of the Company’s New York subsidiary, there will be a transfer of assets from two pension plans and two other postretirement benefit plans from the Company to Liberty.The Company does not expect the asse
ts to be transferred to be a significant percentage of the Company’s overall pension and other postretirement benefit plans.118

 Company’s postretirement benefit plans have different levels of funded status and the assets are held under various trusts. The investments and risk mitigation strategies for the plans aretailored specifically for each trust. In setting new strategic asset mixes, co
nsideration is given to the likelihood that the selected asset allocation will effectively fund the projected plan liabilities and meetthe
 risk  tolerance  criteria  of  the  Company.  The  Company  periodically  updates  the  long-term,  strategic  asset  allocations  for  these  plans  through  asset  liability  studies  and  uses  various  analytics  todetermine the optim
al asset allocation. Considerations include plan liability characteristics, liquidity needs, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns.In
 2018, the Company announced plan design changes to the medical bargaining benefit plan, which resulted in a cap on future benefits and an over funded postretirement medical benefitsbargaining plan.
 As a result of the change in funded status, the Company decreased the investment risk in the plan and reduced its exposure to changes in interest rates by matching the assets of the planto the projected cash f
lows for future benefit payments of the liability.The
 Company engages third-party investment managers for all invested assets. Managers are not permitted to invest outside of the asset class (e.g. fixed income, equity, alternatives) or strategyfor
 which they have been appointed. Investment management agreements and recurring performance and attribution analysis are used as tools to ensure investment managers invest solely within theinvestment strategy th
ey have been provided. Futures and options may be used to adjust portfolio duration to align with a plan’s targeted investment policy.In
 order to minimize asset volatility relative to the liabilities, a portion of plan assets is allocated to long duration fixed income investments that are exposed to interest rate risk. Increases ininterest
 rates generally will result in a decline in the value of fixed income assets while reducing the present value of the liabilities. Conversely, rate decreases will increase fixed income assets, partiallyoffsetting
 the  related  increase  in  the  liabilities.  Within  equities,  risk  is  mitigated  by  constructing  a  portfolio  that  is  broadly  diversified  by  geography,  market  capitalization,  manager  mandate  size,investment style
 and process. For the postretirement medical bargaining plan, its asset structure is designed to meet the cash flows of the liabilities. This design reduces the plan’s exposure to changes ininterest rates.
Actual
 allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy updates, market value fluctuations, the length of time it takes to fully implement investmentallocations,
 and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. The asset allocation is rebalanced on a quarterly basis, if necessary. Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association (“VEBA”) Trustassets
 include the American Water Postretirement Medical Benefits Bargaining Plan, the New York Water Service Corporation Postretirement Medical Benefits Bargaining Plan, the American WaterPostretirement Medic
al Benefits Non-Bargaining Plan, and the American Water Life Insurance Trust.120

Cash—Cash
 and investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased, including certain short-term fixed-income securities, are considered cash and are included in the recurringfair value measure
ments hierarchy as Level 1.Equity
 securities—For  equity  securities,  the  trustees  obtain  prices  from  pricing  services,  whose  prices  are  obtained  from  direct  feeds  from  market  exchanges,  that  the  Company  is  able  toindependently
 corroborate. Certain equity securities are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and categorized as Level 1. Other equities, such as international securities held in the pensionplan,
 are invested in commingled funds and/or limited partnerships. These funds are valued to reflect the plan fund’s interest in the fund based on the reported year-end net asset value. Since net assetvalue
 is not directly observable or not available on a nationally recognized securities exchange for the commingled funds, they are categorized as Level 2. For limited partnerships, the assets as a wholeare categorized as Level 3 
due to the fact that the partnership provides the pricing and the pricing inputs are less readily observable. In addition, the limited partnership vehicle cannot be readily traded.Fixed-income
 securities—The majority of U.S. Treasury securities and government bonds have been categorized as Level 1 because they trade in highly-liquid and transparent markets and theirprices
 can be corroborated. The fair values of corporate bonds, mortgage backed securities, and certain government bonds are based on prices that reflect observable market information, such as actualtrade
 information of similar securities. They are categorized as Level 2 because the valuations are calculated using models which utilize actively traded market data that the Company can corroborate.Exchange-traded options and fu
tures, for which market quotations are readily available, are valued at the last reported sale price or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which theyare traded and are c
lassified as Level 1.Real estate fund—Real est
ate fund is categorized as Level 3 as the fund uses significant unobservable inputs for fair value measurement and the vehicle is in the form of a limited partnership.122

Table of ContentsREITs—REITs
 are invested in commingled funds. Commingled funds are valued to reflect the plan fund’s interest in the fund based on the reported year-end net asset value. Since the net assetvalue is not directly obse
rvable for the commingled funds, they are categorized as Level 2.Guaranteed annuity contra
cts—Guaranteed annuity contracts are categorized as Level 3 because the investments are not publicly quoted. Since these market values are determined by the provider,they are not highly observabl
e and have been categorized as Level 3. Exchange-traded future and option positions are reported in accordance with changes in variation margins that are settled daily.Presented in the table be

 2006, the PPA replaced the funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans by requiring that defined benefit plans contribute to 100% of the current liability funding target over sevenyears.
 Defined benefit plans with a funding status of less than 80% of the current liability are defined as being “at risk” and additional funding requirements and benefit restrictions may apply. The PPAwas effective for the 2008 plan year with
 short-term phase-in provisions for both the funding target and at-risk determination. The Company’s qualified defined benefit plan is currently funded above theat-risk
 threshold, and therefore the Company expects that the plans will not be subject to the “at risk” funding requirements of the PPA. The Company is proactively monitoring the plan’s funded statusand projected contribut
ions under the law to appropriately manage the potential impact on cash requirements.Minimum funding requirements for the qualified defined benefit pensio
n plan are determined by government regulations and not by accounting pronouncements. The Company plans to contributeamounts
 at least equal to or greater than the minimum required contributions or the normal cost in 2022 to the qualified pension plans. Contributions may be in the form of cash contributions as well asavailable prefunding ba
lances.Presented in the table be

 for  pensions  and  other  postretirement  benefits  requires  an  extensive  use  of  assumptions  about  the  discount  rate,  expected  return  on  plan  assets,  the  rate  of  future  compensationincreases received by 
the Company’s employees, mortality, turnover and medical costs. Each assumption is reviewed annually. The assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experienceover time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the o
verall economy. These differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirementbenefit expense that th
e Company recognizes.Presented in the table be

The
 discount rate assumption was determined for the pension and postretirement benefit plans independently. The Company uses an approach that approximates the process of settlement ofobligations
 tailored to the plans’ expected cash flows by matching the plans’ cash flows to the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds. Historically, for each plan, thediscount rate was developed a
t the level equivalent rate that would produce the same present value as that using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments.125

Table of ContentsThe
 expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return, prior to administrative and investment management fees, for current and planned assetclasses
 in the plans’ investment portfolios. Assumed projected rates of return for each of the plans’ projected asset classes were selected after analyzing historical experience and future expectations ofthe returns and volatility of the various asset classes
. Based on the target asset allocation for each asset class, the overall expected rate of return for the portfolio was developed, adjusted for historical andexpected
 experience of active portfolio management results compared to the benchmark returns. The Company’s pension expense increases as the expected return on assets decreases. The Companyused
 an expected return on plan assets of 6.50% to estimate its 2021 pension benefit costs, and an expected blended return based on weighted assets of 3.67% to estimate its 2021 other postretirementbenefit costs.
The
 Company had previously adopted a mortality table based on the Society of Actuaries RP 2014 mortality table including a generational MP-2018 projection scale. In 2020, the Companyadopted the
 Pri-2012 base mortality table and the new MP-2020 mortality improvement scale to replace the previous assumption. In 2021, the Company utilized the Pri-2012 base mortality table and thenew MP-2021 mortality improvem
ent scale to replace the previous assumption.Presented in the table be

Due to the amount of lump sum payment distributions from the Company’s New York Wate r Service Corporation Pension Plan, settlement charges of less than $1 million were recorded for both years ended December 31, 2021 and2020.
 In accordance with existing regulatory accounting treatment, the Company has maintained the settlement charges in regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount is being amortized in accordance withexisting regulatory practice.
The
 Company’s policy is to recognize curtailments when the total expected future service of plan participants is reduced by greater than 10% due to an event that results in terminations and/orretirements.
Cumulative
 gains and losses that are in excess of 10% of the greater of either the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized over the expected average remainingfuture service of the 
current active membership for the plans.126

Table of ContentsSavings Plans for Employees
The
 Company maintains 401(k) savings plans that allow employees to save for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. Employees can make contributions that are invested at their direction in one ormore
 funds. The Company makes matching contributions based on a percentage of an employee’s contribution, subject to certain limitations. Due to the Company’s discontinuing new entrants into thedefined
 benefit pension plan, on January 1, 2006, the Company began providing an additional 5.25% of base pay defined contribution benefit for union employees hired on or after January 1, 2001 andnon-union
 employees  hired  on  or  after  January  1,  2006.  The  Company’s  401(k)  savings  plan  expenses  totaled  $14  million,  $12  million  and  $12  million  for  2021,  2020  and  2019,  respectively.Additionally,
 the Company’s 5.25% of base pay defined contribution benefit expenses totaled $16 million, $15 million and $13 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. All of the Company’scontributions are invest
ed in one or more funds at the direction of the employees.Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies

The
 Company is routinely involved in legal actions incident to the normal conduct of its business. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has accrued approximately $7 million of probable losscontingencies and has estimated
 that the maximum amount of losses associated with reasonably possible loss contingencies that can be reasonably estimated is $2 million. For certain matters, claims andactions, the Company is unable to 
estimate possible losses. The Company believes that damages or settlements, if any, recovered by plaintiffs in such matters, claims or actions, other than as described inthis Note 17—Commitments and Contingen
cies, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.West Virginia Elk River Fre
edom Industries Chemical SpillOn
 June 8, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia granted final approval of a settlement class and global class action settlement (the “Settlement”) for all claimsand
 potential claims by all class members (collectively, the “West Virginia Plaintiffs”) arising out of the January 2014 Freedom Industries, Inc. chemical spill in West Virginia. The effective date of theSettlement
 was July 16, 2018. Under the terms and conditions of the Settlement, the Company’s West Virginia subsidiary (“WVAWC”) and certain other Company affiliated entities did not admit, andwill not admit, any fault o
r liability for any of the allegations made by the West Virginia Plaintiffs in any of the actions that were resolved.127

Table of ContentsThe aggregate pre-tax amount contributed by WVAWC of the $126 million portion of the Settlement with respect to
 the Company, net of insurance recoveries, is $19 million. As of December 31,2021,
 $0.5 million of the aggregate Settlement amount of $126 million has been reflected in accrued liabilities, and $0.5 million in offsetting insurance receivables have been reflected in other currentassets
 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount reflected in accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2021 reflects reductions in the liability and appropriate reductions to the offsetting insurancereceivable
 reflected in other current assets, associated with payments made to the Settlement fund, the receipt of a determination by the Settlement fund’s appeal adjudicator on all remaining medicalclaims and the calcu
lation of remaining attorneys’ fees and claims administration costs. The Company funded WVAWC’s contributions to the Settlement through existing sources of liquidity.Dunbar, West Virginia Water Main Break Class A
ction LitigationOn the
 evening of June 23, 2015, a 36-inch pre-stressed concrete transmission water main, installed in the early 1970s, failed. The water main is part of the West Relay pumping station located inthe
 City of Dunbar, West Virginia and owned by WVAWC. The failure of the main caused water outages and low pressure for up to approximately 25,000 WVAWC customers. In the early morninghours
 of June 25, 2015, crews completed a repair, but that same day, the repair developed a leak. On June 26, 2015, a second repair was completed and service was restored that day to approximately80%
 of the impacted customers, and to the remaining approximately 20% by the next morning. The second repair showed signs of leaking, but the water main was usable until June 29, 2015 to allowtanks
 to refill. The system was reconfigured to maintain service to all but approximately 3,000 customers while a final repair was being completed safely on June 30, 2015. Water service was fullyrestored by July 1, 2015 to all custo
mers affected by this event.On
 June 2, 2017, a complaint captioned Jeffries,  et al. v. West Virginia-American Water Company was  filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in Kanawha County on behalf of an alleged class ofresidents
 and business owners who lost water service or pressure as a result of the Dunbar main break. The complaint alleges breach of contract by WVAWC for failure to supply water, violation ofWest
 Virginia law regarding the sufficiency of WVAWC’s facilities and negligence by WVAWC in the design, maintenance and operation of the water system. The Jeffries  plaintiffs  seek unspecifiedalleged
 damages on behalf of the class for lost profits, annoyance and inconvenience, and loss of use, as well as punitive damages for willful, reckless and wanton behavior in not addressing the risk ofpipe failure and a la
rge outage.In
 February 2020, the Jeffries  plaintiffs  filed a motion seeking class certification on the issues of breach of contract and negligence, and to determine the applicability of punitive damages and amultiplier
 for those damages if imposed. In July 2020, the Circuit Court entered an order granting the Jeffries  plaintiffs’  motion for certification of a class regarding certain liability issues but denyingcertification
 of a class to determine a punitive damages multiplier. In August 2020, WVAWC filed a Petition for Writ of Prohibition in the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia seeking to vacateor
 remand the Circuit Court’s order certifying the issues class. On January 28, 2021, the Supreme Court of Appeals remanded the case back to the Circuit Court for further consideration in light of adecision
 issued in another case relating to the class certification issues raised on appeal. On July 16, 2021, oral argument was heard by the Circuit Court on the issue of addressing the Supreme Court ofAppeals’ remand. This matt
er remains pending.The
 Company and WVAWC believe  that  WVAWC has valid, meritorious  defenses to the claims  raised  in this class action  complaint.  WVAWC is vigorously  defending itself  against theseallegations. The Company cannot 
currently determine the likelihood of a loss, if any, or estimate the amount of any loss or a range of such losses related to this proceeding.Chattanooga, Tennessee Water Main Break Class Ac
tion LitigationOn
 September 12, 2019, the Company’s Tennessee subsidiary (“TAWC”), experienced a leak in a 36-inch water transmission main, which caused service fluctuations or interruptions to TAWCcustomers
 and the issuance of a boil water notice. TAWC repaired the main by early morning on September 14, 2019, and restored full water service by the afternoon of September 15, 2019, with theboil water notice lif
ted for all customers on September 16, 2019.On
 September 17, 2019, a complaint captioned Bruce,  et al. v. American Water Works Company, Inc., et al. was  filed in the Circuit Court of Hamilton County, Tennessee against TAWC, theCompany and American Water 
Works Service Company, Inc. (“Service Company” and, together with TAWC and the Company, collectively, the “Tennessee-American Water Defendants”), on behalf ofa proposed class of individuals or entities who lost water service or
 suffered monetary losses as a result of the Chattanooga incident (the “Tennessee Plaintiffs”). The complaint alleged breach of contractand
 negligence against the Tennessee-American Water Defendants, as well as an equitable remedy of piercing the corporate veil. In the complaint as originally filed, the Tennessee Plaintiffs wereseeking
 an award of unspecified alleged damages for wage losses, business and economic losses, out-of-pocket expenses, loss of use and enjoyment of property and annoyance and inconvenience, aswell
 as punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and pre- and post-judgment interest. In September 2020, the court dismissed all of the Tennessee Plaintiffs’ claims in their complaint, except for the breach ofcontract
 claims against TAWC, which remain pending. In October 2020, TAWC answered the complaint, and the parties have been engaging in discovery. The court has entered an agreed schedulingorder, which sets a hearing in Oc

 Am,  and  the  construction  of  wells  that  would  supply  water  to  the  desalination  plant.  In  addition,  the  Water  Supply  Project  also  includes  Cal  Am’s  purchase  of  water  from  a  groundwaterreplenishment project (the “GWR Project”) between Monterey One Water
 and the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District (the “MPWMD”). The Water Supply Project is intended, among otherthings, to fulfill Cal Am’s obl
igations under the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order.Cal
 Am’s ability to move forward on the Water Supply Project is subject to administrative review by the CPUC and other government agencies, obtaining necessary permits, and interventionfrom
 other parties. In September 2016, the CPUC unanimously approved a final decision to authorize Cal Am to enter into a water purchase agreement for the GWR Project and to construct a pipelineand pump station facili
ties and recover up to $50 million in associated incurred costs plus AFUDC, subject to meeting certain criteria.In
 September 2018, the CPUC unanimously approved another final decision finding that the Water Supply Project meets the CPUC’s requirements for a certificate of public convenience andnecessity
 and  an  additional  procedural  phase  was  not  necessary  to  consider  alternative  projects.  The  CPUC’s  2018  decision  concludes  that  the  Water  Supply  Project  is  the  best  project  to  addressestimated
 future water demands in Monterey, and, in addition to the cost recovery approved in its 2016 decision, adopts Cal Am’s cost estimates for the Water Supply Project, which amounted to anaggregate
 of $279 million plus AFUDC at a rate representative of Cal Am’s actual financing costs. The 2018 final decision specifies the procedures for recovery of all of Cal Am’s prudently incurredcosts
 associated with the Water Supply Project upon its completion, subject to the frameworks included in the final decision related to cost caps, operation and maintenance costs, financing, ratemakingand contingency matters. The reasonableness of the Water Supply Project costs will be reviewed by the CPUC when Cal Am seeks cost recovery for the Water Supply Project. Cal Am has incurred $186
million in aggregate 
costs as of December 31, 2021 related to the Water Supply Project, which includes $47 million in AFUDC.In
 September 2021, Cal Am, Monterey One Water and the MPWMD reached an agreement on Cal Am’s purchase of additional water from an expansion to the GWR Project, which is notexpected
 to produce additional water until 2024 at the earliest. The amended and restated water purchase agreement for the GWR Project expansion is subject to review and approval of the CPUC, andon November 29, 2021, Cal
 Am filed an application with the CPUC seeking review and approval of the amended and restated water purchase agreement. Cal Am is also requesting rate base treatment ofthe additional
 capital investment for certain Cal Am facilities required to maximize the water supply from the expansion to the GWR Project and a related Aquifer Storage and Recovery Project, totalingapproximately
 $81 million. This amount is in addition to, and consistent in regulatory treatment with, the prior $50 million of cost recovery for facilities associated with the original water purchaseagreement, which was approved by th
e CPUC in its 2016 final decision. While Cal Am believes that its expenditures to date ha
ve been prudent and necessary to comply with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order, as well as the CPUC’s 2016 and 2018 final decisions, CalAm cannot currently predict its
 ability to recover all of its costs and expenses associated with the Water Supply Project and there can be no assurance that Cal Am will be able to recover all of such costsand expenses in excess of the $50 m
illion in construction costs previously approved by the CPUC in its 2016 final decision.129

Table of ContentsCoastal Development Permit Appl
icationIn
 June 2018, Cal Am submitted a coastal development permit application to the City of Marina (the “City”) for those project components of the Water Supply Project located within the City’scoastal zone. Members
 of the City’s Planning Commission, as well as City councilpersons, have publicly expressed opposition to the Water Supply Project. In May 2019, the City issued a notice of finallocal
 action based upon the denial by the Planning Commission of Cal Am’s coastal development permit application. Thereafter, Cal Am appealed this decision to the California Coastal Commission(the “Coastal
 Commission”), as permitted under the City’s code and the California Coastal Act. At the same time, Cal Am submitted an application to the Coastal Commission for a coastal developmentpermit for
 those project components located within the Coastal Commission’s original jurisdiction. In October 2019, staff of the Coastal Commission issued a report recommending a denial of Cal Am’sapplication for a coastal development permit with respect to the Water Suppl
y Project, largely based on a memorandum prepared by the general manager of the MPWMD that contradicted findings madeby
 the  CPUC  in  its  final  decision  approving  the  Water  Supply  Project.  In  November  2019,  discussions  between  staffs  of  the  Coastal  Commission  and  the  CPUC  took  place  regarding  the  CoastalCommission
 staff recommendation, at which time the CPUC raised questions about the Coastal Commission staff’s findings on water supply and demand, groundwater impacts and the viability of aproject that the Coasta
l Commission staff believes may be a possible alternative to the Water Supply Project.In
 August 2020, the staff of the Coastal Commission released a report again recommending denial of Cal Am’s application for a coastal development permit. Although the report concluded thatthe Water Supply Project would have a negligible impact
 on groundwater resources, the report also concluded it would impact other coastal resources, such as environmentally sensitive habitat areas andwetlands, and that the
 Coastal Commission staff believes that a feasible alternative project exists that would avoid those impacts. The staff’s report also noted disproportionate impacts to communities ofconcern.
 In September 2020, Cal Am withdrew its original jurisdiction application to allow additional time to address the Coastal Commission staff’s environmental justice concerns. The withdrawal ofthe
 original jurisdiction application did not impact Cal Am’s appeal of the City’s denial, which remains pending before the Coastal Commission. Cal Am refiled the original jurisdiction application inNovember 2020. In December 2020, the Coast
al Commission sent to Cal Am a notice of incomplete application, identifying certain additional information needed to consider the application complete. InMarch
 2021,  Cal  Am  provided  responses  to  the  Coastal  Commission’s  notice  of  incomplete  application.  On  June  18,  2021,  the  Coastal  Commission  responded,  acknowledging  the  responses  andrequesting
 certain additional information before the application could be considered complete. Cal Am responded with the requested additional information on January 11, 2022, and on February 8,2022, the Coastal Commission request
ed additional information. The original jurisdiction application remains pending.Cal
 Am continues to work constructively with all appropriate agencies to provide necessary information in connection with obtaining required approvals for the Water Supply Project. However,there can be no
 assurance that the Water Supply Project in its current configuration will be completed on a timely basis, if ever. Beginning in January 2022, Cal Am expects to be able to comply with thediversion
 reduction requirements contained in the 2016 Order, but continued compliance with the diversion reduction requirements for 2023 and future years will depend on successful development ofalternate water supply sources sufficient
 to meet customer demand. The 2009 Order and the 2016 Order remain in effect until Cal Am certifies to the SWRCB, and the SWRCB concurs, that Cal Am hasobtained a permanent
 supply of water to substitute for past unauthorized Carmel River diversions. While the Company cannot currently predict the likelihood or result of any adverse outcome associatedwith these
 matters, further attempts to comply with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order may result in material additional costs and obligations to Cal Am, including fines and penalties against Cal Am inthe event of noncomplianc
e with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order.Note 18: Earnings per Common Share

cause their effect would have been anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method.Note 19: Fair Value of Financial Information
The following methods and assumptions we
re used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments:Current assets and
 current liabilities—The carrying amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for current assets and current liabilities, including revolving credit debt, due to the short-term maturities and variable interest
 rates, approximate their fair values.Seller promissory note fro
m the sale of HOS — The carrying amount reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the seller promissory note from the sale of HOS approximates fair value.Preferred
 stock with mandatory redemption requirements and long-term debt—The fair values of preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements and long-term debt are categorizedwithin the fair value hi
erarchy based on the inputs that are used to value each instrument. The fair value of long-term debt classified as Level 1 is calculated using quoted prices in active markets. Level 2instruments are valued us
ing observable inputs and Level 3 instruments are valued using observable and unobservable inputs.Presented
 in the tables below are the carrying amounts, including fair value adjustments previously recognized in acquisition purchase accounting, and the fair values of the Company’s financialinstruments:
As of December 31, 2021

To
 increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements, GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value intothree levels as follows:
Level
 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access as of the reporting date. Financial assets and liabilities utilizingLevel 1 inputs include act
ive exchange-traded equity securities, exchange-based derivatives, mutual funds and money market funds.Level
 2—Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable through corroboration with observable market data.Financial
 assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs include fixed income securities, non-exchange-based derivatives, commingled investment funds not subject to purchase and sale restrictions andfair-value hedges.

 3—Unobservable inputs, such as internally-developed pricing models for the asset or liability due to little or no market activity for the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilitiesutilizing Level 3 inputs in

includes these assets in other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Deposits—Deposits include escrow funds and 
certain other deposits held in trust. The Company includes cash deposits in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.132

Table of ContentsDeferred compensation obl
igations—The Company’s deferred compensation plans allow participants to defer certain cash compensation into notional investment accounts. The Company includessuch
 plans in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The value of the Company’s deferred compensation obligations is based on the market value of the participants’ notionalinvestment accounts. The not
ional investments are comprised primarily of mutual funds, which are based on observable market prices.Mark-to-market
 derivative  assets  and  liabilities  —  The  Company  employs  derivative  financial  instruments  in  the  form  of  variable-to-fixed  interest  rate  swaps  and  treasury  lock  agreements,classified
 as economic hedges and cash flow hedges, respectively, in order to fix the interest cost on existing or forecasted debt. The Company may use fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, typicallydesignated as fair-value hedges, to achieve a targeted level of
 variable-rate debt as a percentage of total debt. The Company uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows, whichare discounted, to determine the current fair
 value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, counterparty credit risk, interest rates and market volatility. The Companyhad no significant mark-
to-market derivatives outstanding as of December 31, 2021.Other
 investments—Other  investments  primarily  represent  money  market  funds  used  for  active  employee  benefits.  The  Company  includes  other  investments  in  other  current  assets  on  theConsolidated Balance Sheets.
Contingent
 cash payment from the sale of HOS — The Company’s contingent cash payment derivative included as part of the consideration from the sale of HOS is included in other long-termassets on the Consolidated Balanc
e Sheets. The fair value of the contingent cash payment is estimated using the probability of the outcome of receipt of the $75 million, a Level 3 input.Note 20: Leases
The Company
 has operating and finance leases involving real property, including facilities, utility assets, vehicles, and equipment. Certain operating leases have renewal options ranging from one to
 60 years. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company’s sole discretion. Renewal options that the Company was reasonably certain to exercise are included in the Company’s ROU assets.Certain
 operating leases contain the option to purchase the leased property. The operating leases for real property, vehicles and equipment will expire over the next 38 years, five years, and five years,respectively.
The
 Company participates in a number of arrangements with various public entities (“Partners”) in West Virginia. Under these arrangements, the Company transferred a portion of its utility plantto
 the Partners in exchange for an equal principal amount of Industrial Development Bonds (“IDBs”) issued by the Partners under the Industrial Development and Commercial Development Bond Act.The Company leased back
 the utility plant under agreements for a period of 30 to 40 years. The Company has recorded these agreements as finance leases in property, plant and equipment , as ownership of
 the  assets  will  revert  back  to  the  Company  at  the  end  of  the  lease  term.  The  carrying  value  of  the  finance  lease  assets  was  $146  million  and  $147  million  as  of  December  31,  2021  and  2020,respectively. The Company
 determined that the finance lease obligations and the investments in IDBs meet the conditions for offsetting, and as such, are reported net on the Consolidated Balance Sheetsand excluded from the fin
ance lease disclosure presented below.The
 Company  also  enters  into  O&M  agreements  with  the  Partners.  The  Company  pays  an  annual  fee  for  use  of  the  Partners’  assets  in  performing  under  the  O&M  agreements.  The  O&Magreements
 are recorded as operating leases, and future annual use fees of $4 million in 2022 through 2026, and $48 million thereafter, are included in operating lease ROU assets and operating leaseliabilities on the Consolid
ated Balance Sheets.Rental expenses under operat
ing and finance leases were $13 million, $14 million and $16 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.For
 the year ended December 31, 2021, cash paid for amounts in lease liabilities, which includes operating and financing cash flows from operating and finance leases, was $13 million. For theyear ended December 31, 2021, ROU assets obta
ined in exchange for new operating lease liabilities was $11 million.As
 of December 31, 2021, the weighted-average remaining lease term of the finance lease and operating leases were four years and 18 years, respectively, and the weighted-average discount rateof the finance lease 
and operating leases were 12% and 4%, respectively.The future maturiti
es of lease liabilities at December 31, 2021 are $12 million in 2022, $9 million in 2023, $9 million in 2024, $8 million in 2025, $7 million in 2026 and $89 million thereafter. AtDecember 31, 2021 imputed inte
rest was $45 million.133

Table of ContentsNote 21: Segment Information
The
 Company’s operating segments are comprised of the revenue-generating components of its businesses for which separate financial information is internally produced and regularly used bymanagement to
 make operating decisions, assess performance and allocate resources. The Company operates its businesses primarily through one reportable segment, the Regulated Businesses segment.The
 Company also operates market-based businesses that, individually, do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with GAAP, and are collectively presented as the Market-BasedBusinesses.
The Regulated Businesses segment is 
the largest component of the Company’s business and includes subsidiaries that provide water and wastewater services to customers in 14 states.The
 Company’s primary Market-Based Businesses include MSG, which enters into long-term contracts with the U.S. government to provide water and wastewater services on various militaryinstallations,
 and  the  Company’s  former  HOS  business,  which  was  sold  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  and  previously  provided  various  warranty  protection  programs  and  other  home  services  toresidential customers.
The
 accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2—Significant Accounting Policies. The Regulated Businesses segment and Market-Based Businesses includeintercompany
 costs that are allocated by Service Company and intercompany interest that is charged by AWCC, both of which are eliminated to reconcile to the Consolidated Statements of Operations.Inter-segment
 revenues include the sale of water from a regulated subsidiary to market-based subsidiaries, leased office space, and furniture and equipment provided by the market-based subsidiaries toregulated
 subsidiaries. “Other” includes corporate costs that are not allocated to the Company’s operating segments, eliminations of inter-segment transactions, fair value adjustments, and associatedincome and deductions related
 to the acquisitions that have not been allocated to the operating segments for evaluation of performance and allocation of resource purposes. The adjustments related to theacquisitions are repor
ted in Other as they are excluded from segment performance measures evaluated by management.Presented in the tables be

ITEM 9A.    CONTR
OLS AND PROCEDURESDisclosure Controls and Procedures
The
 Company,  under  the  supervision  and  with  the  participation  of  its  management,  including  the  Company’s  President,  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  conducted  anevaluation of
 the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act asof the end of the period cove
red by this report.Based
 on that evaluation, the Company’s President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer has concluded that, as of December 31, 2021, the Company’s disclosure controls andprocedures
 were  effective  at  a  reasonable  level  of  assurance.  The  Company’s  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  are  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  the  information  required  to  bedisclosed
 by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, andthat
 such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company’s President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regardingrequired disclosure.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Report
ingThe Company’s
 management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. TheCompany’s
 internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  a  process  designed  by  or  under  the  supervision  of  the  Company’s  President,  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer  to  providereasonable
 assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s internal control overfinancial
 reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect its transactions and dispositions of its assets,(ii)
 provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  the  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  GAAP,  and  that  the  Company’s  receipts  andexpenditures
 are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and its directors, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorizedacquisition, use or 
disposition of its assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because
 of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods aresubject to the risk that 
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.The Company’s management, inc
luding the Company’s President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, asof December 31, 2021, using the cri
teria described in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Org anizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).Based
 on the Company’s evaluation under the framework in Internal  Control—Integrated Framework (2013),  its management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting waseffective as of Dece
mber 31, 2021.The
 effectiveness  of  the  Company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  December  31,  2021  has  been  audited  by  PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP,  an  independent  registered  publicaccounting firm, as sta
ted in their report appearing in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The
 Company concluded that there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during its last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonablylikely to materially affect, the 
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.ITEM 9B.    OTHER INFORMATION

Exhibit 4.21DESCRIPTION OF AMERICAN WAT
ER WORKS COMPANY, INC.’S EQUITY SECURITIESThe
 following description of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”), of American Water Works Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), is notintended to be
 complete. For more information regarding the Common Stock, please refer to the Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”), and the Company’sAmended
 and Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”), which have been filed as Exhibits 3.1 and 3.2, respectively, to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Thefollowing
 descriptions are based on the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws in effect as of February 16, 2022. The terms and provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws are herebyincorporated by refer
ence herein. The terms of these securities also may be affected by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”).General
The
 Company’s authorized capital stock consists of 500,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of February 10, 2022, there were 181,724,991 shares ofCommon Stock outstanding and no shares of pr
eferred stock outstanding.Common Stock
Voting Rights
Other
 than with respect to director elections, except as otherwise required by law, all matters to be voted on by the Company’s shareholders must be approved by a majority of the shares presentin
 person or proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter. With respect to uncontested director elections, the Bylaws require that in order to be elected, a director nominee mustreceive
 a majority of the votes cast (for this purpose, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted “for” a director nominee must exceed the number of votes cast “against” thatnominee). For
 contested director elections where the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the Bylaws require that the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality ofthe shares represented 
in person or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors.Dividends
Holders of Common Stock will share equa
lly in any dividend declared by the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”), subject to the rights of the holders of any outstanding preferred stock.Liquidation Rights
In
 the  event  of  any  voluntary  or  involuntary  liquidation,  dissolution  or  winding  up  of  the  Company’s  affairs,  holders  of  Common  Stock  would  be  entitled,  after  payment  of  the  liquidationpreference
 to all holders of any outstanding preferred stock, to share ratably in the Company’s assets that are legally available for distribution to shareholders after payment of liabilities. The Companymust pay the applicable d
istribution to any holders of its preferred stock before it may pay distributions to the holders of Common Stock.Other Rights
The Company’s shareholders have no pr
eemptive or other rights to subscribe for additional shares.Preferred Stock
The
 Board  may  authorize  the  issuance  of  preferred  stock  from  time  to  time  in  one  or  more  series,  without  shareholder  approval.  Subject  to  the  limits  imposed  by  the  DGCL,  the  Board  isauthorized
 to fix for any series of preferred stock the number of shares of such series and the voting powers (if any), designation, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights,and qualifications,
 limitations or restrictions of such series. The Board is also authorized to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series, but not below the number of shares of that series thenoutstanding, without any further vo
te or action by the Company’s shareholders.The
 Board may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that affect adversely the voting power or other rights of holders of Common Stock. The issuance ofpreferred
 stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, causingthe market price of 
a share of Common Stock to decline, or impairing the voting and other rights of the holders of Common Stock.Certain Anti-Takeover Provisions of the Certif
icate of Incorporation and Bylaws, and the DGCLThe
 following provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws could deter, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring the Company, even if doing so would benefit the Company’sshareholders.
1

Undesignated Preferred StockThe
 ability to authorize undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for the Board to authorize the issuance of preferred stock with super voting, special approval, dividend or other rights orpreferences on
 a discriminatory basis that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire the Company. These and other provisions may have the effect of deferring, delaying or discouraging hostiletakeovers, or changes in cont
rol or management of the Company.Requirements for Advance Notification of Shareholder Me
etings, Nominations and ProposalsThe
 Bylaws provide that special meetings of shareholders may be called only upon the request of the majority of the members of the Board, upon request of the Chairman of the Board, or by theSecretary
 of the Company upon request of shareholders holding at least 15% of the outstanding Common Stock. The Bylaws prohibit the conduct of any business at a special meeting other than asspecified in the notic
e for such meeting.The Bylaws establish advance
 notice procedures with respect to shareholder proposals for annual meetings and the nomination of candidates for election as directors, other than nominations madeby
 or at the direction of the Board or a committee thereof. A shareholder who wishes to bring a matter before a meeting must comply with the Company’s advance notice requirements and provide theCompany with certain
 information. Additionally, vacancies and newly created directorships may be filled only by a vote of a majority of the members of the Board then in office, even though less than aquorum,
 or by shareholders. These provisions may defer, delay or discourage a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror’s own slate of directors or otherwiseattempting to obtain con
trol of the Company.Shareholder Action by Written Consent
As permitted by Section
 228 of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation states that any action required or permitted to be taken by the Company’s shareholders must be effected at a duly calledannual or special mee
ting and may not be effected by consent in writing by such shareholders.Certain Anti-Takeover Matters
A
 significant  number  of  the  Company’s  regulated  subsidiaries  are  subject  to  economic  regulation  by  state  public  utility  commissions.  Some  of  these  states  have  enacted  laws  that  requireregulatory
 approval for the acquisition of “control” of any regulated utility. In those states, obtaining “control” of the parent or any other company that controls a regulated utility also requires priorregulatory
 approval. The threshold for a change in control is a fact-specific inquiry that varies by state. For example, in some states, a presumption of control will arise when an acquiring party acquiresmore
 than 9.9% of the voting securities of the regulated utility or the controlling entity. In addition to ownership, other states may analyze the degree of influence or control an acquiror may exert overthe
 company. Any person acquiring Common Stock in an offering or in any other purchase of Common Stock in an amount sufficient to trigger a change in control under state law would need the priorapproval of the applicab
le state public utility commission.Certain Other Provisions of the Certi
ficate of Incorporation and Bylaws and the DGCLBoard of Directors
The
 Certificate of Incorporation provides that the number of directors is fixed in the manner provided in the Bylaws. The Bylaws provide that the number of directors will be fixed from time totime by the Board.
Business Combinations under Delaware Law
The
 Company is subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for aperiod
 of  three  years  after  the  time  the  shareholder  became  an “interested  stockholder,”  subject  to  certain  exceptions,  including  if, prior  to  such  time,  the  board  of directors  approved  the  businesscombination
 or  the  transaction  which  resulted  in  the  shareholder  becoming  an  “interested  stockholder.”  “Business  combinations”  include  mergers,  asset  sales  and  other  transactions  resulting  in  afinancial
 benefit to the “interested stockholder.” Subject to various exceptions, an “interested stockholder” is a person who, together with his or her affiliates and associates, owns, or within the priorthree
 years did own, 15% or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock. These restrictions generally prohibit or delay the accomplishment of mergers or other takeover or change-in-controlattempts that are no
t approved by a company’s board of directors.Limitations of Liability and Indemni
fication of Directors and OfficersThe
 DGCL authorizes corporations to limit or eliminate the personal liability of directors to corporations and their shareholders for monetary damages for breaches of directors’ fiduciary duties.The
 Certificate of Incorporation includes a provision that eliminates the personal liability of directors for monetary damages for actions taken as a director to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL.The DGCL does not permit exculpation fo
r liability:•
for breach of the duty of loyalty;2

•for acts or omissions not in good faith or involving intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law;•
under Section 174 of the DGCL (relating to unlawful dividends or stock repurchases); or•
for transactions from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.The
 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that the Company will indemnify its directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by law. The Bylaws also expressly authorize theCompany to carry direct
ors’ and officers’ insurance providing indemnification for its directors, officers and certain employees and agents for certain liabilities.The
 limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against the Company’s directors forbreach
 of their fiduciary duty. These provisions may also have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against the Company’s directors and officers, even though such an action, ifsuccessful, might
 otherwise benefit the Company and its shareholders. In addition, an investment in the Common Stock may be adversely affected to the extent the Company pays the costs of settlementand damage awards against di
rectors and officers in accordance with these indemnification provisions.Proxy Access
The
 Bylaws  permit  an  eligible  shareholder  or  group  of  shareholders  to  include  up  to  a  specified  number  of  director  nominees  in  the  Company’s  proxy  materials  for  an  annual  meeting  ofshareholders.
 To qualify, the shareholders (or group of up to 20 shareholders) must have continuously owned for at least three years 3% or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock. Themaximum number
 of shareholder nominees permitted under this proxy access provision is the greater of (i) two or (ii) 20% of the total number of directors on the Company’s board of directors as of thelast day on which a proxy access not
ice may be submitted, rounded down to the nearest whole number.Transfer Agent and Registrar
